BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-2028 Title VI Program Update

May 14, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
May 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update to comply with
federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Title VI prohibits any person from being excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or
otherwise subjected to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by recipients of
federal financial assistance. As a recipient of federal funds, RTD must comply with the federal
regulations set forth in 49 CFR Part 21, the terms of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master
Agreement, and FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients
(4702.1B), to the extent consistent with applicable federal laws, regulations, requirements and
guidance.
Title VI prohibits the following discriminatory actions on the basis of race, color, or national origin:
•
•
•

Denial of program services, aids, or benefits
Providing a different service, aid, or benefit, or providing these in a manner different than from
that provided to others
Subjecting a person to segregation or separate treatment related to the receipt of any service,
aid, or benefit

Per Circular 4702.1B, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years. The
objectives of the Title VI Program are to:
1. Ensure that the level and quality of public transportation service is provided in a nondiscriminatory
manner;
2. Promote full and fair participation in public transportation decision-making without regard to race,
color, or national origin; and

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

3. Ensure meaningful access to transit-related programs and activities by persons with limited
English proficiency (LEP).
Pursuant to 4702.1B (II.1), the Board, as the body responsible for policy decisions, must approve the
Title VI Program, which has multiple requirements, including system-wide service standards and policies.
Pursuant to 4702.1B (IV.3), a recipient’s Title VI Program public participation plan may be part of efforts
that extend more broadly to include constituencies that are traditionally underserved, such as people
with disabilities, low-income populations, and others. The Board last approved a Title VI Program update
on May 24, 2022.
DISCUSSION
In considering this Recommended Action, the agency demonstrates alignment with the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff seeks the Board’s approval of the proposed 2025-2028 Title VI Program, which must be submitted
to the FTA by May 30, 2025. Staff released the draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update to the public
for comment on April 7, 2025. Subsequently, staff presented the proposed policy changes at the April 9
Operations, Safety and Security Committee meeting.
The following discussion is divided into five sections:
• Proposed Policy Updates
• 2022 Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report
• 2025 Language Access Plan
• 2025 Public Participation Plan
• 2024 Demographic Analysis Onboard Survey
• Final Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
Proposed Policy Updates
Per 4702.1B (IV.7), RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy, and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. These policies provide the foundational requirements for evaluating
service and fare change proposals for equity. Disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies must
be applied uniformly across mode and fare media and cannot be altered until the next Title VI Program
submission. Staff recommends updates to the policies as discussed below.
Major Service Change Policy
All major service changes are subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
A Title VI Service Equity Analysis will be completed for all major service changes and will be presented
to the RTD Board of Directors for its awareness, consideration and will be included in the subsequent
RTD Title VI Program report with a record of action taken by the Board. RTD shall consider the degree of
adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
Current Policy

Packet Pg. 4

1.E.1

A Major Service Change is currently defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any
route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. Adverse Effect is currently defined as a
geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but is not limited to eliminating a route,
shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways.
Proposed Updates
RTD proposes to update its definitions of "major service change" and "adverse effect" to enhance the
equity analysis and improve clarity.
The definition of a "major service change" would be expanded to include any change that involves a
25% or greater modification in service hours, route miles (including re-routes), daily service span, or
frequency of any route/line, either within a single service proposal or cumulatively over a 36-month
period. Additionally, the implementation of a new route/line or the elimination, discontinuation, or
retirement of an existing route/line would also qualify as a major service change.
An "adverse effect" would be redefined as any impact on transit services resulting from major service
changes, such as service reductions, route modifications, schedule adjustments, or other modifications,
that disproportionately burden Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC)1 and/or low-income
populations compared to non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations, or disproportionately benefit
non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations compared to BIPOC and/or low-income populations.
All major service changes, as defined by these criteria, would continue to require a Title VI Equity
Analysis. Any service change that does not meet these criteria would be classified as a minor service
change and would not require an equity analysis.
Service Change Disparate Impact Policy
Current Policy
A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10% more than non-minority
populations; this level of impact is considered disparate.
Proposed Updates
RTD proposes to update the policy to refer to minority populations as BIPOC populations as follows:
A majority service change should not adversely affect BIPOC populations 10% more than non-BIPOC
populations; this level of impact is considered disparate.
Service Change Disproportionate Burden Policy
Current Policy

4702.1B defines “minority persons” (1.5.q) and “minority population” (1.5.r). Staff proposes that all such
references in the Program Update refer to BIPOC and BIPOC population, respectively.
1

Packet Pg. 5

1.E.1

A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than higherincome populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. A low-income
population is a group of households who are at or below 150% of the Department of Health and Human
Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines.
Proposed Updates
RTD proposes to redefine low-income populations as those whose household income is at or below
200% of the HHS Poverty Guidelines to better align with cost of living in the Denver region as follows:
A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than non-lowincome populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. If the major service
change results in a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying the proposal to mitigate the
impact where practicable. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 200%
of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines.
Fare Change Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
Current Policies
RTD’s current fare equity policies, addressing disparate impact and disproportionate burden, state that
any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes should not result in minority and lowincome customers experiencing adverse impacts that differ by more than 5% compared to the overall
ridership.
Proposed Policies
RTD proposes to add a definition of "fare change" to include increases or decreases in the price of fare
media, the introduction or discontinuation of fare media (such as cash, paper passes, or electronic
payment options), changes in fare types (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass), adjustments to fare levels (e.g.,
Standard, Airport), modifications to customer categories (e.g., full-fare, seniors, individuals with
disabilities, Medicare recipients, LiVE, and youth 19 and under), and changes to Ticket Vending Machine
access (e.g., quantity, fees, or payment options).
RTD also proposes to update the policy to refer to minority customers as BIPOC customers as follows:
Any fare change should not result in BIPOC and low-income customers experiencing adverse impacts
that differ by more than 5% compared to the overall ridership.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact on BIPOC populations, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to mitigate the impact. If no less disparate impact alternative is available, RTD
must have a substantial legitimate justification. If a proposed fare change results in a disproportionate
burden on low-income populations, RTD will consider modifying the proposal to mitigate the impact
where practicable.
2022 Title VI Service Performance Monitoring (SPM) Report
As detailed in Attachment W of the Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program and in accordance with 4702.1B,
(IV.6), RTD conducted a comprehensive analysis of six key service performance metrics: stop amenities,

Packet Pg. 6

1.E.1

vehicle loads, revenue hours, on-time performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability. The
findings indicate that routes and lines serving minority and low-income communities generally perform as
well as or better than those serving non-minority and non-low-income areas across most metrics.
However, the analysis identified a marginal disparity in the revenue hours of bus service on minority
routes, which receive 14.25% fewer revenue hours compared to non-minority routes (43.88% vs.
57.12%, respectively). This discrepancy underscores the need for enhanced improvements to ensure
equitable service distribution.
2025 Language Access Plan
According to 4702.1B (III.9), agencies must develop a Language Assistance Plan (LAP) to provide
language support to individuals with limited English proficiency (hereafter referred to as “linguistically
diverse” persons) in the agency’s service area, ensuring compliance with Title VI and aligning with its
mission to provide inclusive, accessible, and equitable transit services. By proactively addressing
language barriers, RTD enhances mobility and improves the customer experience for its diverse ridership.
This commitment supports RTD’s strategic priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence, as
well as the strategic initiatives of Welcoming Transit Environment and Customer and Community
Connections.
As outlined in Attachment F of the Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program, RTD's updated LAP will direct the
agency's language assistance efforts during this period. RTD’s LAP is structured off the FTA Circular
requirements. It begins with a Four Factor Analysis, which assesses the language assistance needs of
local communities and provides the data RTD needs to make informed decisions on providing language
assistance. Data includes the number of linguistically diverse people in the agency’s service areas as
well as the most common languages they speak, the frequency with which linguistically diverse persons
interact with RTD frontline staff, the suggestions staff have to overcome language barriers with
customers, the nature and importance of RTD’s services to the linguistically diverse population, and,
finally, the costs to pursue various language assistance measures.
Based on the data gathered in the Four Factor Analysis, the final portion of the plan is the Language
Access Measures section, which outlines specific activities and commitments — both new and ongoing
— that RTD will pursue to improve language assistance in the coming years. Activities that the agency
will carry over from prior years include, but are not limited to, providing telephonic interpretation (as well
as bilingual English-Spanish information specialists) via Customer Care, providing the RTD website and
Next Ride app in RTD’s top five safe harbor languages, developing resources for frontline staff that they
have identified may be useful in bridging language barriers with customers, and delivering the Serving
Non-English-Speaking Customers training to frontline staff. New activities identified for the 2025 to
2028 period include making email and text service alerts available in Spanish, ensuring language
assistance measures are integrated into RTD’s upcoming all-in-one mobile ticketing app, piloting Spanish
audio announcements in fixed-route buses, and establishing a translation review process for the
translation tool on the RTD website (among 23 new tasks). In conclusion, the 2025-2028 LAP builds
upon the framework and tasks of RTD’s 2022-2025 LAP, incorporates updated data on Denver’s
language needs, and sets forth specific, measurable, and data-driven actions to enhance the accessibility
of RTD’s transit services and programs.

1.E.1

2025 Public Participation Plan
According to 4702.1B(III.8), agencies are required to develop a Public Participation Plan (PPP) to ensure
meaningful involvement of minority and linguistically diverse individuals in decision-making processes. As
outlined in Attachment E of the Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program, RTD's updated PPP will guide the
agency's outreach and engagement efforts during this time frame. After a thorough review of the 2022
PPP and best practices from other transit agencies such as the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority
and the and Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, RTD’s Communication and
Engagement Department led an interdivision workgroup to develop this update.
The updated plan emphasizes intentional outreach to underserved communities and incorporates best
practices for equitable public engagement that reflect their lived experiences and priorities. These include
creating shared decision-making processes; moving beyond one-size-fits-all strategies by meeting people
where they are; focusing on transparency by showing how public input informs decisions; ensuring
access through plain-language materials, language assistance, and ADA-compliant, transit-accessible
venues; and leveraging multicultural media to further expand the agency’s reach. This approach
reinforces RTD’s commitment to equitable and inclusive public engagement.
2024 Demographic Analysis Onboard Survey
In accordance with 4702.1B(IV.5), RTD must collect and report demographic and service profile maps
and charts using U.S. Census data as well as customer demographics and travel patterns using origin
and destination or customer satisfaction surveys. As outlined in the Demographic Analysis section of the
Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program, RTD developed Geographic Information System (GIS) maps
illustrating the distribution of BIPOC, low-income, and linguistically diverse populations in relation to
services throughout the RTD service area. The Demographic Analysis Onboard Survey provides a
snapshot of weekday trip characteristics and customer demographics collected through a systemwide
onboard transit customer survey between August 19 to December 10, 2024.
Final Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
In accordance with 4702.1B(III.5-6 and IV.4), RTD is required to notify beneficiaries of Title VI
protection and complaint procedures, promote inclusive public participation, ensure meaningful access
for linguistically diverse individuals, and employ appropriate methods to facilitate public comment and
community engagement when setting or updating the Title VI program prior to Board approval. To fulfill
these requirements, RTD has implemented a comprehensive outreach strategy to gather public input on
proposed updates to the Title VI program, including the updated Title VI policies, Language Access Plan,
Public Participation Plan, and Service and Performance Monitoring policies, in alignment with federal
guidelines. RTD’s outreach efforts included a news release sent on April 7, 2025, to inform the public
about the proposed updates and how to participate. Additionally, RTD’s Read-n-Ride publication,
distributed on April 21, 2025, further promoted these engagement opportunities. The Transit Equity
Office and Communications and Engagement Department attended in-person community events in April
and May 2025, providing the public an opportunity to interact directly with RTD staff, ask questions,
and offer feedback. RTD also worked with community partners, sending newsletters to organizations
serving historically underserved populations to ensure broad distribution of information. In addition, RTD
engaged Community-Based Organization (CBO) contractors, who participated in direct outreach at
events, engaging with over 500 BIPOC and low-income individuals across four events. A mass email

Packet Pg. 8

1.E.1

was sent to more than 1,000 community-based organizations and direct service providers to encourage
their participation in the comment process. Furthermore, RTD leveraged existing programs such as the
LiVE income-based fare program (over 12,000 active customers) and the Transit Assistance Grant
program (150 current grant-awarded organizations) to directly reach BIPOC and low-income individuals
through nonprofit organizations serving customers with immediate needs. To maximize outreach, RTD
utilized both organic and paid social media ads, promoting the public engagement efforts across its
platforms. These outreach efforts were designed to ensure an inclusive and comprehensive public
participation process in compliance with federal guidelines.
The proposed updates to RTD’s Title VI Program policies, along with the updates to the LAP and PPP,
reflect the agency’s ongoing commitment to equitable transit service planning and compliance with FTA
regulations. By refining the definitions of major service changes, adverse effects, low-income
populations, and fare equity, these updates enhance transparency, improve analysis, and ensure that
service and fare decisions are made with a strong equity focus. Expanding the criteria for equity analysis
— such as including cumulative service changes over a 36-month period and raising the income
threshold for low-income populations — allows for a more comprehensive assessment of impacts on
underserved communities. Additionally, the results of the 2022 SPM process continue to inform RTD’s
approach, demonstrating that the agency is committed to identifying and addressing any potential
disparities in service delivery. The Board’s approval of these policy updates, including the SPM results,
will adhere to FTA requirements pertaining to a transit agency’s governing board and strengthen RTD’s
ability to proactively address potential disparities, uphold Title VI protections, and promote fair and
inclusive transit access for all customers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update will not result in any direct or foreseeable
financial impacts.

§ When fare prices change, or when several fare changes are averaged together, they

should not negatively impact minority or low-income individuals by more than 5% compared to
the overall ridership

§ Additionally, if fare payment methods (e.g., passes or electronic payments) are changed
or discontinued, RTD’s equity analysis should include how these changes affect access to fare
options, such as vending machines or online payment methods

Definitions
The following terms and definitions are from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Circular 4702.1B unless
otherwise noted.
Colorado Revised Statute (CRS) §24-34-601 – As defined by the State of Colorado Civil Rights Commission
Rules and Regulations, CRS §24-34-601 defines a public accommodation as a place of business that offers
services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations open to the public, including any public
transportation facility or services. The statute prohibits discrimination in refusing, withholding from, or denying
an individual or group the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or
accommodations of a place of public accommodation based on race, color, national origin, creed, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, disability, or ancestry.
Contractor – As defined by the Regional Transportation District (RTD), a non-federal entity that receives a
contract from RTD to provide goods and services for the agency's own use.
Direct Recipient – An entity that receives funding directly from the FTA. For purposes of Title VI, a direct
recipient is distinguished from a primary recipient in that a direct recipient does not extend financial assistance
to subrecipients, whereas a primary recipient does.
Discrimination – Any action or inaction, whether intentional or unintentional, in any program or activity of a
federal aid recipient, subrecipient, or contractor that results in disparate treatment or disparate impact and/or
perpetuates the effects of prior discrimination based on race, color, or national origin.
Disparate Impact – A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects members of a group
identified by race, color, or national origin, where the recipient’s policy or practice lacks a substantial legitimate
justification and where there exists one or more alternatives that would serve the same legitimate objectives
but with less disproportionate effect on the basis of race, color, or national origin.
Disparate Treatment – Actions that result in circumstances where similarly situated people are intentionally
treated differently (i.e., less favorably) than others because of their race, color, or national origin.
Disproportionate Burden – A neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects low-income populations
more than non-low-income populations. A disproportionate burden finding requires the recipient to evaluate
alternatives and mitigate burdens where practicable.

proximity, and, if circumstances warrant, geographically dispersed/transient people (such as migrant workers or
Native Americans) who will be similarly affected by a proposed FTA program, policy, or activity.
Low-Income Transit Route – As defined by RTD, a route that has at least one-half of its total revenue mileage
in a census block or block group with a percentage of low-income population that exceeds the percentage of
low-income population in the transit service area as a whole.
Minority People – Include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples
of North and South America (including Central America) and who maintain tribal affiliation or community
attachment

Introduction
The mission of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is to make lives better through connections, and its
vision is to be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and community.
Title VI and equity are central to this mission and vision. An equitable mass transit system ensures that the
benefits and burdens of service are distributed fairly, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income level.
These principles are reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination in
federally funded programs.
Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program
or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The intent of Title VI is to remove barriers and conditions that
prevent minority people (hereafter referred to as Black, Indigenous and People of Color, or BIPOC) and people

National Origin – As defined by RTD, the nation or region in which a person was born, or where the person’s
parents or ancestors were born. National origin protections include limited English proficiency.

RTD 2025-2028 Title VI Program

1.E.1.b

Unlawful discrimination based on race, color, or national origin can limit opportunities for historically underserved
communities to gain equal access to services and programs. In operating a federally assisted program, a recipient
cannot, on the basis of race, color, or national origin, either directly or through contractual means cannot do the
following:
•
•
•

Deny program services, aids, or benefits;
Provide a different service, aid, or benefit, or provide them in a manner different than they are provided
to others; or
Segregate or separately treat individuals in any matter related to the receipt of any service, aid, or
benefit

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA’s) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires that RTD document
measures taken to comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s) Title VI regulations by
submitting a Title VI program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as otherwise
directed by FTA.
In this updated Title VI Program, the RTD Transit Equity Office under the Civil Rights Division has compiled a
documentation of compliance efforts from May 2022 to April 2025. The policies, procedures, standards, practices,
and analysis provided in this document illustrate how RTD ensures compliance with Title VI by providing
documentation in accordance with FTA grant recipient requirements. Below is an overview of the collection of
documents and information that comprise the 2025-2028 Title VI Program.
The General Manager and Chief Executive Officer has overall responsibility for carrying out the agency’s
commitment to the Title VI Program. While RTD’s Civil Rights Director and Transit Equity Manager are chiefly
responsible for administering and monitoring Title VI compliance, it is the duty of every employee and contractor
of the agency to ensure nondiscrimination and to further civil rights protections. Thus, the RTD Board of Directors
must approve the agency’s Title VI Program prior to its submittal to the FTA.

General Requirements
FTA requires that all direct and primary recipients document their compliance with DOT’s Title VI regulations by
submitting a Title VI Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years. For all recipients,
the Title VI Program must be approved by the recipient’s board of directors or appropriate governing entity or
official(s) responsible for policy decisions prior to submission to FTA. Attachment A includes a copy of the RTD
Board of Director’s (Board) resolution evidencing approval of RTD’s 2025-2028 Title VI Program.
The General Requirements section of this report contains Title VI Program components required in Chapter III
of FTA Circular 4702.1B, including:
1. Title VI Public Notice
This document will hereafter refer to “people with limited English proficiency” or “limited English proficient people” as

with limited English proficiency (LEP) 1 from equal access to public goods and services. In effect, Title VI promotes
fairness and equity in federally assisted programs and activities. Title VI is rooted in the constitutional guarantee
that all persons are entitled to equal protection of the law and specifically addresses the involvement of impacted
people in the decision-making process.

Title VI Public Notice
RTD, as a recipient of federal funds, must inform the public of its Title VI rights to file a complaint if they feel
they have experienced discrimination when accessing RTD services. To ensure customers know their rights, RTD
posts its Title VI public notice on its website at www.rtd-denver.com/TitleVI and all vehicles (bus and rail) and
in its administrative offices. The website also provides RTD’s Title VI complaint forms and procedures in both
digital and PDF formats. In 2024, RTD replaced the previous digital complaint form with a new version to improve
functionality and support language access by ensuring the complaint form content is translatable via the
website’s built-in translation widget. The PDFs of the forms and procedures are available in the 21 safe harbor
languages that RTD identified in its 2022 – 2025 Language Access Plan (Amharic, Arabic, Farsi, French, German,
Hindi, Hmong, Japanese, Khmer, Laotian, Korean, Nepali, Russian, Somali, Swahili, Spanish, Simplified Chinese,
Tagalog, Telugu, Thai, and Vietnamese). Please see Attachment B for copies of the complaint forms and
Attachment C for the Transit Equity Nondiscrimination Policy (which includes RTD’s Title VI public notice) that
RTD posts at its administrative offices.

Title VI Statement

RTD’s Title VI public notice contains the following statement:
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) operates its programs and services without regard to race, color,
national origin, or any other characteristic protected by law including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Colorado Revised Statutes §24-34-601. If you believe you have been subject to discrimination by an RTD
employee, you may file a complaint no later than 180 calendar days after the date of the alleged discrimination
with RTD. For more information on RTD’s nondiscrimination requirements, the complaint procedures, or if you
would like information in a language other than English or Spanish, contact 303.299.6000; email
titlevicomplaints@rtd-denver.com; or visit rtd-denver.com/titlevi. Please allow up to three (3) business days for
a response.

Title VI and CRS §24-34-601 Complaint Procedures
Any person who believes they have been excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of RTD’s programs,
activities, or services due to discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin may file a Title VI Civil
Rights complaint with RTD. CRS §24-34-601 expands these protections to include creed, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, marital status, disability, or ancestry.
The complaint must be filed within 180 days from the date of the alleged discrimination. RTD permits the use
of a representative to file a complaint on behalf of the complainant. All communication following the complaint
will be directed to the complainant’s representative primarily and the complainant secondarily.
Once a complaint is filed either in PDF form or digitally, RTD will review the complaint and determine whether
the agency has jurisdiction. The customer filing the complaint (“the complainant”) will receive an
acknowledgement letter informing them if the complaint will be investigated by RTD within seven business days
from when the complaint was filed. Unless a longer period is specified by RTD, the complainant will have 10
days from the date of the letter to send requested information to the RTD investigator assigned to the case.
Staff adheres to RTD’s Transit Equity Nondiscrimination Policy (Attachment C) and Transit Equity
Nondiscrimination Complaint Management Procedures (Attachment D) to ensure a fair, impartial and
standardized process for investigating complaints. These procedures outline the roles and responsibilities of all
involved parties, specify timelines for investigations and provide step-by-step guidelines for informal and formal
complaints. By adhering to these procedures, RTD ensures consistency and thoroughness in investigating and
resolving Title VI and CRS §24-34-601 complaints.
During the investigation, the assigned investigator may interview witnesses or other individuals with relevant
information. If additional details are needed, the complainant or witnesses may be contacted. Failure to respond
within the required timeframe may result in the administrative closure of the case. Cases may also be closed if
the complainant chooses to no longer pursue the matter.
RTD will generally complete an investigation within 60 days from receipt of a completed complaint form. Although
RTD strives to resolve complaints quickly, resolution time may vary depending on factors such as the complexity
of the complaint and the individuals involved. Once the investigation is complete, RTD will send a final written
response to the complainant by mail, email, or fax.

If a complainant disagrees with RTD’s determination, they may request reconsideration by submitting a request
in writing to RTD’s Transit Equity Manager within seven days after the date of RTD’s letter, stating with specificity
the basis for the reconsideration. The Transit Equity Manager will notify the complainant of their decision either
to accept or reject the request for reconsideration within 10 days. In cases where consideration is granted, the
Transit Equity Manager will issue a determination letter to the complainant upon completion of the
reconsideration review.

List of Title VI Investigations, Complaints, and Lawsuits
As a recipient of federal funding, RTD is required to accept, log, and investigate complaints alleging
discrimination under Title VI. Over the past three years, these complaints have decreased by 24.5%, decreasing
from 106 in 2019-2022 to 80 in 2022-2025. A detailed breakdown of these complaints and their outcomes is
provided in Figure 9.

Investigations

During the reporting period, the State of Colorado Civil Rights Division initiated two investigations into
complaints/charges of alleged discrimination under the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act. Both complaints pertain
to transit-related contractors, but RTD is listed as the respondent. One has been settled and formally closed
while the other has resulted in a no probable cause determination yet remains to be formally closed.

Lawsuits

No lawsuits were filed during the reporting period.

Complaints

RTD staff received, investigated, and resolved submitted complaints in accordance with RTD’s Transit Equity
Nondiscrimination Policy. Figure 9 provides an overview of the Title VI-related complaints received during the
reporting period, with each complaint categorized based on the investigation's findings.

Trainings to Enhance Service Delivery and Compliance

To further enhance customer interactions and ensure fair, respectful service for all transit customers, the Transit
Equity Office has implemented two training programs focused on civil rights compliance and equitable service
delivery: Civil Rights and Public Accommodations and Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers.
The Civil Rights and Public Accommodations training educates frontline staff on Title VI protections, RTD’s
nondiscrimination policies, and legal responsibilities. It defines discrimination and harassment while covering
Title VI and CRS 24-34-601 protected classes. The Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training equips staff
to assist linguistically diverse customers. It describes Title VI protections for linguistically diverse populations,
highlights cross-cultural verbal and nonverbal communication strategies, and demonstrates the tools and
techniques available to communicate across language barriers.

By equipping frontline staff with a deeper understanding of civil rights protections and language access, RTD
has improved service delivery and reduced incidents of perceived or actual discrimination, contributing to a 29%
decrease in complaints from the 2022-2025 program period. The Civil Rights and Public Accommodations training
reinforces RTD’s commitment to nondiscrimination, while the Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training
has helped address concerns related to communication barriers. Together, these trainings have fostered a more
welcoming transit environment and strengthened RTD’s compliance with federal and state civil rights regulations.

Public Participation Plan: Overview
RTD is committed to an inclusive public participation process that actively engages BIPOC, low-income, and
linguistically diverse communities. RTD’s Communications and Engagement Department, in partnership with the
Civil Rights Division, the Planning Department, the Board Office, and other departments, has updated the
agency’s Public Participation Plan (PPP) (Attachment E) with this submission to summarize the agency’s recent
outreach efforts and current approach to public participation as well as to reflect ongoing efforts to enhance
equitable engagement. The plan also outlines RTD’s strategy for recruitment and fostering diverse membership
on its non-elected advisory committees as well as the demographics of RTD’s three advisory committees: the
Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD), Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC),
and the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC).

Language Access Plan: Overview
Ensuring linguistically diverse communities have meaningful access to RTD’s transit programs, services, and
activities is a high priority for RTD. Following a comprehensive review of linguistically diverse populations within
its service area by way of the Four Factor Analysis, RTD has updated its 2025-2028 Language Access Plan to
maintain successful current language access measures and identify new strategies to further enhance language
accessibility. This plan serves as the backbone for RTD’s Language Access Program and is included in
Attachment F.

Subrecipient Monitoring
General Requirements

RTD's subrecipients of federal financial assistance must comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by
following the guidance of FTA Circular 4702.1B. RTD’s Transit Equity Office monitors subrecipients, certifying
enforcement of Title VI by overseeing the following actions:
•
•

Complaint Process and List: Subrecipients must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD
with a list of active lawsuits and a summary of complaints alleging discrimination based on race, color,
or national origin
Public Participation: Subrecipients should maintain a public participation plan (PPP) that offers early and
ongoing opportunities for public involvement in identifying the social, economic, and environmental
impacts of transportation decisions. Efforts to engage BIPOC and low-income communities should include
both broad measures, such as public notices at stations and vehicles, and specific actions to address
barriers like language, culture, or economic challenges
Language Access: Subrecipients must ensure meaningful access to programs and services for
linguistically diverse individuals by providing a copy of its Language Access Plan (LAP)
Inclusive Advisory and Planning Boards: Subrecipients that have transit-related, non-elected planning
boards, advisory councils or committees, or similar bodies must detail the racial composition of committee
members and efforts to encourage BIPOC participation in them
Determining Site or Location of a Facility: Prior to the selection of a site or construction of a facility, such
as a vehicle storage facility, maintenance facility, operation center, or other facility, the subrecipient
should include a copy of the Title VI facility siting equity analysis conducted during the planning stage

Each subrecipient further agrees to assure compliance by its third-party subcontractors at any tier under each
grant, with all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) 21.5(b)(2), 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), and 49 CFR Part 21, Appendix C.
RTD encourages subrecipients to adopt the agency’s own notice to beneficiaries, complaint procedures, and
complaint forms, PPP, and LAP where appropriate. To assist subrecipients in understanding their Title VI
requirements, the Transit Equity Office provides the Subrecipient Title VI Compliance Guide found in
Attachment G.

Smart Commute Metro North

RTD’s only subrecipient during the 2022-2025 Title VI Program was Smart Commute Metro North, with a contract
effective from November 11, 2019 through September 31, 2023. Smart Commute Metro North is a 501(c)(3)

Transit-related Contractors

In addition to RTD subrecipients, every RTD transit-related contractor (“contractor”) must adhere to Title VI
nondiscrimination requirements. Currently, RTD partners with four primary contractors who provide essential
services to the agency:
•
•
•
•

Allied Universal: Security services
Denver Transit Partners (DTP): Commuter rail service delivery and maintenance services
Transdev: Fixed-route bus service delivery
MTM Transit: Paratransit trip scheduling and customer eligibility assessment

Met with Contractors: The Transit Equity Office, along with the Americans with Disabilities Act Office,
met with all contractors from October 23 to December 22, 2023 to discuss Title VI requirements, address
questions, and clarify expectations. During these sessions, RTD established clear deliverables and
requested that contractors provide documentation of their compliance with Title VI requirements.
Following the meetings, RTD issued a formal memorandum to all contractors, reiterating their Title VI
obligations, as well as a detailed slide deck covering RTD’s nondiscrimination policy, procedures for
handling and reporting allegations of discrimination, language access requirements, and monitoring and
reporting expectations.
Reviewed Documentation and Provided Concurrence: The Transit Equity Manager reviewed all
documentation submitted by contractors to ensure that it met the expectations outlined in the FTA
Circular. Following this review, the manager issued a concurrence letter confirming that the contractors
are abiding by Title VI requirements. Please find the concurrence letters in Attachments J-M.
Established Contractor Trainings: Following this review, contractors adopted training programs to
educate their staff on Title VI requirements. These include the Civil Rights and Public Accommodations
training and the Serving Non-English Speaking Customers training described in the List of Title VI
Investigations, Complaints, and Lawsuits section above.

Ongoing M onitoring and Oversight

RTD is committed to maintaining robust oversight of contractor compliance with Title VI. The following measures
are in place to ensure ongoing adherence:
•
•
•

Contractual Assurances: All contracts include a Title VI assurance clause, requiring contractors to comply
with nondiscrimination requirements and cooperate with RTD’s monitoring efforts.
Periodic Reviews: RTD conducts periodic reviews of contractor activities to ensure compliance with Title
VI and FTA Circular requirements. These reviews assess language access measures and complaint
handling procedures, ensuring that all protocols are followed and issues promptly addressed.
Complaint Procedures: Contractors are required to report any Title VI-related complaints to RTD and
cooperate fully in the investigation and resolution of such complaints.

RTD’s proactive approach to contractor compliance with Title VI demonstrates the agency’s commitment to
ensuring equitable access to transit services for all individuals. By engaging contractors, providing clear guidance,
and maintaining oversight, RTD ensures that its federally assisted programs and activities are free from
discrimination and accessible to all members of the community.

Equity Analysis for Facilities Siting and Construction
Siting Facility Statement

RTD is committed to equitable, accessible, and nondiscriminatory site selection for all transit facilities, ensuring
compliance with Title VI and related federal regulations. This process prevents discrimination, provides the
opportunity to mitigate potential adverse impacts, and prohibits site selection decisions that exclude, deny
benefits, or disproportionately burden populations based on race, color, or national origin.
RTD upholds this commitment through rigorous equity analyses, proactive community engagement, and
mitigation strategies that promote fairness, transparency, and accessibility.

Equitable Siting: RTD will comply with Title 49 CFR Section 21.5(b)(3), ensuring no site selection
excludes, denies benefits to, or disproportionately burdens individuals based on race, color, or national
origin. Using census block group data, RTD will assess demographic impacts and cumulative effects of
existing transit facilities to ensure that proper perspective is given to localized impacts.
Public Engagement: RTD will conduct proactive outreach, including public meetings, surveys, and focus
groups. Materials will be provided in multiple languages and accessible formats. Engagement will occur
at multiple stages and before site selection, to ensure inclusivity and transparency, aligning with FTA
Circular 4702.1B.
Equity Analysis: Before selecting a site, RTD will evaluate equity impacts, including potential displacement
and cumulative effects of similar facilities. The analysis will focus on BIPOC and will consider low-income
populations within a quarter-mile radius. Findings will be publicly shared to enhance transparency and
guide decision-making.
Adverse Impact Mitigation: If a disparate impact on BIPOC populations is identified, RTD will collaborate
with affected communities to develop mitigation strategies such as relocation assistance or job training.
Sites with a disparate impact will only be chosen if no feasible alternatives exist, and RTD will provide
clear justification in accordance with Title 49 CFR Section 21.5(b)(3).
Compliance and Reporting: RTD will adhere to federal, state, and local regulations, ensuring compliance
with Title VI requirements. Triennial reports will document public engagement, equity analyses, and
mitigation efforts, demonstrating RTD’s commitment to fair and equitable site selection.

RTD 2025-2028 Title VI Program

In addition to the general requirements for FTA recipients outlined above, FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter VI,

Title VI Policies
Service Performance Monitoring
Equity Analyses of Major Service and Fare Changes since the 2022 Submission
Demographic Analysis

Since RTD meets this threshold, the following section explains how the agency fulfills these requirements.

Title VI Policies

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a major service change policy, a disparate impact
policy, and a disproportionate burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service and fare change proposals for equity.
In the 2025-2028 Title VI Program, RTD revised the major service change policy, the fare equity policy, and the
definition of who constitutes the “low-income” population as it pertains to the disproportionate burden policy. In
the development of these policies, RTD sought public feedback through a series of public meetings and surveys
described below in Engagement Efforts on Title VI Policy Changes. The disparate impact policy, disproportionate
burden policy, and Key Activity Centers (formerly known as Key Public Service Destinations) Assessment remain
the same in the 2025-2028 Title VI Program as the previous iteration.
These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below.

Changes from the 2022-2025 Title VI Policies

In the 2025-2028 Title VI Program, RTD revised the major service change policy, the fare equity policy, and the
definition of who constitutes the “low-income” population as it pertains to the disproportionate burden policy.
To inform the major service change policy, RTD examined the major service change policies of 22 different
transit agencies: Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District (AC Transit), Albuquerque Transit Department
(ABQRIDE), Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART), Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART),
Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority (DART), King County Metro, LA Metro, Milwaukee County Transit
System (MCTS), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), Metropolitan Council Metro Transit (MSP
Metro), North County Transit District (NCTD), Pierce Transit, Sacramento Regional Transit District, San Diego
Metropolitan Transit System (MTS), San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), San Mateo County
Transit District (SamTrans), Sound Transit, SunTran, Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon
(TriMet), Utah Transit Authority (UTA), and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA).
The new major service change policy maintains a 25% threshold, as this is the most common standard across
the researched agencies. However, the criteria for what constitutes a major service change under the policy now
expands beyond service hours alone to specify that 25% changes in service hours, route miles (including reroutes), daily service span, or frequency; implementation of a new route or line; and the elimination,
discontinuation, or retirement of an existing route/line all constitute major service changes. Additionally, the
previous major service change policy required that a change be enacted for 12 months or more to constitute a
major service change; the new policy removes this requirement to capture 25% changes made at one time or
cumulatively over a 36-month period. This helps RTD ensure that small changes made over time do not add up
to large changes that unequally impact communities.

1.E.1.b

Finally, RTD updated its disproportionate burden policy, raising the threshold from 150% to 200% of the
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines. This change better reflects the cost of living in
the Denver metro region, aligns more closely with the LiVE Income-Based Discount Program and the financial
realities of low-income customers, and ensures a more accurate analysis of transit service distribution. While a
250% threshold was considered, limitations in the U.S. Census Bureau’s ACS 2019-2023 data made precise
analysis beyond 200% difficult. The next available income grouping in the ACS dataset is 200-300%, preventing
an accurate assessment of a 250% threshold’s impact. In the end, expanding the threshold also broadens the
number of low-income individuals included in RTD’s equity analyses, improving the ability to identify and address
potential transit access disparities.
In the development of these policies, RTD also sought public feedback through a series of public meetings and
surveys described below in Engagement Efforts on Title VI Policy Changes. The disparate impact policy and Key
Activity Centers (formerly known as Key Public Service Destinations) Assessment remain the same in the 20252028 Title VI Program as the previous iteration.
All policies and their applicable thresholds are described in full below.

Service Equity Analyses

Prior to implementation, the FTA requires RTD to conduct a Service Equity Analysis on all service changes that
exceed the agency’s self-established major service change threshold to determine whether those changes will
have adverse effects on BIPOC or low-income populations. RTD defines “adverse effect” as any impact on
transit services resulting from major service changes, such as service reductions, route modifications, schedule
adjustments, or other modifications, that may:
•
•

Disproportionately burden BIPOC and/or low-income populations compared to non-BIPOC and/or nonlow-income populations, or
Disproportionately benefit non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income populations as compared to BIPOC
and/or low-income populations

RTD’s previous Title VI Program defined an adverse effect as “a geographical
or temporal reduction in service that includes, but is not limited to eliminating
a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an existing
route, and increasing headways.”

M ajor Service Change Policy

To assist in analyzing the degree of adverse effects, RTD defines a major service change as:
•
•
2

A 25% or greater change in service hours, route miles (including re-routes), daily service span, or
frequency of any bus route or rail line within a single service proposal or cumulatively in any period within
36 consecutive months 2
The implementation of a new route/line

The cumulative 36-month period begins when the very first change to a route/line is made.

Separately, changes made to the fare equity policy aim to clarify when a fare equity analysis is required, ensuring
that fare changes do not disproportionately affect BIPOC and low-income communities.

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Title VI Program
The elimination, discontinuation, or retirement of an existing route/line

RTD’s previous Title VI Program defined a major service change as “a 25%
addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that would remain in
effect for 12 or more months.”
Any service change that does not meet the above criteria for a major service change is considered a minor
service change. Additionally, the following exceptional cases are exempt:
•
•
•

•

•
•

Discontinuance of service that is replaced by a different mode or operator, provided the new service
offers the same or better headways, fare, transfer options, span of service, and stops served
Standard seasonal or schedule adjustments, unless the adjustments, as compared to operations during
the previous season, falls within the major service change definition above
Emergency service changes, including changes in routes or service frequencies which may be
necessitated due to a state of fiscal emergency or a major catastrophe (e.g., natural or human-made
disasters) which severely impairs public health or safety, changes in access to public streets, or the ability
of RTD vehicles to travel on public streets
Service changes (e.g., detours) due to roadway or rail infrastructural projects undertaken by external
stakeholders (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation, City and County of Denver) that would
remain in effect for 12 months or less
Creation, alteration, or elimination of a supplemental, temporary, or demonstration service that would
remain in effect for 12 months or less
Adjustments made to major service changes after Board approval but prior to the effective date that
would otherwise be considered minor changes

Ex am ining Adverse Effects: Disparate I m pact, Disproportionate Burden, and K ey
Activities Centers

A Service Equity Analysis is conducted for all major service changes and presented to the RTD Board of Directors
for awareness and consideration. The analysis, along with a record of the Board's actions, will be included in the
subsequent RTD Title VI Program.
To perform a Service Equity Analysis examining adverse effects, RTD will analyze how the proposed major
service change(s) could impact BIPOC populations as compared to non-BIPOC populations, and low-income
populations as compared to non-low-income populations, at both the route/line level and the network level.
Specifically, a major service change should not adversely affect BIPOC populations 10% more than non-BIPOC
populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact. A major service change should not adversely
affect low-income populations 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 200% of
the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines.

RTD’s previous Title VI Program defined low-income populations as those
whose household income is at or below 150% of the HHS Poverty Guidelines.

•

First, RTD identifies the service changes which meet the threshold established in the major service change
policy. 3 The next step in the analysis is to look at each service change at the route/line level to identify potential
individual disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings. If there is a finding, and in accordance with
RTD’s 2022-2025 Title VI Program, a network-level analysis is required to further clarify how service changes
may impact Title VI-protected populations at aggregate levels. 4 Additionally, RTD will quantify the service
changes’ impacts to key activity centers access, which include jobs, retail/convenience stores, human and
social service centers, senior facilities, and educational institutions.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact, RTD shall consider modifications to the
proposed change to ensure it avoids, minimizes, or mitigates the potential disparate impact. A major service
change that results in a disparate impact can only be implemented if:
1. There is a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed major service change, and
2. There are no alternatives that would have a less disparate impact while still accomplishing RTD’s
legitimate program goals
If a proposed major service change results in a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying the
proposal to mitigate the impact where practicable. 5

Fare Equity Analyses

Like the Service Equity Analyses, FTA Circular 4702.1B requires that RTD conduct a Fare Equity Analysis when
proposing fare changes to assess whether the proposed changes adversely impact BIPOC and low-income
populations. RTD must establish a fare disparate impact threshold to determine when fare changes
disproportionately affect BIPOC customers and a fare disproportionate burden threshold for low-income
customers.
Per the FTA, a Fare Equity Analysis is not required in the following cases:
•
•
•
•

Temporary fare reductions. If the fare change is a short-term promotional fare reduction, such as free
rides during a special event or seasonal discount programs
Emergency fare changes. If a fare change is implemented during an emergency, such as a natural
disaster or a public health crisis, and is intended to address immediate needs
Minor fare adjustments. Changes that do not affect the fare structure or pricing for a specific group (e.g.,
minor rounding adjustments)
Special event or promotional zero-fare programs. For RTD, this includes fare-free days such as Zero Fare
for Transit Equity Day, Zero Fare for National Vote Early Day and Election Day, or Zero Fare for New
Year’s Eve

Fare Equity Policy

Any RTD fare change should not result in BIPOC or low-income customers experiencing impacts that differ by
more than 5% compared to general ridership. If changes involve the addition or removal of fare media, the
equity analysis must consider access to fare media, vending machines, and other ways to add value (e.g., online
or through retail).
Please refer to the attached Service Equity Analyses for an explanation of this methodology.
Ibid.
5
Per the FTA, low-income populations are not a protected class under Title VI. However, the FTA requires transit providers
to evaluate proposed service and fare changes to determine whether low-income populations will bear a disproportionate
burden of the changes. Since low-income populations are not a protected class under Title VI, RTD’s approach to disparate
impacts identified in major service changes differs from that of disproportionate burden findings.

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Title VI Program

As part of this updated Title VI Program, RTD defines a “fare change” to include:
•
•
•
•

Increases or decreases in the price of fare media
New or discontinued fare media (i.e., types of transit payment like cash, paper pass or electronic)
Changes in fare types or products (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass), fare levels (e.g., Standard, Airport),
and customer categories (e.g., full-fare, seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients, LiVE
program participants, and youth ages 19 and under)
Modifications to Ticket Vending Machine access (e.g., quantity, fees, payment options)

This definition excludes Access-a-Ride services, which are not subject to these Title VI requirements.

Fare Disparate I m pact or Disproportionate Burden Policies

If a fare change affects BIPOC populations five percent more than non-BIPOC populations, this level of impact
is considered a disparate impact. If a fare change affects low-income populations five percent more than nonlow-income populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. If a proposed fare
change results in a disparate impact, RTD shall consider modifications to the proposed change to ensure it
avoids, minimizes, or mitigates the potential disparate impact. RTD can only implement a fare change resulting
in a disparate impact if:
1. There is a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, and
2. There are no alternatives that would have a less disparate impact while still accomplishing RTD’s
legitimate program goals
If a proposed fare change results in a disproportionate burden on low-income populations, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to mitigate the impact where practicable.

Service Performance Monitoring

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter VI, RTD must establish service standards and actively monitor agency service
to ensure equitable and consistent delivery. These standards provide a framework for objective decision-making
in service provision. Additionally, the FTA expects transit agencies to regularly evaluate their services to ensure
they are provided fairly and without discrimination.
To comply with this requirement, RTD produces its Service Performance Monitoring Report on an annual basis.
The report compares BIPOC access to that of non-BIPOC access as well as low-income access to that of nonlow-income access across six service performance metrics: stop amenities, vehicle loads, revenue hours, ontime performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability. The metrics are defined as follows:

Packet Pg. 86

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

RTD’s previous Title VI Program did not clearly define what constitutes a “fare change.”

•
•
•
•
•
•

Stop amenities: RTD analyzes the distribution of stop amenities in the RTD system (specifically, shelters;
seating; lighting; elevators; digital displays; signs, maps, and/or schedules; waste receptacles; and ticket
vending machines) to identify any potential disparities
Vehicle loads: RTD evaluates whether weekday local bus, regional bus, SkyRide, Bus Rapid Transit, light
rail vehicles, and commuter rail vehicles are overcrowded by comparing the load/seat factor for each
vehicle type and time period (i.e., peak and midday)
Revenue hours: RTD evaluates the amount and distribution of revenue hours of service provided in
census block groups. The hours while in service include trip start to finish
On-time performance: RTD defines “on-time” as no more than one minute early or five minutes late,
measured at time points
Vehicle assignment: The FTA expects that the average age of vehicles on BIPOC and/or low-income
lines/routes should be no more than the average age of vehicles on non-BIPOC and/or non-low-income
lines/routes
Service availability: RTD considers people residing within one-half mile of bus stops and/or rail stations
as having service available. Service availability is expressed as number and percentage of District-wide
population and is determined by vehicle mode

The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan is for BIPOC and low-income routes and lines to achieve within
10% or better per service performance metric. A metric above the 10% threshold but within 20% would result
in a “marginal” score. A marginal score would flag that metric as a caution and area for improvement. Any
composite score that exceeds 20% for BIPOC populations would indicate “adverse impact” and would result in
a system-wide disparate impact finding per the FTA.
Detailed findings are available in the 2022 Service Performance Monitoring Report (Attachment W), and the
Transit Service Policies and Standards (Attachment X).

Demographic Analysis

RTD leverages demographic data to evaluate equity in the distribution of services, facilities, and amenities,
ensuring meaningful access for BIPOC, low-income, and linguistically diverse populations. This data informs
decision-making at the earliest stages of planning for services, facilities, and programs while also enabling RTD
to continuously monitor service performance. By analyzing the impacts of policies and programs on these
communities, RTD identifies and implements measures to prevent or mitigate disparities. To support this
analysis, RTD develops GIS maps and comparative charts, integrating both ridership and population data across
its service area.

Current Network and Service Area

Figures 11 to 13 illustrate the distribution of BIPOC, low-income, and linguistically diverse populations in relation
to services throughout the RTD service area. These maps, derived from the 2019-2023 American Community
Survey (ACS) data, provide insight into transit access for these populations.
Figure 11 depicts the RTD network in relation to the distribution of BIPOC populations by census block group.
Areas are shaded to indicate block groups where the BIPOC population is greater than or equal to the RTD
service area average (38.2%), as reported in the 2019-2023 ACS.
Figure 12 illustrates the RTD network in relation to low-income populations by census block group. Low-income
is defined as earning 150% or less of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) federal poverty level.
Areas are shaded to indicate block groups where the low-income population meets or exceeds the RTD service
area average (14.1%), based on the 2019-2023 ACS. High concentrations of low-income households are
dispersed throughout the service area.

Description of Engagement Efforts to
Update Title VI Program

THIS SECTION WAS UPDATED MAY 1 AND WILL BE COMPLETED UPON BOARD APPROVAL AND ADOPTION AT
THE END OF MAY.
RTD conducted a comprehensive engagement process to ensure that the 2025-2028 Title VI Program aligns
with equity principles and community needs. This effort included consultation with internal departments and
outreach to community-based organizations serving BIPOC, low-income, and linguistically diverse communities.
Through these efforts, RTD sought to gather meaningful public feedback, identify potential barriers to access,
and reaffirm its commitment to equitable transit services.
Outreach targeted the Title VI Program as a whole as well as specific sections, such as the Language Access
Plan and Title VI Policies, as detailed below.

Engagement Efforts on the Overall Title VI Program Update
Engagement on the overall Title VI Program update launched in April 2025.

Title VI Program Update Main Webpage: RTD developed a dedicated webpage to centralize public input
on all elements of the Title VI Program update. The webpage contained a survey to allow the public to
provide direct feedback on the program.
Survey Promotion: The public survey was open from January 2 to May 22, 2025. RTD promoted the
survey and encouraged participation through the following tactics:
o News Media Outreach: On April 7, 2025, RTD issued an English news release to 712 media
subscribers, including municipal staff, public information officers (PIOs), and other stakeholders.
The release had a 36% open rate (209 opened). A Spanish version was sent to 102 multicultural
media contacts and received a 47% open rate (36 opened). Public Relations also shared the
information through the stakeholder newsletter, which is sent to customers who have opted to
receive updates on various RTD topics. The newsletter reached 28,410 subscribers and had an
open rate of 43.3% (8,532 opened). Additional coverage is scheduled in the May 2025 edition of
Read-n-Ride, RTD’s customer newsletter.
o Community-Based Organizations: RTD collaborated with CBOs that serve BIPOC, low-income, and
linguistically diverse populations. Contracted partners engaged more than 412 individuals across
four outreach events and promoted the program via social media, newsletters, radio, and public
meetings. Servicios de la Raza featured the update in its newsletter, which reaches more than
45,000 people. RTD also sent a mass email to more than 1,000 community-based organizations
and direct service providers, encouraging participation in the comment process.
o Emails to LiVE and Transit Assistance Grant (TAG) Program Participants: The Transit Equity Office
sent an email to 12,375 participants of the LiVE income-based fare program and to 150
organizations supported by the TAG Program.
o Community Events: Staff from the Transit Equity Office and the Communications and Engagement
Department engaged directly with the public at community events on April 25 and 26, with
additional outreach scheduled for May 10, 16, and 17.
o Social Media: RTD amplified outreach using both organic and paid social media. Six organic posts
ran between April 7 and May 12. Paid ads focused on high-density BIPOC and low-income
neighborhoods were deployed from April 29 to May 13.

Engagement Efforts on the Language Access Plan

To inform future language access initiatives, the Transit Equity Office conducted a survey with RTD staff
(receiving 662 responses), a survey with linguistically diverse community members (receiving 578 responses),
and a focus group with 15 bilingual/multilingual participants. For details, please read the Four Factor Analysis in
the Language Access Plan (Attachment F).

Engagement Efforts on Title VI Policy Changes

To inform and refine updates to its Title VI policies, the Transit Equity Office collaborated with internal teams
from Service Development and Revenue Management. This coordination ensured that proposed changes were
thoroughly evaluated from both operational and equity perspectives.
As part of its engagement strategy, TEO led several initiatives to solicit public feedback and assess potential
community impacts of the proposed changes. To facilitate community input, RTD launched a dedicated webpage.
The webpage featured background context and a bilingual (English and Spanish) survey that asked participants
whether they agreed or disagreed with the proposed changes. Respondents also had the opportunity to share
open-ended feedback to inform a more nuanced understanding of community needs.
To solicit additional qualitative input, particularly from BIPOC and low-income communities, RTD conducted a
series of in-person and organizational engagements. These efforts focused on understanding how the proposed
policy focus areas (e.g., new facility locations, service changes, and fare adjustments) may impact historically
underserved populations based on their lived experiences with public transit.
The outline of engagement conducted is summarized below:
•

Denver Regional Mobility Access Council (DRMAC): RTD staff provided an overview of the proposed Title
VI policy changes and gathered feedback during DRMAC’s monthly meeting on January 14, 2025, which
had 25 attendees. DRMAC serves as a forum dedicated to overcoming mobility barriers through
education, collaboration, and advocacy to enhance quality of life.
Boulder County Mobility and Access Coalition (MAC): RTD staff presented the proposed updates and
solicited feedback during the Boulder County MAC monthly meeting on January 22, 2025, with 22
attendees. The coalition brings together community organizations, individuals, and interest groups
working to improve transportation services for those facing mobility challenges, including low-income
households, older adults, people with disabilities, youth, and veterans.
Village Exchange Center (VEC): RTD gathered public input on the proposed changes by engaging with
approximately 64 attendees at VEC’s Resource Fair on January 23, 2025. The event provided wraparound
services to populations in need across Aurora and the Denver metro area.
Community Partners Initiative: During the inaugural Community Partners Initiative convening on January
28, 2025, RTD staff reviewed and discussed the proposed changes with 12 community-based
organizations serving diverse populations, including the Denver National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People (NAACP), National Organizations for Youth Safety (NOYS), Servicios de la Raza,
Organization for Chinese Americans (OCA), Fortaleza Familiar, Boulder Housing, The Delores Project, the
Action Center, Denver Street Partnership (DSP), My Father’s House Denver, the Empowerment Program,
The Spirit of Christ Church, and Aurora Mental Health and Recovery (AMHR).
Black and Brown Parents United Foundation (BPUF): RTD sponsored a table at BPUF’s community event
on January 31, 2025, which focused on health equity and air quality action. At the event, RTD provided

information and collected feedback on the proposed updates from 35 attendees. BPUF is a communitybased organization dedicated to supporting parents of Black and brown children by fostering
empowerment and promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion through confidence building, community
development, and engagement.
Outreach through Community Publications, Partner Organizations, and Contractors: RTD shared
information about the opportunity for public feedback on the proposed policies in the January/February
2025 issue of the MUSE, a bi-monthly publication serving Montbello, Denver’s Far Northeast community,
and the Servicios de la Raza newsletter, a social service organization supporting Colorado’s Latino
community. RTD also contracted MOES, a multicultural outreach firm; CREA Results, a community-based
organization focused on equity through research, education, and awareness; and Denver Streets
Partnership, a coalition advocating for people-friendly streets.
RTD’s Advisory Committees (ACPD and CAC): RTD engaged APAC and CAC for insights on the proposed
Title VI policy changes during their monthly meetings on February 11, 2025, and February 13, 2025,
respectively, with 20 attendees at each meeting.
RTD’s News Stop Press Release and Read-n-Ride Newsletter: RTD disseminated information about the
opportunity for public feedback on the proposed Title VI policy changes through a public press release
issued via News Stop on January 2, 2025 (sent to 675+ subscribers including multicultural media outlets).
Additional outreach followed through the Read-n-Ride newsletter on January 6, 2025 (sent to 992+
subscribers).

Title VI Policies Survey Results

The survey remained open to the public from January 2, 2025, through March 15, 2025, allowing individuals
across the RTD service area to participate. Following the survey closure, RTD analyzed the survey data to identify
key themes, understand community concerns, and pinpoint areas for potential policy refinement. RTD received
75 survey responses related to the proposed Title VI policy changes. The majority of respondents expressed
support for the changes, recognizing their potential to strengthen equitable access to transit services.
The following section summarizes key themes that emerged from the survey responses. Full comments are
included in Attachment Y.

Broad support for the policy updates as a step toward equity: Commenters expressed general support
for the major service change policy, viewing it as a positive step toward improving transit equity and
increasing oversight of service changes that may adversely affect BIPOC and low-income communities.
Desire to include unplanned or informal service changes: Respondents recommended that unplanned or
unofficial service disruptions, such as detours or prolonged slowdowns, be evaluated under the major
service change criteria. They argued that these disruptions can create disproportionate burdens and
should trigger equity analyses.
Calls for a more inclusive and responsive approach: Some commenters suggested refinements to ensure
the policy better reflects the lived experiences of customers. This included recommendations to lower
the major service change threshold or re-evaluate the 36-month cumulative change period, with concerns
that outdated demographic data could limit the accuracy of equity analyses.

Support for expanding the low-income definition: A significant portion of respondents expressed strong
support for the updated low-income definition. Many emphasized the importance of adjusting the
definition to reflect the realities of today’s economy, especially in the Denver metro area where the cost
of living is higher than national averages. Suggestions include raising the threshold to better capture
those who face financial hardship but are often excluded from traditional low-income categories.
Proposals for a regionally relevant income threshold: Several commenters suggested revising the lowincome threshold to better reflect regional economic conditions. They proposed using Area Median
Income (AMI) as a metric to define low income or raising the income limit to ensure that more workingclass households, particularly those earning between $40,000 and $50,000 annually, are included in the
policy.
Concerns about the adequacy of the proposed definition: Some respondents voiced concerns that the
proposed 200% of the federal poverty level may still exclude essential workers, especially those in lowwage jobs. They recommended adjusting the low-income definition to capture workers earning at or near
minimum wage, ensuring greater inclusivity for those who face significant transportation barriers.

Positive reception to proposed fare adjustments: Many respondents expressed support for the proposed
fare changes, with some highlighting how the adjustments would improve their ability to access essential
services and areas. They welcomed the focus on addressing the needs of underserved communities.
Concerns about cashless payments and fare enforcement: Some respondents expressed concern about
the potential exclusion of individuals who rely on cash for fare payment. There were also suggestions
that fare enforcement could disproportionately affect low-income riders, with one commenter advocating
for alternatives to fines, such as more flexible or on-the-spot fare collection methods.
Desire for improved communication and transparency: Some commenters requested more information
about how fare equity policies are applied across various regions of RTD’s service area, and some voiced
interest in further understanding the mechanisms of fare equity, including potential regional differences.
Respondents also encouraged clear communication about eligibility for programs like the agency’s LiVE
income-based discount program.

Titre VI Procédure de réclamation

La plainte doit être déposée dans les 180 jours suivant la date de la discrimination présumée. RTD permet le recours à un
représentant pour déposer une plainte au nom du plaignant. Toute communication faisant suite à la plainte sera adressée
au représentant du plaignant en premier lieu et au plaignant en second lieu.
Une fois qu'une plainte est déposée, RTD l'examinera et déterminera si on est compétent. Le client recevra un accusé de
réception l'informant que la plainte fera l'objet d'une enquête par RTD dans un délai de sept (7) jours ouvrables à compter
de la date de dépôt de la plainte. Sauf si un délai plus long est spécifié par RTD, le plaignant disposera de dix (10) jours à
compter de la date de la lettre pour envoyer les informations demandées à l'enquêteur de RTD affecté à l'affaire.
L'enquêteur peut interroger les personnes citées comme témoins et toute autre personne ayant des informations. Si des
informations supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour résoudre le cas, RTD peut contacter à la fois le plaignant et le témoin.
Si l'enquêteur de RTD n'est pas contacté par le plaignant ou ne reçoit pas les informations supplémentaires dans les délais
requis, RTD peut clôturer administrativement l'affaire. Cette dernière peut également être classée administrativement si le
plaignant n’est plus intéressé à donner suite à l’affaire.
RTD mènera généralement une enquête dans les soixante (60) jours suivant la réception d'un formulaire de plainte dûment
rempli. Bien que RTD s'efforce de résoudre rapidement les plaintes, ce processus varie selon la complexité de la plainte, les
personnes impliquées et d'autres facteurs. Une fois l'enquête terminée, le plaignant recevra une lettre de réponse finale à
sa plainte.
Si un plaignant n'est pas d'accord avec la décision de RTD, il peut demander un réexamen en soumettant une demande par
écrit au responsable de l'équité dans le transport en commun de RTD dans les sept (7) jours suivant la date de la lettre de
RTD, en indiquant de manière spécifique la base du réexamen. Le responsable de l'équité dans le transport en commun
informera le plaignant de sa décision d'accepter ou de rejeter la demande de réexamen dans les dix (10) jours. Dans les cas
où le réexamen est accordé, le responsable de l'équité en matière de transport (Transit Equity Manager) en commun
enverra une lettre de détermination au plaignant à la fin de l'examen du réexamen.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Toute personne qui pense avoir été exclue de la participation aux programmes, activités ou services de RTD ou s'être vu
refuser les avantages de ces derniers en raison d'une discrimination fondée sur la race, la couleur ou l'origine nationale
peut porter une plainte au titre VI auprès de RTD.

Beschwerdeverfahren gemäß Titel IV

1.E.1.b

Die Beschwerde muss vor Ablauf von 180 Tagen ab dem Zeitpunkt der geltend gemachten Diskriminierung vorgebracht
werden. RTD räumt die Möglichkeit ein, dass die Beschwerde im Namen des Beschwerdeführers von einem Vertreter
vorgebracht wird. Die gesamte Kommunikation nach dem Vorbringen einer Beschwerde erfolgt dann im Weiteren in erster
Linie mit dem Vertreter und nur sekundär mit dem Beschwerdeführer.
Sobald eine Beschwerde vorgebracht wurde, prüft RTD diese und ermittelt, ob die Zuständigkeit dafür bei uns liegt. Der
Kunde wird anhand eines Bestätigungsschreibens informiert, ob die Beschwerde innerhalb von sieben (7) Geschäftstagen
ab dem Datum ihres Vorbringens von RTD untersucht wird. Sofern von RTD kein längerer Zeitraum festgelegt wird, hat der
Beschwerdeführer ab dem Datum, zu dem er dazu aufgefordert wurde, zehn (10) Tage Zeit, um dem mit dem Fall betrauten
Ermittler die von diesem angeforderten Informationen zukommen zu lassen.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Wenn jemand glaubt, aufgrund einer Diskriminierung wegen Rasse, Hautfarbe oder Nationalität von der Teilnahme an den
Programmen, Aktivitäten oder Diensten von RTD ausgeschlossen worden zu sein bzw. dass ihm oder ihr Leistungen oder
Vorteile vorenthalten wurden, kann die betreffende Person eine Beschwerde gemäß Titel IV des Unionsrechts an RTD
richten.

Der Ermittler kann jegliche Personen befragen, die als Zeugen genannt werden, sowie jede sonstige Person, die über
Informationen verfügt. Wenn zur Klärung des Falls weitere Informationen erforderlich sind, kann RTD den Beschwerdeführer
oder die Zeugen kontaktieren. Wenn der RTD-Ermittler vom Beschwerdeführer innerhalb der vorgegebenen Frist nicht
kontaktiert wird oder die angeforderten Informationen nicht erhält, kann RTD den Fall schließen und zu den Akten legen. Ein
Fall kann auch dann administrativ geschlossen werden, wenn der Beschwerdeführer wünscht, dass die Angelegenheit nicht
weiter verfolgt wird.
RTD schließt solcherlei Untersuchungen in der Regel innerhalb von sechzig (60) Tagen ab Eingang des ausgefüllten
Beschwerdeformulars ab. Zwar bemüht sich RTD stets um eine zügige Bearbeitung von Beschwerden, doch hängt die
Dauer des Prozesses auch von der Komplexität des Falls ab, von den involvierten Personen sowie von weiteren Faktoren.
Sobald die Untersuchung abgeschlossen ist, erhält der Beschwerdeführer ein abschließendes Antwortschreiben.

Wenn der Beschwerdeführer mit RTDs Bescheid nicht einverstanden ist, können sie eine Wiederaufnahme des Falls
anfordern. Dies hat vor Ablauf von sieben (7) Tagen nach Erhalt des RTD-Antwortschreibens schriftlich an RTDs TransitEquity-Manager zu erfolgen. Dabei ist dafür ist der Grund für den Wunsch nach einer Neubewertung anzugeben. Der
Transit-Equity-Manager informiert den Beschwerdeführer dann innerhalb von zehn (10) Tagen von seiner Entscheidung, den
Antrag auf Wiederaufnahme anzunehmen oder abzulehnen. Wenn die Wiederaufnahme gewährt wird, informiert der TransitEquity-Manager den Beschwerdeführer schriftlich über das Ergebnis der abgeschlossenen Überprüfung.

बाद, िशकायतकतार् को िशकायत पर अंितम प्रितिक्रया पत्र प्राप्त होगा।

यिद कोई िशकायतकतार् RTD के िनधार् ण से असहमत है, तो वो RTD के पत्र की तारीख के सात (7) िदनों के भीतर RTD के ट्रांिजट इिक्वटी प्रबंधक को

시민권(Title VI) 소송 절차
인종, 피부색, 출신 국가에 따른 차별 때문에 RTD의 프로그램, 활동, 서비스를 참여하지 못하거나 혜택 수령이

고소자는 차별 혐의가 제기된 날에서 180일 안에 접수해야 합니다. RTD는 대리인을 통해 고소를 제기할 수 있도록
허용해야 합니다. 고소 이후 모든 연락은 고소 대리인이 일차로 받고 그다음 고소인이 이차로 받습니다.
고소를 제기하면 RTD는 고소를 검토하고 관할권이 있는지 알아볼 것입니다. 고소인은 고소가 접수된 날에서 칠(7)
영업일 안에 고소한 내용을 RTD가 조사했는지를 알리는 서한을 받게 됩니다. RTD에서 더 긴 기간을 명시하지
않았다면 고소인은 서한에 있는 날짜에서 십(10)일 안에 사건을 할당받은 RTD 조사관에게 요청받은 정보를 보내야
합니다.
조사관은 증인으로 지명받은 모든 사람과 정보를 가지고 있을 수 있다고 생각되는 다른 이들을 인터뷰할 수 있습니다.
사건을 해결하기 위해 더 많은 정보가 필요한 경우, RTD에서는 고소인이나 증인에게 연락할 수 있습니다. RTD 조사관이
고소인에게 연락을 받지 못했거나 필요한 시간 안에 추가 정보를 받지 못했다면 RTD는 행정에 따라 소송을 종결할 수
있습니다. 고소인이 더 이상 소송을 진행하길 원하지 않는 경우에도 행정에 따라 사건을 종결할 수 있습니다.
일반적으로 RTD는 작성 완료된 소송 서식을 받은 후 육십(60)일 안에 조사를 완료해야 합니다. RTD는 고소 내용을
해결하기 위해 노력할 것이지만, 해당 절차는 고소 내용의 복잡성, 관련 개인, 기타 요인에 따라 달라집니다. 조사를
완료하면 고소인은 고소 내용에 대한 최종 답변서를 받습니다.
고소인이 RTD 결정에 동의하지 않는다면, RTD 서신 날짜에서 칠(7)일 안에 서면으로 재심 근거를 명시하여 RTD의
Transit Equity Manager에게 재심을 요청할 수 있습니다. Transit Equity Manager는 십(10)일 안에 재심의 요청을 수락
또는 거부할지 결정하여 고소인에게 통지해야 합니다. 재심 요청이 받아들여졌다면 Transit Equity Manager는 재심
검토를 완료하는 즉시 고소인에게 우호적 확정서를 발행해야 합니다.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

거부되었다고 생각한다면 누구나 시민권에 근거하여 RTD를 고소할 수 있습니다.

Процедура рассмотрения жалоб согласно разделу VI

Жалоба должна быть подана в течение 180 дней с момента предполагаемой дискриминации. RTD разрешает
использовать представителя для подачи жалобы от имени заявителя. Вся коммуникация после рассмотрения
жалобы будет направлена в первую очередь представителю заявителя, а во вторую очередь - заявителю.
После подачи жалобы RTD рассмотрит ее и определит, подпадает ли она под нашу юрисдикцию. Клиент получит
письмо с уведомлением о том, будет ли жалоба рассматриваться RTD в течение семи (7) рабочих дней с момента
подачи жалобы. Если RTD не установит более длительный срок, у заявителя будет десять (10) дней с даты письма
для отправки запрашиваемой информации следователю RTD, назначенному на это дело.
Следователь может опросить всех лиц, указанных в качестве свидетелей, и любых других лиц, которые могут
располагать информацией. Если для разрешения дела требуется дополнительная информация, RTD может
связаться с заявителем или свидетелем. Если следователь RTD не связывается с заявителем или не получает
дополнительную информацию в установленные сроки, RTD может закрыть дело в административном порядке.
Дело может быть административно закрыто и в том случае, если заявитель больше не желает продолжать
рассмотрение своего дела.
Как правило, RTD завершает расследование в течение шестидесяти (60) дней с момента получения заполненной
формы жалобы. Хотя RTD стремится оперативно разрешить жалобы, этот процесс будет отличаться в
зависимости от сложности жалобы, вовлеченных лиц и других факторов. По окончании расследования заявитель
получит окончательное письмо с ответом на жалобу.
Если заявитель не согласен с решением RTD, он может потребовать повторного рассмотрения, подав запрос в
письменном виде менеджеру по вопросам равноправия в транзите RTD в течение семи (7) дней после даты
письма RTD с конкретным указанием основания для повторного рассмотрения. В течение десяти (10) дней
менеджер по вопросам равноправия в транзите уведомит заявителя о своем решении принять или отклонить
запрос на повторное рассмотрение. В случае положительного решения о пересмотре, менеджер по вопросам
равноправия в транзите направит заявителю письмо с определением по завершении пересмотра.

第六章投诉程序

投诉必须在被指控的歧视行为发生之日起 180 天内提出。RTD 允许通过一位代表来代表投
诉人提出投诉。所有投诉后的沟通将主要针对投诉人的代表，其次是投诉人。
一旦提出投诉，RTD 将审查该投诉，并确定我们是否有管辖权。客户将收到一封确认信，
通知他们该投诉是否会在投诉提出后的七（7）个工作日内由 RTD 进行调查。除非 RTD 规
定了更长的时间，否则投诉人将有十(10)天的时间将所要求的信息发送给 RTD 分配给该
案件的调查员。
调查员可以约谈任何作为证人的个人和任何其他可能拥有信息的个人。如果需要更多的信
息来解决此案，RTD 可以联系投诉人或证人。如果 RTD 的调查员没有与投诉人联系，或
没有在规定的时间内收到额外的信息，RTD 可能会以行政方式结案。如果投诉人不再希望
继续其案件，案件也可能被行政结案。
RTD 通常会在收到完整的投诉表后六十（60）天内完成调查。尽管 RTD 努力及时解决投
诉，但这一过程将根据投诉的复杂性、涉及的个人和其他因素而有所不同。一旦调查结束，
投诉人将收到一份对投诉的最终答复信。
如果投诉人不同意 RTD 的决定，他们可以在 RTD 信函日期后七（7）天内向 RTD 的交通
公平经理提交书面请求，具体说明复议的依据，要求复议。交通公平经理将在十（10）
天内通知投诉人他们接受或拒绝复议请求的决定。在批准复议的情况下，交通公平经理将
在完成复议审查后向投诉人发出裁定书。

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

任何人如果认为他/她由于种族、肤色或民族血统的歧视而被排除在 RTD 的计划、活动或
服务之外，或被剥夺了受益权，可以向 RTD 提出第六章投诉。

Habraaca Cabashada ee Title VI

1.E.1.b

Cabashadu waa in lagu soo xareeyaa 180 maalmood gudahooda laga soo bilaabo taariikhda takoor ku eedeeynta. RTD-du
waxay ogolanaysaa isticmaalka wakiilka si uu u xareeyo cabasho isagoo matalaya qofka ashtakoonaya. Dhammaan xiriirka
ka dambeeya cabashada waxa lagu toosin doonaa wakiilka cabashada ugu horeyn kadibna ashtokoodaha marka labaad.
Marka cabashada la xareeyo, RTD-da waxay dib u eegi doontaa cabashada oo waxay go'aamin doontaa haddii aan awood
u leenahay inaan sameyno xukunka. Macmiilku waxuu heli doonaa warqad qirasho ah oo ku wargelinaysa in cabashada ay
RTD baari doonto gudaha todoba (7) maalmood ee shaqada laga bilaabo marka cabashada la xareeyay. Hadi aysan ka
ahayn in wakhti dheer ay qeexdo RTD mooyaane, ashtakooduhu waxuu haysan doonaa toban (10) maalmood laga bilaabo
taariikhda warqadda si uu ugu diro macluumaadka la codsaday baaraha RTD ee loo xilsaaray kiiska.
Baaruhu waxa uu waraysan karaa qof kasta oo lagu magac dhabo inuu yahay marqaati ahaan iyo cid kasta oo kale oo xog
hayn karta. Haddii macluumaad dheeraad ah loo baahdo si kiiska loo xalliyo, RTD waxay la xiriiri kartaa ashtakoodaha ama
markhaatiga. Haddii baaraha RTD aanu la xiriirin ashtakoodaha ama aanu ku helin macluumaadka dheeraadka ah ee
wakhtiga loo baahan yahay gudahood, RTD waxa laga yaabaa inay maamul ahaan xirto kiiska. Kiisku sidoo kale waxaa laga
yaabaa in loo xiro hab maamuleed haddii dacwooduhu/ashtakooduhu aanu doonayn inuu sii wado kiiskooda.
RTD waxay guud ahaan ku dhamaystiri doontaa baaritaanka lixdan (60) maalmood gudahooda laga soo bilaabo helista
foomka cabashada ee la buuxiyay. In kastoo RTD ay ku dadaalayso inay si degdeg ah u xalliso cabashooyinka, habraacani
wuu kala duwanaan doonaa iyadoo ku xiran kakanaanta cabashada, shakhsiyaadka ku lugta leh, iyo arrimo kale. Marka
baaritaanka la soo gabagabeeyo, ashtakooduhu wuxuu heli doonaa warqadda jawaabta ugu dambeysa ee cabashada.
Haddii ashtakooduhu/dacwooduhu uu khilaafo go'aanka RTD, waxay codsan karaan dib-u-eegis iyagoo codsi qoraal ah ugu
soo gudbinaya Maareeyaha Sinaanta Safrinta ee RTD (Transit Equity Manager) toddobo (7) maalmood gudahooda ka dib
taariikhda warqadda RTD, iyagoo si gaar ah u sheegaya gundhigyada aasaasiga ee dib u eegista. Maareeyaha Sinaanta ee
Safrinta ayaa ku wargelin doona ashtakoodaha go'aankooda ay ku aqbaleen ama ay ku diideen codsiga dib u eegista
toban (10) maalmood gudahood. Kiisaska dib-u-eegida la ogolaado, Maareeyaha Sinaanta ee Safrinta ayaa gudoon siin
doona ashtakoodaha/dacwoodaha warqada go'aan ka gaarista marka la dhammeeyo dib u eegista dib-u-hubinta.

1.E.1.b

Toda persona que considere que ha sido excluida de la participación en los programas, actividades
o servicios del Distrito de Transporte Regional (Regional Transportation District, RTD) o que se
le han negado los beneficios de estos, debido a la discriminación por motivos de raza, color u
origen nacional, puede presentar una queja en virtud del Título VI ante el RTD.
La queja debe presentarse en un plazo de 180 días a partir de la fecha de la supuesta
discriminación. El RTD permite el uso de un representante para presentar una queja en nombre
del denunciante. Toda la comunicación posterior a la queja presentada será dirigida al
representante del denunciante en primer lugar y al denunciante en segundo lugar.
Una vez que se consigne la queja, el RTD la revisará y determinará si tenemos jurisdicción. El
cliente recibirá una carta de acuse de recibo en la que se le informará si la queja será investigada
por el RTD en un plazo de siete (7) días hábiles a partir de la presentación de esta. A menos que
el RTD especifique un período más largo, el denunciante tendrá diez (10) días a partir de la fecha
de la carta para enviar la información solicitada al investigador del RTD asignado al caso.
El investigador podrá entrevistar a las personas que se citaran como testigos y a cualquier otra
persona que pueda tener información. Si se necesita más información para resolver el caso, el
RTD puede ponerse en contacto con el denunciante o el testigo. Si el denunciante no se pone en
contacto con el investigador del RTD o no recibe la información adicional dentro del plazo
establecido, el RTD puede cerrar el caso a nivel administrativo. Un caso puede cerrarse en lo
administrativo también si el denunciante no desea seguir con el mismo.

Por lo general, el RTD completará una investigación en un plazo de sesenta (60) días a
partir de la recepción de un formulario de queja diligenciado. Aunque el RTD se esfuerza
por resolver rápidamente las quejas, este proceso puede variar en función de la
complejidad de la queja, las personas implicadas y otros factores. Una vez concluida la
investigación, el denunciante recibirá una carta de respuesta final a su queja.
Si el denunciante no está de acuerdo con la decisión del RTD, puede solicitar una
reconsideración presentando una solicitud por escrito al director de Equidad de Tránsito
del RTD dentro de los siete (7) días siguientes a la fecha de la carta del RTD, indicando
con precisión el fundamento de la reconsideración. El director de Equidad de Tránsito
notificará al demandante su decisión de aceptar o rechazar la solicitud de reconsideración
en un plazo de diez (10) días. En los casos en los que se conceda la reconsideración, el
director de Equidad de Tránsito emitirá una carta de decisión al denunciante una vez
finalizada la revisión de la reconsideración.

Utaratibu wa Malalamishi wa Title VI

1.E.1.b

Lazima malalamishi yawasilishwe ndani ya siku 180 kutoka tarehe ya ubaguzi unaodaiwa. RTD inaruhusu matumizi ya
mwakilishi kuwasilisha malalamishi kwa niaba ya mlalamikaji. Mawasiliano yote kutokana na malalamishi yataelekezwa
kwa mwakilishi wa mlalamikaji kwanza na baadaye kwa mlalamikaji.
Pindi malalamishi yanapowasilishwa, RTD itayapitia na kuamua ikiwa tuna mamlaka ya kisheria. Mteja atapokea barua ya
uthibitishaji ikimfahamisha ikiwa malalamishi yatachunguzwa na RTD ndani ya siku saba (7) za kazi kutoka wakati
malalamishi yaliwasilishwa. Isipokuwa kipindi kirefu kibainishwe na RTD, mlalamikaji atakuwa na siku kumi (10) kutoka
tarehe ya barua kutuma maelezo yaliyoombwa kwa mchunguzi wa RTD aliyepewa jukumu la kusimamia kesi.
Mchunguzi anaweza kumhoji mtu yeyote aliyetajwa kuwa shahidi ambaye huenda akawa na taarifa. Ikiwa maelezo zaidi
yanahitajika ili kusuluhisha kesi, RTD inaweza kuwasiliana na mlalamikaji au shahidi. Ikiwa mlalamikaji hatawasiliana na
mchunguzi wa RTD au hatapokea maelezo zaidi ndani ya muda unaohitajika, RTD inaweza kuifunga kesi kulingana na
sheria. Kesi inaweza kufungwa kisheria pia ikiwa mlalamikaji hana haja tena ya kuendelea na kesi yake.
RTD kwa jumla itakamilisha uchunguzi ndani ya siku sitini (60) kutoka wakati wa kupokea fomu ya malalamishi iliyojazwa
kikamilifu. Ingawa RTD inajitahidi kusuluhisha malalamishi haraka, mchakato huu utatofautiana kutegemea na uzito wa
malalamishi, wahusika na masuala mengine. Pindi uchunguzi unapokamilika, mlalamikaji atapokea barua ya majibu ya
mwisho kuhusu malalamishi.
Ikiwa mlalamikaji hakubaliani na uamuzi wa RTD, anaweza kuomba tathmini kwa kuwasilisha ombi kwa Meneja wa RTD’s
Transit Equity kwa njia ya maandishi ndani ya siku saba (7) baada ya tarehe ya barua ya RTD, akitaja bayana msingi wa
tathmini. Meneja wa Transit Equity atamwarifu mlalamikaji kuhusu uamuzi wao wa kukubali au kukataa tathmini ndani ya
siku kumi (10). Katika hali ambapo tathmini inaruhusiwa, Meneja wa Transit Equity atampa mlalamikaji barua ya uamuzi
baada ya kukamilisha mapitio ya tathmini.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Mtu yeyote anayeamini kuwa hajajumuishwa kwenye ushiriki au amenyimwa fidia za mipango, shughuli au huduma za
RTD kutokana na ubaguzi kwa msingi wa mbari, rangi au asili ya taifa, anaweza kuwasilisha malalamishi ya Title VI kwa
RTD.

Proseso ng Reklamo sa Titulo VI

1.E.1.b

Dapat ihain ang reklamo sa loob ng 180 araw mula sa petsa ng ipinaparatang na diskriminasyon. Pinapahintulutan ng RTD
ang paggamit ng kinatawan para maghain ng reklamo sa ngalan ng nagrereklamo. Ang lahat ng komunikasyon
pagkatapos ng reklamo ay pangunahing ididirekta sa kinatawan ng nagrereklamo at sekundaryang ididirekta sa
nagrereklamo.
Kapag naihain ang isang reklamo, susuriin ng RTD ang reklamo at tutukuyin kung mayroon kaming hurisdiksiyon.
Makakatanggap ang kostumer ng sulat ng pagkilala na ipinapaalam sa kaniya kung iimbestigahan ng RTD ang reklamo sa
loob ng pitong (7) araw ng negosyo mula noong inihain ang reklamo. Maliban kung tinukoy ng RTD ang mas mahabang
panahon, magkakaroon ang nagrereklamo ng sampung (10) araw ng negosyo mula sa petsa ng sulat para ipadala ang
hiniling na impormasyon sa imbestigador ng RTD na nakatalaga sa kaso.
Maaaring magkaroon ng panayam ang imbestigador sa sinumang indibidwal na pinangalanan bilang saksi at sinumang
ibang indibidwal na maaaring may impormasyon. Kung kailangan ng higit pang impormasyon para lutasin ang kaso,
maaaring makipag-ugnayan ang RTD sa nagrereklamo o saksi. Kung ang imbestigador ng RTD ay hindi tinawagan ng
nagrereklamo o hindi nakatanggap ng karagdagang impormasyon sa loob ng kinakailangang timeline, maaaring isara ng
RTD ang pangangasiwa sa kaso. Maaari ding isara ang pangangasiwa sa kaso kung ayaw nang ipagpatuloy ng
nagrereklamo ang kaniyang kaso.
Sa pangkalahatan, kukumpleto ang RTD ng imbestigasyon sa loob ng animnapung (6) araw mula sa pagtanggap ng
nakumpletong form ng reklamo. Bagaman nagsisikap ang RTD na agad na lutasin ang mga reklamo, mag-iiba ang
prosesong ito depende sa pagiging komplikado ng reklamo, mga sangkot na indibidwal, at iba pang salik. Kapag natapos
na ang imbestigasyon, makakatanggap ang nagrereklamo ng huling sulat ng tugon sa nagrereklamo.
Kung hindi sumasang-ayon ang nagrereklamo sa desisyon ng RTD, maaari siyang humiling ng muling pagsasaalang-alang
sa pamamagitan ng pagsusumite ng kahilingan sa pamamagitan ng sulat sa Tagapamahala sa Pagiging Patas sa
Transportasyon (Transit Equity Manager) ng RTD sa loob ng pitong (7) araw pagkatapos ng petsa ng sulat ng RTD, na
partikular na tinutukoy ang batayan para sa muling pagsasaalang-alang. Aabisuhan ng Tagapamahala sa Pagiging Patas
sa Transportasyon ang nagrereklamo tungkol sa kanilang desisyong tanggapin o tanggihan ang kahilingan para sa muling
pagsasaalang-alang sa loob ng sampung (10) araw. Sa mga kaso kung saan nagbigay ng muling pagsasaalang-alang,
magbibigay ang Tagapamahala sa Pagiging Patas sa Transportasyon ng sulat ng desisyon sa nagrereklamo pagkatapos
makumpleto ng pagsusuri sa muling pagsasaalang-alang.

Bất kỳ người nào tin rằng mình đã bị loại khỏi việc tham gia hoặc bị từ chối các lợi ích của các
chương trình, hoạt động hoặc dịch vụ của RTD do phân biệt đối xử trên cơ sở chủng tộc, màu
da hoặc nguồn gốc quốc gia có thể nộp đơn khiếu nại Mục VI với RTD.
Đơn khiếu nại phải được nộp trong vòng 180 ngày kể từ ngày bị cáo buộc phân biệt đối xử. RTD
cho phép sử dụng đại diện để nộp đơn khiếu nại thay mặt cho người khiếu nại. Tất cả thông tin
liên lạc sau khi khiếu nại sẽ chủ yếu được chuyển đến đại diện của người khiếu nại và người
khiếu nại thứ hai.
Sau khi nộp đơn khiếu nại, RTD sẽ xem xét đơn khiếu nại và xác định xem chúng tôi có thẩm
quyền giải quyết hay không. Khách hàng sẽ nhận được thư xác nhận thông báo cho họ biết liệu
khiếu nại có được RTD điều tra hay không trong vòng bảy (7) ngày làm việc kể từ khi khiếu nại
được nộp. Trừ khi RTD quy định một khoảng thời gian dài hơn, người khiếu nại sẽ có mười (10)
ngày kể từ ngày nhận được thử yêu cầu thông tin cho điều tra viên RTD được chỉ định trong vụ
việc.
Điều tra viên có thể phỏng vấn bất kỳ cá nhân nào có tên là nhân chứng và bất kỳ cá nhân nào
khác có thể cung cấp thông tin. Nếu cần thêm thông tin để giải quyết vụ việc, RTD có thể liên hệ
với người khiếu nại hoặc nhân chứng. Nếu người khiếu nại không liên hệ với điều tra viên của
RTD hoặc không nhận được thông tin bổ sung trong thời hạn yêu cầu, RTD có thể đóng hồ sơ
về mặt hành chính. Một vụ án cũng có thể bị kết thúc về mặt hành chính nếu người khiếu nại
không còn muốn theo đuổi vụ việc của họ.

RTD nói chung sẽ hoàn tất cuộc điều tra trong vòng sáu mươi (60) ngày kể từ ngày nhận
được đơn khiếu nại đã điền đầy đủ thông tin. Mặc dù RTD cố gắng giải quyết kịp thời các
khiếu nại, quy trình này sẽ khác nhau tùy thuộc vào mức độ phức tạp của khiếu nại, các
cá nhân liên quan và các yếu tố khác. Sau khi cuộc điều tra kết thúc, người khiếu nại sẽ
nhận được thư phản hồi cuối cùng thông báo kết quả khiếu nại.
Nếu người khiếu nại không đồng ý với quyết định của RTD, họ có thể yêu cầu xem xét
lại bằng cách gửi yêu cầu bằng văn bản đến Người quản lý Công bằng Chuyển tuyến
của RTD trong vòng bảy (7) ngày sau ngày RTD gửi thư, nêu rõ cơ sở cụ thể để xem xét
lại. Người quản lý Công bằng Chuyển tuyến sẽ thông báo cho người khiếu nại về quyết
định chấp nhận hoặc từ chối yêu cầu xem xét lại của họ trong vòng mười (10) ngày.
Trong trường hợp việc xem xét lại được chấp thuận, Người quản lý Công bằng Chuyển
tuyến sẽ gửi thư xác định cho người khiếu nại sau khi hoàn thành việc xem xét lại.

1. POLICY STATEMENT
The agency has a strong commitment to civil rights and transit equity. As a public agency
receiving federal financial assistance, and a place of public accommodation under federal law,
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Colorado law, Colorado Revised Statutes §24-34601, it is the agency's policy to ensure protected individuals and groups are entitled to enjoy
its programs, activities, facilities, and services on an equal basis and without discrimination.
Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) no person shall be excluded from
participation in, denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination under any agency
program, service or activity because of race, color, national origin (including limited English
proficiency). Title VI extends protection to individuals who experience discrimination,
including harassment, based on their actual or perceived: (i) shared ancestry or ethnic
characteristics; or (ii) citizenship or residency in a country with a dominant religion or distinct
religious identity.
Under Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S.) §24-34-601, a public accommodation is a place of
business that offers services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations open to
the public, including any public transportation facility or services. It is a discriminatory
practice to refuse, withhold from, or deny an individual or group the full and equal enjoyment
of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of
public accommodation based on race, color, national origin, creed, sex, sexual orientation,
gender identity, gender expression, marital status, disability, or ancestry.

2. PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to communicate the agency's commitment to compliance with
federal and state laws including Title VI and Colorado Revised Statutes §24-34-601, which
prohibit discrimination under programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance and
denial of full and equal enjoyment of the agency's services and transportation facilities.

federal requirements, examined existing policies and procedures
and reviewed similar plans at other U.S. transit agencies, including
LA Metro in Los Angeles and WMATA in Washington, D.C.

Acknowledgements

Effective and meaningful community engagement
requires continuous relationships with RTD’s customers,
partners and community groups. RTD acknowledges that
many individuals helped shape this public participation
plan. The agency expresses its most sincere appreciation
for the community’s input and support as it strives to
make lives better through connections.

RTD’s Public Participation Plan (PPP) is a requirement of Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B Title VI
Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
recipients. Overseen by the Transit Equity Office, the PPP is
required to be updated every three years along with the agency’s
Title VI Program Update. It ensures meaningful participation from
Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), historically
underserved and linguistically-diverse populations in the public
participation process. RTD’s PPP is designed to ensure accessible
and equitable participation in public engagement activities from all
individuals within its service area. A summary of federal and state
requirements can be found in the Appendix.

Citizen Advisory Committee

Subregional Service Councils

The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) provides direct
feedback to the RTD Board of Directors on public
transit and customer concerns. Areas of feedback
include operations, preventative maintenance projects,
new capital projects, customer communications and
state and local transportation legislation.

In 2022, RTD established Subregional Service Councils
(SSCs) to more directly engage with local stakeholders on
matters related to service planning and local transportation
issues. Based on transit travel sheds, the councils split the
RTD district into five separate subareas: Southwest,
Southeast, Northwest, Northeast and Boulder County.

The CAC has 17 seats comprised of residents and
businesspersons from around the district, each
appointed by the Board of Directors. Members serve
for a maximum of two, three-year terms, with
approximately one-third of the committee’s 17 seats up
for appointment each year. Members receive a monthly
pass to access RTD’s services in recognition of their
time commitment.

The councils provide a forum for dialogue about the
agency’s services and any related concerns or
opportunities. Meetings typically occur quarterly.
Membership includes local jurisdiction staff, transportation
management organizations, transit advocates and nonprofits that represent RTD’s customers. The agency
specifically included transit advocates and non-profit
organizations to have a more diverse representation on the
SSCs. This ensures that underserved populations have a
voice in the planning of RTD’s services.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCEDURES

1.E.1.b

The agency categorizes its public participation activities as
either community collaborations or agency-led. Community
collaborations are activities requested by community
organizations and stakeholder groups. Projects initiated and
managed in-house are agency-led. While the workflows used
and best practices deployed may differ, both public
engagement categories aim to increase awareness of RTD
services and initiatives.

Event Attendance Rubric and Minimum Basic
Thresholds for Community Collaborations

T
F
A
R

Many community-based organizations, local governments,
school districts and neighborhood organizations recognize
the value that RTD provides the Denver Metro Area.
Requests for RTD to participate in various activities, including
presentations, forums and community events, have steadily
increased over the past three years. The agency strives to
work alongside community partners to provide meaningful
engagement and education to community members,
especially those who are underserved.
Requests for RTD to attend or collaborate on a presentation,
project, or event come in many forms, including:
• Online “Request an Appearance” form
• Emails to the Board of Directors, agency staff or
CommunityEngagement@rtd-denver.com
• Phone calls to Customer Care or staff
• In-person connections at community events

D

Requests for Collaboration Workflows

The process for evaluating and executing community
collaboration requests varies based on the work unit.
Generally, the staff member who receives the requests
assesses the potential impact of the collaboration. If staff
choose to participate, they take ownership of the activity and
coordinate with the community partner to execute it. For
public events, they add the activity to RTD’s online
Community Calendar. All completed activities are shared in
the monthly Board of Directors Customer and Community
Connections Update.

Public Participation Plan | 2025 – 2028

To foster collaboration and communication internally, each work
unit that conducts public engagement tries to have a
representative join the monthly community engagement
standing meeting. During these meetings, team members share
upcoming activities for the month, seek advice, and request
additional support or resources.

Many of RTD’s community outreach activities are the result of an
invitation on behalf of a community of interest, such as assisted
living centers, places of worship, non-profits or schools. Given
the high demand for RTD’s presence in the communities it
serves, Community Engagement developed an Event Attendance
Rubric (EAR) to assess community requests for collaboration.
The EAR sets a standardized process and tool for evaluating
requests with a priority on supporting requests that increase the
agency’s ability to connect with historically underserved
populations. When received, the manager of community
engagement assigns the request to a community engagement
specialist to evaluate. If the specialist determines that
participation is warranted, they become the project owner and
are responsible for developing an outreach activity work plan
and collaborating with relevant internal and external
stakeholders to execute the activity.
If an event scores low on the EAR, the team member assigned
to the EAR review connects with the organizer to get more
information and to determine if modifications could increase the
value of RTD’s participating. If RTD ultimately declines to
participate, an organizer can request the Chief Communications
and Engagement Officer review the decision.

Organizations interested in partnering with RTD should ensure
their request for collaboration form is well-detailed to help staff
better evaluate the merits of the activity.

Future Process for Evaluating Requests
RTD intends to standardize the process for evaluating,
responding to and executing community requests for
collaboration. Doing so will ensure the consistent execution of
engagement programming across the agency. An
implementation timeline is included in the appendix.

1.E.1.b

PPP-Compliant Projects
Any number of RTD projects could require compliance with the agency’s plan. Project managers consider the impacts a
project may have, especially on historically underserved populations. Projects that initiate PPP compliance may include:
• Amenities, environmental, and infrastructure changes – Examples include new systems and structures that impact facility
access or customer behaviors; fare media or purchasing changes; and any project that requires National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA) review.
• Policy alternatives and fare changes – Proposed changes to policies or fares that impact customers.
• Public information and notification – Required and/or planned construction work that impacts customers and community
members, such as facility upgrades, long-term detours, and city or county construction projects that are around a RTD
bus stop, rail station, or park-n-ride facility.
• Service changes – Three times a year, RTD implements changes to its service that may include adjustments to service
spans or frequencies, route modifications and schedule timing adjustments.

T
F
A
R

Current Communications and Engagement Process for Agency-Led Projects

Many teams at RTD perform public engagement activities when executing an agency-led project. Each project manager is
responsible for assembling a project team comprised of internal stakeholders and subject matter experts (SMEs). The project
team, which may include staff from contracted firms, manages the project from conception to completion.
Currently, there is no standard process for executing agency-led public participation projects. Project managers and their
teams have discretion on what methods and strategies to employ based on the project’s specific goals. The Communications
and Engagement Department strongly encourages all teams conducting outreach to develop comprehensive communications
and engagement work plans. A template is available in the Appendix.
The project manager, or their designee, adds any public engagement activities to the RTD Community Calendar.
Once a public engagement activity concludes, they or their designee inputs information about the activity in the monthly
Board of Directors Customer and Community Connections Update.
The following metrics are captured and inputted into the tool:
• Name of event
• Host organization (if not RTD)
• Location
• Number of people engaged
• Topic(s) of discussion
• Work units who supported the activity

Current Process

Future Process and Best Practices

RTD provides CBOs with support, including informational
sessions, technical training and, in some instances,
financial assistance through grant programs such as the
Transit Assistance Grant (TAG) program. Co-creating
public participation activities with CBOs is central to this
approach, allowing for flexible and culturally relevant
engagement methods such as pop-up events,
participatory workshops and digital outreach.

To maintain transparency, RTD will explore establishing a
feedback loop, ensuring that CBOs and their communities
receive regular updates on how their input influences
decision-making. RTD would also like CBOs to play an
active role in evaluating the agency’s public participation
efforts, learning from each project to continuously improve
the process. In addition, RTD will explore opportunities to
implement formalized community-based programs.

The strategy also emphasizes the importance of digital
and virtual engagement, with RTD collaborating with
CBOs to host virtual webinars and social media
campaigns that reach a broader audience. CBOs are
provided with toolkits (usually bilingual but sometimes
with many languages, depending on the target
linguistically diverse population) to support sharing of
RTD information and public participation opportunities.

The Cultural and inclusive language access community
engagement services (CILACES) contract (2025–2027) will
expand efforts that focus on linguistically diverse and
underserved populations. The contract strengthens
community ties, promotes inclusivity and ensures equitable
participation in RTD programs and services.

1.E.1.b

Monitoring, Tracking, and Reporting

To ensure engagement leads to positive outcomes for historically underserved populations, RTD takes a structured approach that
includes feedback collection, impact measurement and continuous reporting. These efforts align with inclusive participation per
ADA and Title VI regulatory compliance requirements.

Engagement and service Feedback Principles
RTD prioritizes the collection of feedback regarding accessibility and other services through the following channels:

T
F
A
R

Actionable outcomes and service improvements: RTD
analyzes feedback to identify actionable outcomes that
drive service or policy changes benefiting all customers.
RTD uses feedback it receives to monitor
improvements in accessibility, service delivery, and
customer satisfaction for BIPOC, individuals with
disabilities, and linguistically diverse populations.
Ensuring intentional and focused engagement: RTD
strives to ensure that at least 30% of its annual
community engagement activities occur at events
serving and appealing to diverse racial, ethnic,
linguistically diverse communities and persons with
disabilities. These events provide platforms to engage
protected populations in culturally relevant settings.
Feedback: RTD gathers feedback through surveys,
feedback forms, community forums and other
platforms. RTD ensures the accessibility of these
channels including individuals from diverse racial,
ethnic, disability and linguistic backgrounds. This
includes designing feedback channels to collect input
from protected populations in inclusive ways.

D

Public Participation Plan | 2025 – 2028

Tracking participation: RTD tracks participation at public
forums, outreach activities and other engagement events
through voluntary post-event surveys. Collecting consensual
demographic data ensures diverse representation from all
protected groups, helping to identify service needs across racial,
ethnic, disability and linguistic populations. RTD ensures
accessibility through interpretation services, multilingual
materials, and accessible formats to ensure that no one is
excluded based on race, national origin or disability status.
Quality principles: RTD assesses the quality of feedback
collection by measuring the responsiveness and impact of the
actions taken based on community input. The quality of
feedback collection will be measured by:
• Response time
• Satisfaction with resolution
• Engagement effectiveness
• Feedback relevance

1.E.1.b

Monitoring, Tracking, and Reporting

Diversity and inclusivity: RTD strives to ensure that
its vendor and partner network includes BIPOCowned, women-owned, disability-focused and
linguistically diverse organizations. Vendor
relationships will reflect RTD’s commitment to nondiscrimination, equity and access.

T
F
A
R

Partnership tracking: RTD tracks partnerships with
disability advocacy organizations, ADA-compliant
service providers and other groups representing
protected populations, including linguistically diverse
organizations.

Impact Principles

Accessibility improvements: RTD tracks accessibility
improvements, such as the increase in the number of
accessible bus stops, infrastructure improvements
and modifications that support people from diverse
backgrounds.
Community satisfaction: RTD uses survey findings
and feedback to determine whether services have
become more accessible and if the needs of
underserved communities have been addressed.

Impact on underserved populations: RTD evaluates
the impact of its improvements on BIPOC, individuals
with disabilities and linguistically diverse
communities. RTD will track service modifications'
impact on reducing barriers and measure outreach
effectiveness to ensure these populations are heard
and supported in service delivery.

D

Future monitoring, tracking, and reporting

RTD recognizes that intentional and focused community
engagement, particularly for individuals with disabilities, BIPOC
communities, linguistically diverse communities and other
protected groups, is essential to the agency’s continuous
improvement. With the adoption of this PPP, RTD aims to
standardize tracking and reporting of engagement activities
across work units.
To strengthen this commitment, RTD will develop key
indicators and implement strategies to monitor engagement
and assess its impact. This will allow RTD to foster meaningful
interactions that inform enhancements in services and support
for all historically underserved populations.
Review the timeline in the Appendix for additional details.

Service equity and inclusivity: RTD evaluates whether
the improvements in accessibility benefit historically
underserved populations. These evaluations ensure
that changes lead to more inclusive and equitable
transportation options, emphasizing aspects where
underserved populations are most in need.

Guidelines and Considerations
Current Process

To ensure greater and more meaningful public participation
from RTD’s customers and stakeholders, especially those who
are historically underserved, the RTD team utilizes the
following guidelines and considerations when supporting or
leading public engagement activities:
Creating consistent communications and feedback
processes through the duration of a project

•

Ensuring that customers, community members and
stakeholders are given ample time to comment on projects

•

Establishing an advance-planning team made up of
internal SMEs to identify anticipated issues from various
stakeholder positions

•

Identifying a range of outreach activities that can inform
members of diverse communities of new or ongoing
projects and programs, or provide educational
opportunities to learn how to utilize RTD services

•

T
F
A
R

Public participation methods selected by the project manager and
team are adjusted to fit the project audience, goals and objectives.
These project teams also identify, design and implement ongoing
communication methods that engage RTD customers and increase
opportunities for expanded participation in the engagement
process. The project manager, with support from their team, may
develop a communications and engagement work plan based on
their respective work unit’s procedures.
Future Process
RTD will establish a standard operating procedure for performing
agency-led public participation.

Identifying public engagement goals and sharing those
goals with the community participants
•

For example, is the intent of the engagement to
collaborate, consult or inform the community
about a project?

•

Identifying the potential uses of online communication,
including websites, online advertisements and social
media, while ensuring that communication and
engagement work plans take into consideration individuals
and households who may have limited access to or
challenges using electronic devices

•

Measuring public engagement and adjusting
communications and engagement work plans by
monitoring performance metrics

•

Utilizing additional data resources beyond RTD’s Language
Access Plan (LAP) to advance the effectiveness of outreach
planning in diverse communities

Best Practices for Engaging Historically
Underserved Communities

•

Acknowledge past harms: Approach communities
with respect and humility

•

Advocate for institutional change: Ensure that
engagement efforts lead to agency decision-making
that benefit historically underserved communities

•

Prevent power imbalances: Follow principles like the
Jemez Principles for Democratic Organizing to create
fair and inclusive engagement

•

Share decision-making power: work with
communities to co-create solutions that address
their needs

Be transparent: demonstrate how public feedback
influences decisions

•

Follow up: Do not just collect input; share results,
next steps, and how input was used

•

Compensate community participation: Pay or
incentivize community members for their time
and participation

•

Use multiple outreach methods: Share information in
plain language and place it in community spaces like
schools, clinics, local stores and civic groups

•

Provide language assistance: Translate outreach
materials and offer interpretation during public
meetings in the languages spoken in the community

•

Ensure accessibility and inclusion: Host meetings in
ADA-compliant, transit-accessible locations, and
partner with individuals with disabilities and
disability-focused organizations

•

Provide accessible information: Develop materials in
alternative formats such as large print, don’t rely
solely on visual imagery and proactively hire a sign
language interpreter for public meetings, in addition
to other reasonable accommodations

Effective Communication with
Persons with Disabilities

Under the ADA, RTD furnishes appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to afford qualified individuals
with disabilities, including applicants, participants, companions and members of the public, an equal opportunity to
participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a RTD service, program or activity.

T
F
A
R

When a customer requests an auxiliary aid or accommodation, RTD gives primary consideration to the choice
expressed by the individual with the disability. RTD will honor the choice unless it can show:
• that another effective means of communication is available;
• that the use of the means chosen would result in a fundamental alteration in the service, program or activity; or
• that the use of the means chosen would result in undue financial burden.
RTD consults with the individual with a disability to identify an effective manner of communication that can be
achieved with the individual in the context of the agency's program, service or activity. RTD does not require an
individual with a disability to bring another individual to interpret for them.

RTD recognizes that no single means of communication will be suitable to engage all audience members. As a result,
RTD strives to meet communities where they are by attending community events, visiting gathering places and using
the social media platforms that communities use the most.

Meeting Location and Structure
RTD takes special consideration when deciding where to
host agency-led public engagement activities. The criteria
for choosing a venue depends on the type of activity
conducted; hosting an information table at a festival will
have different space needs than an open house with
various information stations, for example.

RTD chooses meeting venues based on several criteria
including the following:
• The ADA Office verifies that the venue is accessible.
• Venues are reachable by public transport and include
designated accessible parking spots, adequate curb
cuts and ramps and functioning elevators, if applicable
• The venue provides technology infrastructure for
presentations and live captioning, if necessary
• Facility hours of operations correspond with nearby
transit service hours to support the attendance of
transit-reliant communities

• Informing the public about available accommodations
through press releases, promotional materials and the
inclusion of local disability groups, TMA/Os and CBOs
on communication lists
• Placing easy-to-identify signage with directional
information strategically around the meeting location.
• Propping open doors to ensure easy access for

Outreach Guides

Future Training Opportunities

Starting in 2023, the Community Engagement work unit
began developing outreach guides for major RTD-led
projects. Developed in partnership with SMEs, the guides
include talking points, expectations for team members and
tools and resources that could be used when a customer or
community member had a question or concern that can not
be addressed in the moment. These documents are emailed
to team members prior to the activity. Physical copies are
also provided during public engagement activities.

In the future, RTD intends to establish a Community
Engagement 101 course. Co-created by team members
from Communications and Engagement, Civil Rights, and
Learning and Development, the course will be required for
any project manager who is facilitating an RTD led project
that includes public engagement.

HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVE POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS

1.E.1.b

Public transportation is vital for all communities,
but it is especially important to historically
underserved populations.

Although post-pandemic data is limited, studies suggest
these trends have remained consistent.7 Public transit
continues to serve as a lifeline for many to get to where they
live, work, and play — however, it is clearly most important
to historically underserved populations. This underscores the
need for transit agencies, like RTD, to actively engage these
populations in planning and decision-making to ensure
services meet their mobility needs.

According to the American Public Transportation Association
(APTA), and before the COVID-19 pandemic, most transit
riders were women (55%) and BIPOC (60%). Among these,
Black Americans were significantly overrepresented: while
they made up about 12% of the United States population,
they accounted for 24% of transit riders.1

T
F
A
R

Consequently, understanding where historically underserved
communities live in RTD’s service area helps the agency
create more inclusive and effective outreach efforts. By using
data from the U.S. Census and other sources, RTD can tailor
its approach to better connect with the communities who
need RTD the most. The next section offers a historically
underserved demographic profile of RTD’s service area that
guide its public engagement efforts.

In addition, many transit customers have limited incomes.
In the U.S., in 2017, 13% of households had incomes below
$15,000, but that number rose to 21% among households
that rely on public transit.2 Access to a car plays a major role
in transit use. Among riders, 54% said they had a vehicle
available to them, while 46% did not.3 Households
experiencing poverty are the least likely to own a car.
For example, while fewer than 2% of households earning
$50,000 or more lack a vehicle, about one-quarter of
households living below the poverty line don’t own one.4
Households led by BIPOC and women are also less likely to
have access to a car. Among African American/Black
households, 18% lack a vehicle, compared to 13% of Native
American households, 11% of Hispanic/Latino/a households,
and 6% of white households. 5

Why do people ride public transit?

D

For 44% of customers, it’s about convenience or other nonfinancial benefits. For 40%, it’s because they don’t have
another option due to financial constraints or lack of a
vehicle. Just under half of transit trips are work commutes,
while others are for shopping or dining (21%), recreation or
social activities (18%), school (6%), medical appointments
(2%) and other reasons (4%).6

POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS

1.E.1.b

Understanding the nature and distribution of BIPOC, low-income and disabled populations within RTD’s service area is
crucial to ensuring equitable and meaningful public engagement. This understanding enables RTD to design culturally
competent, inclusive, accessible and customized approaches to public participation, ensuring that the voices of historically
underserved populations are heard and valued in decision-making processes.
The RTD service area spans 2,345 square miles and is home to approximately 3.1 million people, according to the 2019–
2023 American Community Survey. Of this population, 38.1% identify as BIPOC, 14.1% live at or below 150% of the
federal poverty level, 7% are identified as LEP and 9.9% identify as people with disabilities. These demographic insights
underscore the importance of tailoring outreach to address the needs of these populations, ensuring that barriers to
participation are reduced or eliminated.

Demographic data, gathered from sources such as the U.S. Census, onboard ridership surveys and other reliable tools,
plays a foundational role in shaping RTD’s outreach strategies. These insights allow the agency to identify language needs,
address barriers to participation, and prioritize engagement with diverse groups, including those protected under Title VI.
Population distributions vary throughout the region.

Linguistically Diverse Communities

Languages in RTD’s Service Area

RTD serves communities that speak many different
languages. According to the U.S. Census Bureau,
approximately 206,254 people, or about 7% of the 3.1
million residents in the RTD service area, speak English “less
than very well.” This population is considered “limited English
proficient,” indicating that language can be a significant
barrier to them in accessing social services such as public
transportation. Further, approximately 422,320 people,
or 13.3% percent of the RTD service area population,
are foreign born; and 652,963 persons — over 19% of the
RTD service area population — speak a language other than
English at home. Those who speak a language other than
English at home may not be limited English proficient,
but they are also an important population to consider
and support in language access efforts.

66% of people with limited English proficiency are Spanish
speakers, followed by Vietnamese (4.82%), Chinese
(4.04%), Russian (3.98%) and Korean (2.1%). But that’s not
all — in fact, RTD has identified 21 languages that meet the
safe harbor definition, and these languages receive special
consideration in RTD’s language access planning efforts.

T
F
A
R

While these numbers indicate that linguistically diverse
persons are outnumbered by English-speaking individuals
in RTD’s service area, the agency has found that these
populations ride transit at a higher rate than the general
population. For instance, in a survey conducted in 2024-2025
with 578 respondents of varying English language ability,
RTD found that 70% of respondents ride RTD buses at least
once weekly, with 54% riding RTD buses daily or almost
daily. Meanwhile, 51% ride RTD trains at least once weekly,
with 27% riding RTD trains daily or almost daily. Thus, while
the overall numbers of the linguistically diverse population
are not large, these individuals disproportionately rely on
RTD services to get to where they need to go — illustrating
how important it is that RTD integrate language accessibility
into all its programs, services and activities. Language access
efforts not only support those who are limited English
proficient but also those who prefer to use their native
languages. RTD finds that it is important to provide these
individuals the opportunity to engage in RTD programs
and services in the language that they are most
comfortable using.

Public Participation Case Studies
The following section highlights recent public participation efforts for six major agency-led projects. They demonstrate RTD’s
commitment to engaging with all customers and community members.

Due to cost escalation and limited available funding, RTD
has been unable to complete the Northwest Rail Corridor (BLine) beyond its current terminus at Westminster Station.
RTD initiated the Northwest Rail Peak Service Study (NWR
PSS) to evaluate the possibility of completing the corridor
with a reduced level of service than that which was
envisioned in the original 2004 voter-approved FasTracks
plan. The intent of the Feasibility Study was to determine a
common set of facts related to design requirements, cost,
and ridership, among other considerations.

T
F
A
R

Since previous studies had already determined the corridor
alignment and station locations along with the associated
environmental impacts, community engagement for this
effort was somewhat limited. However, over the two-year
study period, in addition to the establishment of a Study
Advisory Team, which met monthly, the study team held a
variety of outreach activities, such as local corridor-wide
open houses, email communications, and a website which
included self-guided online meetings. All physical and print
materials were available in English and Spanish. Pop-up
events at farmers markets, ice skating rinks, and libraries
ensured that RTD could collect feedback from diverse
stakeholder communities.

Public Participation Case Studies

In response to customer feedback that RTD fares were too
expensive and difficult to understand, RTD initiated a
Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis to holistically
reexamine the fare system, taking into consideration equity,
affordability and simplicity. RTD took a bottom-up, customercentric approach to the study.

T
F
A
R

In addition to the somewhat standard methods of outreach,
such as community meetings, customer surveys and a website,
the team also established a series of feedback panels and
community partner focus groups. The three feedback panels,
Equity Feedback Panel, Pass Program Feedback Panel and
Jurisdiction Feedback Panel, considered customer and
community input and how RTD could address commonalities and
trade-offs among different perspectives and fulfill customer and
community needs. For the partner focus groups, RTD contracted
with six community-based organizations each serving as a
community partner to help engage traditionally underserved
populations through focus groups, participation in surveys and
public meetings and other outreach efforts.
RTD’s Public Relations work unit, with support from the project
team, gave interviews to various news outlets in both English
and Spanish to provide updates on the project and encourage
participation. Digital and print materials, including fact sheets,
were translated into more than 20 different languages spoken
by customers within RTD’s service area. The project team
attended several large-scale community festivals that were wellattended by diverse customer population. Events included the
Aurora Global Fest, Denver’s Cinco de Mayo Festival and Sun
Valley Night Market and the Northglenn Food Truck Carnival.

D

Each activity yielded significant customer, community and
stakeholder feedback. RTD then collected, summarized and used
the feedback to influence the development of the recommended
fare structure. After more than a year of engagement with
customers and stakeholders, the recommended fare changes
were passed by the RTD Board of Directors on July 25, 2023. A
2024 customer survey indicated that 73.2% of customers
believed that RTD’s fares were affordable, a significant increase
from 52.2% in 2022.

Public Participation Case Studies

As part of its simplified fare structure, RTD eliminated fares for youth ages nineteen and younger starting August 1,
2023. Named Zero Fare for Youth (ZFY), RTD implemented various tactics for sharing this information with potential
transit users. The broad approaches taken to educate families and young adults about transit spanned across all

Public Participation Case Studies

Three times a year (January, May, and August), RTD reviews,
proposes and implements changes to its service schedules and routes.
These changes improve on-time performance, account for changes in
ridership, advance the implementation of long-range plans and support
scheduled maintenance projects.

During and following the coronavirus pandemic, public meetings
moved from in-person at RTD’s downtown headquarters to an online
format. Public meetings were advertised on bus and rail vehicles, on
social media and in news releases.

In 2024, Communications and Engagement partnered with Service
Development to overhaul its traditional public feedback process,
including by:
• Categorizing changes by route adjustments, service increases,
service reductions, seasonal adjustments and schedule timing to
help customers better identify the impact of proposed changes
• Distributing a bilingual service change toolkit to TMA/Os
• Organizing the project webpage into easy-to-search tiles
• Providing an online customer survey tool
• Creating a reoccurring “Ask a Service Planner” virtual event where
customers can chat individually with staff
• Identifying key stakeholders within impacted service areas and
inviting them to attend the public meetings, complete the survey
or host RTD staff for a presentation
• Advertising the service changes on public information displays
(PIDs) at RTD stations
• Presenting to local registered neighborhood organizations
• Sharing service change information with CBOs to encourage
historically underserved populations to provide feedback

Public Participation Case Studies

Launched as part of RTD’s 2024 fare changes, the Transit Assistance Grant (TAG) program is designed to help organizations
serving clients with immediate transit needs. Immediate needs refer to the needs of individuals in crisis such as domestic
violence, victims seeking shelter to safe and support environment, or other individuals in situations that threaten their personal
safety on a short-term basis rather than prolonged or chronic basis. The agency budgets $1 million dollars annually for the
program, which provide qualified non-profit and government partners up to $50,000 per calendar year via 10-ride ticket books.
RTD’s Market Development team provides full-service support for non-profits interested in the program.

T
F
A
R

To educate potential community partners of the TAG program, the Market Development work unit hosted four webinars and
one in-person meeting and collaborated with CBOs to raise awareness of the application process. A dedicated webpage
included frequently asked questions, selection criteria, a downloadable presentation of the application process. Market
Development received 211 applications in total. To ensure as many non-profits qualified, staff collaborated with non-profits who
had incomplete applications to correct issues. Ultimately 181 non-profits received grant awards. Throughout the year, the team
also published four periodic reports that included collateral necessary for non-profit outreach.
Project resources are available on the Transit Assistance Grant webpage.

Public Participation Case Studies

Reimagine RTD was a comprehensive planning effort to develop a short- to mid-term plan for RTD services and a longer-term
plan that established agency priorities for the future. There was a robust public engagement effort undertaken that included
targeted outreach efforts for key local stakeholder groups and the public. An Advisory Committee and Technical Working Group
were established to vet and review technical and policy considerations. These groups were comprised of stakeholder groups
from across the service area and incorporated a range of perspectives on regional transportation. RTD used the following tools:
• Employee forums – forums that were held to introduce the plan and identify key issues from employees
• Formal focus groups – focus groups were held for both customers and community stakeholders to get input on differing
perspectives on community desires for future RTD service
• Online surveys – surveys to solicit feedback on specific recommendations and priorities
• Project website – information hub that included interactive maps and graphics
• Public meetings – meetings were held in both English and Spanish to allow for direct input from key customers
• Statistically valid survey – statistically significant survey to gather input on regional public transit needs and RTD’s role in
supporting those needs
• Targeted listening sessions – sessions with key customer groups used to in place of in-person meetings that were not
possible because of the pandemic
• Telephone town halls – meetings held in all Board districts where Reimagine RTD was one of multiple items on the agenda
• RTD Customer Panel – panel of diverse set of RTD customers used to gain direct feedback on the draft SOP
• Speaker’s bureau – presentations that provided updates to local business groups, civic groups, and key agency partners by
RTD staff and consultants

FTA C 4702.1B is the primary source of federal guidance for complying with Title VI.
Public participation is listed as one of FTA’s three Title VI Program objectives (Chap. II-1),
specifically: “Promote full and fair participation in public transportation decision-making
without regard to race, color, or national origin.” Additionally, the FTA Circular 4702.1B
requires that recipients submit a “public participation plan that includes an outreach plan
to engage minority and limited English proficient populations, as well as a summary of
outreach efforts made since the last Title VI Program submission.” Chap. III-5, Promoting
Inclusive Public Participation instructs recipients to integrate the contents of Title VI,
Executive Order 13166, and the DOT LEP guidance into the development of the public
participation plan. Chap. III-5 also includes a list of effective practices for promoting
public participation. In addition to the public participation plan, every Title VI Program is
required to include a language access plan that ensures that limited English proficient
(LEP) persons have meaningful access to the services, programs and activities provided
by the recipient.
U.S. DOT Order 5610.2(a) outlines how the Department of Transportation incorporates
environmental justice into its programs, policies, and activities to prevent
disproportionately high and adverse effects on minority and low-income populations. The
FTA requires transit agencies to follow the Environmental Justice Circular 4703.1 (which
aligns with the principles in the DOT Order), particularly in integrating environmental
justice and preventing harmful impacts (specifically, Section 5, Integration with Existing
Operations and Section 7, Preventing Disproportionately High and Adverse Effects).
The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Public Involvement Process requires federal
agencies to provide opportunities for public review and comment on their environmental
assessments.
FTA Circular 4703.1 provides guidance to recipients of FTA funding on how to incorporate

U.S. Department of Transportation,
Policy Guidance Concerning
Recipients’ Responsibilities to Limited
English Proficient (LEP) Persons

U.S. DOT’s LEP guidance provides detailed information concerning the responsibilities of
recipients of federal transportation funding to provide language assistance to persons with
limited English proficiency. Section V, How Does a Recipient Determine the Extent of Its
Obligation to Provide LEP Services, provides detailed
guidance related to the development of the required Four Factor Analysis component of
the Language Access Plan. Section V, (2) The Frequency with Which LEP Individuals Come
in Contact with the Program, Activity, or Service states that recipients should consider
whether appropriate outreach to LEP persons could increase the frequency of contact with
LEP language groups. Section VI, Selecting Language Assistance Services, B. Written
Language Services (Translation) addresses the role of providing written translation in
ensuring meaningful access to public participation activities.

Definitions
Limited English Proficiency or Limited English Proficient (LEP) – People with limited English proficiency
(LEP) are persons whose primary language is not English and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak,
or understand English. In demographic data, the U.S. Census Bureau defines an LEP person as an individual
who is age five or older and speaks English less than "very well." RTD refers to persons with limited English
proficiency as linguistically diverse persons where possible.
Meaningful Access – Language assistance that results in accurate, timely and effective communication at no
cost to linguistically diverse people. Meaningful access denotes access that is not unreasonably restricted,
delayed, or inferior as compared to access to programs or activities provided to persons proficient in English.
Reasonable Steps – Steps taken, or language assistance services provided, to ensure effective communication
with linguistically diverse people (e.g., interpretation services).
Recipient – Any public or private entity that receives federal financial assistance from the FTA, whether directly
from FTA or indirectly through a primary recipient. This term includes subrecipients, direct recipients, designated
recipients, and primary recipients.
Safe Harbor (Language) – The safe harbor provision, as interpreted by the U.S. Department of Justice,
explains when agencies are considered compliant with rules for translating written materials for diverse language
groups. It states that agencies meet the requirements if vital documents are translated for each eligible language
group, as determined by the Four Factor Analysis. To qualify, the language group must make up at least 5% or
1,000 people (whichever is smaller) of the population being served.
Vital Document – Paper or electronic material that is critical for accessing RTD’s services, programs, and
activities or contains information about procedures and processes required by law. Classification of a document
as “vital” depends upon the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and the
consequence to the linguistically diverse person if the information in question is not provided accurately or in a
timely manner.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
RTD is committed to ensuring equitable access to its services for all individuals regardless of their background
or ability — including English proficiency. This Language Access Plan (LAP) provides a framework for meeting
the needs of limited English proficient persons (hereafter referred to as “linguistically diverse” persons) in the
agency’s service area, ensuring compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and aligning with its
mission to provide inclusive, accessible, and equitable transit services. By proactively addressing language
barriers, RTD enhances mobility and improves the customer experience for its diverse ridership. This
commitment supports RTD’s strategic priorities — Community Value and Customer Excellence — as well as its
strategic initiatives: a Welcoming Transit Environment and Customer and Community Connections.
RTD’s LAP is structured off of the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) requirements in Circular 4702.1B, “Title
VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients.” It begins with a Four Factor Analysis, which assesses
the language assistance needs of local communities and provides the data RTD needs to make informed decisions
on providing language assistance. Data includes the number of linguistically diverse people in the agency’s
service areas as well as the most common languages they speak, the frequency with which linguistically diverse
persons interact with RTD frontline staff, the suggestions staff have to overcome language barriers with
customers, the nature and importance of RTD’s services to the linguistically diverse population, and, finally, the
costs to pursue various language assistance measures.
In Factor 1, using the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS),
Colorado Department of Education, and Colorado Health Authority data, the Transit Equity Office (TEO) found
that approximately 200,812 individuals speak English "less than very well," representing 6.88% of the
population. Spanish speakers account for 65.4% of the linguistically diverse population (per the ACS) followed
by Vietnamese and Chinese (4.73% and 3.97% of the linguistically diverse population, respectively). Overall,
the Factor 1 analysis identified 19 safe harbor languages,1 which include (in alphabetical order) Amharic, Arabic,
Burmese, Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese), French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Karen, Korean, Nepali,
Persian (including Dari and Farsi), Russian, Somali, Tagalog, Tigrinya, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese.
In Factor 2, TEO conducted a survey with frontline employees who interact with customers. The survey received
662 responses. It found that RTD’s customer-facing staff are experiencing a notable increase in interactions with
linguistically diverse customers, with daily interactions rising from 26% in 2021 to 40% in the most recent
survey. Most of these interactions (86%) occur in person on buses, trains, or at stations, with a smaller portion
happening over the phone (16%) or online (4%). It also found that staff employ a variety of techniques to
bridge language barriers, commonly using translation apps (47%), body language or communicating in simplified
English (44%), and customer interpretation (30%). However, challenges persist — 70% of staff find it difficult
to communicate with customers who speak little or no English, a significant increase from 57% in 2021.
Additionally, only 46% feel equipped to handle these interactions, while 54% report feeling somewhat or
completely unprepared. To improve language accessibility, staff offered a variety of recommendations, including
that RTD provide translation devices, offer language training (especially in Spanish), expand translated materials
and signage, implement direct access to telephonic interpretation services, and hire more multilingual employees
to better serve the agency’s diverse ridership.

In Factor 3, TEO conducted a survey with linguistically diverse people, receiving 578 responses. Findings
indicate that respondents face significant language barriers. The majority (73%) spoke Spanish, followed by
Chinese (18%), with 23 languages represented overall. Most respondents indicated high usage of RTD services,
with 70% frequently using RTD buses, while train usage was lower (41%), and demand-response services were
rarely used. Importantly, the survey respondents were largely transit reliant, where 61% of respondents reported
not having access to a household vehicle. While 51% say they use RTD as much as needed, nearly a third (29%)
report that language barriers prevent them from using transit more often, and many struggle to navigate key
RTD services. For example, over 70% do not know how to apply for discounts, report a safety concern, or make
a customer service complaint. Survey participants provided detailed suggestions on how RTD can enhance
language accessibility, including hiring more bilingual bus operators and frontline employees, providing staff with
real-time translation tools, improving translation and signage, introducing Spanish audio announcements,
enhancing the accessibility of digital tools (e.g., the RTD website and Next Ride app), and partnering with
community-based organizations to better engage linguistically diverse customers. Beyond language access,
respondents highlighted three key concerns: affordability, security, and cleanliness.
For Factor 3, TEO also hosted a focus group with the Interpreter Network from the Spring Institute for
Intercultural Learning in September 2022. The focus group corroborated the findings of the aforementioned
survey, especially reinforcing the need for improved digital communications, in-system language assistance
resources (e.g., improved wayfinding, audio announcements, signage), and community partnerships.
In Factor 4, TEO reported agency expenditures on language assistance activities from June 1, 2022 to March
31, 2025 across the Paratransit Services Division; the Communications and Engagement, Transit Police, and
Human Resources departments; the Board Office; the Risk Management Division; and the Civil Rights Division.
During this period, RTD and its contractors spent an estimated $309,882 on language assistance services — a
78% increase from the $176,318 reported for the June 2019-May 2022 time period. The largest expense was
the cost of contracts with TEO’s multicultural outreach partners, estimated at $101,442.
Based on the data gathered in the Four Factor Analysis, the final portion of the plan is the Language Access
Measures section, which outlines specific activities and commitments — both new and ongoing — that RTD
will pursue to improve language assistance in the coming years. Activities that the agency will carry over from
prior years include, but are not limited to, providing telephonic interpretation (as well as bilingual English-Spanish
information specialists) via Customer Care, providing the RTD website and Next Ride app in RTD’s top five safe
harbor languages, developing resources for frontline staff that they have identified may be useful in bridging
language barriers with customers, and delivering the Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training to
frontline staff. New activities identified for the 2025 to 2028 period include exploring providing translation devices
in RTD fixed-route buses, making email and text service alerts available in Spanish, ensuring language assistance
measures are integrated into RTD’s upcoming all-in-one mobile ticketing app, piloting Spanish audio
announcements in fixed-route buses, and establishing a translation review process for the translation tool on
the RTD website (among the 23 total new tasks).
In conclusion, the 2025-2028 LAP builds upon the framework and tasks of RTD’s 2022-2025 LAP, incorporates
updated data on Denver’s language needs, and sets forth specific, measurable, and data-driven actions to
enhance the accessibility of RTD’s transit services and programs.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
As the Denver metropolitan region’s public transportation provider, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
committed to serving residents, customers, and visitors regardless of race, color, or national origin. This includes
making reasonable accommodations and removing barriers for individuals in protected classes, including
linguistically diverse individuals. These individuals, language can hinder access to RTD’s services and programs,
compliance with responsibilities like payment or safety measures, or awareness of their civil rights while riding.
Providing language assistance is not only a federal requirement but also a reflection of RTD’s mission, vision,
and values to ensure accessible public transportation for all.

Legal Basis for Language Access Requirements
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) guidance require federally funded
agencies, including RTD, to take reasonable steps to ensure linguistically diverse individuals have meaningful
access to their programs and services.
At the core of these requirements is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq.), which
states: “No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity
receiving federal financial assistance.” While Title VI does not explicitly list language as a protected category,
the 1974 Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols (414 U.S. 563) interpreted Title VI regulations to prohibit actions
that disproportionately impact linguistically diverse individuals, as such effects constitute national origin
discrimination.
To ensure compliance, USDOT issued its “Policy Guidance Concerning Recipients' Responsibilities to Limited
English Proficient Persons” (USDOT LEP Guidance) on December 14, 2005. Further guidance came from the FTA,
which published Circular 4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients,” on October 1,
2012. Chapter III, Part 9 of this Circular directs FTA recipients, including RTD, to:
1. Conduct a Four Factor Analysis;
2. Develop a Language Access Plan (LAP); and
3. Provide appropriate language assistance.
By meeting these requirements, RTD and other transit agencies work to reduce language barriers and ensure
equitable access to their programs and services.

RTD’s Dedication to Language Access

Language access is not just about meeting federal compliance requirements; however, it is fundamental to RTD’s
mission of making lives better through connections and ensuring equitable mobility for all. Providing meaningful
access to linguistically diverse communities aligns directly with RTD’s strategic priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence. By removing language barriers, RTD strengthens its role as a trusted community partner,
enhances the customer experience, and ensures that all customers — regardless of their preferred language —
can navigate the transit system with confidence. Language access also supports RTD’s Welcoming Transit
Environment strategic initiative by fostering a more inclusive and secure transit experience, where all customers
feel respected and informed. Additionally, it reinforces Customer and Community Connections by deepening
engagement with the diverse populations RTD serves. Ultimately, language access is not just an obligation — it
is a commitment to equity, dignity, and accessibility, ensuring that no one’s mobility options are limited by
language. Through this work, RTD continues to create a transit system that is truly welcoming and inclusive for
everyone.

Four Factor Analysis
Background
A key component of the USDOT’s and FTA’s framework for creating a Language Access Plan, RTD’s Four Factor
Analysis helps the agency assess the language needs of local communities and determine appropriate language
assistance measures. The Analysis evaluates the following four factors:
1. Factor 1: The number or proportion of linguistically diverse persons eligible to be served or likely to be
encountered by an RTD program, activity, or service. This involves analyzing demographic data, such as
U.S. Census Bureau data, to identify significant populations who speak little or no English
2. Factor 2: The frequency with which linguistically diverse persons interact with RTD programs, activities,
or services. Higher frequency of contact increases the need for language assistance services to
accommodate linguistically diverse persons effectively

1.E.1.b

3. Factor 3: The nature and importance of programs, activities or services provided by RTD to the
linguistically diverse population. Services critical to basic well-being, such as transportation, typically
warrant greater attention to language accessibility
4. Factor 4: The resources available to RTD and overall cost to provide language assistance. This factor
balances the need for language services with the organization’s ability to allocate funding and resources
effectively
RTD’s Transit Equity Office within the Civil Rights Division updated the agency’s Four Factor Analysis in the fall
and winter of 2024 through 2025 to inform this updated Language Access Plan. The following sections outline
the approach to and results of each of the Four Factor analyses.

Factor 1: Number or Proportion of Linguistically Diverse Persons
within RTD Service Area
Methodology

To complete Factor 1, RTD must assess the number or proportion of linguistically diverse individuals2 who are
eligible for RTD services or may interact with the agency. The U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey
(ACS) serves as a key source for identifying safe harbor languages in RTD’s service area.3 To supplement these
estimates, the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data is analyzed to identify additional language groups as
it allows for a more detailed examination of language subcategories, especially African languages (e.g., Amharic
and Somali) and Asian languages (e.g., Cambodian and Laotian).
RTD’s Transit Equity Office collaborated with Nelson\Nygaard Consulting Associates to compile and analyze this
data. The ACS data, released on December 12, 2024, was sourced from the 2018–2023 ACS 5-Year Estimates
Table C16001, while the PUMS data was obtained from Table B1600, following its release on January 23, 2025.
Both datasets were used to determine the proportion and languages spoken of LEP individuals within census
tracts and Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) across RTD’s service area.
In addition to data from the ACS and PUMS, the Factor 1 analysis incorporates the most recent Student Language
of Origin data from the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) for the 2024 school year. This dataset provides
information on languages spoken at home and enrollment in English as a Second Language (ESL) services for
students from kindergarten through high school. It is assumed that if a child speaks a language other than
English, their parents or guardians likely speak the same language at home, particularly if the student receives
ESL services. While this dataset does not capture non-school-aged populations, it serves as a valuable
complement to Census data. School districts included in the analysis were those with at least one school located
within a zip code covered by RTD’s service area.
Finally, TEO sourced additional supplementary data from the Colorado Health Authority on languages spoken at
participating Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) clinics. The
dataset covered January 2023 to December 2024 and includes information from clinics across Jefferson, Boulder,
2

RTD recognizes the importance of balancing technical accuracy with inclusive language throughout Factor 1. In this
analysis, the term "LEP" refers to individuals who speak another language at home and speak English less than “very well.”
This standardized definition, used by the U.S. Census Bureau, serves as the foundation for the data in this report. To align
with federal guidelines and ensure clarity, RTD will retain the term "LEP" in data-driven sections. However, RTD is committed
to using more inclusive language that reflects the diversity of the communities it serves. Therefore, while maps, tables, and
some written portions in Factor 1 will use the term “LEP” for accuracy, this report aims to use "linguistically diverse" in all
other contextual narratives to describe these communities.
3
RTD estimated service area boundaries used the ACS 5-Year Estimates at the census tract level. RTD analyzed all census
tracts required to include all 8 counties where RTD has services: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas,
Jefferson, and Weld counties.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan

This comprehensive approach ensures that multiple data sources are leveraged to provide an accurate
assessment of language needs within RTD’s service area.

Key Findings

The RTD service area, home to approximately 2.92 million people, includes 200,812 individuals who speak
English "less than very well," representing 6.88% of the population. Spanish remains the most widely spoken
language at home after English, accounting for 65.4% of the linguistically diverse population (per the ACS).
Vietnamese and Chinese are the second- and third-most spoken languages, making up 4.73% and 3.97% of the
linguistically diverse population, respectively. By combining ACS, PUMS, CDE, and WIC data and confirming them
with the Transit Equity Office’s qualitative experiences engaging with the community, the Factor 1 analysis
identifies 19 safe harbor languages, which include (in alphabetical order) Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese
(including Mandarin and Cantonese), French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Karen, Korean, Nepali, Persian (including
Dari and Farsi), Russian, Somali, Tagalog, Tigrinya, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese.
The general distribution of LEP individuals around the RTD service area remain similar to the 2022-2025 Factor
1, with the highest concentrations of LEP populations in north and northeast Denver, east Lakewood/west
Denver, and throughout Aurora. However, south Boulder saw a significant increase in all LEP populations since
the last Factor 1 analysis, and Aurora continues to grow its LEP population as well.
Taken together, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic diversity and dispersion
within RTD’s service area, informing targeted language access initiatives. By continuously assessing demographic
trends, RTD can implement targeted engagement strategies to ensure the language accessibility of its services
and programs.

Results
American Community Survey (ACS)4

According to the ACS, approximately 2.92 million people5 live in the RTD service area, including an estimated
200,812 individuals who speak English "less than very well” (representing 6.88% of the population). This
percentage is roughly consistent with the 2022-2025 Factor 1 analysis.6

Home for the Population 5 Years or Older (Census Tracts)
5
The total population whose language ability is determinable — here, 2.92 million people — is lower than the estimate of
total population that may be noted in other RTD documentation. This is due to the inability of the Census to identify the
spoken languages or English proficiency for everyone estimated to reside in a particular census tract. Linguistically diverse
people may also belong to one or several “hard-to-count” populations, leaving them undercounted.
6
Please note that comparison between actual population numbers should not be drawn between this Factor 1 analysis and
the previous analysis from the 2022-2025 Language Access Plan. Previously, the population sample included the total
populations of all eight counties where RTD has service (i.e., Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas,
Jefferson, and Weld Counties) whereas this analysis used the address method of population distribution to estimate LEP
data for the population within RTD's service area — thus making it a smaller sample size.

and Denver counties as well as most of the City and County of Broomfield and portions of Adams, Douglas,
Weld, and Arapahoe counties. TEO obtained this data through the Colorado WIC Data Dashboard by selecting
the last two full calendar years and isolating the relevant counties. The dataset provides additional insights into
linguistic diversity within RTD’s service area.

The figures below show the linguistically diverse populations by language that meet the LEP safe harbor language
threshold, defined as 5% of the service area population or 1,000 individuals likely to be served by RTD, whichever
is lower. Spanish remains the most widely spoken language at home after English, accounting for 65.4% of the
linguistically diverse population. Vietnamese and Chinese remain the second- and third-most spoken languages,
making up 4.73% and 3.97% of the linguistically diverse population, respectively. These rankings exclude
broader language categories such as “other and unspecified languages,” “other Indo-European languages,” and
“other Asian/Pacific Island languages.”
In all, ACS data allows us to identify nine initial languages that meet the safe harbor threshold: Arabic, Chinese,
French, German, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.

The following maps illustrate the distribution of linguistically diverse individuals throughout RTD’s service area
based on the most recent American Community Survey data. The first map displays the overall population of
linguistically diverse individuals, while subsequent maps highlight the three most common languages spoken:
Spanish, Vietnamese, and Chinese.7 As a whole, the general distribution of LEP individuals around the RTD
service area remain similar to the 2022-2025 Factor 1, with the highest concentrations of LEP individuals in north
and northeast Denver, east Lakewood/west Denver, and throughout Aurora. However, south Boulder saw a
significant increase in all LEP populations since the last Factor 1 analysis, and Aurora continues to grow its LEP
population as well. Spanish speakers remain predominantly concentrated around the City and County of Denver
urban core, with the greatest populations in east Denver (e.g., Montbello, Green Valley Ranch), north Aurora,
east Lakewood/west Denver, and north of Denver headed to Thornton (e.g., Federal Heights, Welby, Derby,
Elyria-Swansea). Similarly, the Vietnamese-speaking population has increased in Northglenn and Erie as well as
select census tracts between Aurora and Centennial; generally, it appears that Vietnamese speakers have
become more concentrated in specific areas like East Lakewood compared to a more general dispersion in the
last Factor 1 analysis. Meanwhile, Chinese-speaking populations tend to be more prevalent in south Denver
suburban areas such as Cherry Creek, Dove Valley, Dakota Ridge, and Highlands Ranch, with an increased
concentration of this population in select census tracts in this area. Boulder remains an important concentration
in addition to an increased concentration of LEP Chinese speakers in Louisville/Superior.

To identify additional language groups prevalent in the RTD service area beyond those captured by the ACS,
RTD’s Transit Equity Office examined Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data. PUMS supplements ACS
estimates by providing more granular insights into grouped or general language categories. As a result, in
addition to Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese being
recognized as safe harbor languages per ACS data, PUMS data identifies Persian (including Dari and Farsi),
Japanese, and Hindi as safe harbor languages while highlighting additional languages that may warrant
consideration, such as Amharic, Nepali, Hindi, and Ukrainian (among others), as shown in Figure 1.7.

language other than English, it serves as a valuable complement to Census (both ACS and PUMS) data in
assessing linguistic diversity and, paired with Colorado Health Authority and qualitative data from RTD’s outreach
efforts, can help RTD finalize its list of safe harbor languages and inform language assistance measures.
Data were compiled from the following school districts serving students within the RTD district boundaries.10

While CDE data generally aligns with ACS and PUMS data regarding the most commonly spoken languages
among linguistically diverse populations generally, it shows a higher percentage of Spanish speakers in the
school-age population as a percentage of the total school-age population that speak another language at home.
Specifically, Spanish accounts for 75.4% of the school-aged population that speak a language other than English
at home in the CDE dataset compared to 65.4% in ACS and 65.91% in PUMS for the general LEP population.
Additionally, Arabic replaces Vietnamese as the second-most spoken language, pushing Vietnamese to third.
Further, compared to the 2022-2025 Factor 1 analysis, both Russian and Amharic surpass Chinese to become
the fourth- and fifth-most spoken language at home in the school-age population.
These languages are the same as those identified in the previous Factor 1 analysis, albeit in a slightly different
order of prevalence. This CDE data reinforces ACS and PUMS data regarding the presence of Amharic and Nepali
in local communities, confirming the need to add them to RTD’s list of safe harbor languages.

WIC data confirms previous findings that Amharic, Burmese, Karen, Nepali, Somali, and Swahili may warrant
inclusion in language assistance measures and addition to RTD’s safe harbor language list. Additionally, WIC
data identified Tigrinya and Karenni as spoken languages that did not explicitly appear in other datasets but may
have been grouped in all-inclusive “other” categories.

Discussion

Factor 1 of RTD’s Four Factor Analysis provides key insights into the languages that should be prioritized for
language assistance and the geographic areas where these services are most needed. Using data from the ACS
and PUMS, the analysis initially identifies 12 distinct languages that meet the safe harbor threshold. These
include Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Persian (including Dari and Farsi), Russian,
Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.
CDE and WIC data then allow RTD to differentiate specific languages from the ACS and PUMS datasets that
group languages together by region. From these datasets, the Transit Equity Office has determined that Amharic,
Burmese, Karen, Nepali, Somali, and Swahili should also be added to the safe harbor language list. Notably, WIC
data highlights the presence of two other languages not captured in preceding datasets: Tigrinya and Karenni.
Given the prevalence of Tigrinya in the Transit Equity Office’s outreach efforts, Tigrinya has also been added to
the list. However, TEO decided to exclude Karenni at this time given no exposure to this language through its
work to date.
In conclusion, 19 languages serve as a foundational guide for RTD’s language assistance efforts. The designated
languages, listed in alphabetical order, are Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese (incl. Mandarin and Cantonese),
French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Karen, Korean, Nepali, Persian (including Dari and Farsi), Russian, Somali,
Tagalog, Tigrinya, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese. This list is reflective of the languages the agency regularly
interacts with when engaging with local communities, especially newcomer populations.
This is a reduction in the 21 safe harbor languages identified in the previous Factor 1 analysis, with the loss of
Hmong, Khmer, Laotian, Telugu and Thai from the list paired with the new additions of Burmese, Karen, and
Tigrinya.

These safe harbor languages can be organized into groups based on the average of all four data sources in
Factor 1 to ensure a targeted and data-driven approach to language accessibility. It is essential to note that
identification of the linguistically diverse populations by way of producing the safe harbor list is merely a guide
for providing language assistance. Importantly, these data do not necessarily represent the language groups
that are actually using RTD services. Moreover, language assistance activities should remain flexible to
incorporate other languages that may not be listed as requested by the community or required by any given

Taken together, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the linguistic diversity within RTD’s
service area, informing targeted language access initiatives. Ensuring language accessibility for Spanish,
Vietnamese, and Chinese speakers, who continue to represent the largest linguistically diverse populations,
remains a top priority. Since the last Factor 1 update, RTD has significantly expanded bilingual English/Spanish
translations of key documents, signage, service and policy updates, and materials for community meetings.
While these efforts have improved language access, further improvements are needed both for Spanish speakers
and other less common language groups. For example, recent increases in Arabic-, Russian-, and Persianspeaking residents may reflect broader global migration trends driven by conflicts in Ukraine, Palestine,
Afghanistan, and Syria. These shifts underscore the importance of a flexible, data-informed approach to
language assistance. Finally, Factor 1 data allow RTD to strategically allocate language assistance resources
based on geographic needs. Transit routes and services in areas with high concentrations of linguistically diverse
populations, particularly throughout Aurora, southeast Boulder, north Denver into Thornton, and east
Lakewood/west Denver should be prioritized for expanded language access initiatives. By continuously assessing
demographic trends and implementing targeted engagement strategies, RTD can ensure that all customers,
regardless of the language they speak, have equitable access to transit services.

Methodology

To complete Factor 2, the Transit Equity Office (TEO) conducted surveys with employees who are likely to
interact with customers from October 14 through November 8, 2024. TEO crafted the survey based on the Factor
2 survey in the agency’s 2022-2025 Four Factor Analysis, though this newest version omitted questions deemed
24

Packet Pg. 345

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
The survey received 662 responses (excluding staff who reported never interacting with customers), with 225
responses to the online version and 437 responses to the paper version. This represents a 15.6% increase in
responses from the 614 responses received to the 2021 version of this survey. Please note that total response
rates may vary question-to-question, as respondents may have skipped questions. Additionally, percentages
may not add up to 100% due to rounding or if a question allowed respondents to select multiple answers to a
question.

Key Findings
Customer-facing staff at RTD increasingly interact with linguistically diverse customers, with daily interactions
rising significantly since 2021. Currently, 40% of respondents report daily interactions and 26% report neardaily interactions, compared to 26% and 21%, respectively, in 2021. Most of these interactions are in person,
with 86% occurring on buses, trains, and at stations or stops. A smaller percentage, 16%, occur over the phone;
4%, online. Most inquiries from linguistically diverse customers pertain to trip-related topics, including directions,
fares, and schedules. Notably, conversations about language assistance services have more than doubled since
2021, increasing from 6% to 13%.
Staff employ various methods to communicate with linguistically diverse customers. The most common methods
include using translation apps on their phones (47%), relying on body language or simplified English (44%),
asking other customers to interpret (30%), speaking directly in the customer’s language (29%), and seeking
assistance from coworkers (26%). Among staff who reported speaking another language, Spanish is the most
common (53%), followed by Amharic (13%), French (7%), Arabic (7%), and Oromo (4%) Less staff use
resources like Customer Care (20%), informational signage (16%), the RTD website (8%), or translated
brochures (5%). Perceptions on the effectiveness of these methods varies.
Despite these efforts, communication challenges remain prevalent. Most staff find it difficult to interact with
customers who speak little or no English, with 18% describing it as extremely difficult and 52% as somewhat
difficult — a statistically significant increase from 2021, when 10% found it extremely difficult and 47% found it
somewhat difficult.16 These challenges may stem from an actual lack of resources or unfamiliarity with available
resources, as only 46% of staff feel somewhat or very equipped to communicate with linguistically diverse
customers, while 21% feel not at all equipped and 33% feel only somewhat equipped.
To address these barriers, staff recommend RTD make several improvements, including providing translation
devices, offering language classes (particularly in Spanish), and increasing the availability of translated materials
and signage. Some also suggest implementing direct access to telephonic interpretation services and hiring more
multilingual employees to better serve RTD's diverse customer base.

Unsurprisingly, these staff interact with customers frequently. 67% report interacting with customers daily, while
another 15% interact with customers almost daily; 4%, once weekly; 3%, once monthly; and 7%, rarely (Figure

When interacting with linguistically diverse customers, respondents note a range of topics that the customers
ask questions about. Figure 2.7 illustrates that the most common topic is directions and trip planning (76%),

But if there is a language barrier present, how do respondents communicate with customers in these
conversations? Forty-seven percent (47%) use a translation app on their phones, such as Google Translate,
Deepl or Microsoft Translator (Figure 2.8). Forty-four percent (44%) use body language, such as hand gestures,
or simple words to try to communicate in English. Thirty percent (30%) ask other RTD customers to interpret
for them, and another 29% speak in the customers language with them given their multilingual skills.

The methods respondents use to interact with customers do not necessarily correspond to how effective they
believe that communication method to be; respondents’ opinions on effectiveness varies, as shown in Figure
2.9. For instance, 82% of respondents perceive the use of translation apps to be somewhat effective or effective
methods to communicate, which aligns with the high reported use of this communication method (46%).18
Conversely, where many respondents note the use of body language or simple words to try to communicate in
English, only 60% report that this is a somewhat effective or effective communication method. On the other
hand, fewer respondents ask RTD customers or multilingual coworkers to interpret (30% and 26%, respectively),
but employees generally find these people-forward approaches quite effective (70% somewhat effective or
effective and 64% somewhat effective or effective, respectively).
Respondents tend to have the strongest perceptions of ineffectiveness towards the translation widget on the
website, providing translated brochures and calling a telephonic interpreter directly (63%, 57%, and 52% not
effective or somewhat ineffective, respectively).

When asked what materials, services, or tools RTD could provide to make them feel more equipped and to
improve communication with customers who speak little or no English, many respondents (56%) would like
access to translation devices, where 43% would like access to language classes and 41% would like more
translated materials and signage (Figure 2.12). This is a similar result to the 2021 survey, in which translated
materials, a “translation tool” and language training classes were the most popular write-in responses. When
asked which language classes they would like, 69% of respondents indicate Spanish; 5%, Chinese; 4%,

In response to an open-ended question inviting additional suggestions, the following themes arose and expand
upon the responses offered in the multiple-choice question above. The quotations were taken directly from the
survey responses and have not been revised.
Technology and Policy
Many respondents emphasize the importance of technological solutions for addressing language barriers. While
many speak to the installation of translation devices on buses and at stations/stops, there were some who also
feel that RTD policy (specifically, Rule 18: Cell Phone and Other Mobile Electronic Device Usage in the RTD
Trailblazer) prevents them from adequately providing language assistance via their personal phones.
Importantly, though, this rule exists mainly due to safety concerns and finds its roots in FTA and Federal Motor
Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations prohibiting or severely restricting cell phone use while driving
transit vehicles.
“Allow operators access to their phones so we can use the programs and abilities provide by our
personal devices to access better communication between operators and riders. Having to grab
your powered off device out of your bag then stepping out of the cab only to have to power it
on, wait for it to power up and communicate with the network before you can even access the
tools we need for that single interaction. Now multiply that by however many times you need to
do that in a shift. This isn't even counting the time you need to power it off again and store it in
your bag once more.”

“Communication device/translation”

“Add Google translate to all ticket kiosks”

“Communication Technology in General”
Enhance and Expand Audio Announcements
Several respondents note how audio technology could be used to improve communications, both on vehicles
and at stops or stations. They suggest improving English audio announcements and adding Spanish audio
announcements on both bus and rail vehicles — with consideration for other languages.
“I think translated announcements of bus bridges or service delays at CR stops would be
extremely beneficial to many of our customers. Many of our customers only speak Spanish, so I
think that translating audio and visual announcements into Spanish would be a good and
reasonable starting point to providing equitable and accessible service to our customers.”
“Better signs near tracks. Audio announcements all the time. for example, "the Airport train is
located on track one. Light Rail trains are located on Chestnut and 17th.”
“Audio device in bus”

“Have announcements in different languages”

“Automated announcements in more

“Incorporate into existing Radio on busses”

Translate and Modify Signage
Respondents suggest that signage could better support multilingual communication by including translations and
incorporating non-written methods, such as the use of colors and images, into signage design to assist
linguistically diverse customers.
“Add language options to some signage. Or a separate sign for multilingual at union station.
Signage in multiple languages”
“More translated/picture-based signage, improved communications about availability of language
assistance.”
“Signage in multiple languages”
“Color coding”
“More specific information on digital boards”

“Signs need to be hung more convenient

Hire Bilingual/Multilingual Staff and Compensate Them for Language Use
Respondents emphasize the importance of RTD intentionally hiring bilingual/multilingual staff and recommend
compensating employees for using their language skills in their work as an ongoing recognition of their value
(e.g., by way of a pay differential).
“Pay employees who speak another language more. This may help those who currently are not
bilingual to learn another language.”
“Hire more bilingual/multilingual customer service employees who speak other languages
commonly used in our RTD districts such as: Arabic, Persian, Mandarin, etc. Many employers
have employees from those countries, they could help us in other RTD departments.”
“More effectively recognize and utilize those bilingual employees already working for RTD”
“Hire more bilingual/multilingual employees”

“RTD needs more people fluent in Amharic”

Provide Staff with Language Assistance Tools
In addition to educational resources, respondents would like to have other assets on hand to help overcome
language barriers, such as sheets with translated phrases.
“a cheat sheet with common phrases like
‘Where are you going?’”

“Booklet with related info”

“Maybe a cheat sheet laminated card or
something?”
Support Staff Language Learning
Respondents express interest in learning additional languages if classes and other educational resources were
more readily available. Respondents request Spanish classes the most, with American Sign Language equally
popular.
“Provide language classes that teach very specific words and phrases related to transit and
giving people directions.”
“Teaching RTD employees and personnel the transit basics in various languages.”
“Learning a 2nd language would help or having a communication board”

“Teach ASL & Spanish”

The survey results highlight a notable increase in daily interactions between customer-facing RTD staff and
linguistically diverse customers since 2021, emphasizing the growing importance of effective communication
strategies in an increasingly diverse community. These interactions predominantly occur in person, often on
buses, trains, and at stations or stops, underscoring the need for staff to have pragmatic, real-time language
assistance tools that meet their needs as well as the needs of customers. Despite efforts by staff to bridge
language barriers through translation apps, body language and multilingual skills, many still report challenges in
effectively communicating with customers who speak little or no English.
The significant rise in conversations about language assistance services suggests increased awareness or
demand among customers for these resources. However, less than half of staff feel adequately equipped to
handle such interactions, reflecting a need for targeted interventions. This is especially notable given that the
Civil Rights Division released its first Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training to frontline staff in 2022,
which outlines strategies for communication across language barriers as well as the various tools available to do
so. Recommendations from staff, such as access to translation devices, language classes (with a focus on
Spanish), and additional multilingual signage and materials, offer actionable pathways to enhance
communication. Moreover, the call for hiring more multilingual employees and compensating them for their skills
highlights the value placed on linguistic diversity within the workforce.
Addressing these needs will not only improve the customer experience for linguistically diverse individuals but
also support RTD staff in delivering equitable and efficient transit services and programs. Implementing these
solutions should be a priority as RTD moves forward with its Language Access Plan from 2025 to 2028.

Factor 3: Nature and Importance of RTD Services to Linguistically
Diverse Persons
To complete Factor 3, the Transit Equity Office (TEO) conducted two different studies with linguistically diverse
people: a survey and a focus group. Doing so allowed TEO to gather both quantitative and qualitative data to
explore the nature and importance of RTD services to this population.
Both studies are described in full below.

Language Access Survey
Methodology

TEO conducted surveys with linguistically diverse people from December 30, 2024 through February 2, 2025.20
Survey languages included Amharic, Arabic, Burmese, Simplified Chinese, English, Farsi, French, Karen, Korean,
Nepali, Russian, Spanish, Swahili, and Vietnamese. TEO distributed the surveys in both paper and digital formats
directly to community members as well as to community-based organizations who shared them with the
populations they serve, using a communications toolkit that TEO produced.21 These community-based
organizations included (but were not limited to) the African Community Center, Aurora Asian Pacific Community
Partnership, Aurora Mental Health, Boulder County Mobility for All, Caring for Denver, Colorado Vietnamese

Though altering questions complicates some statistical comparisons between this survey and its predecessor, the
questions in their updated form will allow for improved year-over-year comparisons moving forward.

The toolkit included 11” by 17” posters, 8.5” by 11” and half-page flyers, social media graphics, blurbs, paper copies of
the surveys, the survey drawing rules, and talking points.

Colorado. Additionally, TEO published half-page advertisements of the surveys in several multicultural
publications — specifically, Colorado Chinese News, El Comercio de Colorado, and the Weekly Focus22.

The survey received 578 responses (133 paper and 445 digital), excluding people who:
•
•
•

Did not meet the threshold for limited English proficiency,23
Only wrote English as their preferred language, or
Reported living outside of the state of Colorado

This represents a 180% increase from the 206 responses received in the 2021 version of this survey. The
increased participation is likely due to improved distribution thanks to strengthened relationships with community
partners and contracting with community-based organizations to support survey outreach.
Note that total response rates may vary question-to-question, as respondents may have skipped questions.
Additionally, percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding or if a question allowed respondents to
select multiple answers to a question.

Key Findings

•

•

•

•

Respondent Characteristics: Compared to the 2021 survey, the 2024-2025 respondents are more likely
to have significant language barriers, with fewer indicating they can read, write, or understand English
well. The majority (73%) speak Spanish, followed by Chinese (18%), with 23 languages represented
overall. Additionally, most respondents identify as Hispanic or Latine (71%) and female (63%).
Transit Usage and Barriers: Most respondents (70%) frequently use RTD buses, while train usage is
lower (41%), and demand-response services are rarely used. Sixty-one percent (61%) of respondents
report not having access to a household vehicle, indicating high reliance on transit for mobility. While
51% say they use RTD as much as needed, nearly a third (29%) report that language barriers prevent
them from using transit more often. Other concerns include limited service availability and infrequent
schedules.
Access to RTD Information: Respondents primarily obtain transit information through the RTD website
(29%), signage (22%), and the Next Ride app (16%). However, many struggle to navigate key RTD
services. For example, over 70% do not know how to apply for discounts, report a safety concern, or
make a customer service complaint.
Importance of Language Assistance: Respondents overwhelmingly support expanded language
assistance services, with 86-89% rating options such as translated signage and multilingual staff as very
or extremely useful. They also find it crucial to receive information in their preferred language on topics
such as trip planning, fare discounts, and safety reporting.

Survey participants provided detailed suggestions on how RTD can enhance language accessibility, including:
•

•

•

Increase bilingual staff and provide better language assistance tools
o Hiring more bilingual bus operators and frontline employees would improve communication and
customer confidence
o Providing staff with real-time translation tools, such as an app, could enhance service
Improve translations and signage
o Address inaccuracies in existing translated materials
o Expand multilingual signage at stations, on buses, and within trains
o Introduce Spanish audio announcements and QR codes for instant translations
Enhance digital and community engagement efforts
o Expand language options on RTD’s website, apps, and text alert systems
o Utilize video content and multimedia formats for clearer communication
o Partner with community-based organizations to better engage linguistically diverse customers

Beyond language access, respondents raised three key issues: affordability, security, and cleanliness. Some
noted that fares are expensive for them, security concerns on buses and trains, and the need for cleaner transit
vehicles and facilities. These concerns highlight that improving accessibility for linguistically diverse communities
goes beyond language — it requires addressing broader challenges that affect all customers. In sum, the survey
results reinforce the importance of RTD’s language access initiatives while underscoring areas for further
improvement. By expanding bilingual staffing, improving translated materials, enhancing digital tools, and
addressing broader transit concerns, RTD could better serve its diverse ridership and advance equitable mobility
for all.

Respondent Characteristics
All survey respondents are considered limited English proficient, indicating at least one area of English proficiency
— whether speaking, reading, writing, or understanding — that they do not do “very well,” as illustrated in
Figure 3.2. Compared to the 2021 survey, respondents to the 2024-2025 survey are far more likely to indicate
that they do not speak, read, write, or understand English at all (in 2021, 13%, 14%, and 14%, respectively for
reading, writing, and understanding) or not well (in 2021, 27%, 34%, and 26%, respectively).24
In fact, most respondents to the 2021 survey indicated they could read, write, or understand English well or
very well — contrary to the 2024-2025 survey, where very few do so (less than 20% across all categories).
These results illustrate that the Transit Equity Office improved its ability to distribute the survey to an audience
where language barriers are truly significant.

As shown in Figure 3.3, the languages that survey respondents speak vary widely, expanding beyond the survey
translation offerings that TEO made available. The most commonly preferred language is Spanish (73%) followed
by Chinese (18%). English was included in the results only if a respondent selected English in addition to another
preferred language.

Transit Usage, Barriers to Mobility, and Mobility Behaviors
Respondents more frequently use RTD buses than trains or RTD’s demand-response services, FlexRide and
Access-a-Ride/Access-on-Demand.25 Specifically, 70% ride a bus once weekly or more, where 41% ride the train
once weekly or more. The vast majority of respondents rarely or never use FlexRide and Access-a-Ride/Accesson-Demand (76% and 89%, respectively). This is likely because most survey respondents’ may not be traveling
in FlexRide service areas nor be eligible to use Access-a-Ride services.

To improve access to RTD information, the survey asked respondents how useful they think certain language
assistance services would be (Figure 3.14). Respondents overwhelmingly think that all language assistance
services listed, from translated signage to having more multilingual staff, are very useful or extremely useful
(86-89%).

Similarly, respondents find it very important or extremely important to get information in their preferred
language(s) across RTD topic areas included in the survey, from directions and trip planning to how to apply for
discounts — though “how to attend RTD events” and “how to apply for an RTD job” were slightly less important
informational topic areas to translate (Figure 3.15). “How to access language assistance” is, perhaps
unsurprisingly, the most “extremely important” (48%) information to translate in respondents’ languages.

Suggestions for Improving Language Accessibility
The end of the language access survey provided respondents the opportunity to write suggestions to improve
the language accessibility of RTD’s services and programs. The responses highlight several key areas where RTD
can improve language accessibility.
Bilingual Staff, Customer Service, and In-Person Engagement
A recurring theme in the feedback is the need for more bilingual English/Spanish staff, particularly bus operators
and frontline employees. Many respondents expressed frustration with the lack of Spanish-speaking operators
and suggested that hiring bilingual operators would significantly improve communication and the overall transit
experience. Some also recommended providing RTD staff with translation apps or other real-time interpretation
tools to assist linguistically diverse people.

Customer service and respectful treatment from staff were also key themes in the feedback. Some customers
reported feeling dismissed or disrespected by operators who appear impatient with customers who don’t speak

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
In addition to improving communication and customer service, respondents — especially Chinese-speaking
respondents — expressed a desire for greater outreach to immigrant and non-English-speaking communities.
Some, particularly elderly customers, expressed appreciation for the translations that RTD has already
implemented but wished for more direct engagement. Suggestions included hosting informational sessions and
even organizing cultural events to build stronger connections with diverse groups.
Enhanced Communication Tools: Improved Quality Control, Expanded Digital and Multimedia Communication
Another recurring concern is the quality and availability of translated information. Several respondents noted
that existing Spanish translations, particularly those that appear to be machine-generated, can be inaccurate or
difficult to understand. Customers suggested improving the clarity and accuracy of translated materials, including
signs, announcements, and printed guides, and making them more visible at stations, on buses, and inside
trains. Some respondents also recommended recording audio announcements in different languages and placing
QR codes on signage that passengers can scan to access information in their preferred language.
Some participants emphasized the importance of digital and multimedia communication. A customer suggested
that RTD create more video content to explain transit services in different languages. Others highlighted the
need for better-translated content on RTD’s website and mobile applications to ensure that linguistically diverse
people can easily access essential transit information. Social media was also mentioned as a potential tool for
outreach, with a respondent recommending that RTD collaborate with community leaders to disseminate
important updates in multiple languages.
Finally, technology and real-time communication tools emerged as another area for improvement. Some
customers suggested that RTD integrate more languages into its mobile applications and ticketing systems to
make transit more user-friendly. Others emphasized the importance of using digital tools, such as text message
alerts in multiple languages, to provide updates and important information.

ethnicity. This suggests a need to bolster cultural competency, general customer service, and effective crosscultural communications skills to foster a more welcoming and inclusive transit environment.

Discussion

One of the most striking findings is that compared to the 2021 survey, the 2024-2025 respondents reported
much lower levels of English proficiency. This shift suggests that RTD’s outreach efforts have been more effective
in reaching individuals who face substantial language barriers by building more relationships with communitybased organizations that serve newcomers and linguistically diverse people as well as contracting with
community partners to support this work. Many of these respondents likely have limited access to Englishlanguage education, work in industries where English proficiency is not required, or are recent newcomers who
have yet to develop fluency. As a result, their transit experience is heavily impacted by the availability — or lack
— of language assistance services. The fact that a majority of respondents lack access to a household vehicle
(61%) further underscores their reliance on transit and the urgency of improving accessibility for this population.
53

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Figure 3.18. Write-in Suggestions on Improving RTD’s Services (Other)

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 374

1.E.1.b

Language barriers were a major reason why nearly one-third (29%) of respondents do not use RTD services
more frequently. This indicates that even though RTD provides language assistance, these efforts may not be
sufficient to overcome the challenges faced by non-English-speaking customers — or, alternatively, that they
are not sufficiently reaching their intended audience. Many respondents reported difficulties in understanding
RTD schedules, planning trips, and accessing fare discounts — tasks that are essential for effective transit use.
For RTD’s MyRide app, respondents overwhelmingly report not knowing how to use it; this is possibly due to the
app being available only in English or, separately, due to technological barriers.
On the other hand, 32% of respondents say they know how to find information on RTD’s fares, compared to
44% in the 2021 survey who reported being unfamiliar with RTD’s fare structure. This improvement may be due
to the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis conducted from 2022 to 2024, which led to the implementation
of lower, simpler fares in 2024.
Beyond language-related barriers, respondents also expressed concerns about affordability, security, and
cleanliness. Many of these customers are likely from low-income backgrounds, given the overlap between
immigration and poverty, making fare costs a major concern. Security issues discourage some from using RTD
services more frequently, especially if they feel unsafe due to crime or a lack of visible enforcement. That 72%
of respondents do not know how to report a safety or security incident to RTD is particularly alarming given the
recent expansion of both the RTD Transit Police Department and the robust marketing campaign for RTD’s
Transit Watch, the primary channel for submitting security concerns.27 Cleanliness concerns, particularly related
to buses and stations, may also influence perceptions of RTD’s services and impact overall satisfaction.
To address these challenges, RTD can build on existing initiatives while expanding efforts to improve language
accessibility, customer experience, and overall service quality.
1. Expand outreach to linguistically diverse communities
o Improve communications on RTD services, programs, and language assistance with community
partners who serve linguistically diverse people, especially immigrants, asylum seekers, and
refugees
o Attend in-person, hyper-local community meetings, such as town halls, to meet these
communities where they are
o Explore alternative communications channels, such as joining new social media groups and
making more video-based content
2. Enhance language assistance services
o Bilingual staffing: Expand the number of bilingual bus operators and frontline employees to help
bridge communication gaps and improve customer confidence
o Improved translations: Ensure greater accuracy in translated materials, especially key service
information, to help customers better understand their transit options
o Multilingual digital tools: Increase language options on the RTD website, mobile apps, and text
alert systems to provide real-time access to critical information
3. Address service barriers
o Better communication of fare assistance programs: Many respondents may not be aware of
available discounts due to language barriers. Clearer, multilingual outreach could improve access
to cost-saving programs
o More frequent and reliable service: While service availability was not the top concern, improving
frequency and reliability — particularly in underserved areas — could encourage greater transit
use

It is important to keep in mind, however, that historically underserved communities — especially those that are
predominantly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color — may not associate law enforcement with improved security given
past harms disproportionately committed against these populations by armed sworn officers.

54

4. Improve customer experience
o Increased security presence: Enhance safety at stations and on vehicles through more security
personnel or surveillance measures to address concerns about crime and customer safety
o Cleanliness initiatives: Examine maintenance and cleaning efforts at stations and on vehicles to
improve perceptions of RTD services and contribute to a more welcoming transit environment
By implementing these solutions, RTD can make its services more accessible, welcoming, and effective for
linguistically diverse communities. Language accessibility is not just about translating materials — it is about
ensuring that all customers, regardless of their English proficiency, can confidently navigate and rely on public
transit. Addressing affordability, security, and cleanliness concerns alongside language accessibility will help RTD
create a transit system that truly serves all members of the community equitably.

Focus Group: Interpreter Network by Spring Institute

RTD’s Transit Equity Office conducted a focus group in collaboration with the Interpreter Network by the Spring
Institute for Intercultural Learning. The purpose of the focus group was to enrich TEO’s qualitative understanding
of the mobility needs and concerns specific to linguistically diverse immigrant and refugee communities as well
as to inform RTD’s language access efforts.

Methodology

The focus group occurred on September 15, 2022, from 5:30 to 7 p.m. online using Microsoft Teams. Participants
registered for the focus group on a dedicated Teams registration page, and they received a calendar meeting
invite and several reminder emails in the days leading up to the September 15. Participants were all employed
as interpreters within the Interpreter Network by Spring Institute at the time of the focus group. While 23
interpreters registered for the focus group, 15 attended (a retention rate of 65%).28 Focus group participants,
as well as the language(s) they speak in addition to English, are as illustrated in Figure 3.19.

Key Findings

1. Low transit usage due to structural barriers
a. Most participants rely on personal vehicles for work due to time constraints and the need for
flexibility
b. Transit is seen as too time-consuming, expensive, and inconvenient for multi-stop trips
c. Real-time service information is difficult to access, making transit less reliable
2. Language barriers limit access
a. Language difficulties create anxiety, particularly for new customers
b. Challenges include understanding schedules, remembering stops, and communicating with
operators
c. The application process for discount programs is inaccessible to many non-English speakers
3. Need for improved digital communications
a. RTD’s apps are not user-friendly and lack integrated fare purchasing and trip planning
b. Multilingual service alerts and instructional videos are essential for better access
c. Social media engagement could enhance outreach to diverse communities
4. Demand for in-person language assistance
a. Electronic wayfinding maps, translated materials, and multilingual announcements at stations and
on vehicles are needed
b. Location-based language assistance should reflect community demographics
5. Importance of community partnerships
a. Collaboration with resettlement agencies, libraries, and senior centers can improve awareness of
transit resources
b. Ride-alongs and community-led training sessions could enhance confidence in using public transit
6. Operator communication and cultural training
a. Translation devices, community ambassadors, and better promotion of RTD’s interpretation
services were suggested
b. Cross-cultural training for operators would help improve interactions with non-English-speaking
customers

Results

The focus group explored three different themes and included one activity, in this order:
•
•
•
•

Theme A: Use of the RTD System and Potential Barriers
Activity: Give Input on a Language Access Icon
Theme B: Communication Preferences and Access to Information
Theme C: Exploring Language Assistance Options (Operators)

Each theme contained two or three questions each, with RTD staff asking additional probing questions as
needed.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The focus group with interpreters from the Spring Institute provided valuable insights into the mobility needs,
barriers, and communication challenges faced by linguistically diverse communities and reinforces the takeaways
from the language access survey detailed above. The key findings are as follows:

Theme A: Use of the RTD System and Potential Barriers
Use of the RTD System
Overall, focus group participants did not use RTD services frequently and chose to drive personal vehicles for
most trips, especially for work. Many stated that this was due to the nature of their positions as interpreters,
which requires them to travel to numerous locations in the same day quickly. Participants noted that when they

do use public transportation, they typically make trips downtown (e.g., Union Station), between college
campuses, or to the airport. Reasons given for using public transportation included avoiding parking, traffic, or
driving in inclement weather; having the ability to use what would have been driving time for other purposes
instead; and good connectivity at Denver Union Station to many areas of interest. Some participants mentioned
that they were more frequent RTD customers in the past, particularly when they lacked access to a vehicle or
had a consistent destination, such as a college campus.

It’s too time-consuming; one participant felt that it sometimes takes 3-4 times longer to make a trip via
bus or train than it does to drive
It’s not advantageous for trip-chaining (i.e., making multiple stops in one trip)
It’s expensive, especially for people using Local passes who must ride frequently
It is not frequent enough; lack of frequency also contributes to the time-consuming nature of transit
Real-time information is not accessible, especially for detours, cancellations, or other unscheduled
service changes; further, participants did not know how to get RTD information generally
The Denver metro is too sprawled to allow for adequate transit access to destinations

Participants highlighted that language barriers can cause significant fear and intimidation when using RTD’s
public transit system. One participant shared that her elderly mother, who does not speak English, was reluctant
to change her route after moving because she was anxious about navigating a new one. Others noted that the
first few experiences using transit can be particularly overwhelming for linguistically diverse people. Other
barriers to language access included:
•
•
•
•

Purchasing discount passes and submitting the necessary paperwork as part of the application process
Having to learn how to read a schedule (due to the lack of frequency)
Remembering where to get on and off the bus due to a lack of information and visual indicators on
approaching stops’ names
Telling a bus operator that the customer needs to get off

Activity: Give Input on a Language Access Icon
After Theme A, the focus group participated in an activity to provide input on the icon they preferred RTD to
use to brand its language assistance materials. Figure 3.20 illustrates the options that were provided:

In the discussion that followed, participants largely shared their preference for Option 1 and Option 5. Though
they seemed less familiar with an icon like Option 1, participants felt that it clearly illustrated elements of
discussion and language; they also felt that it was humanizing and welcoming. On the other hand, participants
also liked Option 5 because it is very similar to other language access icons that exist across smartphone apps
and the internet. Because of this, they felt that linguistically diverse individuals would be most able to identify it
and understand its meaning. Participants also commended Options 2 and Options 6 for their simplicity.29
Theme B: Communication Preferences and Access to Information
Focus group participants felt there is a lack of sufficient information for them and the linguistically diverse
community to use public transportation more comfortably. This included:
•
•
•
•
•

Accessible schedules and route information
Payment options, ensuring that people know about accepted forms of payment, and payment rules
(e.g., providing exact change on buses)
Improved smartphone app for trip planning that is integrated into the payment app
Better and more widespread marketing of digital tools such as RTD’s smartphone apps so that people
know about them
More Spanish translations of key information

Ideas to Improve Communication and Language Access
Focus group participants provided many interesting ideas for improving RTD’s communication generally while
also offering recommendations for expanding language access. The ideas can be organized into the following
three primary categories.

Category 1: Improve Digital Communications

Focus group participants provided extensive feedback on RTD’s digital presence, emphasizing the need for
improved smartphone apps, multilingual service alerts, videos, and social media engagement.

Enhancing RTD’s Smartphone Apps

Participants highlighted that immigrant and refugee families, like many other populations, rely heavily on
smartphones for transportation needs. They suggested several improvements to RTD’s apps, particularly RTD
MyRide, which currently functions as a gateway to the website rather than a fully independent mobile app. Key
recommendations included:
•
•
•
•

Developing a standalone app that does not require linking to RTD’s website
Creating an all-in-one platform integrating fare purchasing, trip planning, and general transit information.
Participants found the separation between trip planning and fare payment confusing, making it difficult
to determine trip costs
Adding a chat feature to connect customers with Customer Care for real-time assistance.
Providing translated versions of RTD’s apps and increasing marketing efforts to raise awareness about
their availability

Multilingual Service Alerts and Visual Content

Participants stressed the importance of receiving service updates in their preferred languages. They
recommended offering translated service alerts or, at minimum, an option for translation.

Following the focus group, RTD proceeded with variants of Options 1 and 2 for its language access branding, which can
be seen throughout some materials in Appendix E.

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan

Leveraging Social Media for Multilingual Engagement

Participants encouraged RTD to better utilize social media to connect with multilingual and multicultural
communities. They emphasized that social media is cost-effective and widely accessible, particularly among
Latine, immigrant, and refugee families who frequently use Facebook and Facebook Messenger to stay
connected.
Additional recommendations included:
•
•

Creating a social media space where people can ask public transit-related questions, with responses from
RTD, community members, or interpreters
Expanding RTD’s presence on platforms popular with diverse communities to enhance accessibility and
engagement

Category 2: Expand In-Person Language Assistance Resources

While many suggestions focused on digital communication, participants emphasized the need for alternative
methods to accommodate differences in technological access or competence, or situations where a phone is
unavailable.
They identified two key areas where in-person communication should be enhanced: bus stops and vehicles.
Specific recommendations included:
•
•
•
•
•

Electronic wayfinding maps at stops and stations with translation options
Translated informational materials (flyers, brochures, and other key documents) available at stops and
stations, covering topics like how to use RTD services and access language assistance
Multilingual auditory announcements at rail stations and on buses
Comprehensive bus system maps similar to rail maps, integrating both modes to illustrate connectivity,
with translations available
Location-specific language assistance, ensuring translated signage, announcements, and documents
reflect the primary languages spoken in each area, based on U.S. Census or other available data

Category 3: Secure Strategic Community Partners

Focus group participants emphasized the need for strategic engagement with community partners to improve
language access. Many expressed concerns that RTD does not adequately reach immigrant, refugee, and senior
populations.30
A key solution is partnering with organizations that already serve these communities, such as senior centers,
case managers, resettlement agencies, public libraries, and human service offices, to provide public
transportation trainings (e.g., ride-alongs) and information sessions. Specifically, organizations like the
International Rescue Committee, Spring Institute, and resettlement agencies were recommended as ideal
partners since they engage with immigrants and refugees early in their resettlement process and have
established educational programs that could integrate RTD-related information.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Recognizing that some customers may be illiterate, participants also urged RTD to produce more multilingual
instructional videos on how to use the transit system. They noted that even small details — such as where to sit
on the bus or how to request a stop — can cause anxiety for new customers. These videos should be developed
in collaboration with immigrant and refugee community members to ensure they address real concerns.

30

According to a participant, seniors tend to live with others of the same language group. Additionally, data shows that
seniors are less comfortable with and use technology less than other age groups, though this is changing over time.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
Theme C: Exploring Language Assistance Options (Operators)
The focus group concluded with a discussion on improving communication between operators and non-Englishspeaking customers. Suggested solutions included:
•
•
•

Installing built-in translation devices on buses
Hiring community ambassadors to assist customers
Better promoting RTD’s free interpretation and translation services through signage and the RTD app

Additionally, a participant highlighted the importance of cross-cultural training for operators to help them
navigate language barriers and cultural differences. This aligned with RTD’s Serving Non-English-Speaking
Customers training, which RTD first implemented in 2022 and includes a cultural competence component.

Discussion

The focus group findings reinforce the challenges identified in RTD’s language access survey, particularly
regarding the accessibility of transit information and services for linguistically diverse customers. The focus group
echoed the challenge of applying for discount programs identified in the survey, highlighting difficulties
navigating fare structures and eligibility requirements due to language barriers.
Additionally, while the survey showed that 68% of respondents knew how to find fare information, the focus
group revealed deeper concerns about real-time service updates and trip-planning tools. Participants emphasized
the need for an improved RTD app that integrates trip planning and fare payment while offering multilingual
support — an issue that aligns with previous survey findings about technological barriers. Fortunately, since this
focus group took place, RTD greatly expanded the translation tools on both its website and Next Ride app, with
more languages to come shortly. Further, RTD’s plan to produce a mobile app that integrates fare payment and
trip planning tools into one interface is in alignment with the focus group participants’ recommendations.
The discussion also underscores the importance of language assistance resources apart from a mobile phone or
computer. While digital tools are critical, many transit users — particularly those in immigrant and refugee
communities — may disproportionately rely on the built environment at stops/stations as well as on vehicles and
printed materials to navigate the system. The recommendation to install multilingual electronic wayfinding maps
and provide translated announcements aligns with broader efforts to improve equity in RTD services.
Finally, both the survey and the focus group highlight the need for stronger community partnerships. Participants
pointed to organizations that already serve immigrant and refugee populations as key allies in improving transit
access. This supports prior findings that more outreach and education efforts are necessary to ensure
linguistically diverse communities feel confident using RTD services.
Together, these findings emphasize that language access in transit is not just about translation but also about
building trust, improving communication channels, and ensuring that transit information is available in multiple
formats. Addressing these gaps will require a multifaceted approach, combining digital improvements, in-person
resources, and deeper community engagement. As RTD continues to advance its language access initiatives, it
will be crucial to honor the lived experiences of diverse customers, develop data-driven resources that reflect
community needs, and foster intentional, reciprocal partnerships to ensure truly inclusive and effective
communication.

Additionally, participants stressed the importance of direct collaboration with community members to better
understand their needs and shape RTD’s equity and language access initiatives accordingly.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
Methodology

To complete Factor 4, the Transit Equity Office (TEO) contacted numerous departments and divisions engaged
in language access work — specifically, the Paratransit Services Division; the Communications and Engagement,
Transit Police, and Human Resources departments; the Board Office; the Risk Management Division; and other
offices in the Civil Rights Division — to report their expenses related to language assistance from June 1, 2022
to March 31, 2025. TEO gathered its own expenses as well, given the outsized role it plays in coordinating and
paying for language assistance services across the agency.

Results
Resources

The resources available to RTD staff to provide language assistance have significantly increased from the 20192022 period to the 2022-2025 period, as is evidenced in part by the increased costs noted in the following
section. For a summary of existing resources, see the Introduction and Language Access Measures below.

Costs

From June 2022 through March 2025, RTD and its contractors spent an estimated $309,882 on language
assistance services — a 78% increase from the $176,318 reported for the June 2019-May 2022 time period.
Figure 4.1 below details RTD’s language assistance expenses with a brief description and the associated
department.
The largest expense in the current period was the cost of contracts with the Transit Equity Office’s multicultural
outreach partners, estimated at $101,442. These expenses supported activities such as survey distribution, focus
groups, resource fairs, and digital communications campaigns. Following, the second-largest expense was
related to developing the agency’s inaugural Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training, estimated at
$62,099 to hire an instructional designer and purchase access to training development tools like Articulate 360.
Expenses do not include printing with the exception of the “Transit Equity Office Signage and Materials” category.
Additionally, costs do not include staff labor.

Discussion

Though some of the spending on language assistance services likely reflects improved accounting across the
agency, the expansion of RTD’s language access efforts is the primary reason for cost increases during this
period. For example, RTD has made significant strides in providing digital forms of language assistance, such as
the buildout of the website’s translation tool, launch of the Transit Watch mobile application in Spanish, and
video production. Most notable, however, is RTD’s commitment in connecting with linguistically diverse
communities through paid partnerships with community-based organizations. All in all, RTD has demonstrated
its dedication to language access since June 2022 directly through its financial investment, and this investment
has allowed us to improve engagement with linguistically diverse communities, expand translated resources,
support staff in overcoming language barriers, and beyond.
Finally, it is also crucial to recognize how staff contribute to RTD’s language accessibility in ways not captured
by this Factor 4 report. As mentioned in Factor 2, 30% of RTD’s customer-facing staff speak a language in
addition to English — providing (often daily) language assistance to linguistically diverse customers. Additionally,
staff across departments — including Civil Rights, Operations, and Communications — play a vital role in
coordinating and implementing language access initiatives. Although not reflected in financial reports, these
contributions are fundamental to RTD’s language access efforts.

Language Access Measures
RTD’s Four Factor Analysis provides a data-driven foundation for understanding the language needs of the
communities the agency serves. Data includes the number of linguistically diverse people in the agency’s service
areas as well as the most common languages they speak, the frequency with which linguistically diverse persons
interact with RTD frontline staff, the suggestions staff have to overcome language barriers with customers, the
nature and importance of RTD’s services to the linguistically diverse population, and, finally, the costs to pursue
various language assistance measures. Based on this analysis, RTD is committed to implementing targeted
strategies that enhance language accessibility across agency programs and services. In the coming years, RTD
will build on existing efforts by enhancing partnerships with community-based organizations, expanding and
better promoting language assistance services, streamlining the integration of language access processes into
operations, and finding new ways to support frontline staff in serving linguistically diverse customers.

Translation of Vital Materials

Undoubtedly, translating written materials is a fundamental method of providing language assistance.
Accordingly, agencies receiving federal funding are required to identify “vital documents” that must be translated
to the extent possible. Vital documents are defined as 1) any document critical for obtaining services and
benefits, and/or 2) any document required by law. In other words, whether a document (or the information it
solicits) is “vital” depends on the importance of the program, information, encounter, or service involved, and
the consequence to a person if the information in question is not accurate or timely. For instance, applications

1.E.1.b

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
RTD refers to “vital documents” as “vital materials” recognizing that not all essential information comes in the
form of a document. The Transit Equity Office has established a tiered classification system to identify vital
materials, and it includes four classifications:
•
•
•
•

Tier 1 — Safety, Security and Civil Rights
Tier 2 — Information Critical to Access RTD’s Services
Tier 3 — Information to Empower Customers
Tier 4 — Entertainment

These tiers are described below.

Tier 1: Safety, Security and Civil Rights

Tier 1 materials protect customers’ physical safety and facilitates RTD customers exercising their civil rights
protected by laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990. While Tier 1 materials can be digital in nature, much of RTD’s Tier 1 information can be found in printed
signage across the transit system (including in vehicles). Examples include (but are not limited to) the Title VI
public notice, Transit Watch signage, and ADA decals. Information about public meetings and engagement
opportunities related to fare changes and service changes are also Tier 1 materials.

Tier 2: Information Critical to Access RTD’s Services

Tier 2 materials may be critical to accessing, or facilitates customers’ understanding of and participation in, RTD
services and programs. Tier 2 examples include basic customer information (e.g., the website), fare payment
information, program applications and information (e.g., for Access-A-Ride, Special Discount Fares or Programs),
maps, service changes, and service alerts (e.g., Next Ride). Customer surveys and details about public hearings
and engagement opportunities related to Tier 2 information are also Tier 2 materials.
Unlike Tier 1, Tier 2 information is more likely to be digital or both digital and print in nature.

Tier 3: Information to Empower Customers

Tier 3 materials help customers understand and participate with RTD at a higher level, empowering them to play
a larger role in long-term service decisions. Tier 3 examples include project updates and planning information.
Customer surveys related to Tier 3 information are also Tier 3 materials.

Tier 4: Entertainment
Tier 4 materials are solely for entertainment or describe how to use RTD for recreational activities. They do not
present information directly related to safety, security, or civil rights; improving access to services; or
empowering customers to participate in RTD service and planning decisions. Tier 4 materials are usually digital.
Once RTD classifies the material, the agency takes the following general approach to translation. Note, however,
that the formatting of a material – for example, whether static signage or digital – may impact the ability to
offer translations, thus requiring modified tactics. Digital and print assets, as opposed to materials like signage
in stations, are easier to translate in many languages.

New Language Access Activities: Implementation Calendar
In addition to the language assistance activities RTD will continue noted above, agency staff have outlined 23
new tasks that align with the needs and suggestions identified in the Four Factor Analysis across customers and
frontline staff. They can be organized into four general categories or “outcomes”: update and monitor the LAP,
strengthen and standardize language access processes, expand and promote language assistance services, and
enhance employee training and resources to serve linguistically diverse customers.32

Using the Vital Material Classification System

32

While this Language Access Plan focuses on how RTD provides language assistance to customers, it is important to note
that RTD is also exploring how it can better support the agency’s linguistically diverse staff. For instance, the Equal
Employment Opportunity Office recently launched its training in Spanish, and Talent Acquisition began translating certain
hiring assessments into Spanish as well. Other internally facing conversations, such as offering a pay differential to
multilingual staff as well as tactics to hire more linguistically diverse staff, are ongoing.

RTD 2025-2028 Language Access Plan
Key Outcomes
RTD will maintain, monitor, and regularly update its Language Access Plan (LAP) to guide the administration of
language access efforts. In addition to the three-year LAP update, RTD will adjust its language access approach
on an ongoing basis, adapting to changes in service area demographics. To stay attuned to language assistance
needs, RTD will continuously monitor demographic trends and collaborate with community-based organizations
serving linguistically diverse populations.
In 2022, RTD established a formalized Language Access Program within the Civil Rights Division’s Transit Equity
Office, and the LAP forms the backbone of this program. A dedicated Transit Equity Specialist will oversee its
implementation, coordinating language access activities across departments while monitoring the agency for
adherence to language access requirements.

Outcome 2: Strengthen and Standardize Language Access Processes

RTD will refine and formalize agency-wide language access processes to ensure consistency and adherence
across departments. While the 2022-2025 LAP introduced key internal procedures for language assistance, the
2025-2028 LAP will focus on strengthening compliance, streamlining workflows, and incorporating feedback from
linguistically diverse communities to improve service delivery.

Outcome 3: Expand and Promote Language Assistance Services

RTD will actively provide and promote language assistance services, in a culturally competent manner, to ensure
equitable access for linguistically diverse customers. This includes offering interpretation at community events,
translating vital materials, producing multilingual signage, and enhancing outreach and communications
strategies to increase awareness of available language assistance services.

Outcome 4: Enhance Employee Training and Resources to Serve Linguistically Diverse
Customers

RTD will ensure that all frontline employees know their obligations to provide meaningful access to RTD services
for linguistically diverse people; accordingly, the agency will sufficiently equip employees to assist linguistically
diverse customers by improving training programs and expanding available resources. Though RTD produced
its inaugural Serving Non-English-Speaking Customers training during the 2022-2025 LAP, the agency aims to
improve the training that staff receive as well as continuously assess and refine tools that facilitate effective
communication between employees and linguistically diverse customers.

language access efforts, setting a firm foundation for the 2025-2028 Language Access Plan. The 2025-2028 LAP
builds upon the framework and associated tasks noted in the 2022-2025 LAP, provides updated data on the
language needs of the Denver metro area, and identifies specific, measurable, and data-driven tasks to continue
to improve the language accessibility of RTD’s transit services and programs. Through its language access and
other efforts, RTD will continue to build a respectful, dignified, and welcoming transit environment for all.

Why the Focus on English Proficiency?
▪ RTD receives funds from the Federal Transit
Administration

▪ This requires us to comply with Civil Rights law,

including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title
VI”)

▪ Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of
race, color or national origin

▪ Lau v. Nichols of 1974: national origin includes language
▪ RTD must ensure that non-English speakers can
access programs and services

1.E.1.b

Packet

Why is Compliance Important?
▪ Violation of Title VI can result in:
• Legal consequences
• Loss of federal funding
• Negative impact on RTD’s public image
• Decrease in customer satisfaction
• Loss of employee morale

Remember: to be compliant with
federal law, RTD must take
reasonable steps to provide
meaningful access to
non-English-speaking customers.

Never Demand that Someone Speak English
“You speak (any) English?”
If someone speaks to you in another language, assume they don’t
speak English. Asking can be condescending (but tone is important!).
“This is America! Speak English!”
English is not a requirement to access RTD services.
“You want me to help you? Gotta speak English.”
Title VI requires RTD staff to provide customers with equal
access to services regardless of their preferred language.

Ask Another Customer for Help
▪ Ask someone in the vehicle, “Is there anyone here that can speak [language]?”
▪ Use your judgment: a customer may say they speak a different language, but that
does not mean they are a reliable interpreter!

▪ Avoid asking anyone under the age of 18 to act as an interpreter except for simple

topics (e.g., ticket purchase, route schedule) or if urgent (e.g., medical emergency)

• You may also ask the child to tell the accompanying adult that interpretation is
available at no cost by calling Customer Care at 303.299.6000

• If a crime has taken place, responding law enforcement should provide an
interpreter

Title VI Subrecipient Compliance Guide
Background
Equity is central to the mission of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to provide mass transit services in
the Denver Metro Area. An equitable system ensures fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of transit
service, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income level.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance.
Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national
origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the
benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898,
which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by
identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA’s) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Executive Order 12898. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document the measures taken to comply with U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT’s)
Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three
years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
Subrecipients of federal financial assistance are also required to comply with Title VI and Environmental Justice
requirements.

Subrecipients
As the regional transit provider for the Denver Metro area, RTD is a designated and primary recipient for FTA
grant funding. An organization becomes a subrecipient of federal funding when RTD enters into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) which extends federal funding to that organization (e.g. federal grants,
loans, real estate). Under federal Title VI regulations, primary recipients are responsible for ensuring their
subrecipients comply with these requirements. Noncompliance by an RTD subrecipient also places RTD in
violation of Title VI.
Accordingly, all RTD IGAs that extend federal funding state, “This Agreement and all subgrants, third party
contracts and subcontracts are therefore subject to the FTA Master Agreement and all other applicable federal
transit regulations…” RTD has developed this compliance guide to aid subrecipients in fulfilling applicable Title
VI requirements.

1.E.1.b

Title VI Subrecipient Compliance Guide
Subrecipients must submit a Title VI Program to RTD, outlining the scope of their federally funded program,
project, or activity and detailing how they will ensure compliance with nondiscrimination requirements.
Subrecipients must demonstrate compliance with DOT’s Title VI regulations by providing documentation,
including records and reports, within their Title VI Programs.
RTD encourages subrecipients to adopt our notice to beneficiaries, complaint procedures and
complaint forms, Public Participation Plan and Language Access Plan where appropriate.
Subrecipients must submit their first Title VI Program within six months of the execution of the applicable
intergovernmental agreement (or any other contract mechanism).
After the first submission, subrecipients must submit a Title VI Program Update annually for the life of the
agreement. The update should include any recent activities. Title VI Program Updates are due by December 1
of each year.
A Title VI Program must include the following to demonstrate Title VI compliance.

Title VI Policy Statement
Subrecipients must provide a Title VI Policy Statement affirming a commitment to complying with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and ensuring nondiscrimination in the applicable programs, policies, and activities of the
intergovernmental agreement with RTD. The policy statement should be signed by the same signatory of the
intergovernmental agreement and included within the Title VI Program.

Title VI Complaint Form, Complaint Procedures and Public Notice
Subrecipients must develop a Title VI complaint form, allowing the public to submit a Title VI complaint.
Subrecipients must also develop Title VI complaint procedures for investigating and tracking Title VI complaints
filed against them. The form and procedure for filing a complaint shall be available on the subrecipient’s website.
Subrecipients are required to prepare and maintain a complaint log, listing any of the following that allege
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin: active investigations conducted by entities other
than FTA, lawsuits, and complaints naming the subrecipient. This list shall include the date that the investigation,
lawsuit, or complaint was filed; a summary of the allegation(s); the status of the investigation, lawsuit, or
complaint; and actions taken by the recipient in response, or final findings related to, the investigation, lawsuit,
or complaint.

Subrecipients are required to provide information to the public regarding the subrecipient’s obligations under
DOT’s Title VI regulations and apprise members of the public of the protections against discrimination afforded
to them by Title VI. At a minimum, subrecipients shall disseminate this information to the public by posting a
Title VI notice on their website and in public areas such as the subrecipient’s office(s) (e.g., reception desk,
meeting rooms).
The public notice must include the following:
1. A statement that the subrecipient operates programs without regard to race, color, or national origin
2. A description of the procedures that members of the public should follow to request additional information
on the subrecipient’s Title VI obligations
3. A description of the procedures that members of the public shall follow to file a Title VI discrimination
complaint against the subrecipient
To the extent that it is appropriate, RTD encourages subrecipients to adopt RTD’s complaint form, procedures,
and public notice. RTD will assess needs with each subrecipient during the initial intake and provide any
supporting documents.

Public Participation Plan
Subrecipients must create a Public Participation Plan demonstrating how they intend to authentically engage
low-income and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) populations1 with respect to the project,
program, or activity. Plans should include how subrecipients offer continuous opportunities for the public to be
involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental impacts of proposed decisions. Subrecipients
are offered great latitude in their ability to tailor their approach considering their unique programs, projects or
activities and blend of cultures among their beneficiaries.
To the extent that it is appropriate, RTD encourages subrecipients to adopt RTD’s Public Participation Plan. RTD
will assess needs with each subrecipient during the initial intake and provide any supporting documents.

Language Access Plan
To ensure beneficiaries can access benefits, services, information, and “vital” materials, subrecipients must
develop a Language Access Plan for individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP; hereafter referred to as
linguistically diverse persons). Failing to provide language assistance may result in national origin discrimination.
Subrecipients can do this by conducting a Four Factor Analysis. An FTA requirement, the Analysis will assist in

Title VI Subrecipient Compliance Guide
1. Identify the number and proportion of linguistically diverse persons likely to be encountered by the
subrecipient
2. Determine the frequency of contact with which linguistically diverse persons encounter the subrecipient
3. Determine the nature and importance of the program, activity and/or service provided
4. Identify the resources available to the subrecipient and the costs
Additionally, the Safe Harbor Provision and threshold assists agencies with determining when it is necessary to
translate vital materials. DOT adopted the Department of Justice’s (DOJ’s) Safe Harbor Provision which stipulates
that, a recipient should provide written translation of vital materials for each eligible language group that makes
up five percent (5%) or 1,000 persons, whichever is less, of the total population of person eligible to be served,
encounter or affected by their services.
For more in-depth information on the Four Factor Analysis and developing a Language Access Plan, check out
the US DOT’s LEP Guidance here.
To the extent that it is appropriate, RTD encourages subrecipients to adopt RTD’s Language Access Plan. RTD
will assess this need with each subrecipient during the initial intake.

Inclusive Advisory and Planning Boards
Subrecipients that have transit-related, non-elected planning boards, advisory councils or committees, or similar
bodies, the membership of which is selected by the recipient, must:
•
•
•

Include a table showing the racial composition of committee members
Detail efforts to encourage minority participation in such committees or councils
Use self-reported data to determine racial composition (avoid assumptions)

The racial breakdown table and the description of efforts to include minorities should be included within the
subrecipients Public Participation Plan.

Determining Site or Location of a Facility
In determining the site or location of facilities, subrecipients may not make site selections that subject people to
discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin. Facilities included in this provision include, but
are not limited to, storage facilities, maintenance facilities and operations centers. To comply with Title VI:

•

Subrecipients shall complete a Title VI equity analysis during the planning stage regarding where a
project is located or sited to ensure the location is selected without regard to race, color, or national
origin. Subrecipients shall engage in outreach to persons potentially impacted by the siting of facilities.
The Title VI equity analysis must compare the equity impacts of various siting alternatives, and the
analysis must occur before the selection of the preferred site.

•

When evaluating locations of facilities, subrecipients should give attention to other facilities with similar
impacts in the area to determine if any cumulative adverse impacts might result. Analysis should be done
at the Census tract or block group where appropriate to ensure that proper perspective is given to
localized impacts.

•

If the subrecipient determines that the location of the project will result in a disparate impact on the
basis of race, color or national origin, the subrecipient may only locate the project in that location if there

Specifically, the Four Factor Analysis is an individualized assessment that balances the following four factors:

is a substantial legitimate justification for locating the project there, and where there are no alternative
locations that would have a less disparate impact on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Subrecipients must show how both tests are met; it is important to understand that to make this showing,
the recipient must consider and analyze alternatives to determine whether those alternatives would have
a lesser disparate impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and then implement the least
discriminatory alternative.

Other Requirements
Title VI Coordinator

Subrecipients must designate a Title VI Coordinator who is responsible for managing and monitoring Title VI
compliance, providing Title VI Program updates and serving as the point of contact for RTD’s Transit Equity
Office.

Requirement to Provide Additional Information
RTD may request, at its discretion, information other than that which is required by this guide from a subrecipient
to investigate complaints of discrimination or to resolve concerns about possible non-compliance with DOT’s
Title VI regulations.

Subrecipients in need of technical assistance in complying with any of the requirements set forth in this document

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2025 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

November 14, 2024

December 3, 2024
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2025
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 27 service changes proposed for January 2025 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail personnel to
select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2025 service

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy:
A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that
would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity
analysis.
Title VI Policies:
• Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones, and three rail lines commencing January
2025. Of these changes, eight services have proposed additions to service 25% greater than that of
baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes are
shown in bold in the following table.
Schedule Timing

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group, and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.

change proposal includes eight major service changes out of 27 total changes. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity
Analysis report is included in Attachment A.

Packet Pg. 500

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route
level: of the eight bus routes with major service changes (Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1,
FF5, and LD1), three routes (Routes 100, AB1, and LD1) had a potential disparate impact finding,
and one route (Route 139) had a potential disproportionate burden finding.
o Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.42% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations
receive 0.18% more benefit than non-minority populations.
o Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.39% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.21% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05%
more benefit than non-low-income populations.
o While not considered a major service change, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and
non-low-income) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than nonminority populations. Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than
non-low-income populations. Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential
disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations being impacted 1.0% more
than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are impacted 0.09% less than nonminority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from Routes 1 and 44
into the 1/44E Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.
•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the network level, to
determine overall impacts to equity populations compared to non-equity populations. At the
network level, minority populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61%
vs. 10.32% respectively). This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of
9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major
service increases. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income
populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 8.9%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increases.

Conclusions:
Although three major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service
change resulted in a potential disproportionate burden at the route level, staff recommends the January
2025 service plan as proposed, as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize, or mitigate the
potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burden. Additionally, the network-level analysis provides
holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VI-protected populations across the service

area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network-level findings. In fact, both minority
and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network level from the major service changes
than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight bus routes facing major service changes
serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the routes serve higher than average
minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes 100, AB1 and LD1)
serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority populations.
Improving service on these routes does not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given
the results of the network-level analysis indicating that Title VI concerns are minimal (0.42%, 0.18%,
0.39% and 0.21%, respectively).
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for January 2025 to ensure that
the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 22 bus routes, two FlexRide zones and three rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming
January 2025 service change. Of this change, eight services meet established thresholds for a major service
change. The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service
and are proposed for the long-term (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Route Modification
(one service)

Route 35: As described in the SOP, segment reinstated east of Englewood
Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue
Route 49: Daily service frequency increased to 30 minutes throughout the
service day; service span expanded to extend to 11 p.m. on weekdays, to
commence at 5 a.m. and extend through 11 p.m. on Saturdays, and to
commence at 6 a.m. and extend through 8 p.m. on Sundays
Route 83D: Weekday midday and evening service increased to 30-minute
frequency
Route 100: Service frequency increased between Federal Center Station (W
Line) and Arvada Ridge Station (G Line)

Service Increases
(seven services)

Route 139: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays and
to commence one hour earlier and extend two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route AB1: AB2 trips reinstated from Downtown Boulder Station; daily service
increased to 30-minute frequency throughout the service day
Route FF5: 3:02 p.m. eastbound trip added from Downtown Boulder Station to
Anschutz; 2:45 p.m. westbound FF5 trip shifted to 2:30 p.m.; eastbound 4:02
p.m. trip added to interline with current westbound trip at 5:15 p.m.
Route LD1: Two morning and two afternoon/evening peak trips added from
Bross St/8th Ave to Denver Union Station in each direction

Minor Service Changes
The service tabulated below has proposed adjustments that were less than 25% of baseline service. This includes
one route merger proposal that, while not currently included in the major service change policy, represents a
significant change to the alignments of two bus routes. Other adjustments include service increases under the
major service change threshold and schedule timing changes.

Schedule Timing
(Five services)

Route 42: Running time adjustments due to changes on Route 45
Route 52: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 65: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance for all
service days
Route 76: Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance on
weekdays
NB: Minor changes to weekday schedule to account for class start/end times at
Boulder High and Nederland High, as well as operational hours at Eldora Ski
Resort
D Line: Schedule adjustments due to ongoing maintenance work

Service Increase
(Six services)

Route 24: Service spans expanded to extend two hours later on weekdays,
and commence one hour earlier extend and two hours later on Saturdays and
Sundays
Route 73: Daily service span increased to provide later evening trips
Route 205/205T: Tripper service added to address overloads on Route BOLT
due to increase in Boulder High School usage
Route 208: School tripper service added to address overloads on the regular
scheduled 7:51 a.m. westbound trip due to increase in Boulder High School
usage
E Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)
H Line: Reinstatement of 15-minute frequency (temporary change)

Route Adjustment
(Seven services)

Route 1: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic
Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current
alignment between Lakewood Commons and 17th/Stout.
Route 15: Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access
to the stop at 13th Avenue/Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the
safest manner, resume westbound operations after serving the stop. Service to
13th Avenue/Lisbon Street bus stop will start as soon as the traffic signal is
completed at Colfax Avenue/Picadilly Street.
Route 44: Service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted service to
Civic Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the
current alignment between Wheat Ridge/Ward Road Station and 17th/California
Streets.
Route 45: Routing updated to reflect ongoing westbound detour related to left
turn at unsignalized intersection from Ireland St onto 56th Ave. Buses will
operate in a loop via Maxwell, right on Dunkirk, right on 56th Ave and right on
Ireland. Buses will serve the same stops on Ireland St, Dunkirk and 56th Ave in
both directions. Original routing will be restored when a traffic signal at the
intersection is installed and operable
Route 1E/44 (Art District Connector): Eastern portion of the Route 1 and
Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points neighborhoods from
Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat Ridge/Ward
Station to Civic Center Station) retained into downtown Denver, with the new
merged routing renamed as the ART Connector
NBFX (Broomfield North FlexRide): Boundaries expanded to include a new
area
ILFX (Interlocken/Westmoor FlexRide): Service boundaries expanded to
include a new affordable housing development

Findings
Major service changes included in the 27 proposed January 2025 service changes include route adjustments
as well as service increases to eight bus routes. Of the eight routes with major service changes, three serve
populations that are above the district average of minority populations, and all eight serve populations that are
above the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increases
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations receive a higher increase in service
(i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
2.92% more of a benefit than non-low-income areas. This difference is above the 10% minimum threshold.
Minority areas received more of an increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to
non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.29% more than non-minority areas, a difference above
the 10% threshold.

Finally, potential disparate impact findings were identified at the route level for the changes proposed for
Routes 100, AB1 and LD1 and a potential disproportionate burden for Route 139.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (Family of Services) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2025 service change looked at whether an individual bus route’s or rail
line’s major service changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the
proportional difference in changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route
or rail line. These proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity
populations and route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
Three public meetings were conducted October 21-22, 2024. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, number of
attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the major service changes described
in this analysis.

RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.change@rtd-denver.com, by phone at
303-299-6000 and at Board of Directors’ meetings. In 2024, RTD also added the option for the public to provide
comment by completing route- and line-specific surveys found at www.rtd-denver.com/service-alerts/servicechanges.
There was a total of 1,289 responses on the proposed service changes, with 65% indicating a very positive
impact and 20% indicating a somewhat positive impact. See below for route-specific feedback:
•

Route AB1: Received strong support with 87% finding it very positive and 11% somewhat positive

•

Route 35: Positive response with 72% very positive and 16% somewhat positive

•

Route 49: Mixed feedback with 40% very positive and 30% somewhat positive, but 10% very
negative

•

Route 83D: Generally well-received with 61% very positive and 28% somewhat positive

•

Route 100: Mixed reviews; 59% very positive, 18% somewhat positive, and a combined 18%
negative

•

Route 139: Predominantly positive at 60% somewhat positive, though 20% noted a very negative
impact

•

Route FF5: Mostly positive, with 41% very positive, 32% somewhat positive, and 12% negative

•

Route LD1: Highly favorable with 53% very positive and 36% somewhat positive, and minimal
negative feedback

Overall, the feedback reflects substantial support for the proposed changes, with a few areas where impacts
are more mixed.
Additionally, the Transit Equity Office collaborated with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) to share
information on service changes and encourage customer feedback on the proposed changes to the routes.
Through this partnership, three CBOs attended a total of nine events, directly reaching 944 community members.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Major Service Change Test
Identify routes with proposed major service changes (based on trips or hours) of 25% or more

Changes by Transit Mode

For the January 2025 runboard, 22 fixed-route bus routes and three rail lines will undergo various service
changes. Of these, 12 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 407 total weekday revenue
service hours and 541 additional weekend service hours.1 While not considered a major service change
under current policy, the proposal to merge portions of Routes 1 and 44 represents a significant change in
alignment and service patterns. Service increases on other routes include additional service frequencies and
spans of service (longer hours of service) on several routes both for weekday and weekend service.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed January 2025 runboard.

comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year demographic data.

1 The reinstatement of 15-minute frequency on the E and H Lines are not noted here as an increase in service hours given that their

baseline frequency prior to ongoing maintenance projects (notably, the Coping Panel project and Downtown Rail Reconstruction project
in 2024) was 15 minutes. Thus, there is no change in service hours.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025
Eight bus routes had proposed major service increases which include service increases of 25% or greater.
Improved headways and spans of service are proposed on Routes 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5 and LD1 for the
January 2025 service change. The proposed segment reinstatement of the Route 35 is outlined in the RTD
Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP).

Other Changes

While not currently included within major service change policies, the proposal to truncate Routes 1 and 44 at
Civic Center Station and combine those truncated segments into the new 1E/44 (Art District Connector) route
represents a significant change in alignment and service patterns. While the truncation may impact some
customers who previously rode through downtown to the respective route ends, data supporting the proposal
indicates potential improvements in trips for customers who formerly had to transfer to complete the new route
pattern as well as improved service to and through downtown Denver.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.

Route 35
Proposal: Segment reinstated east of Englewood Station to Nine Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue,
as described in the Systems Optimization Plan.
As shown in Table 3, a slightly higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (0.98% vs. 0.79%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.71%). Therefore, no
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority
population benefits from the proposed major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population
(1.10% vs. 0.65%, respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.58%).
Thus, there is no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

As shown in Table 4, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.03% vs. 0.33%,

As shown in Table 9, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-low-income population (1.29% vs. 0.32%,
respectively). This difference does not fall below the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.29%). Therefore,
no potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. A slightly lower percentage of the district’s minority
population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority population
(0.52% vs. 0.56%, respectively). However, this difference does not fall below the 10% disparate impact
threshold (0.51%). Thus, there is no potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring further
examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis).

Analysis of Minor Service Change
A route level analysis for minor service changes is atypical in RTD’s equity analyses but was performed to
understand the potential impacts to minority and low-income populations currently served by Routes 1 and 44
and to provide supplemental information for the January 2025 service change. Because of the truncation of
these routes prior to a merger and the potential for new transfers, proposals on the extent routes are considered
service decreases. The merged segments creating the 1E/44 (Art District Connector) is considered a service
increase. As with major service changes analyses, the demographics of each route were reviewed for potential
DI or DB findings.

Route 1
Proposal: As described in the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted to Civic Center Station
via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the current alignment between Lakewood Commons and
17th/Stout
For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease
due to possibility of forced transfers at Civic Center Station. As shown in Table 11, a slightly higher percentage
of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-low-income population (2.13% vs. 1.12%, respectively). This difference meets the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold (1.23%). Therefore, a potential route-level disproportionate burden is found.
Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population is impacted from the proposed major service
decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.61% vs. 1.08%, respectively). This difference meets

For the purposes of this analysis and as a conservative measure, this proposal is assumed as a service decrease

of the district’s low-income population stands to be impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-low-income population (2.55% vs. 1.56%, respectively). This difference meets the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold (1.71%). Therefore, a potential route-level disproportionate burden is found.
Additionally, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to be impacted from the proposed
major service decrease as compared to the non-minority population (1.64% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This
difference meets the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.91%). Thus, there is no potential disparate impact
found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community
engagement and network level analysis).

New 1E/44 Art District Connector Route
Proposal: Eastern portion of the Route 1 and Route 44 combined, connecting the Baker and Five Points
neighborhoods from Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station; the western portions of the Routes 1
(Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheatridge-Ward Station to Civic Center Station)
retained into downtown Denver, with the new merged routing renamed as the ART Connector, as described in
the RTD Board-approved Systems Optimization Plan. Under current policy, this change is not considered a
Major Service Change.
As shown in Table 13, a higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the
proposed merger as compared to the non-low-income population (2.02% vs. 0.90%, respectively). This
difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.81%). Therefore, no potential routelevel disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, a higher percentage of the district’s minority population
benefits from the proposed merger as compared to the non-minority population (1.31% vs. 0.92%, respectively).
This difference does not meet the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.83%). Thus, there is no potential disparate
impact found at the route level requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations,
community engagement and network level analysis), and the creation of the 1E/44 helps maintain service
availability following the truncation of the Routes 1 and 44.

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 407 weekday revenue hours and 541 weekend hours
Of the nearly 320,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented a higher share of population compared to district averages. Of this total, over
55,000 people with low incomes and nearly 122,000 people in minority communities would receive service
improvements.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes2 were compared only for those with major
service changes. All bus routes serve higher than average low-income populations. Of the eight bus
routes with major service changes, three serve higher than average minority populations.

In review of the proposed major service changes at the systemwide level, there are no potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden findings.
An analysis was conducted of all district block groups and their service levels to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the September 2024 to January 2025 service changes. Block groups with low-income and minority
populations at or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas
non-low-income and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and
minority population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.3 Using the 2018-2022
Five-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.4
The thresholds summarized in Table 14 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

For system-level service increases (excluding population affected by the merger of Routes 1 and 44), minority
populations stand to benefit more than non-minority populations (10.61% vs. 10.32% respectively).
This difference does not meet the disparate impact threshold of 9.29%. Therefore, no system-level disparate
impact finding is found with the proposed major service increases. Low-income populations stand to
benefit more than non-low-income populations (12.8% vs. 9.89%, respectively). The difference does not
meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold of 8.9%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden
is found with the proposed major service increase.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2025

The systemwide service modifications proposed between September 2024 and January 2025 include
schedule improvements, expansions of service spans, alignment changes, and additional trips on regional routes.
Eight major service changes include those for Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

•

•

•

•

Of the 27 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, 4 had potential DI or DB findings.
Route 100 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.42%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.03% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route 139 has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income populations
receiving 0.18% less benefit than non-low-income populations. Minority populations receive 0.18% more
benefit than non-minority populations.
Route AB1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.39%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 1.09% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Route LD1 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.21%
less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations receive 0.05% more benefit than
non-low-income populations.
Additionally, while not considered major service changes, the truncation of the Route 1 impacts equity
(i.e., minority and low-income) populations more than non-equity (i.e., non-minority and non-lowincome) populations. Minority populations are impacted 0.53% more than non-minority populations.
Additionally, low-income populations are impacted 1.01% more than non-low-income populations.
Truncation of the Route 44 also has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income
populations being impacted 1.0% more than non-low-income populations (whereas populations are
impacted 0.09% less than non-minority populations). On the other hand, the merger of segments from
Routes 1 and 44 into the 1E/44 Art District Connector had no potential findings and will maintain service
availability to the truncated portions of the Routes 1 and 44.

Table 16 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings of potential disparate impacts
and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, and it provides the individual route
service change.

Systemwide-level Findings:
•
•

Routes 35, 49, 83D, 100, 139, AB1, FF5, and LD1 comprise the January 2025 runboard’s major service
changes.
Almost 320,000 people live within a quarter mile of bus stops on routes with major service increases.
Both minority and low-income populations are represented at higher shares of the population than district
averages (38.2% and 17.7%, respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly higher
benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Lowincome areas benefited 2.92% more compared to non-low-income areas. Minority populations
received a higher benefit (were more positively impacted) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.29% more compared to non-minority areas.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Title VI concerns are minimal with the proposed January 2025 service change proposal. Although three major
service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and one major service change resulted in a
disproportionate burden at the route level, RTD recommends keeping the January 2025 service plan as proposed
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impacts and disproportionate
burden. As noted in the route-level findings, improving service on these routes (100, 139, AB1 and LD1) does
not raise concerns of inequitable distribution of benefits given the minimal differences (0.42%, 0.18%, 0.39%
and 0.21%, respectively) between the comparator groups.

Additionally, the network-level analysis provides holistic understanding of changes to service levels for Title VIprotected populations across the service area compared to the route level. The analysis revealed no network
level findings. In fact, both minority and low-income populations stand to benefit more at the network

level from the major service changes than non-minority and non-low-income populations. All eight
bus routes facing major service changes serve higher than average low-income populations, and three of the
routes serve higher than average minority populations with only three improvements (specifically, to the Routes
100, AB1 and LD1) serving areas with relatively low minority populations as compared to non-minority
populations.

As described in the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and
rerouted to Civic Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would
serve the current alignment between Lakewood Commons and 17th/Stout

15

Routing updated to reflect a current detour, which removes access to the stop
at 13th Avenue/Lisbon Street, due to inability to reliably and in the safest
manner, resume westbound operations after serving the stop. Service to 13 th
Avenue-Lisbon Street bus stop will start as soon as the traffic signal is
completed at Colfax Avenue/Picadilly Street

35*

As described in the SOP, segment reinstated east of Englewood Station to Nine
Mile Station primarily along Hampden Avenue

44

As described the SOP, service east of 17th/18th Streets truncated and rerouted
to Civic Center Station via Broadway/Lincoln. The new routing would serve the
current alignment between Wheat Ridge/Ward Road Station and 17th/California

ART
Connector
(1E/44)

Described in the SOP as the 1E/44, the eastern segments of the Route 1 and
Route 44 would be combined into a new route service, connecting the Baker
and Five Points neighborhoods from Alameda Station to 40th/Colorado Station
and thereby connecting the Santa Fe Arts District, the Denver Theatre District
and the RiNo Arts District, inspiring the ART route name. The western portions
of the Routes 1 (Lakewood Commons to Civic Center Station) and 44 (Wheat
Ridge/Ward Station to Civic Center Station) would be retained at current
service levels

45

Routing update to reflect ongoing westbound detour related to left turn at
unsignalized intersection from Ireland Street onto 56th Avenue. Buses will
operate in a loop via Maxwell Place, right on Dunkirk Street, right on 56th
Avenue and right on Ireland Street. Buses will serve the same stops on Ireland
Street, Dunkirk Street and 56th Avenue in both directions. The original routing
will be restored when a traffic signal is installed at the intersection

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 24, 2024

July 30, 2024
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September
2024 service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 38 service changes proposed for September 2024 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail operators
to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD
System Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, there is no disparate impact on minority populations, nor a
disproportionate burden on low-income populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy
A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in the service hours of
any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate
impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 32 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming September 2024 service
change. Of these 38 changes, one service has proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater
than that of baseline service and thus meets established thresholds for a major service change. That
route is shown in bold in the following table.

disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2024 service
change proposal includes one major service change out of 38 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report
is included in Attachment A.

Methodology

Packet Pg. 571

1.E.1.b

Summary of Findings:
• A potential disparate impact was identified at the individual route level: the one route/line that
had major service changes, Route 40, had a potential disparate impact finding.
•

The proposed major service change was examined, at the network level, to determine overall
impacts to equity (i.e., minority and low-income) populations compared to non-equity (i.e., nonminority and non-low-income) populations. However, the systemwide service increase findings
mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to being the sole major service change.

At the network level, service changes (service increases solely on Route 40), minority populations stand
to benefit less than non-minority populations (1.37% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This difference falls
below the disparate impact threshold of 1.56%. Therefore, the proposed major service increase results
in a system-level disparate impact. However, low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than
non-low-income populations (1.57% vs. 1.62%, respectively). The difference does not fall below the
10% disproportionate burden threshold of 1.46%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increase.
Conclusions
Although the major service change has resulted in a potential disparate impact at both the route and
network levels, RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 major service change plan as proposed,
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The
substantial legitimate justification for the Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of
the SOP, which recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th•
Colorado Station and Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective
Bargaining Agreement-compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate
justification for the service improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are
significant, with a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of five of the
six minor changes (of the 38 service changes, only those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours),
are considered low-income-serving bus routes, and a total of two out of six are considered minorityserving bus routes. Other minor changes include improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus
routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on eight routes, three individual implementations of
the SOP, and four changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line level, route/line
block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024

This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the September 2024 runboards
to ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 38 bus route/patterns of RTD’s forthcoming September 2024 runboard. Of this
change, one service met the established threshold for a major service change. The route tabulated below has
proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service and are proposed for the longterm (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Service Adjustments (1 service)

Route 40: Improve headways to 15 minutes weekday
mornings through evenings along the entire route.

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed September 2024 service changes include only the
improvement of service levels of Route 40. This route serves populations in east Denver that are below the
district average of minority populations and just under the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increase
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a slightly lower increase in service
(i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
0.02% less of a benefit than non-low-income areas. However, this difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold. Minority areas received less of an increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.15% less than non-minority areas,
a difference falling below the 10% disparate impact threshold. Thus, a potential disparate impact was identified
at the route level for the changes proposed for Route 40. The systemwide service increases findings mirror the
route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route 40 being the sole major service change.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024

Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (the “Family of Services”) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024

3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2024 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route or rail line. These
proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and
route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).

2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.

RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024
Six public meetings were conducted between June 18-26, 2024. No comments regarding the major service
change were collected during these meetings. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, and number of
attendees.
The Communications and Engagement department produced a recorded webinar and downloadable toolkits,
which were provided to community-based organizations. Efforts were made to increase the use of social media
platforms, and in-system promotional assets were used to inform the public about the service changes. RTD’s
newly formed Impact Team was deployed to inform and gather feedback at stops and stations.
The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com, by phone at
303-299-6000 and by fax at 303-299-2227.

In addition to the public meetings, the Transit Equity Office contacted 67 key public activity centers within a
quarter mile of Route 40. These entities were informed of the proposed major service change, provided with
instructions on how to offer feedback, and encouraged to attend the open houses.
The Transit Equity Office collaborated with three community-based organizations (CBO) to share information
and collect feedback virtually and in-person. Of note, one CBO attended a community event and conducted
direct outreach along the Route 40 corridor. A total of 39 customers responded to the survey administered by
the CBO. Four additional survey responses were collected via the Service Changes website bringing the total
survey responses for the Route 40 to 43. Of these 43 responses, 41.5% stated that the change has no impact
on them, 14.6% indicated it has a somewhat positive impact, and 41.5% stated it is a very positive change.
Table 2 captures the common themes of the feedback received and the total responses.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

Proposed service changes for the September 2024 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in
service were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the route/line individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of disparate impact (for minority populations) or disproportionate burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

For the September 2024 runboard, 32 bus routes and six rail lines will undergo various service changes. Of
these, 6 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 115 total weekday revenue service
hours and 51 additional weekend service hours. While temporary and technically not meeting major
service change requirements, with the ending of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project the discontinuation
of temporary service on the Free MetroRide with reinvestment of its resources into improving Free MallRide
service levels is a combined cost neutral change. The improvement of service on the Free MallRide allows for
service every 5 minutes between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station along an updated alignment
along 15th and 17th Streets. The L Line is also proposed to resume operations downtown in September.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024
A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions

There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed September 2024 runboard.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route, the Route 40, had a proposed major service increase which includes service increases of 25%
or greater. Improved headways are proposed on Route 40 for the September 2024 runboard as outlined in
the RTD Board approval of the Systemwide Optimization Plan (SOP).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential disparate impacts (DI) and/or
disproportionate burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service increases,
the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and lowincome populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the
reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route 40

Proposal: As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP), it is proposed to
implement 15-minute headways weekdays, mornings through evenings, along the full corridor. This also
ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement compliant restroom at each terminal.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Major Service Change Review

As shown in Table 4, a slightly lower percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit
from the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.99% vs. 1.01%,
respectively). However, this difference falls below the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.91%).
Therefore, no potential route-level disproportionate burden is found. However, a lower percentage of the
8

Packet Pg. 582

1.E.1.b

district’s minority population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the nonminority population (0.91% vs. 1.06%, respectively). This difference falls below the 10% disparate
impact threshold (0.95%). Thus, there is a potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring
further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network
level analysis).

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 115 weekday revenue hours
Of the over 31,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented an average share of population compared to district averages. Of this total,
nearly 4,300 low-income people and nearly 10,500 minorities would receive service improvements.
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service increases serves slightly below-average lowincome and minority populations and is not classified as an equity route.

In review of the proposed Route 40 changes at the systemwide level, there is a potential disparate
impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2024 to September 2024 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at
or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas on-low-income
and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and minority
population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2018-2022
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3
The thresholds summarized in Table 4 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The analysis of all service changes identified the following:

Based on existence of the route within the May 2024 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops or
rail stations. 2018-2022 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 6 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations underlying
the bus stops with proposed major service increases proportionally compared to population in the District. There
are no proposed service decreases. The comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be
impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. For
the proposed runboard, systemwide service increases mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route
40 being the sole major service change.
No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for rail services with the September 2024
runboard.

Route 40 comprises the September 2024 runboard’s only major service change
Almost 31,000 people live near Route 40 bus stops. Both minority and low-income populations are
represented at slightly lower shares of the population than district averages (34% and 14%,
respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas benefited 0.02% less
compared to non-low-income areas. However, this difference did not fall below the disproportionate
burden threshold. Minority populations received a lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefited 0.15% less compared
to non-minority areas. This difference fell below the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a systemlevel disparate impact was found with the proposed change
When considering the proposed service increase on Route 40 for the nearly 50,000 people within the
block groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the district overall, minority
populations stand to benefit less compared to non-minority populations. Minority population
areas received 0.37% less of a benefit compared to non-minority areas. The difference was below the
disparate impact threshold by 0.19%; therefore, a potential systemwide disparate impact was
found. Low-income populations received 0.05% less of a benefit than non-low-income
populations. The difference was 0.11% above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden;
therefore, no potential disproportionate burden was found with the proposed service decrease

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024

a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals
Alterations to the initially proposed September 2024 service changes4 include an improvement in service levels
along Route 40 which serves low-income populations at a below average rate than as the District average.
RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 service plan as proposed as there are no practical alternatives
to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The substantial legitimate justification for the
Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) which
recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th and Colorado Station and
Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement
compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the service
improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are significant with
a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of 5 of the 6 minor changes (of the
38 service changes, just those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours) are considered low-income-serving
bus routes and a total of 2 out of 6 are considered minority-serving bus routes. Other minor changes include
improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on 8 routes,
3 individual implementations of the SOP, and 4 changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Replacement
Project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
July 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to concurrently adopt the continuance of the Zero Fare for Youth
(ZFY) program and the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the ZFY proposed fare change to comply
with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Carl Green Jr, Director, Civil Rights Division
Monika Treipl-Harnke, Senior Manager, Revenue
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the May 14, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B. In this circular, the FTA requires transit
agencies, such as RTD, to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those
changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The
continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is required to
be brought before the Board for approval. The complete final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is
included in Attachment A.
During the June 11, 2024, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item regarding
the results of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, with the
intention of continuing the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included
information about increased youth boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for
grant funding through Senate Bill 24-032 (SB032).
DISCUSSION
In adopting the continuance of the ZFY program, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the
Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis and Zero Fare for Youth
Program Continuation

Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change
and final Title VI fare equity analysis. Consequently, the proposed fare change is ready for the Board’s
consideration. The following discussion is divided into six sections outlining the following:

Packet Pg. 616

1. Final Title VI fare equity analysis findings
2. Community outreach activities
3. Feedback on Staff’s recommendation
4. Final recommendation summary
5. Projected youth ridership and forgone fare revenue
6. Implementation
1. Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies, and notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population. As
a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their
average fare with the proposed change. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the
establishment of a longer-term ZFY program following the conclusion of the pilot.
2. Community Outreach Activities
Public outreach events regarding the continuation of the ZFY program were held in conjunction with
public meetings regarding the upcoming September 2024 service changes. RTD hosted five in-person
open houses and one virtual public meeting between June 18-26, 2024, to communicate the proposed
changes, answer questions, and collect feedback from customers, stakeholders, and the community. In
addition to these public meetings, staff were available to answer questions about the proposed
extension of the ZFY program during its participation at community events. The public outreach
activities comport with the Federal Transit Administration’s Title VI Requirements and Guidelines and are
illustrated in Section 7 of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
3. Feedback on Staff’s Recommendation
Through the outreach process, significant support was provided for the continuance of the ZFY program.
The following themes regarding the program were present in the feedback:
•
•
•
•
•

Supports youth in accessing school and work
Benefits families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who
see driving as a more affordable option
Meets climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provides youth with independence and agency
Encourages lifelong transit use

4. Final Recommendation Summary
The Board’s adoption of the proposed fare structure would continue the no-cost fare for youth through
August 31, 2025. For comparison purposes, the tables following provide a summary of the existing pilot
fare structure alongside the fare structure for customers, ages 19 and under, without ZFY.

Fare Structure without ZFY

Incorporated into staff’s recommendation, youth customers would be able to travel to any destination,
including Denver International Airport, at no cost.
5. Projected Youth Ridership and Forgone Fare Revenue
With a ZFY program, youth boardings in 2025 are estimated to be 13.9 million. Estimated youth
ridership for the subsequent years, should a ZFY program continue beyond 2025, is shown in the table
below.

Packet Pg. 618

1.E.1.b

*RTD fares decreased on January 1, 2024
SB032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up
to $5 million to RTD in FY2024-25, provided that the agency applies for the grant. Should RTD apply
and be approved for this grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in
ridership, provide operating support for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for
other expenses necessary to implement and measure the effectiveness of the program. This includes but
is not limited to reasonable marketing expenses and expenses incurred conducting customer surveys.
In addition to the forgone youth revenue estimated above, additional funds will be necessary to continue
the ZFY program for marketing awareness and informational reminders across RTD’s transit network,
language assistance and effective communications, a survey for youth customers or their guardians, and
an annual report. RTD estimates these costs to total approximately $410,000 from September 1, 2024
– August 31, 2025. Therefore, the $5 million in available grant funding is expected to offset forgone
revenue as well as additional expenses continuation of a ZFY program from September 1, 2024 through
August 31, 2025.
6. Implementation
In order to be eligible for state grant funding, RTD will need to apply to the Colorado Energy Office.
Details on the grant program are not yet available, but RTD is working closely with the Colorado Energy
Office to understand the grant terms and process for receiving funding.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As noted in the Discussion section of this report, the recommendation would result in forgone fare
revenue of approximately $2,900,000 as well as estimated costs of $410,000, for a total financial
impact of $3,310,000. The financial impact would be fully offset by the grant established by SB032,
should RTD apply for and be awarded the grant. The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will
not result in any direct or foreseeable financial impacts.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The forgone fare revenue in 2025 due to a ZFY program is estimated to be $2.9 million. Estimated
forgone fare revenue for the subsequent years is shown in the following table.

Final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

May 3, 20241.E.1.b

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
On June 2, 2023, RTD formally requested authorization to proceed with a 12-month Zero Fare for Youth pilot, as
well as a time extension for completing a fare equity analysis of a potential permanent Zero Fare for Youth change
since the pilot extends beyond the normal six-month period allowed under Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
rules. The FTA approved RTD's Title VI Fare Equity Analysis extension request on June 22, 2023, in order to ensure
all critical tasks associated with the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program were completed. This analysis of the Zero
Fare for Youth program was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of
FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare change
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare change.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Change
On July 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new fare structure, policies and programs that included
the one year of no-cost transit for youth throughout the district. The fare changes 1 were developed as part of
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, a yearlong review aimed at creating a fare structure
that is more equitable, affordable and simple. Most of the fare changes were implemented in early 2024.
The Zero Fare for Youth pilot program was made available for youth customers September 2023 through August
2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency or school enrollment, are eligible for participation in
the pilot. RTD is funding the financial impact resulting from implementation of a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program
for the first year. For long-term sustainability, RTD sought out funding partners to support the continuation of the
program after the pilot. RTD will be positioned to adopt this zero-fare offering if funding is secured.
In January 2024, Colorado lawmakers introduced Senate Bill (SB) 24-032 Methods to Increase the Use of Transit.
SB-032, which passed in May 2024 and was subsequently signed into law, specifically appropriates up to $5 million

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 2, 2024

On May 14, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the draft
results of the equity analysis for the ZFY program pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the FTA
Circular 4702.1B. The continuance of the ZFY program meets the definition of a fare change. Thus, an analysis is
required to be brought before the Board for consideration and approval.
On June 11, 2024, staff presented a discussion item to the Finance and Planning Committee regarding the results
of the 12-month pilot program from September 1, 2023 through August 31, 2024 with the intention of continuing
the ZFY program for the following school year. The discussion item included information about increased youth
boardings, estimated forgone youth revenue, and the potential for grant funding through SB 24-032.
Staff have now completed the community outreach and public comment for the proposed fare change and final
Title VI fare equity analysis. Thereby, the proposed fare change to continue the ZFY program will be brought
forward on July 23, 2024 for the Board’s consideration and approval.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 2 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.

grant, funds can be used to offset expenses associated with an increase in ridership, provide operating support
for its transit operations and general transit programs, and to pay for other expenses necessary to implement and
measure the effectiveness of the program.

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.
RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).

July 2, 2024

Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

4 Fare Equity Analysis Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected. 3 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 4
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority

or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

4.1 Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction
Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the 2019 CSS sample size was smaller than
the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption, which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes. The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any ridership
changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure of rider sensitivity to changes in fare
rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions are essential to modeling anticipated
ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but are often excluded from fare equity analyses.
Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a segment of customers prior to a fare
change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in average fare. This calculation becomes
unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract new customers to the system or from
other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to compare the average fare impacts of the fare
changes on the same segment of customers after the change in pricing and policies.

Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 2, 2024

For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys. RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger
sample of completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic
fare adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched
– MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers.

4.1.2 Demographic Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the
limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.
The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, because 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

1.E.1.b
July 2, 2024

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

4.1.3 Additional Average Fare Analysis Assumptions
Assumptions were made regarding the impact of the Zero Fare for Youth program on the EcoPass programs;
namely, the Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass program customers. The EcoPass programs are universal pass
programs, where all (or the vast majority) of a business, neighborhood or college are required to participate. By
having a large group of participants with varying levels of utilization of the system under a single contract, RTD
can continue to charge the contracted entity only for those trips that are taken. But when that cost is spread
across a large group of customers, it results in a relatively affordable rate per customer. In all three cases, the
utilization of the system multiplied by a fare rate is the fundamental determinant of contract pricing, although the
specific calculation steps differ slightly for each Pass Program.
With the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth policy, the utilization of younger customers eligible for the Zero
Fare for Youth program is expected to be excluded from the Pass Program pricing calculation, thereby resulting in
a lower contract amount. For a number of the Neighborhood EcoPass contracts and nearly all CollegePass
contracts, this is expected to result in a notable decrease in future contract pricing. For business EcoPass, some
small contract pricing impacts may be felt however past survey data has suggested that the share of participating
employees that are 19 years of age or younger is a relatively small share.
However, the benefits of the lower contract pricing cannot be easily attributed to any given individual because
pass program participants do not pay on a per-boarding basis, and may not pay for their EcoPass at all. For
example, with the CollegePass program, if 30% of a college community was eligible for the Zero Fare for Youth
program, any assessment of equity impacts would need to know whether the College planned to reduce the per
student CollegePass fee by 30% for all participating students (regardless of age) or planned to allow students 19
years of age and under to opt out of the fee, with the remaining students covering the remainder of the contract
amount (which may increase their CollegePass price). Depending on the decision, these can have markedly
different financial outcomes on individual participants, and these decisions fall to the participating colleges, not
to RTD. In the case of business EcoPass, a number of employers fully subsidize the cost of EcoPass and employees
do not pay anything for their use of the transit system; in these cases, any change in EcoPass pricing related to the
introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program would not have any impact on the per-boarding cost to
employees, it would only impact the overall cost to the employer. Further, with little detail on specific
demographics by contract and by age group, assessing per customer demographic impacts is not possible.

For this reason, the average fare analysis assumes that there are no changes in the average fare for the business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass programs. It is likely that at least some participants in these
programs will benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction of the Zero Fare for Youth program over
time however, given that participants in these programs do not pay on a per-boarding basis, that the distribution
of benefits can vary widely across Pass Program participants, and that the demographic makeup of individual Pass
Program contracts is not known, the analysis cannot fairly assess potential changes in the average fare.

Final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

May 3, 20241.E.1.b

The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

African-American/Black
Asian/Pacific Islander
Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin
Hispanic/Latino
Native American/Indian
Other (please specify)

5.2 Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.
Table 1 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 2 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

5.3 Ridership Demographics
Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 3 presents the fare
payment type by minority and income status.

Final Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

May 3, 20241.E.1.b

As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project, the public expressed strong support for a zero
fare for youth pilot. Based on this feedback, staff determined it would be beneficial for the pilot to align with the
2023-24 school year. The proposed fare change is summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD launched a Zero Fare for Youth pilot program for a period of up to 12-months beginning September 1, 2023
and lasting through August 31, 2024. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, are eligible for
participation in the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot
would likely be supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding
partners. A permanent Zero Fare for Youth program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable,
external funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70%
discount on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program is intended as a pilot, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare
Analysis assumes that the fare pricing for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full
fare before and after the pilot. For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 4 in
Section 6.2.

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
The following is a summary of themes across the feedback received.

7.1 Fare Study Public Outreach Overview
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement, customers and community members had the opportunity to
provide feedback on the recommended changes to the fare structure, policies and programs through public
comment. The public comment period was open from April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:
●

●

Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.

July 2, 2024

A kickoff media event occurred on August 8, 2023, at the Chestnut Pavilion Denver Union Station with the
following speakers: Debra A. Johnson General Manager and CEO of RTD, Denver Councilwoman Amanda Sawyer,
District 5, Denver Public Schools Board Member Scott Baldermann, District 1, RTD Board Chair Lynn Guissinger,
District O, RTD Board Director Kate Williams, District A.
Staff convened virtual informational meetings with public school districts on August 21, 2023 and August 24, 2023.
These meetings were held with staff representatives from Adams 12, Adams 14, Adams County, Aurora, Boulder
Valley, Brighton, Cherry Creek, Denver, Douglas County, Englewood, Jeffco, Littleton, Mapleton, St. Vrain Valley,
Westminster. The meetings served as an opportunity to provide an overview of the pilot program, seek
administrative support for program evaluation, respond to questions and garner feedback.
RTD implemented a comprehensive marketing and outreach strategy that featured distinctive creative assets to
inform and engage both existing customers and the wider public about the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. The
multi-faceted approach combined digital and social media, a dedicated webpage 5, in-system assets, public
relations efforts, community engagement, partnerships, and paid media, to effectively communicate the benefits
of public transit while encouraging a positive shift in riding habits in the short and long term. To garner direct
feedback from youth and families, RTD administered surveys, virtually and in-person, between October 16, 2023
and March 15, 2024. The survey consisted of questions about youth and/or family travel behaviors and
experiences using RTD services, thoughts on the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program and general information. The
online survey was available in English and Spanish and offered the chance to win a $25 King Soopers gift card for
up to 20 participants. Appendix A provides the full Zero Fare for Youth Survey Analysis Report.
Staff phoned and emailed 105 private schools, 124 youth-serving organizations, 39 recreation centers and 40
libraries to promote the pilot program, distribute English and Spanish toolkits and disseminate surveys to families
who may be using RTD services during the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Outreach to these entities were
carried out in two phases. The first occurred between October-November 2023 and second occurred between
January-June 2024.
Table 6 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of participants.

7.4 Changes to Proposal
Overall, public comments demonstrate immense support for the proposed fare change. Additionally, no items of
significant concern were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its
impacts on the community is necessary. As such, no changes were proposed to the ZFY program continuation
recommendation, and the final Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented on July 23, 2024 to the RTD Board of
Directors for review and adoption.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings

The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes are targeted specifically to Youth customers, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all
customers and minority customers and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5%
policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income
customers to a greater degree than all customers. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.

8.1 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, and
notes that minority and low-income customers benefit more than the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers benefit to a greater extent than the overall population in the
Average Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by rider
category. The share of Youth customers that are minority and low-income are higher than the other rider
categories. It is important to recognize that a key assumption in the analysis is that Youth customer demographics
align with the demographics of Local, Full Fare customers, as outlined in Section 4.1.2. The methodology of the
2019 CSS specifically avoided targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this customer group is
underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the survey. This leaves open the
possibility that the demographics of Youth customers are different than what was assumed in the analysis, which
would change the results of the Average Fare Analysis. Without any comprehensive survey data on the
demographics of RTD Youth customers, the assumption is used for the Average Fare Analysis.
Appendix B provides the detailed tables that show the average fare for each rider category and fare payment type
under the current and proposed fare structure. A summary overview of the findings resulting from the change,
including the Average Fare per Boarding, Absolute Change and Percentage Change are presented in Table 7 with
the following description:
●

Changes that represent a greater percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., more beneficial
for minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in green.

●

Changes that represent a lesser percentage decrease than the overall population (i.e., less beneficial for
minority and/or low-income customers) are highlighted in yellow.

●

Changes that are outside the Disparate Impact/Disproportionate Burden threshold (+5%) are highlighted
in light / deep red.

8.1.1 Key Findings
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.01 per boarding for all customers, $0.92 for minority customers (9% lower than for all customers)
and $0.80 for low-income customers (21% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a greater decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 5.2% decrease in their average fare per
boarding and low-income customers experience a 5.1% decrease, compared with a 4.2% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population.

●

No groups are anticipated to see an increase in their average fare with the proposed changes.

●

As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the analysis assumes no change in the average fare paid by participants in
the three EcoPass programs (business EcoPass, neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass). It is likely that
participants in these programs will eventually benefit from lower contract pricing with the introduction
of the Zero Fare for Youth program, but given that (1) students in these programs do not pay on a perboarding basis, (2) organizations have some discretion as to how to apply contract pricing reductions, and
(3) with little detail on specific demographics by contract and by age group, the analysis cannot fairly
assess potential changes in the average fare. By assuming no change in the average fare for the Pass
Programs, the analysis is likely conservative and understates the fare reduction benefits of the Zero Fare
for Youth program.

8.1.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 8 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $0.97 to $0.92, a 5.2% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is 1%, indicating that
minority customers are expected to benefit somewhat more than all customers as a result of the proposed fare
changes. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare
changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.05 to $1.01, a 4.2% decrease. The percentage

9 Cumulative Findings and Mitigations
Zero Fare for Youth aims to enhance the lives of RTD customers and communities by reducing transportation costs
for families. By inviting youth ages 19 and under to ride the bus and train at no cost, the program seeks to remove
barriers to education and employment, while creating access to destinations across the metro Denver region.
The proposed fare change for a permanent no cost fare for youth ages 19 and under do not appear to create any
Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear to create any Disproportionate Burdens on lowincome communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order to proceed with the implementation of the
proposed fare change.

10 Next Steps
It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
change upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
[This section will be completed once RTD’s Board of Directors has been made aware and considered this equity
analysis.]

difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%

1.E.1.b

The development of the Zero Fare for Youth survey effort began in Summer 2023. Originally, this effort
was to include a pre, mid, and post-test survey of a randomly selected group of students and their
families. To achieve this and considering it would be inappropriate for RTD to have access to school
contact lists, RTD sought out partnerships with numerous local school districts that would facilitate and
administer the survey’s distribution to the selected families. A representative sampling plan (by
enrollment) was developed by RTD and each district was provided with a random number sequence as
well as detailed instructions on how to apply these number sequences to their contact lists to select
the participating families. Unfortunately, engagement with all but one of the district representatives
seemingly ceased upon distribution of the random selection number sequences.
In an attempt to continue the collection of feedback and experiences of youth taking advantage of the
Zero Fare for Youth pilot, RTD decided to distribute this survey instrument to numerous youth-serving
organizations, recreation centers and libraries across RTD’s service area. At this point, the survey
ceased to be randomly selected, and became a self-selection study.
It should be noted that while the data collected in this effort is still valid feedback directly from RTD
customers and youths participating in Zero Fare for Youth pilot, and while general reporting and
comparative analysis can be and was performed on this data, predictive statistical analysis could not
be performed as this study did not contain a random sample of participants.
The survey itself consists of 31 questions and gathered feedback and information on: rider experience,
individual and household transit habits, and personal as well as household demographics. A total of
232 surveys were completed and the reporting and analysis of the survey responses are provided in
the next section.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2024 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

March 13, 2024

March 26, 2024
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for May 2024
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling Division
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 37 service changes proposed for May 2024 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail operators to
select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the agency’s transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD
System Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964: benefits and services are provided
without regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a

disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The May 2024 service change
proposal includes two major service changes out of 37 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be
brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report is
included in Attachment A.

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150
percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 31 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming May 2024 service change.
Of these 37 changes, two services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25 percent greater
than that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those
routes are shown in bold in the following table.

1.E.1.b

Summary of Findings:
• Potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route
level: of the two routes/lines that had major service changes, one route (the Free MetroRide) had
a potential disparate impact finding and one route (the Free MallRide) had a disproportionate
burden finding.
•

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate, at the system level, to
determine overall impacts to equity (i.e., minority and low-income) populations compared to nonequity (i.e., non-minority and non-low-income) populations.
o

At the system level, service decrease on the Free MallRide stands to impact minority
populations less than non-minority populations (0.39% vs. 0.82%, respectively). The
difference does not surpass the disparate impact threshold of 0.90%. Therefore, no
systemwide level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service
decrease. However, low-income populations stand to be impacted more than non-lowincome populations (1.07% vs. 0.59%, respectively). The difference exceeds the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 0.65%. Therefore, a system level disproportionate
burden is found with the proposed major service decrease.

o

At the system level, reinstatement of the Free MetroRide stands to benefit minority
populations less than non-minority populations (0.20% vs. 0.24%, respectively). This
difference meets the disparate impact threshold of 0.21%. Therefore, a system level
disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service increase. Conversely,
low-income populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income populations (0.47%
vs. 0.19%, respectively). The difference is above the 10% disproportionate burden
threshold of 0.17%. Therefore, no system level disproportionate burden is found with the
proposed major service increase.

Conclusion:
Although the two major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact and a disproportionate
burden at both the route and system level, RTD recommends keeping the May 2024 service plan as
proposed as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Free
MetroRide) and disproportionate burden (Free MallRide). The substantial legitimate justification for the
Free MallRide service reduction is evident as this change is due to ongoing construction on the 16th
Street Mall and the Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project. Moreover, the Free MetroRide
service increase will be utilized as a mitigation measure (i.e., providing customers with alternative
connection between Denver Union Station and the Central Business District) due to the downtown rail
reconstruction project, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the reinstatement.

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level and system level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or
income.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2024

This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the May 2024 runboards to
ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 31 bus route/patterns and six rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming May 2024 runboard. Of
these 37 changes, two services meet established thresholds for a major service change. Although meeting the
threshold of 25% for a major service change, the suspension of the L Line during downtown rail reconstruction
project will be a temporary change in service during the May 2024 runboard and will be reinstated in September
2024; this proposed service change falls below the threshold of major service changes based on timeline of the
change. The routes tabulated below have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of
baseline service and will remain in effect for 12 or more months.
Service Adjustments (1 service)

Free MallRide: Reduce service to 10-minute headways

Service Reinstatement (1 service)

Free MetroRide: Reinstate in accordance with System
Optimization Plan and to provide alternate services during
downtown rail reconstruction project

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed May 2024 service changes include a reduction of service on
the Free MallRide and reinstatement of the Free MetroRide previously suspended in April 2020. These routes
both serve high concentrations of low-income populations in central Denver.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of a major service increase
and as a proportion to the District overall, low-income populations received a greater increase in service (i.e.,
were more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received 0.28%
more of a benefit than non-low-income areas. However, minority areas received less of an increase in service
(i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.01% less
than non-minority areas. For population within the service area impacted by a service decrease, low-income
areas were impacted more than non-low-income areas. Low-income areas were negatively impacted 0.48%
more than non-low-income areas. Conversely, minority areas were less impacted than non-minority areas,
receiving 0.43% less of an impact from service decreases compared to non-minority areas.
Finally, a potential disparate impact and a potential disproportionate burden were identified at the individual
route-level: the Free MallRide had a potential disproportionate burden finding and the Free MetroRide had a
potential disparate impact finding.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2024

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without

populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles

1.E.1.b

a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10
percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the May 2024 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).

1.E.1.b

RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview
Three public meetings were conducted March 6-7, 2024. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 97 key public activity centers surrounding the routes/lines to inform them of the proposed major
service changes, how to provide feedback and encourage community members to attend the open houses.
Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’
comments pertaining to the two major service changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis

Proposed service changes for the May 2024 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service were
categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior (current)
network using 2018-2022 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2024
For the May 2024 runboard, 31 bus routes will undergo various service changes. Of these, 5 routes will see
combined increases in bus service of over 56 total weekday revenue service hours and 62 additional
weekend service hours. While cancelling each other out, the decrease in service on the Free MallRide with
reinvestment of its resources into reinstating the previously suspended Free Metro Ride service both exceed the
major service change threshold. The reduction on the Free MallRide allows for 90 new weekday revenue service
hours for the Free MetroRide, providing another option between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions
The Free MallRide is proposed to have reduced service in light of continuing construction work on the downtown
16th Street Mall and in anticipation of the downtown rail reconstruction project. The service hours reduced on
the Free MallRide are proposed to be reinvested to reinstate the Free MetroRide.
The L Line is proposed to be temporarily suspended due to Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project
during the May 2024 runboard but will be reinstated prior to the September 2024 runboard.

Major Service Change Increases
One bus route had a proposed major service increase which includes service increases of 25% or greater. The
reinstatement of the Free MetroRide is proposed for the May 2024 runboard to mitigate impacts of the
downtown rail reconstruction project and provide additional service through downtown.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Free MallRide

Proposal: Due to ongoing construction work on the 16th Street Mall and in anticipation of downtown rail
reconstruction project, it is proposed to reduce frequencies on the Free MallRide to 10-minute headways
from every 5 minutes. This change will free up operator resources to reinstate Free MetroRide service,
the reinstatement of which will also help mitigate impacts of the rail reconstruction project.
As shown in Table 3, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income population stands to be impacted
by the proposed major service decrease as compared to non-low-income population (0.75% vs. 0.43%,
respectively). This difference exceeds the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.47%). Therefore, a
potential route-level disproportionate burden is found requiring further examination (i.e., access to key
public service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis). However, a lower
percentage of the District’s minority population is impacted from the proposed major service decrease as
compared to the non-minority population (0.36% vs. 0.56%, respectively). This difference falls below
the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.62%). Thus, there is no disparate impact found at the route level.

Free MetroRide

Proposal: In accordance with the System Optimization Plan, ongoing 16th Mall construction and in
anticipation of downtown rail reconstruction project, reinstatement of the Free MetroRide service is
recommended to give customers alternative connection between Denver Union Station and the Central
Business District.
As shown in Table 4, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income population stands to benefit from
the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.81% vs. 0.50%,
respectively). This difference does not meet the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.45%).

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average District thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 55 weekday revenue hours
Of the over 31,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher share of population than District averages. Of this total, nearly
8,500 low-income people would receive service improvements
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The two bus routes with major service changes both serve above-average low-income
populations and are classified as low-income routes

In review of the Free MallRide and Free MetroRide at the systemwide level, there are potential
disproportionate burden and disparate impact findings, respectively.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the January 2024 to May 2024 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas on-low-income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and
minority population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity
versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential
adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2018-2022
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3
The thresholds summarized in Table 5 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 5 summarizes the change in service for block group population underlying the
bus stops with proposed major service decreases proportionally compared to population in the District, while
Table 6 summarizes impacted block group population for major service increases. These comparisons review
the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall
equity composition of the District overall. No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for
rail services with the May 2024 runboard.

Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.

The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to

The systemwide service modifications proposed between January 2024 and May 2024 include schedule
adjustments, suspension of school trips, changes to summer schedules and trip availability and additional service.
The major service changes were entirely focused on bus services with a major service decrease on the Free
MallRide and a major service increase on the Free MetroRide.
Route-level Findings:

•

Of the 37 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, 2 had potential findings.
The Free MallRide has a potential disproportionate burden finding due to low-income
populations receiving +0.32% more impact than non-low-income populations. Minority populations
received 0.20% less of an impact than non-minority populations.
The Free MetroRide has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving
0.16% less benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations benefited 0.31% more than
non-low-income populations.

Systemwide-level Findings:
•
•

•

The Free MallRide and Free MetroRide comprise the May 2024 runboard’s systemwide major service
decreases and increases, respectively.
For the proposed service increase on the Free MetroRide, of the almost 6,900 people located within the
block groups that include the route’s stops, low-income population represented a higher share of the
population than District averages, indicating targeted services to low-income populations. Low-income
populations received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more)
compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas benefited 0.28% more compared to
non-low-income areas. However, minority populations received a lower increase in service
(were less positively impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas
benefited 0.03% less compared to non-minority areas. This difference met the disparate impact
threshold; therefore, a system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed change.
When considering the proposed service decrease on the Free MallRide for the demographics within the
block groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the District overall, minority
populations were impacted less compared to non-minority populations. Minority population
areas received 0.15% less of an impact compared to non-minority areas. This was below the disparate

impact threshold; therefore, no systemwide disparate impact was found. However, low-income
populations as a received 0.38% more of an impact than non-low-income populations. This
was above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden; therefore, a potential disproportionate
burden was found with the proposed service decrease.
Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed May 2024 service changes4 include reduction of service on the Free MallRide
and reinstatement of the Free MetroRide, both of which serve low-income populations at rates higher than the
District average.
RTD recommends keeping the May 2024 service plan as proposed as there are no practical alternatives to
avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Free MetroRide) and disproportionate burden (Free MallRide).
The substantial legitimate justification for the Free MallRide service reduction is evident as this change is due to
the ongoing construction work on the 16th Street Mall and the Near-Term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
Moreover, the Free MetroRide service increase will be utilized as a mitigation measure (i.e., providing customers
with alternative connection between Denver Union Station and the Central Business District) due to the
downtown rail reconstruction project. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the
reinstatement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits of the proposed service plan to customers are significant, with a
greater benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of 13 of the 16 minor changes are
considered minority bus routes and a total of 10 out of 16 are considered low-income bus routes. These minor
changes include improvements to on-time performance for 14 bus routes, stops being added to one bus route
to improve operations and transit access and the introduction of all-day service to one bus route to mitigate
impacts on rail service due to construction.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 12, 2023

July 25, 2023
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September 2023
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service change recommendations for September 2023 provide opportunities for bus and rail
operators to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several service change recommendations reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for service change recommendations continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to enhance
service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and environmental justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, all service changes that exceed the
established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2023 service
change recommendations include one major service change out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted
the Title VI Program Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change recommendations for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends changes to 26 bus routes and two rail lines in the forthcoming September 2023
runboard. Of these 26 changes, one service has recommended additions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service, thus meeting established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the table below.
Modified Services (eight services)

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group and network level to identify potential disparities in service changes based
on race/ethnicity or income.

required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis
report is included in Attachment A.

Summary of Findings:

Packet Pg. 750

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes
with a major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of
the population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income
populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major
service change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a
greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-low-income
populations. Low-income areas benefited 1.19% more compared to non-low-income areas.
Therefore, no disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, minority populations received a
slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas. This difference
meets the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a system-level disparate impact was found with
the recommended change.

Conclusions:
Although only one major service change resulted in a potential disparate impact at the route and network
level, Title VI concerns are minimal when comparing the service changes between the May 2023 and
September 2023 runboards. Additionally, low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations.
Moreover, the Route GS reinstatement increases access to key public service destinations. Overall, the
minor changes (modified services) have positively impacted equity populations slightly more than nonequity populations.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. Staff will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change recommendations and will recommend adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2023

This document summarizes the analysis of service changes between the May 2023 and September 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 26 bus route/patterns in the forthcoming September 2023 runboard. Of these changes,
one service meets established thresholds for a major service change. The route listed below has proposed service
adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services being eliminated.
Service Reinstatement (one service)

GS – Golden / Boulder: Reinstate service on the GS (Golden
/ Boulder) with four trips in each direction.

Findings

Alterations to the proposed September 2023 service changes include reinstatement of the GS route between
Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder. This route serves a high concentration of low-income
populations.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of this route with a major service change and as a
proportion to the district overall, low-income equity populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were
more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas had a +1.19% benefit
above non-low-income areas. Minority areas received a lower increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations.
Finally, a potential disparate impact was identified, but no potential disproportionate burden at the route and
network level.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver
metropolitan area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit
service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental
justice.

Executive Summary

Packet Pg. 755

1.E.1.b

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs
receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes proposed to occur between the May 2023
and September 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase via reinstatement
of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the
route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts on the communities RTD
serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include adding new routes/lines, eliminating existing routes/lines and changing the alignment and trip
frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes needed to
meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit
system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify underperforming services and
recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised
Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics to identify underperforming

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes
but is not limited to eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households at or below 150% of the
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2023
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2017 to 2021 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis include route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts on district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2023 runboard analyzed whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional
differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line
proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for the population within the district is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on
150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based
on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of the total population. The service area was based on the collection of
block groups within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter-mile catchment area centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of the census
block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block
group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block
group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted May 15-16, 2023. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 14 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,
number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the three major service
changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis

Proposed service changes for the September 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
network using 2017-2021 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to individually review the routes/lines. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations). It was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, 26 bus routes will undergo service changes.
Of these, five routes will see a total increase of bus service by over 45 total weekday revenue service
hours. Changes to Route GS exceeded the major service change by being a reinstatement of previously
suspended service; it accounts for 12 of the additional daily revenue service hours.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations: a service reduction of 25% or more
Major Service Increases/Restructuring: service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
No major reductions/eliminations.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route had major service changes, which included service increases of 25% or greater. This includes the
reinstatement of service to Route GS, considered a major service change, and is therefore included in the review.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis

Having identified the service changes that meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route or line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts
In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each major service change route were reviewed for
potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The

Route GS - Boulder/Golden

Proposal: Reinstate route pattern with four northbound trips at 7:02 a.m., 8:22 a.m., 3:37 p.m. and 4:39
p.m., between Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder Station. It is also proposed to reinstate
four southbound trips at 7:10 a.m., 8:19 a.m., 4:36 p.m. and 5:13 p.m., between Downtown Boulder
Station and Federal Center Station.
As shown in Table 5, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority population (1.07% vs. 0.44%,
respectively). This difference exceeds (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.96%).
Therefore, a potential route-level disparate impact is found, requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement, and network-level analysis). However, a
higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed Major
Service Increase as compared to the higher-income population (1.68% vs. 0.55%, respectively). This
difference does not exceed (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.50%). Thus, there is no
disproportionate burden at the line-level.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2023

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a network-level analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analysis. A network-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts and identify structural issues in areas requiring further review.
Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or greater
(additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes experienced
service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major service changes are
later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels (block groups within route
service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 43 weekday revenue hours.
Of the over 25,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher population share than district averages. Of this cumulative
figure, over 12,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.
At the network level, equity routes and non-equity routes 1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average low-income
populations.

In the review of Route GS at the network level, there is a potential disparate impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2023 to September 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups, whereas non-low-income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.
Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.3%) and
minority population (36.9%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the district 2. Using the 2017-2021
5-Year ACS Estimates, the total population residing within these block groups was calculated, as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the district-wide lowincome and minority rates that set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average. While
the percent minority figure of 36.9% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.049 million)
the low-income population percentage of 14.3% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure (3.005
million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine 3. The
thresholds summarized in Table 6 yielded 831 (38% of all) block groups above the district average for lowincome population, and 830 (38%) block groups above the district average for minority populations.

The proposed major service change was examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
on underlying populations. Table 7 summarizes the change in service for the block group population within onequarter mile of bus stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to the population in the
district. This comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service
changes compared to the overall equity composition of the district. No major changes were proposed for rail
services with the September 2023 runboard.

For system-level bus service changes, minority populations stand to benefit slightly less than non-minority
populations (0.44% vs. 1.07%, respectively). The difference meets the Disparate Impact Threshold of 0.96%.
Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service changes. Lowincome populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income income populations (1.68% vs. 0.55%
respectively), with low-income areas benefitting 1.19% more than non-low-income areas. Therefore, no systemlevel disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service changes.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above-average low-income and minority block groups within the district
and highlight the bus route with a major service change (orange). Route GS is currently suspended and is

include schedule adjustments, changes to summer schedules and trip availability, additional trips and longer
service spans. The major service change increase was entirely invested in bus service. No major rail service
changes or service reductions were included.
Route-level Findings:

Of the 26 total services with proposed changes, one had a potential disparate impact finding.
Route GS has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.52% less of a
benefit than non-minority populations.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether an alternative would
serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that no alternatives
would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or a disproportionate burden on low-income
customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed September 2023 service changes 4 include the reinstatement of Route GS,
which serves low-income populations at a rate higher than the district average.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s ongoing pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty serve as
justification for maintaining the September 2023 service changes proposal.

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes with a
major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a greater increase
in service (were positively impacted more) compared to higher income populations

•

Low-income areas benefited +1.19% more compared to higher-income areas

•

Minority populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less)
compared to non-minority populations

•

Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas meeting the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore a system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed change

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

July 25, 2023
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the Systemwide Fare
Study and Equity Analysis recommended fare changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and
guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The FTA defines a fare
change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation of new
fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.). The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis
includes proposed fare changes that meet this definition. Thus, an analysis is required to be brought
before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report is included in
Attachment A.
RTD’s Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted the Title VI Program
Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating
fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which difference
shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

Board Meeting Date:

Packet Pg. 793

1.E.1.b

If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
Staff presented the draft recommendation for fare structure changes and the draft Title VI fare equity
analysis at the April 11, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting (see attached Board materials).
Subsequently, staff released the draft fare equity analysis to the public for comment in tandem with the
draft recommendation release. There were no associated changes made to the draft recommendation
following the final public comment period.
The following discussion is divided into two sections:
• Final draft Title VI fare equity analysis of proposed fare changes
• Final public outreach and engagement efforts
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis of Proposed Fare Changes
In accordance with Title VI and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducted an equity analysis of the
proposed fare changes to ensure that they do not unfairly impact people of color and low-income
populations. The changes proposed as part the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis, include a
fare restructuring and price reduction, establishment of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, introduction
of a Bulk Purchase Program, establishment of a Semester Pass Program, introduction of fare capping and
expansion of eligibility for RTD’s low-income fare discount program (LiVE).
The analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary
paratransit services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI
evaluation requirements. The introduction of expanded retail opportunities for the MyRide fare collection
system beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets is not included in this analysis as RTD is still in the process of
procuring retail expansion opportunities. The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail
opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is an examination of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed
by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes,
which difference shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership.
A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the United States
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Packet Pg. 794

Lastly, this analysis does not include the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program. Per the FTA, promotional
fare reductions or pilots are excluded from being subject to a fare equity analysis if the pilot does not
last longer than six months. On June 22, 2023, FTA officials approved RTD’s request to extend the pilot
beyond the six-month period permitted under current federal regulation to a 12-month period, through
the end of the 2023-2024 school year and concluding August 31, 2024. If Zero Fare for Youth is sought
to be made permanent beyond the pilot period, a fare equity analysis is required to be completed prior to
the permanent fare change and will need Board approval.
Methodology:
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated
from passenger surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately
more likely to use the mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the
fare change.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
i.
Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
ii.
Review fares before the change and after the change;
iii.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
iv.
Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users.
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a
determination is made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit the overall population, including
non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both groups
experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat more
than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However, the fare changes do
not represent a disparate impact on minority customers as the percentage point difference in
percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5%
threshold. Therefore, the proposed fare changes do not present a disparate impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare decrease compared to all customers. While both
groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit
somewhat more than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. However,
the fare changes do not represent a disproportionate burden on low-income customers as the
percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed fare changes

1.E.1.b

Conclusions:
The average fare analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI
Policies. While changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for
some populations, the aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers
and between all customers and low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The
proposed fare changes are expected to benefit minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser
degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits does not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As
such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes
based on the average fare analysis.
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI fare
equity analysis, RTD has integrated equity focused improvements and targeted programs benefitting
minority and low-income populations as part of the draft recommendation. This includes LiVE expansion,
Transit Assistance Grant program, Semester Pass opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions and the zero fare for youth pilot. Additionally, RTD has planned efforts to expand access to
MyRide retail opportunities as well as increase outreach activities to promote the LiVE Program through
partnerships with community-based organizations.
Final Public Outreach and Engagement Efforts
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter III.5-6, RTD must promote inclusive public participation,
provide meaningful access to limited English proficient persons, and perform appropriate methods to
facilitate the public comment and community engagement process. The final public engagement
activities and public hearings comport with the federal guidelines and are illustrated in Section 7 of the
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
This analysis of the fare changes proposed as part the recent Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis that
includes a fare restructuring and price reduction, introduction of fare capping and expansion of eligibility for RTD’s
low-income fare discount program (“LiVE”) was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV
and Appendix K of FTA Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed fare changes for fixed-route services
would result in either Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. The proposed fare changes being presented by RTD are the basis of this Fare Equity Analysis. The
analysis does not consider fare changes to Access-a-Ride services, which provide complementary paratransit
services within the RTD service area, as they are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The Average Fare Analysis conducted as part of this Fare Equity Analysis found that the proposed fare changes
would not result in a Disparate Impact on minority customers or Disproportionate Burden on low-income
customers. Given that there were no findings of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden, no mitigations are
needed to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

In 2021, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) initiated the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (the
study) in response to feedback from customers and stakeholders that RTD fares are expensive and difficult to
understand. To address those issues, RTD launched the study to examine its fares holistically, taking into
consideration the three study goals of equity, affordability and simplicity. These goals have provided direction for
the overall study, guided the development and evaluation of alternatives and will be used to determine success.
RTD has taken a customer-centric approach to the study, with opportunities for customers as well as stakeholders
and community members to help shape the direction of the study. The study has included three distinct phases
of engagement to gather customer and community input and share updates on progress. The first phase, held in
spring 2022, was undertaken to identify challenges with the current fare system and to receive input on fare
structure preferences. The second phase, held in summer 2022, provided an overview of the customer and
stakeholder feedback heard during the first phase, as well as the conceptual fare options that were under
consideration and in the process for evaluating them. Phase 3 was conducted in fall 2022 to receive feedback on
the two fare structure alternatives that were developed and being considered. Final public engagement and public
hearings will be held between April 2023 and June 2023.
All of the engagement phases included customer and community meetings, three feedback panels aimed at larger
groups of constituents, focus groups with community-based organizations and a number of other methods of
providing feedback including two online surveys, a study website and social media posts. To ensure a communitydriven process, the study focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Partnerships were
formed with six community-based organizations to assist in reaching their respective clients, and included specific
focus groups with their clients.
The proposed alternative was developed based on feedback received on the two fare structure alternatives in the
third phase. The proposed fare changes include a number of structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well
as changes to current pass programs, new pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including
the introduction of fare capping. The proposed alternative does not include changes that were implemented prior
to July 2022 and examined under a separate Fare Equity Analysis. Tables 1-4 summarize the proposed fare
changes, which include fare structure and pricing changes, LiVE Program changes, pass program changes, and
implementation of a Transit Assistance Grant Program and a College Semester Pass. More information about the
proposed fare changes is found in Section 6.

New/Change

Elimination

● Lowered 3-Hour, Day Pass and Monthly Pass pricing.

● Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare
category. Customers would pay a flat fare for all travel
except for trips originating or ending at Denver
International Airport.

● Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly
(calendar) fare capping for full fare customers, seniors,
individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth
using MyRide stored value with MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card.
● Lowered Monthly Pass price, with the breakeven
multiple for the full fare Monthly Pass reduced from 38
times the price of a 3-Hour Pass to 32 times the price
of a 3-Hour Pass, resulting in an $88.00 Monthly Pass
and monthly fare cap.
● One Monthly Pass price for customers paying
discounted fares with an increased discount on the
Monthly Pass to 70%, effectively lowering the
breakeven multiple for Monthly Pass and monthly fare
cap for seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients and LiVE customers to 20 times the 3-Hour
Pass price ($27.00).

● For customers paying discounted fares, a single price
fare level for all travel, including trips originating or
ending at Denver International Airport.
● Elimination of the discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books for
full fare customers, seniors, individuals with disabilities
and Medicare recipients. Existing LiVE and youth 10Ride Ticket Books do not include a discount, so no
changes are proposed to these customers’ 10-Ride
Ticket Books.
● Elimination of mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books.

● One Monthly Pass valid for travel anywhere in the
service area including the Airport; no higher price pass
required for Regional and Airport customers. For
customers using fare capping through MyRide Barcode
in the MyRide App or MyRide Smart Card, Local and
Airport fares paid will contribute towards the $88.00
calendar monthly fare cap.

3 Title VI Policies
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on minority and
low-income populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating
major service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes
have discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on minority populations and/or Disproportionate
Burdens on low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 1 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an on-going process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2022
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact Policy and
Disproportionate Burden Policy. The Board of Directors adopted the Title VI Policies concurrent with the adoption
of their 2022 Title VI Program Update. The policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes is found in
Section 3.1.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.

RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.
These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether minority and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and by inference, whether the overall
ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (minority and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes, which shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all
persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare
changes, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A
low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a fare change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation
of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for
transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a fare equity analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Spare the Air Days”, or temporary fare
reductions that are mitigating measures for other activities such as construction, or promotional fare reductions,
so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media. The results of analysis provided in this report uses RTD’s adopted thresholds
for determining Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burdens.

1.E.1.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, or on certain transit modes,
or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated from passenger
surveys indicating whether minority and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the
mode of service, payment type or payment media that would be subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely affected
by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., non-minority or nonlow-income) who are adversely affected.2 In accordance with RTD Title VI Policies, the determination of a Fare
Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden is based on the difference in the impacts experienced by minority
and low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes compared to
the impacts experienced by the overall ridership.
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD Title VI Policies, RTD shall:
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and all users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and all users. 3
A fare equity analysis compares the current fare to the proposed fare and calculates the absolute change as well
as the percent change. Utilizing the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden threshold, a determination is
made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are disproportionately borne by the minority
or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also used to assess whether the proposed changes
disproportionately benefit the overall population, including non-minority or non-low-income populations.
Throughout the document, the following definitions are used:
●
●

●

Fare payment type is defined as fare product (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass) and fare media on which it is
distributed (i.e., cash, paper, electronic)
Fare levels include Local, Regional and Airport. Whether the Local or Regional fare level applies is based
on the number of zones traveled on rail and distance traveled on bus. The Airport fare level applies to any
trip to or from Denver International Airport, regardless of distance, on the A Line, SkyRide or Express bus.
Fare-paying rider categories include full fare customers, seniors 65+, individuals with disabilities, Medicare
recipients, LiVE customers and youth aged 19 and younger.

This report provides the results of the Average Fare Analysis undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed
fare changes on the average fare paid per boarding to determine whether minority or low-income customers are
disproportionately adversely impacted by the changes or whether overall customers disproportionately benefit
from the changes.

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

The Average Fare Analysis for the proposed changes was undertaken using ticket sales and revenue data from
calendar year 2021, when ridership was continuing to recover from the COVID pandemic. Ridership by fare
payment type was estimated based on ticket sales and revenue data as well as transfer and fare product usage
rates developed using the 2017 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2017 CSS). 2021 ticket sales data were used to
determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers in order to assess the impacts of the
introduction of fare capping on the average fare for overall, minority and low-income customers. 2017 CSS
demographic data combined with 2021 ticket sales data were used to estimate the potential increase in LiVE
ridership due to the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.
The Average Fare Analysis excludes free rides as ridership data for free rides are not available. Free rides include
Access-a-Ride customers on fixed-route and FlexRide services, children ages 5 and younger traveling with a farepaying adult, active duty members of the U.S. military and other customers on the RTD fare exemption list. The
Average Fare Analysis also excludes free rides taken on the MallRide. Further, this Fare Equity Analysis does not
consider the impacts of the proposed changes to Access-A-Ride fares on the average fare paid as paratransit
services are not subject to the current Title VI evaluation requirements.
The 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS) was used for the customer demographic data. While the
2019 CSS sample size was smaller than the 2017 CSS, it provides demographic data on electronic fare adoption,
which were not available in the 2017 CSS.
The only ridership changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the changes in the
average fare per boarding due to pricing changes, introduction of fare capping and the income eligibility expansion
for the LiVE Program to include household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare
Analysis does not assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities. Fare elasticity is a measure
of rider sensitivity to changes in fare rates and the resulting change in ridership behavior. Elasticity assumptions
are essential to modeling anticipated ridership and fare revenue impacts from fare policy changes, but is often
excluded from fare equity analyses. Fare equity analyses seek to understand the average fare experienced by a
segment of customers prior to a fare change and after a fare change, in order to determine the % change in
average fare. This calculation becomes unnecessarily complex when a customer segment is anticipated to attract
new customers to the system or from other fare products. Therefore, fare elasticity is excluded in order to
compare the average fare impacts of the fare changes on the same segment of customers after the change in
pricing and policies.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption as RTD continues to
explore expanded retail opportunities for its electronic MyRide fare collection system at the time of the
preparation of this report. Introduction of expanded retail opportunities for MyRide beyond the four RTD Sales
Outlets that are currently open will improve access for unbanked and underbanked customers to load cash to
their accounts. Based on the 2019 CSS data, non-minority and non-low-income customers disproportionately use
electronic fare media (MyRide stored value and RTD Mobile Tickets App at the time of the 2019 CSS) at a higher
rate compared to minority and low-income customers. If RTD were to introduce a set of expanded MyRide retail
opportunities to increase access for customers to load cash to their accounts, MyRide adoption is presumed to
increase for minority and low-income customers. Because the Average Fare Analysis is based on 2019 CSS data
and does not assume any increase in electronic MyRide fare adoption, the Average Fare Analysis may understate

the benefits of fare capping for minority and low-income customers as it assumes that overall customers will
disproportionately benefit from fare capping compared to minority and low-income customers.

For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, on-board
customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare payment. The
2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research surveyors conducted 3,811
surveys.
In addition to the 2019 CSS, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was used for demographics for LiVE customers. RTD
launched its LiVE Program in July 2019, after the 2019 CSS was conducted. Unlike the 2019 CSS that was conducted
onboard vehicles, the 2020 LiVE Program Survey was conducted via email and US mail. RTD invited the 6,579
customers whose applications were approved within the 12 months leading up to the survey to participate. After
removing duplicates, 886 surveys were included in the final LiVE Program Survey data set.
RTD’s 2017 CSS was considered for use in the analysis instead of the 2019 CSS, given the much larger sample of
completed surveys (9,936). However, the survey included limited customer response data on electronic fare
adoption due to the timing of when the survey was conducted (May 2017) and when electronic fares launched –
MyRide Stored Value (May 2017) and RTD Mobile Tickets App (November 2017).
While the demographics of transit ridership may have changed due to COVID, the 2019 CSS provides the most
comprehensive and recent survey data available of systemwide demographics, and likely provides a conservative
assessment of the impacts of the proposed fare changes on minority and low income customers. Evidence from a
number of transit agencies across the US suggest that the share of minority and low-income customers has
increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While RTD has no current survey data to indicate whether that is
true in the RTD service area, if one assumes it to be true then this current Fare Equity Analysis (with an assumed
lower share of minority and low-income customers) would show less beneficial differences in average fare
between minority and low-income customers and the system overall. Alternatively stated, if minority and lowincome ridership has increased, the difference in the impacts of the proposed fare changes between the overall
customer population and minority and low-income customers would decrease. This is because in determining the
impacts on the overall customer population, the weight of the impacts on minority and low-income customers
would increase, while the weight of the impacts on non-minority and non-low-income customers would decrease.
Additionally, there have been concerns about the potential movement of low-income and minority households
into outer regions of the RTD service area and their reliance on RTD services that require the Regional fare. While
there is no recent RTD-specific survey data suggesting this has occurred, if future survey data were to confirm this
trend, the current Average Fare Analysis using the 2019 CSS provides a conservative estimate of the benefits of
the proposed removal of the Regional fare for longer distance trips. The estimate of benefits may be conservative
because the Average Fare Analysis in this Fare Equity Analysis understates the benefits for minority and lowincome customers who were less likely to pay the Regional fare at the time of the 2019 CSS.

4.1.2 Assumptions

4.1.1 Demographic Data

The 2019 CSS, while comprehensive with a significant number of survey responses, does have some limitations.
Low response rates for some rider categories, fare levels and fare payment types, as well as the absence of some
fare payment options on the survey pose several challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address the

limitations of the data by using demographics for similar rider categories or aggregating responses for different
fare payment types for a specific rider category.

●

Demographics for full fare customers who are not eligible for a discounted fare or for a pass program are
assumed to vary by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) and by fare payment type, including whether fares
are paid with electronic fare media (i.e., MyRide Stored Value or Mobile Ticket) for 3-Hour and Day Pass
customers.

●

Demographics for youth are assumed to align with the demographics of Local full fare customers. The
methodology of the 2019 CSS specifically avoids targeting youth customers under the age of 18, so this
customer group is underrepresented in the 2019 CSS, representing less than 2% of customers in the
survey. Due to insufficient survey responses, we consider youth demographics to be similar to those of
their family. Additionally, since 93% of youth boardings are assumed to occur on Local services, youth
demographics are assumed to mirror Local full fare customer demographics.

●

Demographics for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients are assumed to vary by
fare level and fare payment type. No distinction in demographics by fare media type is assumed due to
insufficient survey responses. For Airport fares, demographics are aggregated for all fare payment types
due to limited survey responses.

●

Demographics for LiVE customers are assumed not to vary by fare level or fare payment type. The 2020
LiVE Program Survey did not ask respondents about the fare level they typically paid. Responses were
aggregated for all fare payment types as the differences between the fare payment types was minimal.

●

Demographics for expanded LIVE customers are assumed to align with full fare customers with a
household income between 185% and 250% of the federal poverty level who would become eligible for
the LiVE Program. Demographics are assumed to vary by fare level. Demographics are not assumed to
vary by fare payment type due to insufficient survey responses.

●

Demographics for bulk sales are assumed to align with the demographics for all rider categories and fare
payment types for a given fare level.

●

Demographics for pass program customers are assumed to vary by pass program (Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass) and fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

●

Demographics for Semester Pass are assumed to align with the demographics for CollegePass customers.

A number of assumptions were also made in the Average Fare Analysis regarding:
●

Impact of fare capping on customers and electronic MyRide fare adoption

●

Participation of full fare customers in the LiVE Program with the income eligibility expansion

●

Average fare assumed for Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass

●

Introduction of a new LiVE Monthly Pass/Fare Cap and Semester Pass

The Average Fare Analysis assumes the 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fares will benefit with the
introduction of fare capping, reducing the average fare paid by these customers in addition to the reduction due
to the proposed fare pricing decreases. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that non-minority and non-low-income
customers disproportionately benefit from the introduction of fare capping given their higher adoption of
electronic fare media based on the 2019 CSS.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The following demographic assumptions are used in the Average Fare Analysis:

Packet Pg. 830

1.E.1.b
July 11, 2023

The benefits of fare capping are accrued only by customers paying stored value using a MyRide Barcode in the
MyRide App or MyRide Smart Card. While customers with credit and debit cards are able to load value online or
through the MyRide App and Website, cash customers can only load value at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are
currently open across the region. There is no MyRide retail network at the time of the preparation of this report.
Given the limitations to loading cash to a MyRide account, there is no basis for assuming increased electronic fare
adoption.
Introduction of fare capping for customers paying fares using MyRide stored value results in a reduction in the
average fare paid by customers, in particular 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. Instead of purchasing a Day or
Monthly Pass upfront, fares paid by customers accrue towards daily and monthly fare caps, ensuring customers
always pay the best fare. For 3-Hour and Day Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be notable,
especially with the reduction in the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the 3-Hour Pass price. For
Monthly Pass customers, the cost savings is anticipated to be minimal as most Monthly Pass customers are making
more than 38 trips per month and others who purchase the Monthly Pass for convenience are making more than
32 trips per month. The cost savings anticipated for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers using electronic fare media
are incorporated into the average fares for the proposed fare structure. The reduction in the average fare is based
on 2017 CSS data that provide the distribution of 3-Hour and Day Pass respondents by the number of trips taken.
2017 CSS was used because it provided a larger data set than the 2019 CSS as well as the data needed on the
number of trips taken in the last week.
For determining the number of boardings that would potentially benefit from fare capping, the Average Fare
Analysis uses 2021 ticket sales data to determine electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour and Day Pass customers.
Electronic fare adoption is determined by calculating the proportion of tickets sold through the MyRide App
(formerly branded the RTD Mobile Tickets App) and MyRide stored value compared to total purchases, including
purchases at bus fareboxes or rail ticket vending machines. The Average Fare Analysis assumes electronic fare
adoption varies by rider category, fare level and fare payment type. While 3-Hour and Day Pass customers will
continue to be able to purchase 3-Hour and Day Pass mobile tickets rather than using stored value, the Average
Fare Analysis assumes that 100% of electronic fare customers would use MyRide stored value and thus benefit
from fare capping.
For LiVE customers, including those eligible as a result of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare
Analysis assumes 100% electronic fare adoption for 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass as these customers must pay fares
using electronic fare media.
The Average Fare Analysis does not assume any adjustment to the average fare paid for 10-Ride Ticket customers
due to the introduction of fare capping. In 2021, less than 2% of 10-Ride Ticket Books were sold through the
MyRide App.
LiVE participation is expected to increase slightly with the expansion of the LiVE Program household income
eligibility limit from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Average Fare Analysis assumes that these
“expanded LiVE” customers would go from paying the full fare under the current fare structure to paying the LiVE
fare under the proposed fare structure. Given the slightly higher transfer and usage rates for LiVE customers
compared to full fare customers, the average fare for these customers is based on the same transfer and usage
rates as LiVE customers. The increased participation is based on the estimated current LiVE Program participation
rate among income eligible customers and the number of boardings made by full fare customers who would
become income eligible for the LiVE Program as part of the income eligibility expansion. The current LiVE Program

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) and CollegePass contract pricing is based on prior ridership data
and the applicable fare. Given that pricing is based on prior ridership, 2021 contract pricing was based on preCOVID ridership, resulting in a temporarily higher average fare. To reflect the average fare per boarding in the
future as ridership stabilizes, the Average Fare Analysis uses the average fare that would have been collected
based on 2021 ridership data and the applicable fare under the current fare structure and proposed fare structure.
For CollegePass, the total number of boardings is understated. For Auraria Higher Education, RTD introduced an
option to use the MyRide App for CollegePass students. Ridership data for these students using the app is not
available and thus is excluded from the Average Fare Analysis. Further, Auraria Higher Education offered its
CollegePass as an opt-in pass. If Auraria Higher Education returns to an all-in model that provides a CollegePass to
all eligible students, ridership is anticipated to increase.
The Average Fare Analysis assumes the introduction of two new fare payment types: LiVE Monthly Pass (as well
as a monthly fare cap) and Semester Pass. These new fare payment types will likely disproportionately benefit
low-income and minority customers. As such, the assumptions for adoption of these products are constrained in
the Average Fare Analysis so as to not overstate the benefits of the new fare payment types, and are described
further below.
For current LiVE customers, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates the benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly
Pass to the fare capping assumptions for LiVE 3-Hour and Day Pass customers. For new LiVE customers that
become eligible for LiVE as part of the income eligibility expansion, the Average Fare Analysis incorporates
separate line items for the Monthly Pass as these newly eligible LIVE customers are assumed to transition from
purchasing a full fare Monthly Pass to purchasing a LiVE Monthly Pass. While introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass may
increase interest in the LiVE Program, no increase in LiVE participation is assumed in order to not overstate the
benefits of introducing a LiVE Monthly Pass for low-income and minority customers.
For Semester Pass, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that 1% of full fare Local Monthly Pass customers would
transition to purchasing a Semester Pass. This is based on the share of Monthly Pass customers who indicated
“to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken on the 2019 CSS. The analysis was careful to
exclude CollegePass and youth respondents when making the 1% calculation. The Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any transition of full fare Regional Monthly Pass customers to Semester Pass as there were no Regional
Monthly Pass respondents indicating “to/from school/college” as the primary purpose of the trip taken.
While the proposed changes include the introduction of a Transit Assistance Grant Program, the potential
implications of that program are not included in the Average Fare Analysis. The Grant Program is not included
because it is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the 10-Ride Ticket Books
at no cost to their clients. Further the tickets distributed through the program are not intended to supplant current
fare purchases by grant recipients.
Within the baseline model, reflecting RTD’s existing fare structure, there is no Airport Monthly Pass. Instead,
customers may use their Regional Monthly Pass for trips that require the Airport fare and the Airport boardings
associated with the use of the Regional Monthly Pass for trips to/from Denver International Airport are included
with the Regional Monthly Pass in the Average Fare Analysis. When evaluating the proposed alternative, the

expansion are based on the 2017 CSS.

For the Bulk Purchase Program, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that all purchases by nonprofit organizations
in 2021 would transition to the program as well as 10% off full fare Monthly Passes. Prior to the discontinuation
of the FlexPass Program (a prior RTD program similar to the Bulk Purchase Program proposal), approximately 10%
of full fare Monthly Passes were purchased through the program. The FlexPass Program provided a discount on
Monthly Pass purchases based on the number of passes purchased, whether the employer provided a matching
discount to employees and whether the employer offered the FlexPass on a pre-tax basis.
Due to insufficient data to support other assumptions, the Average Fare Analysis assumes that overall customers,
minority customers and low-income customers have identical usage rates and transfer rates for a given fare
payment type. This means that for any given fare payment type, it is assumed that overall, minority and lowincome customers will all have the same average fare. To be clear: the analysis only assumes that the average fare
is identical for overall, minority and low-income customers within a given fare payment type; average fares are
assumed to differ across fare payment types (e.g., 3-Hour Pass, Day Pass), rider categories (e.g., full fare, LiVE
customers) and fare levels (i.e., Local, Regional, Airport).

5 System Ridership Demographics Overview
The following provides an overview of RTD’s systemwide ridership using data from the 2019 CSS, which is the
most recent onboard survey with the detailed information needed for the Fare Equity Analysis. While other data
sources have been consulted for the Fare Equity Analysis, the 2019 CSS provides the most accurate data for
portraying systemwide ridership demographics.
These demographic statistics were considered in the development of the proposed fare changes in order to
minimize or avoid the potential for changes that would result in Disparate Impacts on minority customers or a
Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

5.1 Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified themselves as
“Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include respondents who refused
to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. Additionally, respondents who did not choose an ethnicity or race yet
submitted a survey response that did not comport with racial/ethnicity designations (e.g., “Human,” “Female
Only,” “Russian”) were assumed to be non-minority. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey include:
1.
2.
3.

5.
6.

African-American/Black

For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty
Guidelines (also referred to as federal poverty level). To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines
were used to determine which populations would be considered low-income.
Table 5 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions by
household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare Equity Analysis
was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey respondent accurately using U.S.
HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 6 presents the income categories used in the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS
income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within the income ranges that corresponded to the
150% U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size were identified as low-income. This may
overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents the most inclusive low-income definition. The
analysis did not include those survey respondents who refused to respond to either of the household income and
household size questions, as they could not be properly categorized.

Figures 1 and 2 provide an overview of systemwide fixed-route ridership by minority and income status for those
who responded to ethnicity and income related questions, excluding those who refused to respond to ethnicity
or income questions. For purposes of the analysis, minority status is characterized as anyone who responded to
anything other than only “Caucasian/White.” Low-income status was determined through a cross tabulation of
household income and size, matching the income to 150% of the U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines, as discussed above.
It should be noted that for purposes of this Fare Equity Analysis, low-income customers are defined as those at or
below 150% of the federal poverty level. This is different from the current RTD definition for income eligibility for
the income-based LiVE Program, which is set at or below 185% of the federal poverty level for adults ages 20-64.
Figure 1: Ridership Ethnicity

Figure 2: Ridership Income

To support the Fare Equity Analysis, cross-tabulations of the 2019 CSS were performed for those who responded
to ethnicity- and income-related questions to develop a breakdown of demographics by fare payment type.
Because the 2019 CSS was conducted prior to the launch of the LiVE Program, data from the 2020 LiVE Program
Survey and the Average Fare Analysis were used to modify the fare payment profiles to account for the LiVE
Program. Recognizing that various fare changes may impact some protected groups more than others, the
relationship between fare payment type and ethnicity and income was reviewed. Table 7 presents the fare
payment type by minority and income status.

6 Fare Change Proposal
RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project launched in 2022 after customer feedback indicated
that fares are too expensive and difficult to understand. The proposed fare changes include a number of
structural and pricing changes to RTD’s fares, as well as changes to current pass programs, introduction of new
pass programs and technological changes to fare payment, including the introduction of fare capping facilitated
by RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system and described in Section 6.2. The three study goals, (1) equity, (2)
affordability, and (3) simplicity, as well as customer, community and stakeholder input throughout the study led
to the proposed fare changes summarized below.

6.1 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
Proposed fare changes to be implemented in 2024 include changes to fare pricing, fare structure, pass programs
and the LiVE Program, referenced below.

6.1.1 Fare Structure
●

Simplified fare structure by removing the Regional fare category

●

For customers paying discounted fares, a single price fare level for all travel, including trips originating or
ending at Denver International Airport

RTD’s fare structure comprises three fare levels: Local, Regional and Airport. For rail trips, customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the number of zones they travel through while fixed-route bus customers pay a Local
or Regional fare based on the type of service and distance traveled. For FlexRide trips, customers pay the Local
fare. The Airport fare applies to any rail travel in the Airport zone and for most bus service to/from Denver
International Airport.
Under the proposed fare changes, full fare customers will pay a flat fare for all travel except for select trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport. Customers who begin or end their trip or who transfer at
Denver International Airport will pay the Airport fare on select services. Customers who do not travel to Denver

Routes 104L, 169L and 145X serving Denver International Airport will not be subject to the Airport fare. Routes
104L and 169L do not currently charge the Airport fare for trips originating or ending at Denver International
Airport. Route 145X does currently charge the Airport fare, but will not be subject to the Airport fare for trips
originating or ending at Denver International Airport under this proposal.
Customers paying discounted fares, including seniors, individuals with disabilities, LiVE customers and youth, will
pay a single price and will not be subject to the Airport fare. This will provide these customers with access
throughout the region for a single price.
Currently, customers who use a Local pass for a Regional or Airport trip or a Regional pass for an Airport trip must
pay an upgrade. The proposed fare changes flatten the fare structure by removing the Regional fare level for all
customers and the Regional and Airport fare level for customers paying discounted fares. These changes eliminate
the need for unique Regional fare products. Further, customers paying discounted fares will no longer need to pay
an upgrade for any travel. Upgrades will only be required for full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass customers making
trips requiring the Airport fare.

6.1.2 Fare Discounts
●

Increased LiVE discount from 40% to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass

●

Increased discount on the Monthly Pass for customers paying discounted fares to 70%, establishing one
Monthly Pass price for customers paying discounted fares

●

No change to 50% discount on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass for seniors, individuals with disabilities and/or
Medicare recipients

●

No change to 70% discount on 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes for youth aged 19 and younger

Seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients will continue to receive a 50% discount on full fare 3Hour Pass and Day Pass, equating to a $1.35 3-Hour Pass and a $2.70 Day Pass. RTD proposes to increase the LiVE
discount from 40% to 50% of the full fare Local 3-Hour and Day Pass. This aligns the LiVE discount/pricing with the
discount for seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients resulting in one, unified discounted fare
level.
If the Zero Fare for Youth pilot is not implemented, or if Zero Fare for Youth is not made permanent after the pilot
period, youth will continue to receive a 70% discount on full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes.
The discount on the Monthly Pass for all customers paying a discounted fare will increase to 70%, establishing one
discounted price of $27.00.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.

6.1.3 Fare Capping
●

Introduction of daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card

RTD’s new MyRide fare collection system enables RTD to introduce fare capping, which offers customers the best
fare based on their trip-making behavior. Unlike Monthly Passes, customers do not need to purchase a Monthly
Pass upfront. With fare capping, customers can pay as they go and have their fares capped on a daily or monthly
basis such that they do not exceed the price of a comparable Day Pass or Monthly Pass. This removes financial
barriers for customers who may not be able to pay for a Monthly Pass upfront and also increases convenience for
customers by providing them the best fare without needing to determine whether to purchase a pass upfront.
Customers using stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card will be able
to take advantage of fare capping.
All fares paid with MyRide stored value will apply towards the daily and monthly fare caps. For full fare customers
traveling to/from Denver International Airport, Airport fares and upgrades may apply until the customer pays the
equivalent of the price of the Airport Day Pass or Monthly Pass.
While under the proposed fare structure, all Monthly Pass customers will be able to travel to/from Denver
International Airport without paying an Airport upgrade, full fare customers using fare capping will be paying on
a trip-by-trip basis towards the daily and monthly fare caps. These customers will pay the Airport fare or upgrade
until they reach the Airport daily fare cap or monthly fare cap.

6.1.4 Fare Pricing
●

Lowered Local and Airport fares

●

Lowered Monthly Pass multiple to reflect hybrid work schedules and provide greater affordability for

●

Eliminated the discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with
disabilities and Medicare recipients

The Airport fare will remain, but the fare will be lowered from $10.50 to $10.00 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass/Day
Pass. The Local fare will also be lowered from $3.00 to $2.75 for a full fare 3-Hour Pass and from $6.00 to $5.50
for a full fare Day Pass. Lower full fare Local fares will result in lower fares for customers paying discounted fares.
The discount on 10-Ride Ticket Books will be eliminated for full fare customers, seniors, individuals with disabilities
and Medicare recipients. LiVE and youth 10-Ride Ticket Books do not currently include a discount. 10-Ride Ticket
Books will be priced at 10 times the price of the applicable 3-Hour Pass. More information about the availability
of 10-Ride Ticket Books is presented in Section 6.2.
RTD will decrease the full fare Monthly Pass multiple from 38 to 32 times the price of the full fare 3-Hour Pass,
resulting in an $88 Monthly Pass and monthly fare cap for full fare customers. One Monthly Pass price will be
established for customers paying discounted fares. This Monthly Pass will be discounted approximately 70%,
equating to a Monthly Pass multiple of 31.8 for youth, and a Monthly Pass multiple of 20.0 for seniors, individuals
with disabilities, Medicare recipients and LiVE customers.
For details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.
While paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will be changing its Access-a-Ride
fares. The Local Access-a-Ride fare will change from $5.00 to $4.50, and the Airport Access-a-Ride fare will change
from $20.00 to $19.00. The Regional Access-a-Ride will be discontinued. Customers can pay their Access-a-Ride
fare in cash on-vehicle or with a mobile ticket. Local paper 6-Ride Ticket Books will continue to be available and

priced at six times the Local Access-a-Ride fare. As part of the proposed fare changes, RTD will also allow eligible
customers to apply a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

●

Expanded LiVE eligibility requirements to encourage LiVE participation

●

Introduction of a LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes and MyRide monthly fare capping

●

Increased discounts for customers using LiVE fares

●

Travel anywhere in the service area for a single price fare level (no Regional and Airport fare)

The proposed fare changes include expanding access to the LiVE low-income fare program. The income eligibility
threshold will increase from 185% to 250% of the federal poverty level, and customers applying to the LiVE
Program will no longer need an address within RTD’s service district, which will require a change to the Colorado
state PEAK system used for eligibility verification.
RTD will introduce LiVE paper and mobile Monthly Passes as well as monthly fare capping for LiVE customers using
MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or new MyRide Smart Card. Introduction of the new LiVE Monthly Pass will
improve access to LiVE fares. The Monthly Passes and monthly fare capping will also increase the affordability of
transit for LiVE customers by capping the amount spent on transit for these customers on a calendar month basis.
As noted above in Section 6.1.2, the discount for LiVE customers will increase to 50% on 3-Hour Pass and Day Pass
and 70% on Monthly Passes, aligning them with seniors, individuals with disabilities and Medicare recipients. The
price of 3-Hour and Day Pass for LiVE customers will align with those for seniors, individuals with disabilities and
Medicare recipients. There would be no change to how LiVE customers would purchase 3-Hour Passes and Day
Passes. RTD continues to increase opportunities for LiVE customers to access fare products. As discussed earlier,
RTD is planning on introducing a paper and mobile LiVE Monthly Pass. RTD is also exploring expanded
opportunities to purchase fares using cash at retail locations. At a future point in time, if the provision of LiVE
Monthly Passes and expanded retail opportunities to facilitate cash purchases is still determined to be insufficient
to meet the needs of LiVE customers, RTD may consider other cash payment opportunities. Section 6.1.8 provides
additional detail on expanded retail opportunities, and Table 9 in Section 6.3 identifies the current and proposed
fare distribution by fare payment type and rider category.
Also as noted above in Section 6.1.1, the Regional fare will be removed and the remaining Airport fare will not
apply for LiVE customers under the new fare structure.
Also, while paratransit fare changes are not analyzed in this Fare Equity Analysis, RTD will allow customers to apply
a 50% LiVE discount to Access-a-Ride fares.

Prepared by: Four Nines Technologies

1.E.1.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

RTD proposes to introduce a Transit Assistance Grant Program to help organizations serving clients with
immediate transit needs. RTD will initially distribute up to $1 million of full fare paper 10-Ride Ticket Books per
calendar year at no cost to grant recipients. The grant recipients must distribute the tickets to their clients or
constituents for free. RTD will release one annual call for grant proposals and a grant program selection panel,
consisting of internal RTD staff and external stakeholders, will determine grant recipients based on clear and
transparent evaluation criteria, such as an organization’s IRS Tax Exempt Letter and whether they serve
populations with immediate transit needs. The RTD in consultation with the grant program selection panel will
determine evaluation criteria, the scope of reporting requirements and participant responsibilities. RTD is
budgeting internal funding for the Transit Assistance Grant Program; however, in the future, RTD may seek
supplemental funding from external partners.
Bulk Purchase Program
The proposed Bulk Purchase Program will introduce a 10% discount on bulk purchases with an invoice amount of
$1,500 or more. RTD currently allows organizations and employers to purchase fare products in bulk, but does not
provide a discount on bulk purchases. Contracts are currently required for recurring bulk paper purchases or any
mobile bulk purchases. Customers will be able to purchase all fare products available to the public through the
Bulk Purchase Program except stored value, and current contract rules are likely to remain. The discount does not
apply to EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass or CollegePass contracts. If the ability to purchase stored value for
individuals in bulk becomes available in the future, the bulk discount would not apply to stored value loads.
While any individual or organization can purchase fare products through the Bulk Purchase Program, RTD will
manage payments differently based on organization and sale type. For nonprofit and community based
organizations, online orders, and one-time orders, customers will prepay. Customers with unused paper fare
products are not eligible for refunds, but nonprofit and community based organizations may be eligible to
exchange expired, unused paper 10-Ride Ticket Books. Customers purchasing bulk mobile passes will pay for the
passes that are activated and used, with the discount calculated once utilization is determined and if the invoice
amount is $1,500 or more.
While employers or organizations purchasing fare products via the Bulk Purchase Program may pass on the cost
of the pass to employees or clients, the amount collected cannot exceed the amount paid for the pass.
Semester Pass
In response to community feedback about alternatives to CollegePass, RTD proposes to establish a Semester Pass
Program for post-secondary educational institutions, targeted towards smaller colleges and community colleges.
The program will be open to post-secondary educational institutions not enrolled in CollegePass. Participating
institutions will offer the Semester Pass to enrolled part-time or full-time students, and institutions can pass
through the entire cost of the pass or subsidize all or part of the cost for students. Students purchasing a Semester
Pass will be able purchase the pass on an opt-in basis from the participating institution. Participating institutions
that subsidize the Semester Pass may also opt to subsidize the pass for all or a subset of students.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Transit Assistance Grant Program

The Semester Pass will be valid for a term duration set by the institution. The pricing will total approximately 80%
of a full fare Monthly Pass per month of the valid term. Students will be able to use the Semester Pass on all fixedroute and FlexRide services, including travel to/from Denver International Airport.

6.1.7 Pass Program
●

Simplified EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass programs

Business EcoPass
RTD’s Business EcoPass is an employer-sponsored pass that provides eligible employees at participating employers
unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The program is based on a calendar year and is an all-in,
insurance-based model, which means employers must purchase passes for every eligible employee. Employers
can decide to completely subsidize the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs on to the employee, who
can pay for it with pre-tax dollars. Business EcoPass pricing is based on three factors: number of employees, a
business’s location in the RTD service area (referred to as Service Level Areas (SLAs)) and actual ridership two
years in arrears (referred to as utilization-based pricing). For large employers with over 3,000 employees,
employer-specific ridership data is used for pricing. For new large employers, SLA pricing is used until employer
specific ridership data is available for contract pricing. RTD manages the program via annual contracts with
employers. Independent of the policy changes proposed in the Fare Study, RTD will eliminate photos on Business
EcoPass MyRide Smart Cards.
There are several proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program.
●

RTD will introduce fixed pricing for 2-year intervals starting in 2024 and 2025. Currently, pricing is updated
annually. Pricing in 2-year intervals will apply to employers subject to SLA pricing, and large employers.

●

RTD will consolidate SLA A (suburban) and SLA B (major transit centers), and consolidate all employer size
categories (currently four) to a single size category. This will reduce the total number of pricing zones
across the region from 16 to three.

●

The contract minimums will be reduced from $1,368/year for SLAs A and B, and $2,400/year for SLAs C
and D to a single contract minimum of $950/year for all SLAs. This is equal to the purchase of 12 Monthly
Passes at the Bulk Purchase Program price.

●

All trips taken by Business EcoPass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate, and the
Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Currently, the Business EcoPass
pricing applies the applicable fare level (Local, Regional, Airport) for each trip taken when determining
utilization pricing. As the Local Monthly Pass will now be valid for all travel, including to/from Denver
International Airport, without an Airport upgrade, the Business EcoPass will also entitle the passholder to
travel to/from Denver International Airport.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
employees participating in EcoPass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

RTD will collect the fare revenue from the participating institution based on the passes issued. The institutions will
be responsible for collecting fees and distributing the passes to their students.

Although fare capping will be available to the general public, fare capping will not apply to Business EcoPass
utilization pricing. Similarly, RTD will not provision entitlements onto eligible Business EcoPass participants’

July 11, 2023

accounts, so discounted fares will not be factored into utilization pricing. Further, the discount offered through
the Bulk Purchase Program will not apply to Business EcoPass contracts.

Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) is a pass program providing residents of enrolled neighborhoods, apartment
buildings and/or homeowner associations unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. The NECO program
operates in a similar way to Business EcoPass and is based on an all-in, insurance-based model, which means
neighborhoods must purchase passes for all household residents, but pricing is slightly different. For new NECO
contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per household. Once neighborhood specific data is available,
pricing is based on utilization ridership data for the neighborhood. Unlike Business EcoPass, RTD incorporated fare
discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in determining NECO pricing. While historically NECO
participants have been provided with a NECO MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes
independent of the Fare Study will mean that future NECO MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.
There are several proposed changes to the NECO program.
●

Similar to Business EcoPass, all trips taken by NECO participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare
rate, and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. Further, no fare
discounts will be applied for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities for contract pricing.

●

RTD will make permanent the temporary reduction of the NECO contract minimum from $7,000 to $4,000.
Prior to COVID, the contract minimum for a neighborhood was $7,000. During COVID, due to decreases in
transit ridership, the contract minimum was temporarily reduced to $4,000.

●

RTD will reduce new neighborhood pricing from $175 per household per year to $125 per household.

●

Participants will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
residents participating in NECO received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

●

Since utilization pricing will not take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities, NECO neighborhood coordinators will not need to provide information on whether a
participant would qualify for a fare discount, simplifying their roles and responsibilities. Further, RTD will
not add entitlements onto eligible NECO participants’ accounts.

In alignment with Business EcoPass, fare capping will not apply to NECO pricing.
CollegePass
CollegePass is a pass program offered to post-secondary educational institutions. Students enrolled in CollegePass
can take unlimited rides on fixed-route and FlexRide services. RTD maintains annual contracts with colleges and
universities based on the all-in, insurance-based model with institution-specific utilization pricing. As an all-in
program, institutions are required to enroll all eligible students into CollegePass. CollegePass is not an opt-in pass
program for students (see proposed Semester Pass for opt-in program for post-secondary educational
institutions). For new CollegePass contracts, pricing is initially based on a fixed price per student until institutionspecific ridership data is available for contract pricing. Colleges and universities can decide to completely subsidize
the price of the pass, or pass all or part of the costs to students. While historically CollegePass students have been
provided with a MyRide smart card with their photo on it, policy changes independent of the Fare Study will mean
that future CollegePass MyRide Smart Cards will not have photos.

●

Similar to EcoPass, all trips taken by CollegePass participants will be priced at the full fare, Local fare rate,
and the Airport fare will not be applied when determining utilization pricing. In alignment with Business
EcoPass and NECO, RTD will not count discounted fares toward utilization pricing for CollegePass.

●

RTD will reduce the pricing for new colleges/universities from approximately $26 per student per month
to $15 per student per month.

●

Contract minimums for participating colleges will decrease from $15,600 per academic year to $9,000 per
academic year.

●

Students will have the option to use the MyRide App rather than a MyRide Smart Card. Historically,
students participating in CollegePass received a MyRide smart card with their name and photo on it.

In alignment with Business EcoPass and NECO, fare capping will not apply to CollegePass pricing.

6.1.8 Additional Fare Guidance
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis identified additional fare changes and/or pilots. These
changes/pilots are not evaluated in this Fare Equity Analysis.
Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program
RTD is intending to proceed with a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program for a period of up to 18-months. The
proposed Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare
Analysis, but should the pilot be made permanent or extend beyond 6-months without a waiver from FTA, a Title
VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required. The duration of the pilot would be up to 18-months with a start date
to be determined. All youth ages 19 and younger, regardless of residency, would be eligible for participation in
the pilot. Proof of eligibility that would be required to ride free is to be determined. The pilot would likely be
supported by internal RTD funds with potentially some additional support from external funding partners. A
permanent Zero Fare for Youth Program would be contingent upon the availability of sustainable, external
funding. At the conclusion of the pilot, if it was not made permanent, youth fares would revert to a 70% discount
on the full fare 3-Hour, Day and Monthly Passes, as noted in Section 6.1.2.
Because the Zero Fare for Youth Program is intended as a pilot with no established schedule for either
implementation or termination, this Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis assumes that the fare pricing
for youth ages 19 and younger would remain at a 70% discount of the full fare before and after the pilot. For
details on specific pricing assumed in the Fare Equity Analysis, see Table 8 in Section 6.2.
LiVE Access Expansion
During customer, community and stakeholder outreach, RTD received feedback for the need to increase
awareness of the LiVE Program and work with community partners to better market and expand access to the
LiVE Program. RTD plans to develop a comprehensive outreach and engagement action plan. RTD also plans to
explore expanding means testing beyond the current State of Colorado’s PEAK system, which is used to determine
eligibility for federal and state assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)
and Colorado’s Medicaid program. Expanding means testing beyond the PEAK system and changes to eligibility

criteria not listed above in Section 6.1.5 are not included in this Fare Equity Analysis or in the Average Fare Analysis,
but should the criteria for eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

The ability for customers to load cash into their MyRide accounts is critical for promoting equitable access and
adoption of the electronic MyRide fares. At the time of preparation of this report, cash customers can only load
value to their MyRide account at the four RTD Sales Outlets that are currently open in the region. Expansion of
MyRide retail opportunities beyond the four RTD Sales Outlets will improve access for unbanked and underbanked
customers to load cash to their accounts. While RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities, RTD is still in
the process of procuring retail expansion opportunities and as such it is not included in this Fare Equity Analysis.
The introduction of a substantially expanded set of retail opportunities would require a future Title VI review.

6.2 Pricing, Payment and Media Changes
Table 8 summarizes the proposed fare pricing changes by fare payment type. Several fare changes aim to simplify
RTD’s fare structure and introduce more equitable and affordable fares for RTD customers.
Proposed fare media and product changes include introduction of fare capping, elimination of all Regional fare
products and acceptance of Local fare products on Regional services, elimination of mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books
and introduction of a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap.
●

RTD will introduce daily (service day) and monthly (calendar) fare capping for customers using MyRide
stored value with MyRide Barcode in the MyRide App or a new MyRide Smart Card, as noted in Section
6.1.3

●

RTD will eliminate mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books since discounts will no longer be provided on 10-Ride
Ticket Books as noted in Section 6.1.4 and customers will be able to purchase multiple mobile 3-Hour
Passes in the MyRide App in one transaction. Customers will continue to be able to purchase paper 10Ride Ticket Books via the RTD Online Store, RTD and Third Party Sales Outlets and the Bulk Purchase
Program. RTD will also distribute paper 10-Ride Ticket Books through the proposed Transit Assistance
Grant Program discussed in Section 6.1.6.

●

RTD will introduce a LiVE Monthly Pass and fare cap, which will align with the other discounted fare
Monthly Pass/cap, as noted in Section 6.1.5.

The fare payment types that are highlighted in light teal are newly available fare payment types (e.g., daily and
monthly fare capping), while the fare payment types that are highlighted in light gray are discontinued fare
payment types (e.g., mobile 10-Ride Ticket Books).

Customers can currently purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books at four
RTD Sales Outlets: Civic Center Station, Union Station Bus Concourse, Downtown Boulder Station and Denver
Airport Station. A fifth location is temporarily closed (Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station). Third Party Sales
Outlets, which currently include King Soopers and Safeway stores, provide approximately 130 locations across the
metro area for customers to purchase 10-Ride Ticket Books, Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books.
Customers can purchase paper 10-Ride Ticket Books, paper Monthly Passes and Access-a-Ride Ticket Books via
the RTD Online Store, and RTD sends the purchased fare products in the mail free of charge. These fare payment
types will remain available at the RTD Online Store but the Regional versions of these fare products will be
discontinued. Customers can currently purchase physical MyRide cards online through their MyRide account and
will receive them in the mail free of charge. Customers will continue to have a way to order new MyRide cards
online and receive them in the mail, via the RTD Online Store.
Customers can purchase mobile tickets and passes in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website and use them in
their MyRide App. Similarly, customers can manage their MyRide account and load value to their account in the
MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. Cash as well as credit and debit card customers can load value to their
MyRide accounts at RTD Sales Outlets. Customers who want to purchase tickets using stored value must convert
the value loaded into their MyRide accounts to mobile tickets in the MyRide App or via the MyRide Website. With
the launch of the new MyRide fare collection system, in addition to using the MyRide App, MyRide Smart Card
customers can load value to their MyRide accounts and manage their accounts similar to MyRide App customers,
although MyRide Smart Card customers cannot purchase mobile tickets to use with their MyRide Smart Card.
Customers are no longer able to obtain or reload the new MyRide Smart Cards at select Safeway and King Soopers
stores, as they could previously. Customers will continue to be able to obtain and reload MyRide Smart Cards at
RTD Sales Outlets. In the future, RTD plans to expand MyRide retail opportunities for the new MyRide fare

7 Fare Proposal Outreach
7.1 Public Outreach Overview
In the fourth and final phase of public engagement for the RTD Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis,
customers and community members had the opportunity to provide feedback on the recommended changes to
the fare structure, policies and programs through public comment. The public comment period was open from
April 13 to May 24, 2023.
Public comment could be submitted in several formats, including:




Online on the Fare Feedback website, which provided a comprehensive overview of the proposed fare
changes
Written on a paper comment form at Fare Study open houses, station pop-ups and community events
Spoken out loud at one of four virtual public hearings

The public comment form asked for open-ended feedback on three topics: the recommended fare structure,
recommended policies and programs and fare equity (Title VI Analysis). Participants could optionally include their
name, organization with which they were affiliated, and demographic information (including racial and ethnic
background, income, household size and age). A list of organizations represented and a summary of demographic
information of the commenters are included in this summary.
Table 11 provides a summary of the outreach events and methods along with the estimated number of
participants. Engagement opportunities and methods of promotion included:

household income and number of household residents. Several key demographic statistics about the commenters
are outlined below.

7.2 Summary of Public Comments
Through comments directly related to the fare study, significant support was provided for the components of the
proposal. The following themes were present in the feedback:

Fare Structure
There was significant support for changes to the fare structure that would support the fare study’s goals of
simplicity, affordability and equity. In total, 731 comments were submitted from a variety of methods. Additional
comments unrelated to the fare structure study are not included.




Simplicity: Participants expressed support for the consolidation of the Local and Regional fare levels,
indicating this would provide much needed simplicity and benefit commuters who travel significant
distances.
Affordability: Many commenters expressed appreciation for the reduction in costs, particularly in an era
of increasing inflation. In particular:
o Commenters supported the decreased full fare monthly pass price ($88) and discount monthly
pass price ($27), explaining that this would benefit frequent riders, particularly airport employees
and regular DIA travelers with the inclusion of the Airport fare within the monthly pass.
o Many comments noted that the lower monthly pass price made transit more cost competitive
with driving and parking. Some previous customers indicated that the decrease in fares would
encourage them to begin using RTD services again; commenters believed that may result in
increased transit use/decrease car traffic and related environmental benefits.
o Nonprofit staff members said that the price decreases would support the needs of their clients
who may be transit-reliant or have limited financial resources.

1.E.1.b



July 11, 2023

Equity: Commenters noted that transit-reliant equity populations would be well served by this
recommendation. They indicated that changes to the fare structure and discount programs would allow
individuals with disabilities, low-income customers, older adults, and community members who are
unhoused to attend appointments, travel to work or school, and make other necessary trips without
incurring significant cost burdens associated with transit. Others supported the incorporation of the LiVE
discount into Access-a-Ride fares.

There were also some suggestions for further improvements to the fare structure, many of which were considered
through the fare study process but found to be financially or operationally unfeasible.





Simplicity: Many commenters urged RTD to have a single fare for all destinations, including the airport.
Affordability: Many commenters urged RTD to further reduce prices or provide fare-free transit for all
customers. Some commenters indicated the Airport fare ($10) is still a financial burden and is not a costcompetitive option, especially for groups of individuals traveling together. Some also encouraged RTD to
offer higher discounts for customers using Discount programs and suggested that discounts for older
adults should start earlier to coincide with retirement.
Equity: A number of commenters encouraged RTD to consider fares rounded to the nearest (and lowest)
dollar to ensure customers using cash would not overpay for service – or to ensure drivers have change
to offer to customers in return for overpayment. RTD was also encouraged to provide additional outreach
for discount programs to ensure eligible customers were aware of their existence, with grocery stores,
food banks and libraries listed as locations to promote information and possibly offer retail options for
discount pass purchases. Additional feedback on how to more broadly approach RTD’s LiVE program is
outlined below.

Passes and Pass Programs
Commenters also provided support for current and proposed passes and programs.
Zero Fare for Youth
Overwhelming enthusiasm was shown for the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program, noting that this would:






Support youth in accessing school and work
Benefit families who cannot afford fares for multiple children and incentivize larger families who see
driving as a more affordable option
Meet climate goals by encouraging additional ridership
Provide youth with independence and agency
Support lifelong transit use

Comments also encouraged RTD to seek long-term funding sources, potentially through the State of Colorado, to
ensure the program lasts beyond the first year.
Additional Passes and Programs
Commenters viewed the transit assistance grant program as a benefit for non-profit organizations with limited
budgets who aim to support clients with travel needs to appointments, food banks, job interviews and others.
They also voiced support for the updates to the EcoPass program and its positive impact on commuting
employees.

RTD was also encouraged to consider other ways to decrease the cost of transit for commuting employees,
including those traveling to the airport.

Customers were encouraged to provide feedback on RTD’s outreach plan for the proposed LiVE income-based
fare discount program expansion as well as recommendations of organizations for RTD to partner with to increase
awareness of the LiVE program. These included nonprofit organizations, libraries, college and schools, heath care
facilities and stores among others.
When asked who RTD should partner with to spread the information about the LiVE program, participants
recommended partnering with nonprofits with Spanish speaking constituents, libraries, educational entities
including Denver Public Schools, and healthcare facilities, including those who serve the Spanish speaking
populations.

7.3 Changes to Proposal
In the fourth and final phase of the fare study and equity analysis, the public comments overall demonstrate public
support for the recommended fare structure, policies and programs. Additionally, no items of significant concern
were raised in public comments that suggest further review of the recommendation and its impacts on the
community is necessary. As such, no changes are proposed to the Systemwide Fare Study and Fare Equity Analysis
recommendations, and the final draft Title VI fare equity analysis will be presented to the RTD Board of Directors
for review and adoption.

8 Average Fare Analysis Findings

The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board-adopted Title VI Policies. While
changes to some fare payment types would result in a greater percentage change for some populations, the
aggregate, systemwide differences between all customers and minority customers and between all customers and
low-income customers were within the 5% policy threshold. The proposed fare changes are expected to benefit
minority customers and low-income customers to a lesser degree than all customers, but the difference in benefits
do not exceed 5% on a systemwide basis. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with the
implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.
This Fare Equity Analysis and Average Fare Analysis did not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program, LiVE
access expansion beyond proposed changes in Section 6.1.5 or the expansion of a MyRide retail opportunities for
cash customers. These items are discussed in Section 6.1.8. A separate Fare Equity Analysis may be required as
RTD moves forward with the implementation of the Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or the expansion of MyRide
retail opportunities, depending on the proposed changes. Nonetheless, these changes would likely benefit
minority and low-income customers. As such, the Average Fare Analysis represented in this document likely
understates potential upcoming benefits for minority and low-income customers.
It should also be noted that the introduction of the Transit Assistance Grant Program is not included in the Average
Fare Analysis as the program is intended to generate new ridership, and grant recipients are to distribute the
tickets at no cost to their clients.

8.1 Average Fare by Fare Level and Fare Payment Type
Overall, customers will experience a decrease in the average fare paid per boarding. As shown in Table 12, the
systemwide average fare for all customers would decrease from $1.41 to $1.05 (25.4% decrease). The reduction
in average fare varies dramatically by fare level (Local, Regional, Airport).

Customers paying the Regional fare experience significantly greater reductions in the average fare compared to
customers paying the Local fare (Regional average fare decreases by $1.31, while Local average fare decreases by
$0.17, for a difference of $1.14). This is due to charging the Local fare for trips that previously required paying the
Regional fare. Customers paying the Airport fare also experience greater reductions in the average fare compared
to customers paying the Local fare. This is primarily due to the introduction of fare capping and the reduction in
the Monthly Pass price resulting from reducing the Monthly Pass multiple and including travel to/from the Denver

Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

Local Neighborhood EcoPass is the one specific fare payment type that experiences an increase in the average
fare; however, in aggregate, the NECO program experiences a 22% decrease in average fare when factoring in
Airport and Regional trips. The average fare for NECO customers making a trip that requires the Local fare
increases as a result of no longer taking into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with
disabilities in contract pricing. However, NECO contracts are priced based on total ridership, and overall, the NECO
program experiences a decrease in the average fare due to the discontinuation of applying the Regional and
Airport fare to determine contract pricing (proposed fare change would price all trips at the Local, full fare for pass
program pricing).

8.2 Average Fare Analysis Results
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Policies, but
does note that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population.
A reason that minority and low-income customers do not benefit as much as the overall population in the Average
Fare Analysis is due to the composition of RTD’s customer population and share of ridership by fare level. Minority
and low-income customers rely much more heavily on Local fare level trips compared to all customers, as noted
in Table 14. While the Average Fare Analysis findings suggest that minority and low-income customers do not
benefit as much as the overall customer population due to the significant decreases in Regional and Airport fares,
the proposed fare changes may actually lower financial barriers and improve mobility and access for these
customer populations. By removing the Regional fare level and providing a lower priced Monthly Pass that is valid
for travel anywhere in the RTD service area, the fare structure may allow customers to travel to parts of the region
that they previously chose not to visit or may have been unable to due to the price of Regional and Airport fares.
The Average Fare Analysis analyzes impacts on customers based on current travel behavior and does not attempt
to forecast how proposed changes may alter future travel behavior or improve customer access.

As noted in Section 4, the data and methodology used were developed to not overstate the potential benefits of
the proposed fare changes for minority and low-income customers. An increase in the proportion of customers
who are minority and/or low-income systemwide or among customers paying Regional fare as the result of the
COVID impacts on ridership demographics, suburbanization of poverty or reduction of financial barriers to make
longer distance trips with the removal of the Regional fare would increase the benefits of the proposed fare
changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer population and minority and low-income
customers. Further, increased electronic MyRide adoption among minority and/or low-income customers would
increase the benefits of the proposed fare changes and reduce the difference between the overall customer
population and minority and low-income customers.

8.2.1 Key Findings
●

When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for the proposed change
is $1.05 per boarding for all customers, $0.97 for minority customers (8% lower than for all customers)
and $0.84 for low-income customers (20% lower than for all customers).

●

As a whole, minority and low-income populations experience a smaller decrease in their average fare than
the overall customer population. Minority customers experience a 23.1% decrease in their average fare
per boarding and low-income customers experience a 22.0% decrease, compared with a 25.4% decrease
experienced by the overall customer population. It is important to note that each group (overall, minority
and low-income) is anticipated to see an average fare per boarding decrease of 22% or greater.

●

A significant reason for the overall customer population experiencing greater average fare benefits
compared to minority and low-income customers is that the proposed fare changes disproportionately
benefit customers paying the Regional fare, which is disproportionately non-minority and non-lowincome according to the 2019 CSS.
○

Regional boardings represent 8% of minority customer boardings and 5% of low-income customer
boardings, but represent 10% of boardings for the overall customer population.

●

Low-income customers do not benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program. The
proposed fare change increases the household income limit from 185% of the federal poverty level to
250% of the federal poverty level. Both of these income limits exceed the income threshold of 150% of
federal poverty level established by RTD Title VI Policies and used for the purposes of this Fare Equity
Analysis.

●

Minority and low-income customers do not benefit as greatly as the overall customer population from the
introduction of fare capping given their lower electronic fare adoption.
○

For full fare, 34% of overall 3-Hour and Day Pass boardings are made with electronic fares, while
this decreases to 24% and 17% for minority and low-income customers, respectively.

●

The proposed changes to the Business EcoPass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting more than the overall customer population. This is largely a function of the demographics and
proposed changes to the Airport portion of the Business EcoPass program. Within the Business EcoPass
program, the Airport fare level has a significantly higher share of minority and low-income customers than
the Local and Regional fare levels, and the Airport fare level for Business EcoPass has the largest
anticipated percentage decrease in average fare resulting in a greater benefit for minority and low-income
customers.

●

The proposed changes to the CollegePass program result in minority and low-income customers
benefiting less than the overall customer population. This is largely a result of the fact that the Local fare
level has the highest proportion of minority and low-income customers, yet is anticipated to experience
a relatively low percentage decrease in average fare. Regional and Airport fare levels have much larger
shares of non-minority and non-low-income customers, yet are anticipated to experience much higher
percentage decreases in average fare. It is important to remember that the structure of CollegePass
contracts is such that all utilization across all customer populations at a college (minority, non-minority,

●

As noted in Table 15, the only group that is anticipated to experience an increase in their average fare in
the study are low-income Neighborhood EcoPass (NECO) program customers. The estimated change in
average fare per boarding for these customers is $0.03. Proposed changes are expected to result in
minority customers also benefiting less than the overall NECO customer population. Low-income NECO
customers in particular disproportionately rely on the Local fare level within the NECO program (90% of
Low-Income NECO boardings are Local vs. 73% of overall NECO boardings), yet the Local fare level for
NECO is the one that is anticipated to experience a sizable increase in average fare due to the proposal to
no longer take into account fare discounts for youth, seniors and individuals with disabilities in contract
pricing. While the Average Fare Analysis suggests that low-income and minority NECO customers are
anticipated to benefit less than the overall population of NECO customers, it is important to remember
that all utilization across all customer populations (minority, non-minority, low-income, non-low-income)
is aggregated together and all households in the same neighborhood pay an identical amount.

8.2.2 Overview of Overall Findings
Table 16 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority customers to the overall
customer population. For minority customers, the average fare decreases from $1.26 to $0.97, a 23.1% decrease.
For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage point
difference between the percentage change for minority customers and all customers is +2.3%, indicating that
while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit somewhat
more than minority customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare
changes to RTD’s Disparate Impact Burden threshold, the fare changes do not represent a Disparate Impact on
minority customers as the percentage point difference in percentage change in average fare from the proposed
fare changes does not exceed RTD’s 5% threshold.

decrease. For all customers, the average fare decreases from $1.41 to $1.05, a 25.4% decrease. The percentage
point difference between the percentage change for low-income customers and all customers is +3.4%, indicating
that while both groups experience a decrease in their average fare, all customers are expected to benefit more
than low-income customers as a result of the proposed fare changes. Applying this difference in average fare

As previously noted, individuals with a household income up to 250% of the federal poverty level will be eligible
for the expanded LiVE Program, which exceeds the low-income threshold of 150% of the federal poverty level
established in RTD’s Title VI Policies. As such, there are individuals in the Average Fare Analysis that are classified
as non-low-income but will benefit from the income eligibility expansion for the LiVE Program.

1.E.1.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

A Fare Equity Analysis should not take the place of thoughtful planning at the earliest stages of project
development. Considering the impacts that plans, programs or projects have on minority and low-income
communities has been part of the early planning and development process for the Systemwide Fare Study and
Equity Analysis and the study’s recommendations.
Even though RTD’s ridership is not homogenous in terms of ethnicity, income, payment methods or fare type, the
proposed fare changes do not appear to create any Disparate Impacts on minority communities, nor does it appear
to create any Disproportionate Burdens on low-income communities. As such, no mitigations are needed in order
to proceed with the implementation of the proposed fare changes.
Equity was the primary goal for the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. As changes to RTD’s fare structure,
pricing and system were considered to achieve other study goals including Affordability and Simplicity, the impacts
of these potential changes on minority and low-income communities were continually examined. The study relied
on a community-driven process, focused on Title VI and historically underrepresented populations. Customer,
community and stakeholder engagements were undertaken to identify unmet needs and potential impacts and
to obtain fare structure preferences among minority and low-income communities.

1.E.1.b
Final Draft Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

July 11, 2023

It is important to note that this Fare Equity Analysis represents the impacts associated with the proposed fare
changes upon full implementation as adopted by the Board of Directors. As such, should any of the proposed
changes be determined to be technically or administratively unfeasible, a new Fare Equity Analysis would be
required for any proposed changes to the adopted program in order to comply with federal Title VI guidance.
Additionally, if the agency implements the fare change in a way that is inconsistent with what was adopted, the
agency may need to undertake a new Fare Equity Analysis.
While no adverse impacts on minority and low-income customers were identified, RTD continues to focus on
initiatives that support the customer experience for minority and low-income customers. As discussed in Section
6.1.8, RTD is looking at expanded MyRide retail opportunities for customers who prefer to pay with cash, and are
developing a public outreach and engagement plan to promote the LiVE program (See Appendix B) throughout
the region. Both of these initiatives are expected to improve the customer experience for minority and low-income
customers.
It should also be noted that this Fare Equity Analysis does not evaluate a Zero Fare for Youth Pilot Program or
expansion of MyRide retail opportunities for cash customers. A separate Fare Equity Analysis for these may be
required as applicable. The Fare Equity Analysis also did not examine administrative programs that are being
contemplated or developed for the expansion of means testing beyond the current system used in the LiVE
Program, or programs intended to improve outreach and engagement to promote the LiVE Program. Should the
criteria for LiVE eligibility change, a Title VI Fare Equity Analysis would be required.

Summary
In 2019, RTD introduced the LiVE Income-based Fare Discount Program (LiVE program) that allows eligible
customers to save 40% off RTD full fares. The discount is available directly to the customer, and they can apply
for the LiVE discount through the Colorado PEAK website. Currently, participants qualify if they are between the
ages of 20 and 64, live within the RTD service area and have a household income at or below 185 percent of the
Federal Poverty Level (FPL).
As part of RTD’s Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis (Study), RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE
program that would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for LiVE Discount
fares. The recommended changes will need to be communicated to the public. This plan aims to identify strategies,
resources, and partners to communicate about these changes (once finalized) and ensure that income-eligible
customers receive the information and support they need to fully participate in and benefit from the program.

To reach and educate customers and the public (especially those who are income-eligible) about changes to RTD’s
LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program, encourage participation in the program and provide the informational
and logistical support needed to ensure a smooth transition for the LiVE program expansion.

Current State
The LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount Program is currently available to customers who:




Are between the ages of 20 and 64
Live within the RTD service area
Have a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines, set annually by the
Department of Health and Human Services based on household size and income

LiVE applications are processed through PEAK, the state's public benefits website. Customers enrolled in LiVE
currently receive a 40% fare discount. LiVE discounts currently apply only to mobile and MyRide 3-Hour Passes,
mobile Day Passes and paper and mobile 10 ride ticket books. Access-a-Ride fares do not receive a LiVE discount
in the current fare structure.

LiVE Program Expansion Recommendation
RTD is recommending changes to the LiVE program including increasing the discount from 40% to 50%. Other
changes would increase the number of income-eligible customers who would be eligible for Discount fares. These
changes are as follows.

Increase the Income a Household Can Earn to Qualify
Currently, individuals with a household income at or below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines qualify for this
program. That means, for example, a family of four with a household income of $55,500 or is income-eligible for
the LiVE program discount. RTD is recommending that individuals with a household income at or below 250% of
the federal poverty guidelines be eligible for the LiVE program. Under the new recommendation, a family of four
could make a household income of $75,000 or less and qualify for the discount.

Eliminate the Requirement to Have an In-District Address
RTD is recommending eliminating the requirement to provide a home or mailing address within RTD boundaries
as a qualification for the LiVE program. Doing so would simplify and streamline the enrollment process, provide
more equitable access to customers who are unhoused or underhoused, and provide access to customers who use
RTD but live just outside of the District boundaries.

Apply LiVE Discounts to Access-a-Ride Fares

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Objective

RTD is recommending expanding LiVE discounts to include Access-a-Ride fares for customers who qualify for and
enroll in the program. That would mean that Access-a-Ride customers with household incomes at or below 250%
of the federal poverty guidelines would be eligible for a lower fare, paying $2.25 for the Standard fare (all current
Local and Regional routes) and $9.50 for travel to and from the airport. Visit the Access-a-Ride page for more

information. In addition, the age limits for LiVE eligibility would not apply to Access-a-Ride customers since youth
and senior discounts are not provided for Access-a-Ride fares.

RTD is exploring opportunities to work with community partners to help individuals apply for LiVE. RTD is also
exploring ways to verify an individual is income-eligible outside of the PEAK system and in addition to income
verification by Denver Human Services. Community partners would provide local, trusted support to help incomeeligible customers to enroll in and benefit from Discount fares, increasing the use of equity programs. Verifying
eligibility outside of the PEAK system would simplify and streamline the process for income-eligible customers who
have provided similar documentation through other entities.

Strategy
Through a mix of in-system printed assets, digital and social media channels, community events, open houses,
meetings, in-person and virtual presentations as well as Public Relations efforts, RTD will inform customers and
the public about the finalized changes to the LiVE program as a result of the Study.

Transit Equity Office – Language Access
Based on 2021 RTD survey data, non-English-speaking customers indicated that they rode RTD at least a few
times per week, with a quarter indicating that they rode RTD every single day. The results of this survey along
with other national data illustrates that non-English-speaking populations may rely on public transportation services
more than people who speak English as a preferred language. Additionally, non-English-speaking populations have
a high concentration of immigrants, refugees, asylee seekers and others who, as a result of low incomes given
legal and logistical barriers to fully participate in local economic opportunities, would qualify for the revised LiVE
program. Consequently, the 2024 LiVE program outreach must ensure that it provides language access to
information on the LiVE program changes as well as adequate language assistance support. While all LiVE materials
and the PEAK application itself are currently available in Spanish, this is not the case for other languages.

Transit Equity Office will work with Communications to translate all key assets (e.g., instructions to
apply on PEAK) into Vietnamese and Chinese. The most relevant assets will be strategized by priority
and translated into RTD’s safe harbor languages using the Language Access Plan as guidance and
by working with resettlement agencies/immigrant- and refugee-focused community-based
organizations to identify the most needed resources and languages
Transit Equity Office will identify multilingual community-based organizations and events to host
presentations and Q&A sessions on the LiVE program updates, working with the appropriate
interpreters as needed. Potential organizations include (but are not limited to) Spring Institute,
African Community Center, Boulder County for All, Montbello Organizing Committee and DRMAC
Provide links to the most relevant translated assets on the new LiVE program on the LiVE webpage
on rtd-denver.com as well as other relevant pages

Target Audiences
The target audience of this outreach should center individuals who would benefit the most from the LiVE program
changes as well as the organizations that serve these individuals. Specifically, this entails outreach to people with
low incomes, BIPOC, seniors, non-English-speaking populations (e.g., immigrants and refugees) and people with
disabilities.

Public comments were received in multiple languages. Where the comment was submitted in a language other

Is RTD concerned about being able to fund the fare free after the pilot? Or are you thinking that can
roll forward without hiccups?
I am absolutely amazed at how this process went and in what you have come up with. I think it's
brilliant. It will help so many people. Thank you so much for this.
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a case worker the support RTD
provides to our families in immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the pandemic, you are awesome.
I definitely appreciate the added security - makes me feel safer to ride.
Please lower rates.
I am all for it! Reduce fares yay!
Yes! Reduce fares!
This is a great package of changes. I’m on board with the higher airport cost as it still is the most
affordable option vs Uber or parking. However, I tend to still choose Uber or parking because of the
train schedules that don’t line up which make an already lengthy journey even longer when you
deboard your train at Union Station and find out you just missed the connection you needed. An
increase in frequency of trips (or slightly adjusted to make those types of connections more possible)
would make me reevaluate using the train.
I agree with the proposed RTD fare changes and believe that if fares were lowered, RTD would be
more attractive as a method of transportation around the Denver Metro area.
Fare structure- recommend a tap on tap off structure like in Sydney Australia that you can use credit
card or local card. It avoids educating on fairs and you can keep short trips cheaper than the 3 hour
rule currently. Cost based on tap on and tap off rather than time can increase revenue based on
infrequent users and still create predictible revenue and access for frequent users. Recommend
researching their system if that hasn't been done. Programs- offer families with school age children
who qualify for government programs to access free transit for adults and children. Offer stop gap
emergency cards to schools to support families experiencing homelessness, lost a car, or are highly
mobile. Right now schools can apply for a nonprofit discount but would love to be able to give out
free monthly cards as needed that cover an adult and their children to reduce chronic absenteeism
and support highly mobile families with staying at a consistent school. Also having a way to send the
passes and cards to schools rather than a centralized location can help networks and individual
schools have passes regularly without needing to ship them or drive them to each location.
I think this is a fantastic idea and will help to further encourage greater usage of RTD services!
I wholeheartedly support all of these recommendations. This is the type of policy that impacts our
hardest working Coloradans, our young people, and people in need. We all win with this type of
forward thinking. My favorite though is the no-cost youth pass! Louisville, KY did this a decade ago
and it was a game changer for youth development. Well done, team RTD!
I am a big supporter of the new fare structure. I think these changes will lead to more ridership and
they make me more likely to use the RTD system more often. I hope we continue to implement
changes like these to encourage greater use of public transportation.

I support the new fare structure that lowers cost and simplifies the fares. I utilize the train to get from
my home in Arvada to the airport approximately 3-4 times a year. I also use the train occasionally to
go into Denver to attend sporting events, concerts, and meet with friends near Union Station. In all of
these cases, taking the train lessens the hassle and cost of parking, which is appreciated. Simpler fare
structure helps with our out of town guests as well. It's great to have the train as an option when
friends are visiting from out of town, so they can access the city and the airport independently if
needed. I also really appreciate the changes to the policies and programs to help make utilizing the
train an affordable and accessible choice for all populations in Denver. I think these programs and
the efforts towards Fare Equity will go a long way to increase the use of the train system in Denver.
I do wish the Gold line ran more frequently and that there was expanded access from Denver to
Boulder. Maybe with increased usage over time, we'll see initiatives like these become a reality.
I really appreciate the overall simplification of fares, which will benefit everyone. Although I use the
RTD app, which makes paying easy, it can be tricky to figure out how much a trip is going to cost these
days. The new plan will be easier. Also, as a Senior, I'm excited to note the lower cost, especially for
trips to the airport. The new package looks good!
I believe that the fare structure will help especially those who rely heavily on RTD transportation in
their daily lives. I believe that it fair policies and programs. Working as a care worker and the support
RTD provides to our facilities is immeasurable and astounding.
Thank you for your service during the Pandemic. You are awesome.
I definatly appreciate the added security makes me feel safer to ride.
Fare structure can be confusing especially when using bus+ lightrail/commuter rail. Also a study
needs to be done to make routes more efficient. RTD is usually slower than driving in traffic.
Accepting credit/debit card would be useful too.
Lower fares enable people to get to work, improving the city economy!
I would like to see the Recommended Fare structure implemented. Also return of the FF2 route and
the promised Boulder-Denver rail line.
Simple is better and encourages more riders
Great to make available to those most needing services and more accessible.
Its scary. (I just have anxiety, nothing against RTD)
I have taken RTD since 1978. Only stopped during co-vid and have not started again. Concerns are
park-n-ride safety and union station. Otherwise I feel RTD does a great job.
I like how often the rides are.
Like the "spin the wheel" that they added, like the ambiance and info that is given out. Like the offers
that are given out as well
Love it! No more local/regional fares is a great idea!
One flat rate would be nice so its not complicated
I want fare change for cheaper fares
Standard rate for everything It is very confusing
Fares and charges should be lowered for non-students and the youth. Youth/children should have
lower charges or even no charge at all depending on their ages. Children have no concept of traveling
and are often with their designated guardian or adult, which should be enough charge for their ride
alone.
Fare simplification would be benefit our region. We live between N-line 112th and 104th station and
it seems odd to change regions between the two. Using a local-only fare would allow us to use all
stations equally and benefit lower-income commuters in the higher density areas north of 104th
station.

The goal of a fare structure that's easy to understand and affordable for all is spot on. A simple and
affordable fare structure by default should be equitable too. The youth population would be well
served by the improvements. The Zero Fare for Youth proposal is most promising not only as a
method to increase access to the transit system and promote transit in the near term but also to
cultivate future patrons of public transportation. Many thanks to RTD staff for conducting this
exhaustive study.
Really good and helpful survey
Charges for riding the RTD bus, being a student is fair however can have safety concerns regarding the
bus in general. Generally, I feel and agree with the study's decisions to have a reward system for
frequent users, no fees for children and better discounts for elderly or even vet. Children under the
ages of 5 or 6 should not be charged or have a significantly lower fee due to their age. A rewards
system would not only benefit present users but also encourage more people to use public
transportation frequently.
RTD is really helpful for people with no transportation.
Its really helpful for people with no transportation.
I cant tole feeling unsafe on the 4te anymorer
The new recommendations are needed and appreciated
Make regional pass be for more than 1 day
Reduce fare is great IDEA- For Retirees
The transportation in certain neighborhoods where people of color live is decreasing in availability the
RTD board should look at studying the lack of access they are providing to people of color in a lower
economic bracket.
I really like taking public transportation but I don't like going to Union Station Because of the
homeless people. They should only allow people using public transportation to enter the building.
Otherwise its great to get around.
Can you get the 10 bus to Aurora CO. It was going over there. Now it don't.
I have an elderly mother 95 who I take with me on excursions for fun and stimulis. The ride you offer
is great but I could do it more with lower fares. My sister-in-law was mentally challeneged and she
rode your ride daily. It was a life saver! Thank you. Esther
I agree with the statement
Bus Passes are Reasonabily Prices (114) - SAVES Money. ECO Pass Available for ECE-Catholic
Charities? Please look into it.
Fare pricing needs to be controlled to allow access to all income levels!
I needed to ride RTD for work 2010-2015. I was living on less than $20K /year. Every dollar counted.
Someone in the position I was in needs the change in fare. I'm all for it.
I would like to see the fare on RTD be lowered to help people that can't afford the fares as they are
structured today. Veterans should have a discount, students, the over 55 riders. Thanks. PS: RTD
should also make a way to give jobs to people that have bad things happened to them and give them
a second chance at life. God's giving us a second chance. :)
I think it’s a great idea
All riders should pay something, the "No-cost transit for youth ages 19 and under through the Zero
Fare for Youth pilot" will encourage vandalism and will impose rider safety issues from violence from
under 19 riders.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Overall, the recommended fare structure goes a long way towards making RTD more affordable and
easier to use. However, increasing the time window for a single fare from three to four hours would
make it a more appealing and useful option for riders. With the current three hour travel window,
many riders are forced to purchase a second fare due to traffic congestion, transit delays and other
circumstances. A longer travel window would give riders more of a time buffer against delays to
complete their trip. This would make the fare a more practical alternative to a day pass for riders
wishing to go to a single destination, such as a medical appointment, grocery shopping or other
errand. Therefore, while the proposed regional and monthly pass rates as well as the consolidation
of the local and regional pricing helps encourage commuters to ride RTD for long distance trips, more
could be done to make public transit more compelling for shorter trips. A lower priced base fare or a
longer travel window would encourage more people to choose RTD for local errands and
appointments.
I like the streamlined pricing. I think this is a step in the right direction for more equity with ridership.
I feel there's a real need for customers to feel safe before you can bring back customers to riding
more. Once we have established safety I think proceeding with more routes, particularly at rush hour
times. It seems we've taken away routes instead of adding.
I frequently visit a good friend in Collinsville, Illinois. That is 29 miles from the airport (but not the end
of the line, which is Scott Air Force Base. From the airport to Scott AFB is $2 for seniors. The return
trip fare is based on the station where I board the train. My 29 mile ticket is $1.25.
The recommended fair is still too excessive if you consider someone who works at the airport has to
pay $10 one way per day equaling over $300 a month. I own a car and would like often to take the
train instead but it's cheaper to drive the car even at the gas prices as high as they are today. Because
the stops are so close together the regional ticket should be abolished and that should just be all local
there's nothing that far apart in the metro area. In Dallas you can go between Dallas and fort Worth
for $10 all day long on a day pass on the train you can also have an option on the bus to buy a day
pass for just double the single ride pass and it lasts all day. The reduction of the tickets you have
proposed are literally 25 cent less or 50 cents less not substantial enough to make a difference the
$88 a month pass seems to be the best option but many low income people are not able to come up
with $88 at one time. A weekly pass maybe a good alternative thank you.
I think this fare structure is a really good choice. Standardizing fares for all non-airport journeys
should have positive effects on ridership. And the reduction in price for monthly passes is a great idea
from both a ridership and equity perspective. These changes need to be implemented as soon as
possible.
Please include all students who are registered/enrolled in high school in the pilot program for free
RTD access (this includes students with disabilities who are over the age of 19 but are still enrolled in
public school)
Charge what you like. I can't afford to become a drug addict by riding your vehicles.
I like the proposal, I feel like it would encourage me to ride the commuter rail more often.
I am someone who mostly uses transit to get downtown for leisure activities (I work in the
neighborhood I live in). But the Zero Fare for Youth pilot program really excites me. Right now my son
is 3, and I find it reasonable to pay for a ticket for myself and take him for free on a visit to downtown.
But I've already thought that I wouldn't be as likely to do so after he gets older and passes the age
limit to ride for free. And after we have a second kid, whoo! Definitely wouldn't see that as an
inexpensive way to get around. I love the idea of increasing the age limit for youth to ride free. It
would greatly increase my likelihood of continuing to use public transit.
Hello. I am over 65 and occasionally use RTD. I like having one fare for all zones. Also, and this may
sound strange, but I think the discounted fares for seniors are too generous. For me to go to the
airport for only 1.35 is amazing. Great for us, but a loss of revenue for RTD.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

I don’t mind about the cost of the fares so long as we, the riding public, are safe on the bus and trains.
What needs to be addressed is the safety and welfare of everyone. I have witnessed people doing
drugs inside the train and the filth left by those who have nothing to lose in life. While law abiding
people are like zombies inside - not moving for fear of their own safety. I have seen the decline of
paying and law abiding public riders because of this mess. Even RTD employees are saying they won’t
allow their family to ride public transport anymore. Police visibility is key. It pains me so much to say
that this is no longer the RTD I used to know. I feel sorry for the situation it is in now. Thank you.
nope
I very much support the simplification of the fare structure. Hopefully it will make all users more
inclined to use RTC and for RTD to then enhance (increase) service along key corridors to at least
every 15 minute frequency. I appreciate that outlying counties pay for service (and deserve it), but
we really do need to focus on the everyday trunk line service instead of commuter service. I hope
that these economical pricing tiers make that more feasible for more people. I particularly like the
$88/monthly pass as that seems more likely to be purchased as a "nice to have" option even for
someone that may commute by car a few times/week. I think the fare capping is great, but probably
needs to be explained a few times (and doesn't work with cash), so distribution of farecards may be a
good promotion even if they only have one ride pre-loaded (but the card is reloadable).
I would bet that the August month last year when there was no fee to ride transit went over well. I
think it would be good to try a Transit Week several times during the year. Get companies with staff
working downtown to get a break. Also, the buses, such as Number 10, Number 0, the Mall Shuttle
all have maintenance issues--have you travelled on some of these buses yourselves??? I would guess
Number 15 is the same way. Thanks for listening.
The proposed fare change is a good idea for all
After learning that the RTD My Card and app can be synced, I had to spend quite some browsing and
searching Google/RTD for info on the app. Finally found the section and ordered the card. There
needs to be more education on where to get the card and how to sync it. Phones do die and this is a
great alternative for when you don't have your phone and or don't want to carry. Also if buying
through the card/ app maxes out at the monthly pass price under the new structure. Why can't that
be implemented now even under the current structure???
Registering my support for the new fare structure. As a Boulder resident, I know that lower regional
fares will make me use RTD *more* often to get to and from Denver. I am also in support of any
policy that makes public transit more accessible to low-income residents and visitors.
I think it should be similar to how Minneapolis does it. Plus no extra fare to get to the airport. Not
every employer pays for an Eco pass, or for parking, and it can get expensive for employees who work
there.
The proposed fare structure is still too expensive. RTD should lower it's fares even further to assist
low-income riders, disadvantaged communities and the environment.
As a senior citizen who has a disability and mainly uses public transportation, RTD, I am very grateful
to l those who have worked tirelessly to create the new fare structure. Since I live on my Social
Security checks my income is set and with 1) so many services 2) rent 3) food 4) medicines and 5)
phone use going up, RTD'S efforts to show kindness and consideration to populations such as mine is
a Godsend. I also live in a virtual food desert so a walk doesn't get me to a viable grocery store. I
believe this will help many people in the Denver Metro area and beyond. Thank you for your
extensive work! I'm definitely a fan of RTD!
The new fare structure would be great,and more affordable.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

I highly recommend this fare structure! RTD's fares are some of the highest in the country and do not
provide value for money in my opinion. I commute to the airport 5 days a week, and the new monthly
pass cost would make it much more feasible for me to take the train almost every day. In addition
to the new fare structure, I also recommend that RTD implement 3 and 7 day passes, like many other
transit systems have. This will make it more affordable for visitors to the Denver metro to travel by
transit rather than having to Uber/Lyft or rent a car.
Good revision to the fare structure. Easy to understand and simple to follow.
While the no cost fare idea for Youth may seem attractive, experience elsewhere demonstrates that
some youth will choose to simply board RTD for a frolic or, worse, to annoy or harass other
passengers. Large city transit (NYC, Phila, LA, etc) companies are having significant problems with
youth, including gangs and delinquents who prey upon other riders, occupy handicapped seating and
generally engage in boisterous or disrespectful conduct; regrettably this is fact in 2023. (Look at
experience on Mall Shuttles , Union Station, etc). RTD needs to charge all riders some fare -even if
modest or nominal - to preserve the ability of bona fide users from joy riders, etc. If this is ignored, no
one will choose to ride RTD and subject himself or herself to annoyance and harassment.
Your pricing structure for ECO passes does not make sense. You charge companies a flat price based
upon number of employees regardless if they would use the program or not. If this is not intended,
this is exactly how your contract is interpreted. For instance, one of the largest locations for
employment is the airport (over 35,000 employees). Airlines refuse to buy into the ECO program
because you are charging almost $60.00 per month, per employee that they have (not that are local).
Based upon the definitions of ECO pass pricing, they have 1000's of employees across their companies
(not all local) so most of what they are charged for could never participate. Therefore, you are
missing some of the largest employers in the region (remember that + 35,000 employees at the
airport) because it is cost prohibitive for them to offer such a benefit; especially when parking only
costs $36.00 per month for employees. Why be overcharged due to out of state employees and also
pay almost $60.00 per employee, when they may pay $36.00 to the city for parking? With your
current pricing structure you are missing great opportunity for the very large employers such as
airlines and concessions. Make it simple and offer a blanket cost for SIDA badged employees at the
airport that is competitive to the $36.00 per month parking fee).
I am hugely disappointed in the lack of innovation and creativity in this study. I was expecting a
refresh in fare structure, including at least considering the possibility of abolishing the 3-hour pass
that no one likes; and all we got for regular fares is a 25-cent discount and no more regional level??
Did you know that Denver has one of the most expensive transit systems in the country? It is cheaper
to drive a family of 5 to the airport and park there than it is to take the train--one way! In every other
city I have lived in, fare is based on how far you're traveling, not a fixed (and very high) price. If I am
taking a bus 5 stops down the road, why the heck am I paying 3 dollars?? Sorry, $2.75. In other cities
that would cost me a dollar, maybe less. This study was a wonderful opportunity, and it was
completely wasted. Shame on you, RTD.
Of course I think the new fare structure looks great - simplified and much cheaper. But however will
you meet operating costs at those rates? We are not low-income, but I always do keep in mind how
to help low-income people - while high earners can afford more. High earners should pay more, but
less than it would cost drivers to park downtown. Many corporate jobs with good benefits offer
transit pay, e.g. I used to receive $65 a month to offset the cost of taking mass transit. $6 for a day
pass is perfectly reasonable. For the monthly pass, there should be two rates - one regular at $200
per month, then a $90 one for low-income or airport employees. For people using the A line just for
travel - make it more expensive, but less than getting a cab/Uber ride or paying for parking. e.g. I'd
pay $20 for a round trip to the airport when traveling. (However I DON'T use RTD to go the airport
because I don't trust the train to actually get me there / on time to make my flight.) I realize you can't

rescind these low prices after you've publicized them, but obviously if you couldn't be profitable at
the current rates - you're definitely going to be in the red with these rates that are lower than they
need to be.

Excellent! The new simplified approach and thoughtful and appropriate discounts should really
motivate more people to use RTD!
Hello. I voted for light rail and am a believer and user of public transportation around the world……as
long as I feel safe on it. I DO FEEL SAFE ON THIS LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM! I used to, but I no longer do!!! I
am very disappointed on how it is being overseen. There needs to be consistent security on the trains
and at the stations! I stopped using light rail after too many encounters with a lot of the passengers
struggling with mental illness, homeless riding it to stay warm, out of control youth and drug users. It
is an absolute shame and something needs to change before I will go back to using it in our city.
Senior citizen fares should be less than 50% of full fares. Also, because of safety concerns for the very
elderly, consider free transit for anyone 75 years of age or older using public RTD services.
This is great! I think it simplifies a lot of things while encouraging an interest in use.
The people that are using the RTD system, need better prices and easy access to buses and train
Please reduce the day pass to $5! Also, the light rail feels unsafe at times. Is there a way to increase
the presence of RTD staff or security especially at Union Station?
The fare changes will help so many individuals that rely on public transportation. Our non-profit will
be able to help more clients with the lower fare rates. Especially monthly passes. I like the idea of the
youth not having to worry about having money to get to school, work, and home. It may help some
avoid having to choose between bus fare or eating that day. It can help the kid who is forced to take
the bus, but can barely afford it. Everything is getting more expensive, and would be helpful for our
community to not worry about affording public transportation.
Good job
I don't ride the bus
I don't catch the bus
Please start enforcing the fares. It is pathetic how many homeless and drug addicts just hop on these
trains and buses and move around freely wherever they please around the Denver area. You wouldn’t
need to increase the fares constantly if there was enforcement. People living in the outskirts of town
aren’t going to ride the light rail if they don’t feel safe and all that recent expansion will be for
nothing. Enforcement is absolutely necessary.
Its cool
Riders from N Line 124th Eastlake Station waited a long time for the train while paying taxes toward
the project, then were penalized with higher fares. Abolishing higher fare zone ends confusion about
fares and makes fares fair for all riders
nothing
fundamentally REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION is inequitable and impacts most of all indigent people
trying to go to and from appointments, work and take care of families, but also, people who have
fixed incomes. For all of these people the transit needs to be more robust and free. The inequities of
not being able to live on the corridors of the transit system and for people, like myself, who use
bicycles the RTD system and its connections are fraught with limits and scheduling where to catch the
trains making connections for outlying areas is unwieldy. We need a cross-section of transit options
that accommodate people who have medical and mental challenges. IF we really want to make transit

Much overdue reform in fare structure... the recommended fare structure is just, equitable and

why raise if alot of time the bus does cancel and put people heading to work in a bind
I completely support the recommended fare structure.
I love this idea! As someone who rides RTD a lot, there are times I forget my pass. I shouldn’t but I do.
Having better pricing takes it off of my mind about having to think about how far I’m going. Or if I
need to bump up my fare. Very helpful!
I like the new prices. I have never gone to the airport on the bus. Maybe I will now
I hope the routes don't get cut back because it costs less.

I get the regional and the new price is good. I think local should be less or free.
This makes it easier for me to go to Denver because it's cheaper. Thank you.
I like the prices. Are babies free. I have to bring my baby and I hope I don't have to pay extra for her.
I like the local. I can get around Boulder better now.
These fares will make me take the bus more. It is a lot cheaper which is good because I have a lot of
places to go to. I hope the drivers have change its hard when they keep the change.
There should be a fare for people who are disabled that is better than these. Focus said I can still get
my discount on top of these fares but it's not in writing so I hope you all are still going to do that.
The new fares are great. It makes it easier to get around between towns. Thank you.
I go from Boulder and Longmont a lot so I really like the regional fare. The bus is free in Longmont so
that doesn't matter much to me.
I don't really take the bus in Boulder. I like the light rail in Denver. If the bus and light rail changes are
the same the regional change is the best.
I really like the regional price.
I agree that the fares are a better fit for people riding the buses & trains
Please clean up the trains. They do not feel safe since they are rarely patroled and the fabric seats are
disgusting germ factories. Tired of people smoking pot/cigarettes/cigars on the train. I will drive and
sit in traffic because I do not feel safe and the trains are disgusting.
You should like, destroy most of the R line and re-do it. All the other lines go fast because they go
straighter. The R Line sucks because there’s like a bunch of tight curves or whatever. It’d be a lot
cooler if it followed the freeway and went faster n stuff. You could still use the old tracks that you’ve
already built; just turn it into a trolley or something and build a new track between Colfax and Florida
for a properly fast light rail. Also you could add a stop next to the In n’ Out Burger, that would be cool.
I like the new fare structure it's so much easier to understand I just hope that if you get increased
riders you do ensure people are paying and not using it as a moving homeless encampment.
I use live program this is so convienient instead of loading my live card at King Soopers. Thank you
I have many clients who rely on RTD and we would love to help them more w/ funding, it has just

the prices were lowered we would be able to help them out more!! So exciting!!
It will increase ridership because more people can afford it and increase airport train useage

I think RTD is changing people's lives within the community. I am thankful for the beneficial free fares
for our youth. I know a few kids that need this so much! This will help them succeed. Thank you RTD.
As a parent with two kids, free youth fares would encourage us to ride the train more often. The
additional cost of paying for the whole family makes it more expensive than parking, so we usually
drive. We are season pass holders at Elitches, so this would definitely be useful for us.
I live near Green Valley Ranch and my work is on Jackson Gap Rd. The area has more warehouses and
factories but they are having trouble staffing because there are no transit options. Would like if they
expanded the 42 or 45.
As a senior living in the Baker neighborhood, fervent about traffic/pollution/transportation issues in
Denver, I fully support lowering prices for monthly RTD passes. Let's make ridership accessible and
affordable for all, and reduce car traffic!
Like the idea of creating a monthly pass that encourages regular use including airports. Also like the
social equity aspect of the Live program.
I like the proposed fare reduction and simplification. $1.35 fare doesn't make sense for low income make it a whole $ amount.
I want to see the transit system continue to grow and connect communities. We need more routes,
decreased fare, cleanliness and safety measures increased for Colorado (Denver) transit system.
These changes to the economic system is so great and creates a more accessible community and will
ultimately help the environment!
As a student who doesn't have a car, these changes are fantastic! I'll be more able to get to work.
Love this! Making public transportation as accessible as possible financially is huge and helps people
have more economic opportunities.
I think it's mucho bien. I'm 64 and there's not a lot of work and it would be good to do that. I live in
Denver.
This will be good for a lot of people who're disabled and don't have a lot of money. I'm surprised it
was so expensive.
I ride the buses a lot and me and my wife are on SSDI and the cost of what it was was way too
expensive. A cheaper pass means we can put it to something else.
I take the bus every other day. I'd much rather have it cheaper because the fare seems like it goes up
and the town halls feel useless. This should help people take the bus more but I would like to see it
lower.
I like it! Thanks :)
Overall, I support the new proposed fares. The best change is the Regional monthly pass fee. This will
help many achieve access. The minimal reduction in single adult fare is not as good. Still room for
improvement there to help our community achieve access to public transportation.
I live in Broomfield and needed to commute to both Boulder and now Denver for the 4 years I have
lived here. Many times I have considered and honestly dreamed of using public transportation, but
driving has always been more timely. Now that I work close to Union Station, I am again interested in
using public transportation. The new fare structure would make it much more appealing for someone
like me, who lives in the suburbs to use the bus. Even though the time it takes to get to work may not
change due to these policies, the reduction in fare rates makes it much more worth the time. I wish
Colorado could be a leader for the country when it comes to public transportation and though we
have a long way to go, these new fares, policies, and changes that create greater accessibility for
those in need, is certainly a step in the right direction.
I think these lower fares would be very helpful for people like my wife and myself.

The 3-hour window should be increased to 4. When I go to the Performing Arts Complex I end up
having to pay a fair both ways because the window is not long enough. At this point it almost makes it
non practical because I could just drive down there and pay for parking for a couple bucks more
I ride the bus to and from work and think the amount to ride is a little expensive, the proposed
amount would be great.
The reduce rate of Live will help so much on bringing in more riders weekly, if not daily, for even
individuals on fixed income.
I am all for the proposed fare structure change and think that free fare for youth will greatly increase
use and accessibility for many many people
I am in support of the proposed structures. I wish there was Apple Pay.
I am all for a lower fare for the bus considering it is the daily commute of my daughter to and from
school. Also the free youth fare for a year is an awesome idea to bring youth out into the community
and around the city
I appreciate the reduced fares and actually think they should be free. If they are simplified, I think
they should be rounded to $2 for a few hours and $5 for all day.
Elimination of zones is so smart! We have to do that. Good on ya
It's better to lower cost for RTD. makes me w Less worried about public transit.
It should be cheap for those who cannot afford to pay/afford a car.
It’s great to reduce the price of public transport to get more cars off the road
I think that the fair structures look fair. I like the day pass option that is affordable
I think the new fare structure is an improvement. I do think there should be youth fare discounts
I believe public transit should be free for all. Anyone that rides public transit is doing thw world a
favor. Less cars on the road. Less gas consumed. This should be rewarded with free fare. Its not a
handout. Its a way if life and it is helping preserve the world.
Support the lower rate of bus passes. Would like to see more light rail.
Cheaper fare
So more people can benefit. Also maybe more working people will once again take this
transportation. I am now concerned about taking it because there is so much violence
Bring back the 16L!!!!!
If you really want more people to ride RTD, I would suggest a fare-free month. Then more people will
ride and enjoy the trip.
I think the new fare structure seems much more simple and I am excited that youth will ride free and
costs across the board are decreasing a bit!
Please lower the fare structure to 19 and younger free...thank you
I agree with lower fare prices
Love the simplified fare structure and that kids ride for free. Thanks for supporting families!
Reducing fares, especially monthly passes, makes using RTD much more likely. Reduced local fares
while keeping airport fares up seems smart. PLEASE give free fares to youth to promote transit usage
at a young age
Appreciate the reduction in monthly pass amount. Great work
Make riding safer by removing non paying riders that do drugs on the train
Love the changes, and how it will be less confusing!
Love the reduced monthly pass cost but please bring the discount 3-hour pass cost down to $1.00 and
daily pass cost down to $2.00 as RTD does not give change. This will help make RTD truly affordable

It's about time fares came down. RTD was my only mode of transit other than my bike for years and i
would watch the fares go up while quality of service and serice in general decreased or remained the
same. I remember when fare for a monthly pass was under $100 dollars and it was affordable then.
After Covid hit there were service interruptions as was to be expected, and the busses and trains
began running on a weekend schedule which meant some routes were and lines were no longer
running, (such as the 122X) but the worst part about it was over a year later service was still
structured like this with no plans foreseeable to return to normal schedules, and yet fares remained
unchanged. Many riders, myself included felt outrage at this. Not only had we seen a steady annual
increase in fares and a drop in services anyway, how could RTD in good faith be audacious enough to
continue to charge it's riders a full fair when they weren't providing the whole service to its riders?
Inwas paying $114 dollars per month for what? Maybe 3/4 of the use routes and lines offered. RTD
really dropped the ball on that one and for the first time in my ridership did I feel like I was getting
taken by RTD. I hope this plan goes through, and prices do come down. The riders are owed at least
that much.
Why not set the age for Senior Fare to 60 or 62 ? Many seniors take Social Security at 62 and are
retired.
What would the rates for seniors be
Really hope the bus fare can go down xoxo
I am concerned about the under 19 free fare, basically a good idea but might encourage delinquent
kids to act out, commit crimes in places outside their neighborhood if they could just get on
wherever.
Homelessness and crime.
Lower fares for low income/disabled and also free fares for children ages 19 & under would be
beneficial to our community
I see two significant problems with the proposed fare structure: 1. $10/person each way to the
airport, which is $40 R/T for a couple plus $2/day parking, keeps private vehicles and off-site parking
an attractive option. For a family of 4, $80 plus parking. The Airport should cost the same as regional
fares. 2. The flat $2.75 fare has people living in higher density areas--a responsible decision--and
taking short RTD trips subsidizing those living in low-density exhurbs. Philosophically, this is
backwards, but has always been the failing of RTD: its focus on moving people around the suburbs.
Everyone needs equal opportunity
SEIU Local 105 represents over 8,000 members across the Denver Metro Area, the state of Colorado
and the Mountain West. This comment is specifically made on behalf of our Denver Metro Area
members that have difficulty affording and finding accessible transportation to and from their jobs.
Our main concern is that the companies that directly and indirectly employ our members say that the
Eco-Pass benefit some of them provide is too expensive. Although SEIU Local 105 welcomes the
proposed fare structure for businesses, it may still fall short to satiate the need for a better public
transportation experience. This is especially true for areas that currently are far away from major
populated centers, like Denver International Airport (DEN). But the need for a better RTD service is
also true for our 2,500 janitorial members that clean office spaces across the Denver Metro Region.
Most of this work is performed after working hours, when schedules are sparse, presenting a major
difficulty for our members to get back to their loved ones. The issue of high costs for the EcoPass for
employers is also at play. Given these two examples, DEN and the Downtown area and metropolitan
suburbs, SEIU Local 105, strongly encourages RTD to look into creating special incentive zones similar
to what other cities have enacted, including in our own backyard: Boulder. The City of Boulder

what RTD could accomplish for DEN and the main commuting regions within Metro Denver. Another
idea we welcome, specifically to the DEN workforce, is creating a system of free employee-only
shuttles to and from the airport, connecting with the A-Line, that should also be free to DEN workers.
Airports around the world have a dedicated transportation system for their employees and as a
world-class airport, DEN, RTD and the airlines should work together to study the viability of this
alternative. SEIU Local 105 has also heard about RTD’s conversation to create a master
transportation contract with the airlines at DEN. This master contract should include the contractors
and sub-contractors that provide services to the airlines. Designing a program that excludes the
workers that, through other vendors, directly and indirectly, support the airlines, is a program
destined to fail. Our union looks forward to engaging RTD, DEN, the airlines and other regional and
city government officials to provide additional input and testimony on why contractors and
subcontractors of airlines need to be included in any master airline transportation contract. It is
crucial that fare policies and programs are regularly evaluated and adjusted as needed to ensure that
they continue to meet the needs of workers and low-income riders. If we all want to make Denver
and the Denver Metro Area more green and accessible in terms of jobs, housing and basic needs, we
need to find ways to improve and fix the public transportation grid. Ultimately, by prioritizing the
zones of greater usage within populated centers, but also in far away regions like DEN, RTD can create
a more inclusive and efficient transportation system that benefits everyone in our community. I urge
you to carefully consider SEIU Local 105’s recommendations and to work towards creating a more
equitable and accessible public transportation system in the Denver Metro Area.
Looks great! Much simpler and will really help low income families! Looking forward to the new rail
line to Boulder/Longmont. Hope there is a stop in Gunbarrel!
I really like the simplicity of the new fare structure. I think it will help riders understand it better.
While I appreciate the lowered fares, that personally doesn’t impact me as much. But grouping the
local/ regional together is very helpful.
I just think there should be lowered it's really outrageous to have to commute when a lot of people
are still feeling the covid stuff and it's hard for people to come up with the money for a bus and get
from here to there my self I get help from the empowerment group with bus passes but it's before
that I would have to constantly try to figure out how to get bus where I needed to go so if you guys
would make a structure it's a little bit lower the people could reach for people that are in the lower
income phase or like you said discounted that would be awesome I need to start helping the people
more thank you very much for your time
Bus are very unstable especially on weekend. Bus route is to long especially on the 76-Wadsworth
especially when it snows. We have to wait on 3 or 4 hrs for the Bus. No real back up on the routes.
We have to wait 3 or 4 hrs for an asser ride and back up driver - for when they breakdown call from
dispatch to let us is the bus is running down. Why don't you will try a volunteer dispatch service for
someone closer the call instead of having a customer waiting 4 or 4 hours.
I strongly support the streamlining of RTD’s fare policy, and appreciate greatly the decreased cost of
both individual fares and monthly passes!
Being elderly and disabled and on a fixed income, it is hard to make ends meet as it is. It would be
greatly appreciated if I didn't have to pay so much to ride the bus, which gives me access to my
community and various, much needed, resources. Respectfully, Donna
Thank you for simplifying the fare structure for everyday work commuter, such as myself. It might be
too complicated but I'd love to find out how you all applied a fare equity analysis to this process.
I'm thrilled to see an $88 monthly pass. Between the reduced price and fare capping, it makes the
decision to take RTD instead of driving a no-brainer. The simplification and price reductions of the
employer pass programs will make it easier for employees to talk about starting a pass program with

I'm 67 and live 1/2 block from the 28 bus. Currently, I can pay $1.50 and take that bus to the Central

the proposed fee plan, I will be able to pay $1.35 for the bus and get a free transfer to take the train
from the central park station to the airport. Is that correct, or will I have to pay an additional $1.35 to
take the train to the airport?
The changes on Discount and adding LIVe to AAR are going to be a great improvement Please

I believe a lower fare structure would benefit all involved because more ridership supports better air

like to have some help with the bus fare. I would be nice if the rec center and the police academy
could work with RTD to reduce the bus fare.
This is a good program for my people. Thanks

It seems to me that the proposed fair structure is much more fair and easier to understand. I am very
much in favor of expanding the access and discount fair program.
I don't ride the bus very much but I will take it more now. I like the regional all day price. The local is
better also
I buy the monthly pass regional/airport. Currently it takes me 20 commutes per month for the
monthly pass to pay off. Some months I don't meet that threshold. Under the new structure, it would
take me 9 commutes. This is such a vast improvement for me and would conjure no hesitation in my
monthly pass purchase. The monthly pass encourages me to ride RTD even when I "need" to, so
cheaper monthly passes would be a plus all around!
I believe that the fares prices should be much lower. A majority of people who use the public
transport systems are lower income folks, and it doesn't make sense to charge so much. Reducing
prices ensures equity of the public transport system. Reducing prices will also increase the number of
folks who use it, reducing our green house gas emissions in Denver.
The regional for the day is the best price.
These prices are great especially the regional. I think the bus should be free for veterans but these
prices are good for everybody else.
I wish it was all free for people with bad health. We have to take the bus a lot for our medical stuff.

go to Boulder once a week and now it's cheaper.
The regional price is the best. I have to go from Boulder to Longmont a lot so this saves me money
since the local is free in Longmont
Absolutely appreciate the effort to bring equity to RTD. Cannot wait to see the positive impact these
fare changes will bring to the communities of Colorado. When I was younger I relied on the light rail
to go to school, today I use twice a week to go to work. Thank you for all the positive changes you are
bringing to CO. Great work to all the people involved in these changes.
I really like the local one. I can take the bus more now.
Looking forward to the new rates to share w/ people.
The regional price is good
This is too much. I am homeless and I can't pay this. The bus should be free if you are homeless.
I like the new changes RTD is proposing in order to create more equitable opportunities in bus fares
for all citizens in RTD's area of work. I like the proposal of making local/regional fares the same price,
and I like the idea of youth bus fares being free.
These prices are good. Now I don't have to ride my bike that much.
I'm glad the price is lower. Is it lower for older people too? I am older and I like senior discounts
The price is good for the regional. Too much for local
All public transit should be free. Travel is a right of the people.
I would love for my grandma as she gets older and for me to be able to ride the bus for cheaper prices
especially for those in my community who need rides.
I don't take the bus but if I do I like these prices.
I think the bus should be free for people that are homeless
As someone who has been closely following the issues w/ fare structures specifically impacting our
clientel (parolees), I can confidently say that the changes being proposed will have a profoundly
positive impact on our community particularly for nonprofits and low income around the city. I was
especially pleased to see the inclusion of the 10% bulk discount; This will help many organizations
save money in the long run. I also believe that this change will make a real difference for those who
have been struggling to afford transportation in the region. Overall, I want to commend the
decision-makers involved for their thoughtful and forward -thinking approach to these issues. It is
clear that those involved have carefully considered the needs of the community and nonprofits and I
am confident that the proposed changes will be felt by many in a truly meaningful way.
I like the new price.
It should be cheaper for people with disabilities. I can't walk and I have to take the bus but I can't
work so the bus is a lot.
I like the cheaper regional. I hope the drivers have change.
I like the structure but I don't understand why local isn't free everywhere. Longmont has free local
buses
$88 still to high to encourage people to leave their vehicles and use more public transportation and
reduce carbon emissions
Equity, and more importantly justice, would be free transit for all. It removes barriers to access.
Reduces stress and anxiety for those most impacted by not expose people to invasive application
processes. Reduces overhead costs of managing upwards of 15 different fare products/structures.
Increases ridership as shown by fare free August 2022. Please end fares and find funding from other

As a long time RTD rider, this recommended fare structure is highly attractive and I hope it passes.
With the delays & frequent cancelations on the A-line, the new monthly fare would make it more
affordability to those moving about in the city who need to find last minute (and sometimes higher
rates on busy/peak ride share) options to get around. Thank you for your consideration.
I DEPEND ON RTD AND RESPECT THEM
The recommended fare structure both simplifies the fare system and lowers fares, making it a great
solution. It will help drive equity as well as higher transit use. A simpler system also will encourage
more tourists and other visitors to use transit as it is not as confusing to have to try to figure out what
zones they will be traveling in.
I support Title V1
Enthusiastic support for fare reductions to improve access! The current fee structure doesn't work
economically, even against downtown parking costs! The new structure will make it much more
accessible to commuters and those who rely on public transportation as their primary mode of
transportation.
I'm not sure if this idea has been discussed, but I wanted to mention it while I had a moment. I've
been a driver for 4+ years, so I have many thoughts about how things could be improved. Relating to
the fares though, I think making a 1-way trip without a transfer should only cost $1. It's not fair to
charge $3 to a passenger that's going 2 miles down the road to get home and also $3 for a passenger
that's going to ride for 40 min, switch busses and ride another half hour. It just doesn't make sense
that both situations are the same fee. I hope this will be implemented.
The safety of our car and belongings at the park and ride (especially 40th) is in danger. I know many
people that got their car stolen or/and broken into multiple times. Insurance doesn’t even cover the
damages. So we need RTD to work on making those parking spaces safe.
The train is always delayed, especially on Saturdays. After being delayed for an hour, the small train
comes and half of the people that have been waiting would not even fit which makes us all late to
work.
There are days I stay at the airport overnight because I miss the last train at 1 am. Most times, I would
be assigned a last-minute passenger and by the time I get the passenger to their destination, clock out
and make it to the train station, it is too late for me to catch the last train of the night, so I sleep in the
airport for the night.
I work for a low income community in north Denver, lower fairs and monthly passes would help out
my resident's greatly
This is an excellent first step to making RTD fares easier to use. RTD should work toward identifying
more non-fare sources of revenue, with the goal of eventually making the entire system fare-free.
Regarding the RTD LiVE Income Based Discount Program. I am pleased that this program is available
as it covers a large demographic not previously available with other discount fare programs. I'm
looking forward to proposed enhancements possibly coming in the future to LiVE. One feedback I
would like to give is for the reloadable MyRide card for the LiVE program. This is a great option for
many people that are unable to use the MyRide mobile ticketing app. either because they do not have
access to a mobile phone, on-line options and do not have or cannot obtain a debit or credit card to
use for payment and need to use cash. The MyRide card is a good alternative however it can only be
reloaded at an RTD Sales Outlet which severely limits their ability to reload the card as there are only
a few locations available to do this. Their needs to be more access available for people in the
community that must use cash to reload their cards. Grocery stores or convenience stores would be a
good option for these folks. Thanks for all you do with the discount fare programs.

Appreciate the simplicity of the new fee structure and commitment to accessibility for all riders. Well
done and thank you!
This is a great step in the right direction but does not go far enough with the airport fare. If you travel
with one other person it is likely to be the same price to Uber vs taking the train. The airport train
should be THE way to get to and from but if it costs $10 per person people will remain opposed to
using it. The barrier to entry is barely too high. Including it in the monthly pass is a great addition,
however. I do very much appreciate the combination of local and regional into a lower price. This
makes it much simpler to use!
I think they're a lot of work to be done in outreach letting people know about the discounts offered. I
like the idea of grocery stores, food banks and libraries having info and retail options for purchasing
these passes. They should have big obvious signs talking about the discount programs and how you
can buy tickets and passes there. Also the app needs a lot of work. There should be accurate location
data on the busses and trains whereabouts, how early or late they are so they can provide riders with
accurate ETAs. I can't rely on the busses downtown to be in time so that I can make my connection. I
missed two connections today and was late to work! That's not my fault but it looks like a terrible
excuse to my employer! Please address the timeliness of busses, they either arrive late or leave too
early, I've experienced both situations and it's ridiculous. The operators need to stick to a strict
schedule for the rider's sake!
Hi, I want to voice my support for the reduced cost of fares and passes, free fare for youths, and the
expansion of the LIVE discount. I think these changes are a great start to changing car dependence in
Denver and a step in the right direction for reducing greenhouse gases. This seems to be one of the
first real actions I've seen that can reduce emissions and I want to applaud the proposed changes and
people making it happen. I think this will increase ridership and make transit an option for more
people and for families that want to use transit. Lowering fares is a great way to encourage more
people to get out of their single occupant vehicles and use transit. I've used RTD buses and rail for 10
years and have seen a wide variety of people and interactions. I have never felt threatened or fearful
using transit unlike the feelings I get when driving with so many aggressive, arrogant, careless motor
vehicle operators. We need systemic change to dismantle car dependency and violence and this is a
great step. Thanks and keep up the good work on increasing transit use and decreasing carbon
emissions.
My husband and I are in our seventies and so appreciate that we are close to the light rail and buses.
We don’t have to pay to park and most of the places we visit are within walking distance. Thanks.
This new fare structure seems very equitable and smart. I think it will have almost only positive
impacts. Thank you
As a member of a group that advocates for the unsheltered and under-served, this program would
mean a lot to our clients. It would make it possible to avoid fines, keep their things, get medical help,
visit shelters and food banks, and find housing and jobs. It would help to remove some of the unfair
burden carried by those who suffer in poverty. Changing the fare structure to reflect equity is not only
going to increase paid ridership, it is a moral responsibility to our most vulnerable.
Very much look forward to these changes! It’s far too expensive for airport employees to use transit
to the airport! Also, please work with the airlines to get passes offered to their employees at no-cost
to the employee!

I attended the May 16th Zoom meeting, and I don't think I received a thoughtful or serious answer to
my question - which was intended to be constructive. Someone else in the chat asked about the base
fare being $2.75 rather than an even $3.00. I wanted to explore how RTD's current fare collection
equipment could replicate what other systems do (MBTA, RFTA?) by printing a stored-value card that
could be used on a future ride. I asked what it would take for the bus printers to print something
other than transfers. The answer I received was essentially "the bus printers print three-hour passes
and day passes," and "our system can't do what you're asking." My apologies for using informal
terminology that people who ride your buses would use ("transfers") instead of terminology used by
people who work at 1660 Blake St. The answers I received didn't seem to have received much thought
from the staff member who answered. At a minimum, I would have expected a reply such as "we'd
need someone from our IT department or our fare media vendor to discuss that, and unfortunately,
they're not here at this meeting." Instead I got a message that "The host has removed you from the
web meeting" at the end of the hour - before this and another question of mine was answered.
I never received an answer to this question during the May 16 noon webinar: Regarding other agency
policies, such as Portland Tri-Met's option of a diversion by applying for the analog of RTD's LiVE
program as restitution for fare evasion (that is, instead of paying a fine or performing community
service - see https://trimet.org/fares/fareisfair.htm ), would this possibility need to be considered as
part of the Fare Equity Study or the separate Respect the Ride effort? I hope that since I wasn't able
to get an answer during the webinar that this topic can be covered in the study's final
recommendations.
Needs to be more affordable
I work as the homeless student liaison at a charter school. I was very excited to see a No-cost transit
for youth ages 19 and under. This will help so many students - low income and homeless.
Transportation to school is one of the barriers so many homeless students experience. By providing
transportation, RTD has increased students' ability to achieve their and their family's goal of
graduating. Thank you!
Currently Access-A-Ride customers may ride regular services for free. Will this continue?
I would like to advocate that McKinney-Vento Homeless students and families be categorically
exempt from income verification for the LiVE program and that school districts be allowed to be an
organizational partner where we can purchase bulk LiVE passes for this specific population. PEAK is a
barrier for our students and families. Please make LiVE passes available for purchase just like Local 10
Ride Ticket Books. Thank you!
Gracias por apoyar a la comunidad esperemos que estas tarifas sean accesibles para los menos
afortunados
Gracias por tomar en cuenta la opinión de la comunidad que esta palpando la necesidad
I LOVE the idea of making RTD free for youth. Adolescents are seeking independence and need access
to mobility in order to transition into adulthood. Making this fare free would increase access to
school choice, promote access to after-school activities, and give teens the independence they are
craving and need to develop a healthy sense of self-sufficiency and self-agency.
This comment is unrelated to the changes to fares, etc. But this issue is much more important than
any of that. I used to be a daily rider of RTD. Due to increasing crime, mostly damage to cars at the
park-n-rides & the transients at Union Station, I (and my family) no longer use RTD. I used to be a big
proponent of RTD, defending the funding, tax increases, etc. I will no longer support RTD until you
take the crime problem seriously, and work with police to apprehend and convict all criminal activity
surrounding RTD properties.
I encourage you to adopt the new fare structure, especially the recommended discount fare structure
for people over 65, Medicare recipients and those with disabilities. It will make a huge impact in their

Will Access-a-ride passengers be given a day trip for as many trips as they can make for that day fee.

LOVE! The new fare structure, It is a huge improvement. I am hoping we can continue to adjust the
price to drive increased ridership! Also hoping soon we can support nfc on iphones through apple
transit passes, would increase my ridership!
I believe the proposed plan would be good. It would make it easier and more affordable and by being
a disabled vet it would help out.
I feel that youth shoulde have free fares in order to attend school
All of these are a good idea.
I am so very excited about the new fare structure. I will definitely be riding the train and bus more
often once it is live. I absolutely think that the three pairs for all you should be extended beyond the
one-year pilot program. We need long-term investment in our youth and public transit. It is also kind
of strange to have bus fares be $1.35 because people don’t often Carey coins anymore. They should
definitely be rounded to the nearest whole dollar.
When I travel a single person j will take the bus/light rail to the airport. When it’s 2 or more of us
traveling to airport it is cheaper to pay for parking at dia vs round trip rail ($40 for 2 ppl) $30 for
parking.
Getting around with the bus is a really fun experience and this free for June thing for buses will really
help when I get to work and school
I think that we should have better bus stops and make bus stops easier to be at because having to
stand in the rain trying to get to school
These changes are ESSENTIAL for the people of Denver in providing public transportation for all! As a
bus rider myself the monthly pass decrease would be a game changer for me and allow me to access
more places that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to.
Location of transit is not convenient. Makes many last mile problems
We appreciate the current 70% discount off of full fares that youth currently receive. We purchase
10-pack ticket books for our kids to use when they ride the bus. However, sometimes they don't
anticipate needing to get home on their own and forget to bring their tickets when they are out.
Having a zero-fare program for youth would allow my kids to access public transportation whenever
they need it, rather than rely on a parent to pick them up in a car.
I'm an infrequent rider and will benefit hugely from these changes. Currently the monthly fare is
inaccessible to me and the new one would be affordable.
Can you please work with DIA to provide a discount for airport employees? The a.m. trains are FULL of
us & even with this proposed reduction, this is still a lot of $. I wanted to take the train daily to help
the environment, but it’s unfortunately cheaper for me to drive. Thank you!
I would be pleased if the monthly regional pass was reduced to 88$. One low price, one time
purchase would make my life convenient. I know several who would take the triai to DIA but
complain that the price is too high. I think ridership would increase with the new airport fare.
Thanks!
I'm very excited to see this simplified fare structure. Living in a local zone along a regional route, I

The cheaper regional fare is the best part.
It should be free for homeless people or people with no money. I also hope you don't cut the routes.
I like that the regional and local day pass is less because I have to go to Longmont to work.
I hope you all still make money. It's nice that you're giving us a break.
Glad it is going to cost less money. My issue is the drivers kick me off if I don't have exact change. I
think the $2.75 will make the same problem for me and lots of others.
The bus should be free for local rides
I like the cheaper local fare but I hope the drivers will have change so they don't take an extra quarter
when I ride the bus.
I like these new fares because the monthly fare is less.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. Additionally, see the success of the free fare programming both here in Denver/August,
and in other cities. I'm a firm advocate of making RTD fares completely free. It reflects the accurate
value system of our community members who rely most on these services, greener/cleaner/lower
congestion on our streets, and eliminates ALL of the cost and accountability of collecting fares at all.
Imagine how streamlined a system we could have if drivers were not at all concerned about collecting
fares, we didn't have to have officers screening for non-payment and risk unhealthy encounters, no
systems or procedures would need to be in place, screened, trained, reviewed, reciprocated in
accountability, etc. It would simply save more money than it brings in to charge $0 for all transit. I
urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state
funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our
transit system accessible for all. Thank you.
The fare structure looks more affordable and should allow more people to be able to access the rtd
services
I think it makes sense to not have a higher fee for those in lower cost of living areas (generally further
out) so mass transit is used more. I’m not sure I would lower the local fare though. Why not just leave
it the same? $3 (for 3 hrs) & $6 (for day) to have a slightly lower tax burden & “even” $ amounts.
Otherwise I like the ideas. Thanks!
Agree only if this change won’t affect the quality of the service. Right now is good. Keep it that way
I think that the new recommended fares are a great improvement. I have been using the RTD college
pass for a couple of years, but now that I'm graduating and losing access to that I have been trying to
figure out how to make my commute. The current monthly pass is far to expensive to justify purchase
for me but at a price point of $88 its far more reasonable and I would be more than likely to continue
to utilize RTD services for commutes. Thank you for taking the time to do this study and for the
potential of making RTD affordable for everyone! Best regards, Taylor Mundt

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The Fee structure is still outrageous. I've been to dozens of other countries around the world and
these fares are laughable. If we want to move to mass transit, the costs need to be lower. Period.
Wake up.
The new fee structure appears more affordable for those groups of riders who actually depend on
public transportation. I especially believe that the reduce cost for regional and airport fares will
benefit the metro area as a whole with regard to reduced traffic and air pollution.
Riders 65 or older should ride free. They've paid RTD taxes for decades. Gets them off the road and
decarbonized too. Children should pay something. Teaches them that transportation costs $$$ and
isn't free. They learn the sting of paying taxes for RTD services. RTD must first ensure a safe, clean,
vagrant free riding experience before customers will return. RTD light rail is a fixed guideway system
designed to move passengers toward the center city. This is now an obsolete concept. Neighborhood
circulator buses should be stationed at each light rail stop to better service the local neighborhoods
rather than the central city. A once to twice per hour express light rail train should service the
downtown. This will require dispatching capabilities far above what RTD currently has. RTD
management needs reengineered. Far too many chiefs with far too few Indians, especially beat cops.
18 RTD Board members is ridiculous.
Please clean up your bus stop trash. Lafayette at Lucerne and Hwy 287 is piling up and blowing trash
all over Lafayette. Bad environmental impact by RTD.
I support the new fare structure. I would also support having someone check fares. I think those of
us that pay them are subsidizing a lot of riders who don't.
Why is the CEO salary so high?
I would like to see a monthly pass available to LiVE participants. Being on SNAP and unemployed I am
constantly on the bus all over the district for interviews and job searches.
I’m reviewing the new fare schedule there is no option for veteran discounts. As a disabled veteran
who requires the RTD A and R lines to make appointments at the hospital etc. I have to prove
disability. This is fine however I choose not to file for state disability, my injuries are a result of federal
service and only use Veterans Affairs for medical and disability. Currently RTD requires state disability
forms for disability discounts. My choice to “save money in the state pot” for others to use
automatically puts me in tougher financial positions and I receive no disability assistance on Bus/Rail
options. I have on numerous occasions, going back to 2020, been harassed by RTD security staff
because “I don’t look disabled.” My apologies RTD that disabilities are not appearance based as the
Americans with disabilities act would agree. RTD’s managerial incompetency is being taken out on
paying customers, shocking RTD can’t seem to make the correlation from their actions and policies
and the drop in ridership. This includes employee conduct. Just a former new flyer transit operator
from Virginia with 3 years of observation now on RTD and well, I still wait for the ability to applaud
RTD for doing something correct, observations and easily heard comments from riders show that
Denver will not have reliable public transportation anytime this decade at the current pace and with
the leadership in place. Union Station (train areas) also appalling. The urine rich aroma of public
transportation in Paris, is still far cleaner than the RTD and it’s well known those aren’t water puddles.
RTD is the problem, public transport is meant to be a solution, perhaps new leadership with European
and or real world experience is necessary. With road rage accidents on the rise, this is the time to
shine for public transport, not continue to circle the drain down the toilet. Hopefully RTD can make
positive changes, in less than 10+ years, my optimism remains low.
Please continue the EcoPass program. It has pushed me to use RTD more consistently and to get more
cars off the road. It is a great program for companies/organizations that buy into it. I am a BVSD
employee and get the EcoPass through BVSD. I love it and wish it was also available for my family. The
new fare structures look reasonable (especially the free youth option), but the EcoPass needs to
continue as well. Thank you.

I live within a very short walk to 10th & Osage and work a very short walk from Orchard. I chose this
job and house due to proximity to RTD. I never take it though as I feel uneasy at the 10th & Osage
station with all the vagrants hanging by the grassy slope. And the zone fare is just too expensive to
justify. Yes we can afford it, but there comes a point where it just doesn't make sense. There should
be a charge, just not so cost prohibitive for those who do not get subsidized. But enough of a cost to
keep the vagrants from taking up all the space. Also need to step up security. Drugs are out of hand.
Another huge disappointment is the RTD after a Fiddlers Green event. We gave up on that year's ago.
Always worried that we wouldn't fit on the one last train that runs when the show lets out. And way
too long of a wait time to catch that last train. They should be a few trains ready to go when big
events let out. I hope you can get us back as customers, we've been so disappointed by the whole
system...
Kids zero fair would allow more to ride it. I can’t afford it with the kids and myself
Love the new structure! Feels much simpler for first time or out-of-town users.
Simplify the tickets by allowing/limiting rides by time-of-use, not Regions crossed. Riders taking the D
train from Littleton-Mineral have a total of ONE stop that's in their "Local" region. Riders taking the W
train, from JeffCo Govt's Cntr-Golden have ZERO stops in their "Local region. Riders taking the E and
R trains, from RidgeGate Pkwy, in contrast, have NUMEROUS stops, before hitting a new region. This
makes no sense and financially burdens/punishes riders, based on where they live.
Fare should be free and frequent. RTD is a PUBLIC SERVICE that should be fully funded through taxes
and grants. I moved into a house because of its proximity to the light rail six years ago and took the
light rail downtown. Then the (already more expensive than driving) price went up, then trek of the
three stops I used got cut and frequency decreased, then the price went up again, then violent
policing increased (of POC and of queer people like myself), then the frequency decreased again, and
now I drive downtown every day, sometimes multiple times a day, because I can’t afford to burn time
or money trying and won’t risk state sponsored harassment to support a public services that has done
everything it can to convince the public not to use it. I’m hoping the Lynx BRT will help with reliability
but if it costs $6-$19 (not sure which fare level it will be for that distance) for me to take it to my
favorite brewery in Aurora, I’ll just keep taking a car.
In the last years Arapahoe Ridge HS have been supporting our student with RTD bus passes in order
for our students to come to school and to go to work. RTD can support our students and facilitate
them with their most important need which happens to be transportation. Lack of transportation is
the biggest reason for missing attendance, by helping the students with RTD tickets, we can reduce
this problem by 90%. Most of our students come from families that are going through financial
hardship that cannot afford transportation. By helping them with this, they can now go to school and
start their path to success.
My school has been working under a grant for the past two years to provide bussing for students to
attend ARHS. We also offer credit to students for working in the community. What we have found is
that students do not have transportation to and from work. FREE to STUDENTS is an excellent way to
support the working class of Boulder. 70% of my school is free and reduced lunch. The families
support education but don't have the means to get their students to school. This proposal would be a
DREAM COME TRUE for families of poverty in Boulder County.
After reviewing the recommended fare structure, I am in favor. As an infrequent rider, I was
frequently confused as to which fare I needed to purchase. Combining local and regional makes
sense. I appreciate the lower fee structure. Price to ride was not an issue for me; however, I'm sure
that will be welcome by transit reliant/financially burdened customers. I'm wondering how this will
be subsidized.

1) I really want to ride and support public transportation but the price and time to drive is still much
better. The price is going to have to lower much more than 25 cents to get my family on public more
often. 2) Would it be possible to up the amount of hour for a pass from 3 to 4? That would also get
me on public more often and make it possible to use just one ticket to go to an event for example.
3) Or how about a bigger discount than 10% for 10 pack tickets? 4) I have a gap year program with
numerous young people that use RTD. They all usually take the same bus but they all can't ride their
bikes b/c only two bikes fit on the rack and can't be brought on bus. This really limits us!
We deem that this initiative would be undoubtedly equitable for students in our district, specifically
those undergoing housing challenges, who are qualified to receive McKinney Vento Services. This
school year we've had our highest number ever of unhoused families at BVSD.

I’m writing to share my excitement about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and pass structure.
I’m particularly happy that RTD is simplifying the structure and creating significant cost savings for the
most frequent users of the system through the changes to the monthly pass. I believe the lower
monthly pass price will also induce more ridership, as they cost/value tradeoff significantly improves
for the monthly passes. I urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as soon as possible, and
keep pushing for state funding to help improve reliability and frequency of our service. Thank you,
Jonathan
Free fares for those under 19 is a great step toward improving attendance for public school students.
Transportation cost should not be a barrier for accessing a free, appropriate, public education.
I live on a light rail stop and never use it because it is too expensive. I used it once this year and the
train I planned to take home was cancelled, so I had to call a ride share car. I also used to work near
another lightrail stop on the other end of the city three days a week. It still was too expensive and
didn't make sense to use. The stop I live on is also in a different zone and so, last I checked, it is more
expensive to use the one here than to drive a short distance to another one that is just as far south. I
use it less than once a year.
I love that 19 and younger are free. I think the fare structure should be $3, $6, and $90.
Way to go RTD on the proposal to make fares reasonably priced for all, create a program for all youth
under 19 to hop on transit, and making the LIVE monthly program more affordable and less
cumbersome. As a city planner and lover/supporter of transit, my main question is how RTD will
sustain funding for the fare cost reductions...with the assumption that more people will ride?
This is an excellent idea to create a more accessible, inclusive public transit system in Denver,
specifically for those who require it for daily commuting. Personally, this would encourage me to use
it more and also make it more feasible to get to the airport.
I agree with the proposed changes. This would simplify my life and make the community more
accessible to all parties.
I was very happy to see RTD proposing a reduction in fare prices. When I moved to the metro area, I
was eager to make more use of public transit for convenience, savings, and the environment. But I
was shocked to see the high prices of both rail *and* bus services. How is RTD meant to encourage
public transit use and the reduction of smog and congestion when it is *cheaper* to drive, even with
the summer’s high gas prices? My 20 mile round-trip commute costs around $3-3.50 in gas; even with
the added cost of insurance and car maintenance, it seems to barely match the $6 round-trip bus
fare, which is significantly less convenient. I have lived in metro areas where bus transit is significantly
cheaper than RTD or even free. I am glad for RTD’s lower fares, and hope they will be further lowered.
I also would like to see greater transparency in why the fares are so high compared to other metro
areas—or if in fact this is not the case.

I'm so glad to hear that the access for Youth will improve. Too many times growing up in Houston I
was unable to participate in educational, volunteer or work opportunities. Our youth, especially our
economically disadvantaged youth, deserve access and I'm so proud to live in a state, and city that
cares.
$3.00 is expensive compared to other cities across the US. I suggest if we keep the $3.00, make that a
full day pass so riders can complete a number of errands rather than just have the 3 hour window.
I support new reduced rates (which are still higher than pre-COVID fares). Transit in the metro area is
expensive.
I agree to lower the RTD fare for all people in this community.
Look forward to lower fares
Make fares cheaper and more affordable for all! And a place to call security or cops from unruly
people in the bus
RTD should be free. The current price is ridiculous and unfair for the people that rely on it for daily
transportation. The city should spend less resources for car infrastructure and put more into public
transportation and infrastructure.
I really like the proposed changes! I especially like the Zero Fare for Youth program and the lower
monthly pass cost.
I am very pleased with RTD's new fare structure, especially the lower fares for monthly passes,
simplified discount categories, and free fares for younger people. I would like to see RTD work
actively to secure funds from the state.
I appreciate the simplified fare structure and lower fares. Nice job! I hope your efforts will get a few
more people out of their cars.
$1.00 should be the fare for all rides.
I think the Airport fee should be lower so that a family can take the train for cheaper than paying to
park at the airport.
I fully support the new changes in recommended fare structure and how it would greatly benefit
lower income, disabled, marginalized, and unhoused populations that lack access to transportation.
This would particularly allow the people we serve in our organization easier access to resources such
as appointments, food banks, work, etc. that are so crucial to supporting them in the community.
Most times I ride the AB bus to and from DIA there are no enough seats for all the passengers. People
stand for 40 minutes while on a bus going over 60 mph on a highway. This is so unsafe. Why does rtd
not run enough busses on this route? Why are you endangering your riders because you don’t want
to add busses?
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. Seeing affordable, robust transit that is offered in other cities gives me hope that the
Denver area can develop a solid model. I urge you to adopt these changes, implement them as
soon as possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare and pass structure
toward affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for all. Thank you. -Bret

Not enough money to pay daily
At 40th and Colorado station, put gate in between ends on eastbound side.
Nice buses - keep up improving
Too high fare
RTD is really doing an excellent commute all level and nationality of population. Kudos. The train to
the airport DIA, great job! Keep it going!
I like the new fare structure. Lower prices should help get more riders, and it is definitely a good idea
to lower the cost of the monthly pass.
I'm thrilled to see the $88 monthly pass fee for the Regional routes and the streamlining of the pricing
structure. I ride RTD frequently and even I'm confused about how the current fare structure works. I
never know when I get on the buses headed out of Denver if I'm going to be paying $3 or $5.25.
Since "troublemakers" and the homeless are now allowed to ride free (drivers tell me they're not
supposed to confront anyone or refuse them a seat), upstanding citizens should have the fare waived
as well.
The one thing I see missing is an annual fare . Businesses can pay as little as $350/yr for a commuter
pass, but individuals it’s closer to $3k. It will be better if you buy 12 monthly passes at $88/mo, but
what about just having an annual pass with a discount? It would save in monthly administrative costs
and benefit riders whose companies don’t purchase passes.
Free fare. You have tried everything else and it doesn't work Take a look at Luxembourg with their
free fares. Their public transportation is packed. And I would suggest a gasoline tax to pay for it. /PC

Hello there! I wanted to express my feelings about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and pass

urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these changes. I’d love to know if RTD studied
moving the 3-hour fare to $2 and if not, encourage you to do so. It’s an exact change and could drive
ridership up. The lower the barrier to riding for cash customers, the better. Having 10 people paying
$2.75, is one thing. Getting 30-35 at $2.00 would be a major win money-wise. Busses are running
regardless, why not make sure they’re always more than half full? Not to mention, the lack of giving
change, really means the fare is $3 for cash customers. I urge you to adopt these changes,
implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare
and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for all.
Thank you
Greetings RTD Team ~ I’m writing to share my comments about the proposed changes to the RTD
fare and pass structure. I’m VERY grateful RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all
riders (especially those that depend on RTD as their primary form of transportation). I really like
seeing the free fares for youth pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one.
I would; however, love to see the 3-hour passes be $2 even (instead of $2.75). I have taken numerous
transit/bus routes where the fee was only $2. This makes everything easier, smoother, and less
stressful - on drivers, on riders, on those who one any number of edges financially - running late - in
challenging weather. I am grateful for the work around providing grants/discounts for community
serving organizations. I would recommend that this is as easy as possible for said
organizations/leaders. I would also recommend that there are perks/incentives for these leaders to
educate, connect, and promote transit ridership. In addition to making permanent free fares for
youth, I would love to see more advocacy from RTD - publicly and politically - around safe and
accessible ACCESS to bus stops/stations. I would also love to see creative fundraising
schemes/programs to invite community to help privately fund (or partially/privately fund) bus stop
shelters - with local artists, ADA codes, and support from RTD and city/county agencies. These
changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. As a full-time pedestrian
and transit user, we need our system to radically CENTER access/dignity for those who depend on
these systems the most, programs/organizing around climate action responsibility and transit, and
community partners/agencies who can help expand funding, increase ridership, and shift
harmful/false stigmas around transit. In gratitude, Jonathon

Lowering the fares will be SUPER helpful in convincing (new) folks to take public transit, as well as
helping those who already struggle to afford it. I don't have a car and have relied on RTD since I
moved to Denver in 2018, and I am thrilled to see these changes and updates. I am a graduate
student at the University of Denver, and I love the student pass I receive through DU's bulk policy with
RTD. As an aside, the #1 change that would improve the overall quality of taking RTD is *frequency*
of buses. I know this is dependent on employing more drivers, but it would DRASTICALLY improve the
ease of taking transit. Thank you!
I make decent money and recently purchased a condo in Denver. I'm doing okay. Public transit here
isn't affordable. For a family of 4 to go to the airport and back is $80. I can park and drive and feel
very safe for LESS! The bus to Boulder, more expensive than driving unless you are a student. You
need to general middle class to use the transit to subsidize all the other people using it but it's not a
deal. It sometime MORE than driving. There is NO motivator to use the public transit besides
traveling to the airport solo. I don't use it any other time because it is not affordable. If it was $3 per
person I would exclusively use it to go to and from the airport. A dollar saved is a dollar made. I'm
over paying a lot for a poor service. Make it a fair affordable price and we will come use it all the time.
Until then, I'll be driving and parking.
We work with arts workers all over the metro area who use buses and light rail as well as those who
wish they could use it but currently can’t. Schedules don’t go as late as they could, service is
unreliable and currently unsafe on multiple routes, and prices, especially to the airport, have been
cost prohibitive given the available routes and timed schedules. A more integrated system that
benefits performing arts workers that work long hours in the night and in multiple areas is paramount
for this group to be regular RTD riders.
we should make all fares minimal to encourage the public to use ALL available forms of public transit.
The only way to get cars off the roads - and provide transportation alternatives is to have a lot of
frequent options. This means smaller vehicles (i.e. 15 passenger vans) and more frequent stops
throughout towns and cities. Large Empty Buses are a waste of taxpayer resources. Side Note when is the commuter rail coming to Boulder? We have waited a decade with no progress. Time for
Eminent Domain - or a major investment - or return our money!
Make sure to have markedly lower fares for low income/elderly/disabled, thank you!
I think the fare structure should be changed. It is almost as expensive as owning a car for the current
daily rider.
I think this is an excellent idea that will get more people to use the bus and increase revenue through
volume.
Public transit should be viewed as part of infrastructure like roads and city parks and should be
heavily subsidized for everyone. Rich people will still drive their Mercedes to work, don’t worry. You
want people to use it and not have to keep expanding highways - then stop spending money on
highways and put it into public transit subsidies. Look at countries where it’s done successfully. Asking
people to show they are poor enough to get a discount and to track all that will require so much work
that it won’t be worth it. Stop trying to make it fair, make it WORK. Make people love it and depend
on it - and then people will be willing to pay more for the convenience.
Follow CTA -Chicago Transit Authority’s pricing model!
I think the fare needs to be cheaper than it is to park downtown. We almost rode today but it would
have cost my husband and me $6 each, totaling $12. On SpotHero, I found parking for $10. We chose
to drive instead since it was cheaper. Also, some of the RTD light rail lots require you to pay to park.
All parking should be free since we’re paying to use the light rail. In sum, it’s often cheaper for the 2
of us to park downtown than it is to use public transportation.

I ride the bus in Seattle as a senior citizen. The reduced fare is $1 each trip including the express bus
to the airport. If you really want ridership among the elderly, the fee of $1 should be effect for us. In
addition, the flex rides should be available late nights and on the weekends as well. It is too
expensive for UBR from the airport. Also, I ride the AT bus to Arapahoe. When my flight is later than
11:17 PM, the bus does not go to Arapahoe station. It is a 5 mile walk, so I sleep at the airport until
the 6:17AM bus. Thanks this forum to discuss fare and improvements.
As a student, this would be super helpful to me and other students who struggle with other
transportation!
Current Price too high. Proposed one looks great Dirty seats. Please replace
This fare structure is such a huge step in the right direction. Much simpler, and more in line with the
cost of transit in other comparable cities. (Public transit should be free, though). I’m hoping there’s a
way to do some kind of pay as you go for a monthly pass, so riders who don’t have the $ upfront for a
pass don’t end up paying more than those of us with more liquidity.
Love it!!!! Finally, it will cost me less to ride the train from Broadway to Lone Tree than to drive to
work!!!! Thank you!!!!! I love the light rail. And the airport fare is still reasonable. Also given the
dangers with speed and what happened on the golden line, I recommend using cameras and speed
monitors so engineers will be watched and not be permitted to travel at excessive speeds. The cost
of Monitoring public safety on transit, a basic obligation of RTD, will more than cover the expense the
city will incur as a result of the recent unfortunate accident, increase public trust, protect riders, and
increase ridership.
I live in North Denver and go to the Tech Center. Here are reasons why I don't: 1) Union Station is full
of bums! Why on earth would I want to pass thru? 2) The light rail is SLOW. I can get by car just as
fast even in heavy rush hour traffic. 3) The fare isn't worth it if I had to do this weekly. You're asking
me to pay $200 a month when it costs the same in gas for a compact car? 4) Very few creature
comforts, food/drink services along line. I would love to use mass transit, but it makes no economic
sense, hard to use and feels unsafe.
free fare for people 19 and under
Make all public transportation free.
I think It would benefit the public, and it would be awesome for the environment
Absolutely love the lower fare idea! RTD is solid for what it does and staff are always friendly!
Make public transit free for all.
I pay 200 a month for transportation to and from work and it gets expensive in the months I don't use
it to it's full capacity
One of the reasons I don't often use the light rail when I can is because of the outrageous prices. It's
handy to jump on a train to Park Meadows but cheaper to drive when traveling with a family of 4. It's
well over $30 bucks round trip for all of us. It is senseless to have such high fairs per person- it's a
deterrent to riding RTD. If your goal is to make money it shouldn't be off the limited people who will
ride. Lower the prices to affordable prices, that makes it cheaper than driving a car, and more people
will take advantage of it, hence RTD will bring in more money. The light rail to the airport is ridiculous.
We want to take it but for a family of 4 it is $80 round trip. No we'll just get a ride to and from. Also
get some security on each lightrail/ bus. They're are people who harass and bully others on the bus.
It isn't safe.
I realize you are in a "catch 22", but you have increased fares and decreased service. If you had
service that ran more often I would be more inclined to take the bus. The senior discount is good for
me, as I am a senior. Riding light rail is confusing because of the fair scale for longer trips, because I
am not sure what zone I'm in when I get on or off.
Please lower the cost!

Totally agree with Free Youth fares!
I'm very onboard with these changes, but would like to see further reduction in the regular fare as
well. RTD is one of the most expensive transit in the country, and it affects ridership. For example, we
went to a Rockies game with family and friends the other day, and we would have loved to take the
bus. But it was the same price for four adults to drive and park downtown as it would have been for
us to take the bus. That seems backwards.
Please make the A Line route to the airport either free or significantly more affordable. Incent people
to use it rather than it being an easier/cheaper option to drive and park at one of the outer lots or
take a taxi or rideshare. It's $40 for two people to take a round trip A Line ride to the airport, that's
likely why it's underutilized.
The most important thing for the success of the system is high numbers of riders which can only be
achieved through frequent service along routes connecting areas of interest. Please do not reduce
fees too much or move to a free fare model which would undermine the ability of the system to
operate with enough service to make it a viable alternative to driving.
I visited Seattle and their senior fare for either light rail or bus is $1, period, no matter how long your
trip.
Public transit should be free.
I agree with under 19 ride free. Provide the next generation with a love for mass/community transit.
I agree with expanding employer sponsored passes. This is the best way to do ridership outreach for
commuters. Give a tax inventive for the businesses. Time based passes were a welcome change.
Enable NFC pass scanning for phones. Create a family pass for getting to the airport. Simple flat rate
for groups traveling to/from the airport. It has to be less expensive than driving plus the cheapest
parking option at the airport.
I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare
Study. The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders and will offer some incredibly
good value journeys on RTD such as Denver to Boulder. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare
cap / pass will offer anybody who uses RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who
work at Denver Airport. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply
discounted monthly fare caps / passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare
recipients and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a
huge benefit to the districts’ high school students.
It would be good to explain more how this fare structure would work for families. I initially was
thinking it would cost $50 to bring a family of 5 to the airport on the A line which isn't competitive
with driving or Lyft/Uber. However, after spending some time reading the policies and programs
section it sounds like children under 5 ride free and other ages receive a substantial discount. This
was news to me. Advertising these price reductions for children would be good as my family and
other families I've talked with in the metro area weren't aware of them and thus didn't consider RTD
as a serious option for getting around. Overall, I think the fare structure is a huge improvement
over the previous one. It greatly simplifies fare calculus and bringing the monthly pass under $100
while including the airport is quite attractive.
I would like the bus fare to be free for all people under 19 because it would help me get to and from
school without worrying if I need money for the bus.
Something that I've never heard discussed is incentivizing loyal RTD customers. Reward those who
take RTD regularly, offer promotional pricing for NEW customers that sign up, give free passes for
out-of-town family & guests. The goal is to get people out of their cars and lowering the cost of a ride
by a quarter doesn't do that. Allow people to earn points to get a free monthly pass. Those savings
could mean a lot to people.

What is the specific pricing structure for EcoPasses and neighborhood EcoPasses? I can’t find the
actual pricing on the fare equity study website.
Make fares free for youths
Having free bus passes monthly for students in Denver public schools as well as for Auraria campus
students would be extremely beneficial and help make transportation as well as education more
equitable.
I'm very much in favor of free fares for people 19 and under. I work at North High School and Skinner
Middle School Especially at North, MANY of our students ride the bus to school each day. We offer
discounted bus passes, but free rides would make a huge difference to our students. I also think that
knowing the bus is always free would encourage young people to use RTD much more often.
Greetings: As a representative of the largest advocacy organization of the blind in Colorado, I want
to say at the outset that the manner in which the recommended fare structure is being presented is
incredibly difficult to read because of the numerous links that a person must activate in order to glean
any useful information. We understand the recommendation would eliminate regional fares over-all,
both for full-fare and discount-fare customers. But saying that fares would be reduced by a certain
amount without indicating the final fare under the new structure makes it harder for the reader to
understand what is happening. Why not just say (for example) that for full-fare customers, the regular
fare would be reduced from $3 to $2.75 and that for discount customers, . the fare would be reduced
from $1.50 to $1.35. If, in fact, you have a single page which lays all of this out, I would be happy to
receive a file which we could share with our blind members, friends, and colleagues. Cordially,
Curtis Chong National Federation of the Blind of Colorado
As a middle school social worker in DPS, I am writing in STRONG support of the Youth fare proposal
for free transit pass for all youth 19 and under. Our high school students have historically been able
to access free bus passes in order to utilize RTD for transport to and from school and activities. We
have many middle school students, especially those with truancy issues, who's parents have
unreliable or no formal transporation of their own who are missing out on their education due to
accessibility due to lack of transportation and/or hardship financial impact on family even with
reduced youth fare. Having this RTD pass available to middle schoolers will provide the benefit of
allowing students to have agency in getting themselves to school without relying on an adult and to
gain skills in RTD ridership for their use in the future as a Denver resident. Please approve this option
as a means to increase equity for all students to be able to get themselves to and from school and
their outside activities that builds protective factors for youth.
I like the new proposed plan and would ride far more often with that fare structure for a monthly
pass.
I support the reduced fare proposal. I pay the monthly full fare every month as I commute from
Westminster to Downtown using the FF1 bus and the proposed reduced fares would have a huge
positive impact on my family’s budget.
I’m very excited for this updated fare structure. For me personally, it never made sense financially to
take public transit to my destinations due to the high cost. Now with these reductions, it’s going to
take me out of my car more often then not in the future. I do have a concern on the standard 3-hour
and daily rates. Because they are not even dollars, I do think it’ll make things difficult to those who
must pay with cash and if drivers don’t carry change, it’ll mean they are spending more to ride. I hope
you can find a reasonable solution to this, either by reducing the price or including some kind of
transit ticket where you can load cash into.
Ok
Due to the fact that Denver Public Schools does not provide school bus transportation for students, it
is critical that the Zero Fare for students under the age of 19. Please also consider route changes to
transport students to school efficiently.

I work at the hospital and my husband at the airport... I think hospital employees and airport
employees should get some type of discount on monthly passes.
STOP shifting the burden of payment to others. To be equitable, everyone (regardless of color, creed,
etc.) should pay the same amount. RTD cannot afford to lower rates, especially when they need to
ENFORCE policy by stopping the non-paying riders. More-&-more I don't feel safe on RTD, and that
will cause more of us to STOP riding. Reduced fares, "equity" programs, and lack of enforcement in
trains will continue to make RTD go down-hill and lose customers.
Are you, or can you, bring back discounted coupon booklets?! I see a problem with feeding in three
dollar bills and expecting to get back 30 cents in change. And the ticket kiosks where I ride from
(Southmoor) has had one out-of-service since before Covid. I would much rather buy a ticket booklet
and not have to deal with either the kiosk or with change.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth
pilot program, and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few
barriers to true accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean
many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove
some of the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need
transit accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize ﬁnding funding for a permanent free fares
for youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I
know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes.
Fares should be less if I only need 1 ride down the road I spend $6 a day for 1 bus 2 ways
I am delighted that you are lowering fares. This is such a positive step to increase ridership. I admit I
was not well-versed in the equity issues involved, but am happy that this is being
addressed/publicized as well.
I support removing the regional fare and making the monthly pass much cheaper! Great work on this!
The airport fare is very expensive. $10+ per ticket is excessive. Especially, if you are only 2 stops
away from the airport. The airport train cost should be based on where you are going verse a flat
rate...like the other lines. Also, the bus from Union Station to Boulder is amazing. Could there be a
future train instead of the bus?
The buses need to be more clean there are some that are dirty
I think that the new lower fare for everyone and the one price local/regional are going to boost usage.
The zero fare for under 19 is going to bring rtd so much more business year round. This'll help create
jobs and make less emissions/smaller carbon footprint and working towards climate justice. I also like
the increased discount for LiVE Income-Based Fare Discount participants.
They should give more discount on the 1 month ticket a lot of people can’t afford to pay so much
money at once
I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare

I hope the lower pass program minimums encourages my employer to participate. The cost of
commuting as we return to the office, particularly parking, feels so high. I would love a free transit
benefit. It would give me a reason to opt for the train.
Have you permanently closed the Downtown Boulder bus station? I live a block away and I've seen no
interior changes in the last 3 months? Please announce and publicize your plans for the bus station!
I am a social worker with Denver Public Schools and I am a huge proponent of the Zero Fare for Youth
Pilot. Anything we can do to reduce barriers for youth to attending school is so vital. I wonder if this
pilot can be tied to existing programs/structures such as the MyDenver Card or school ID cards. Thank
you for work on this and your efforts to engage the community.
So thankful that kids under 19 will be able to get the bus for free. I can see what a hardship even the
reduced fare/monthly pass has on my teen’s friends. Thank you for piloting this.
Age discrimination. That is a point that I would like to see considered. You plan to give one age group
free travel, and still expect everyone else to pay. So, for example, you have two friends board. One is
19, the other is 20. One of them has to pay and but the other gets to ride free. It makes no sense.
How hard is it to expect a youth to pay $0.90 or $1.80. If free for one, than it has to be free for all. A
good segway to the next point: Why have any fares at all if you do not plan to ever enforce it? It is
warning, after warning, after warning. But no actual consequences. "Educate and accommodate"
that's all I ever hear. How many times should someone be "educated" before there is any
ENFORCEMENT? There are laws for a reason. Use those laws to enforce fares. Or simply stop all fares
and go to a FULLY FREE system. It is not practical to have it both ways. It is not fair to not make
everyone or no one pay fares. It is not fair to single out one age group to be free and then expect
others to pay. It is not fair to expect people to pay, but yet not consequence those that do not pay.
Just get it over with and go to a fully free ride system. And then beef up police presence on the buses
and trains because free will attract crime, homeless camping, drug use, etc. The system still has not
recovered from 'free for covid' issues that continue to plague the transit system.
I used to love taking RTD before the pandemic. I am very leary of going back due to the increase in
crime. I hope this will be addressed.
The new fare structure is great and will help the region reach its equity, climate, and safety goals. Can
you provide more transparency online about how this will impact RTD's overall budget? My only
concern is that the loss in revenue will lead to additional service cuts, when what we need most right
now is more frequent service and extended service hours. Thank you.
I’m writing to share my excitement and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and

exact change, will mean many folks who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Round
down the prices to even dollar amounts or have a ride card that people can front load with money.
Debut off at people ride. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove some of the requirements to qualify for

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The current price structure that RTD is using, penalizes individuals that are considering using public
transport. A couple looking to go downtown will spend upwards of 20$ on just transit with RTD. This
does not encourage public transit use.
Please, please deal with various riders who feel entitled to smoke or vape on the train or bus. It is
unfair to the non-smoking riders to observe the security guards also covertly vape on the train
platforms, and then they expect us to obey the rules they supposedly have the power to enforce. It
can be harmful when I need to step away from the smokers who need to puff up in billows of germy
smoke just before boarding.
I like and appreciate the lower pricing that is proposed for RTD Service. The price has been going up
and the quality has been going down of RTD Services: timeliness, cleanliness, safety, reliability etc.
Also, it didn’t make sense that it cost the same amount to go to Boulder as it does to go to the airport
from Denver. The price of $10.50 round trip for a trip that is more than 3 hours was not the most
logical, especially since 1 hour of that time is spent on the bus so the transfer would only be good for
2 hours. Also, I haven’t liked the zoning since I started using RTD over 10 years ago. It is difficult for
new riders to understand and makes traveling within the Boulder/Denver/Aurora metro area more
expensive and deters people from going outside of their zone.
The new fare structure makes the monthly fare something I would actually purchase. As a 4-5 day a
week user, the current local monthly fare doesn’t make any sense for me to use because if I go on a
trip, work from home an extra day, or need to drive to work for whatever reason, I end up spending
more than I would on local fare 10-packs. At an $88 flat rate for full use of the system, I’d buy that
every month. It also incentivizes me as a regular rider to take the train to the airport. As someone
who does not necessarily live close to the A-line, the cost of taking the A line+a cab to the station vs
driving to the airport is a wash. The next thing I hope to see is increased frequency of A line trains
and have increased frequency later into the night (or atleast on busy nights like sundays). As it
stands, transferring from light rail to the A-line adds 15 minutes to the already long trip to the airport
I think the change in the fare prices is a really good idea especially for those of us who use the bus on
a regular basis. The only thing that would be amazing is if Live offered a monthly pass. I think giving
youth a free monthly pass is a fabulous idea.
They should not let anyone come in the bus like homeless
RTD buses and light rail are already free for anyone who chooses not to pay.
They should lower the mond pass it it to much money to pay at once
They should lower the month pass so many people cant aford to buy The pass because it is to much
money
They should lower the price and have equil prices for al type of trasportacion
All older people should not have to pay to ride a bus
I take the A line daily to the airport for work and I think the monthly fare of $88.00 will help al lot of
us passengers especially people who need to take public transit to get to work daily.
For taking time to read the police’s and putting them in place
I think the new fare will benefit everyone across the community. I fully rely on RTD and I've been
utilizing RTD for 38 years since I was 15. I don't know how the discount programs work though so it
would be hard for me to help others apply in my community.
Move the airport fare to $11.50 but create a Colorado residents discount that lowers the fare to $5.00
for residents by entering their zip code and their drivers license/state ID number at the time of
purchase. The rider could make this part of their RTD app profile so that they don’t need to reenter it
over and over again. This system would have tourists subsidize the system while avoiding excessive
fares for residents who need to ride more frequently.

I hope the fares can be reduced or removed entirely for the people of Colorado. Having better access
and more realiable public transportation will benefit everyone in the long run.
I fully support the new fare structure. This is very similar to the fare structure that was in place when I
was living in Chicago. It made the system easy to understand and easy to navigate and was a big
reason why I felt happy relying on public transport throughout the entire time I lived in that city.
Upon moving to Denver, I thought the RTD fair structure was confusing and priced too high for what
the system offered. At the time I worked at the airport and ultimately I had to resort to driving,
because it made more economical sense.
This is a step in the right direction for the RTD and access to regional transit will benefit from this. I
personally do not currently use this service because of the cost, I commute to Boulder and the price
for bus fare is about the same as driving without the convenience. If this new structure is
implemented, there is more of a benefit to me personally in using public transit (along with less
impact on the environment, traffic, etc.). I imagine I'm not alone in my reasoning and that ridership
will increase, justifying more investment in the system from the state. This is a good thing for
everyone!
Until you make good on the NW Rail, I consider you as nothing more than a group of thieves.
I think it's a good idea to have both the local and regional fares combined into one price. It's time
consuming having to check the schedules just to see which buses are local and regional. I remember
sometime last year, I emailed a RTD representative about what pass I have to buy to get to work. I
was told local, but it turns out that I needed the regional pass. The two different prices for local and
regional is so confusing that even customer service cannot figure it out. Please combine it into one
price.
Cut the cost of fares and you will see more people use the trains. = more $
Please pass this and the current structure is confusing and pricey for those of that don't drive
I applaud RTD for the changes in fare collection. The new fare structure will make transit easier to
use and more accessible to folks on limited income. The new monthly pass program will likely
increase ridership. But RTD needs to do even more to increase ridership. Raising funds from the
state to improve service by increasing frequency and reliability along major transit routes would
probably increase ridership even more.
I’m writing to share my excitement and questions about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and
pass structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but
especially frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also excited to see the free fares for youth

know these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. I use RTD as much as possible, but find that my bike is a more reliable way to get around.
I'd love to see increased frequency, more consolidated lines focused on Denver and less on the
suburbs, and better north/south routes. I'd also love to see free fares for all kids (under 18) and more
emphasis on supporting bus routes that get middle and high school aged kids to school and back
without having to rely on cars. I urge you to adopt these fare changes, implement them as soon as
possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve the fare and pass structure toward
affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for all. Thank you. -- amy campbell

Airport employees currently are nearly punished for commuting on the RTD with the monthly pass
being $200 (no benefit for a regular commute of less than 20 days/month). If you bring this down,
you’ll be bringing more employees to the airport and therefore more sustainable growth for Denver!
love the changes in general. it's easier and cheaper. however, the airport is still too expensive. I think
it's ok to charge a premium for the airport but only if the service is top notch. to qualify for such a
premium, I think frequency would have to increase as well as reliability. I don't think the current
service qualifies for $10
I would like to express my support for the proposed fare structure recommended by the Fare Study.
The new fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders (I moved here last year and it took
some time to understand it). I believe the proposed $88 monthly pass will offer anybody who uses
RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who work at Denver Airport. I am also in
support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps /
passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare recipients and riders with
disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a huge benefit to the districts’
high school students and will instill the transit goals our nation wants in our young folks.
Hi, just wanted to say that I'm a fan of the reduced monthly fare. I've previously considered getting a
monthly pass because it would encourage me to take the train more. The previous monthly price
simply did not make sense unless I was commuting daily. The more people that have a monthly pass
the better, it's much easier to decide to ride transit if it's already paid for
This policy does sound more equitable.
I support the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare Study. The new fare
structure is much simpler to understand and is more equitable for people who rely on transit for
many trips a month. The lower fares and simplified pricing structure may increase ridership while
being cost-effective for frequent riders. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and
providing steeply discounted monthly fare caps/passes and airport fares for low-income riders,
seniors, Medicare recipients, and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares.
Hello, thank you for reducing the airport fare and suggesting the Zero Fare For Youth pilot. I think this
is huge because the current pricing is still an unattractive option for many families. Take for example a
family of 2 adults and 2 children taking a 5 day trip. The round trip A-line cost is $80 and parking at
the airport will be approximately $86 (in the Economy lot which is a 5 minute walk). With the Zero
Fare For Youth program, that same A-line roundtrip comes down to $40, a much more attractive
option!
As a refugee resettlement caseworker, I support the simpler fare structure of local/airport instead of
local/regional/airport. The lower cost of a monthly pass is also a great idea. We support our new
refugee and immigrant neighbors with bus passes as they search for and begin employment in metro
Denver. We often purchase passes or ticket books in bulk so I highly support the recommendation
"to support nonprofits, employers and social service organizations through bulk purchase discounts,
Pass program expansions and a transit assistance grant program." Our nonprofit's budgets are very
tight and any way to help our newcomers make it around the city safely are welcome. We are in high
need of volunteers & workers who could provide transit training to our newcomers, so a grant
program to help pay for that would be something we could apply for. Thank you.
Thank you for proposing more affordable fares!!
I support efforts to reduce fares to make transit access more equitable and increase ridership.
I've been away for the last two years but I miss riding the trains. I'd like to think with the new fare
structures and an e-bike, people would give up driving as much do the monthly pass. April 2019 - Oct
2019 was a great period in my life when I took my e-bike on the G and A line getting off at Central
Park and riding the rest. My emotional state was so much better when I rode.

I am very supportive of the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare Study. The new
fare structure is much simpler to understand for riders and will offer some incredibly good value
particularly for families traveling with children. In addition, the proposed $88 monthly fare cap / pass
will offer anybody who uses RTD multiple times a week a great deal, including those who work at
Denver Airport. I am also in support of raising the LiVE discount to 50% and providing steeply
discounted monthly fare caps / passes and airport fares for low income riders, seniors, Medicare
recipients and riders with disabilities. Lastly, I support the trial of free youth fares, which will be a
huge benefit to the districts’ high school students. Having kids and teens riding will help build long
term ridership as they become more familiar with public transit.
I am writing to express my support for the proposed fare structure as recommended by the RTD Fare

I am absolutely thrilled to see this simplified fare structure. One of the biggest mental barriers when
taking light rail especially is trying to figure out local vs regional zones, especially when the difference
between them wasn't always clear. Every simplification of the fare structure makes it easier and
easier to get where I'm going without having to do mental gymnastics trying to figure out which ticket
is needed, and therefore makes it easier to just ride and get where I'm going. I'm glad to see RTD
moving further in this direction. I am most excited about the single price monthly pass. Due to the
zone issues and the high cost of the current fare structure, a monthly pass has not been feasable for
me or most people I know. Reducing the cost and providing a single pass for all areas makes it much
more likely that I'll maintain a monthly pass out of convenience if nothing else.
I’m writing to share both my excitement about the proposed changes to RTD fares, as well as some
recommendations for how to continue to make RTD more accessible and equitable. First and
foremost, it's an incredible boon to riders to simplify the fare system. Thank you for doing that! Just
as exciting are the free fares for youth pilot program and consolidation of the discount programs into
one. I am concerned, though, about how the 3-hour passes will end up costing certain folks who
pay in cash to pay more, because RTD doesn't issue change. I’d like to advocate for requirements to
be relaxed so that more individuals could qualify for discounted passes. Last, I want RTD to prioritize
finding funding for a permanent free fares for youth program. Obviously, these aren't changes that
could be made without additional funding. Could RTD pursue partnerships with the state to make
these changes happen?
Price is ridiculously high and not cost effective! Especially when it’s not reliable.
When I first moved to Denver, I honestly avoided RTD because I didn’t understand the system,
specifically “local vs. regional” destinations. I had lived in DC and London and traveled in New York
and Boston on the public transportation, but those systems seemed much more intuitive to me. The
first time I used RTD was to take the A line to the Airport because I knew I couldn’t mess up the
“Airport fare.” I appreciate the combination of Local and Regional to make the system easier to
understand. And I know you’ll get complaints about the Airport fare being higher, but let’s be real for most people it is more cost effective than the alternatives of parking or Ubering, and if you can get
to the airport for less than $10 some other way, good for you and travel that way. The fact that you
don’t have a higher airport charge for discount customers and that youth are free relieves any angst I
might have about having a higher airport fee. If kids, low income families, seniors and folks with
disabilities can get to the airport cheaply, the business and casual travelers can pay $10. It looks like

RTD is listening to what its customers are asking for and I appreciate that. Hopefully this process will
show support for free fares for youth so school districts or state or local government will fund the
program.

The consolidation of local and regional fares is great. I would suggest keeping whole dollar amounts
as the fares to better facilitate cash transactions. $3 for 3 hr and $5 for day seems like a better pricing
structure in my opinion. $6 is harder to do with cash if you don't have exact change since it's a huge
loss to feed in a 10.
We should absolutely be providing free public transit for youth. Also, if public transportation in
Denver was better structured (as in does not take significantly longer then other modes of
transportation or is more direct) then more people would use it. I talk to people all the time who
want to ride buses and trains but it is simply not reasonable for their needs.
Getting rid of the regional fare is one of the smartest things RTD can do. The lower monthly rate is
fantastic, and I think youth riders should ride free always. As a daily rider, I'm excited about these
changes.
Under 19 free will get young people in habit of jumping on a bus something Denver needs
desperately.
I like that local and regional are the same fare. however, the new suggested fares are still higher than
other major cities. Chicago charges $2.25 for bus fare and $5 for airport. Houston charges $1.25 for
bus fare. Austin, which has a comparable cost of living charges $1.25 for single rides, $2.50 for day
passes. We can do better for people who rely on buses for transportation!
Without a car, I rely heavily on RTD to get to and from work. A reduced fare structure would help with
my household budgeting and make public transport a way more feasible option for some of my
coworkers stuck in traffic or who have to rely on rideshares!
There used to be so many airport employees who rode with RTD and have since stopped to the the
outrageous monthly pass cost. The new fare structure should increase ridership in the future . Thank
you
I think the proposed fare structure looks great, especially the lower monthly pass price. I work with so
many at the airport who won’t buy a monthly pass since they think $200 is too much. I think the
proposed new fare structure will increase ridership. Thanks!
sounds like an easier option. I'm in favour. Just wish to have it feel safe to ride RTD again, including
light rail. It's been awhile, and the news continues to paint a disturbing picture. Even the choice of
Chestnut Pavillion for a next community meeting is kind of scary, based on my experiences at that
location. Thanks.
it is simply criminal to charge 5.25 to get from longmont to boulder. To get to and from work i pay
that twice a day and it amounts to over 30% of my bi weekly paycheck. i may as well lyft or do really
anything but use rtd. this is public transportation make it accessible to the public.
Wonderful changes being proposed. They could be even better: Find a fare for Discount passengers
that doesn’t require having change. Make free youth fare permanent. Find a way to allow
homeless people without address to qualify for discount fare. Thank you for your good work!

I’m writing to share my support and concerns about the proposed changes to the RTD fare and pass
structure. I’m happy RTD is simplifying the structure and reducing the cost for all riders but especially
frequent riders through the monthly pass. I’m also glas to see the free fares for youth pilot program,
and consolidation of the discount programs into one. I’m concerned about a few barriers to true
accessibility and affordability. The 3-hour passes, by requiring exact change, will mean many folks
who pay with cash on the bus will end up paying more. Additionally, I’d like RTD to remove some of
the requirements to qualify for discounted passes that prevent access for folks who need transit
accessibility the most. I’d also like RTD to prioritize finding funding for a permanent free fares for
youth program. These changes would make our transit system truly accessible and affordable. I know
these require increased funding, and I urge RTD to pursue partnerships with the state for these
changes. However, while these changes are good, the most important thing RTD could do to better
serve the community and increase ridership is BETTER SERVICE—more frequent and expansion into
newer developments that currently have limited or car required service. I’ve been riding RTD and its
predecessors since the 1950s and service never gets better. Thank you.
How are you going to be able to keep enough coins in the ticket kiosks to return 30 cents for every 3
dollar bills inserted for my discount fare? Are you going to return to having discount ticket books
available for purchase? (One of the two kiosks at Southmoor has been down since before the
pandemic!)
I'm actually just curious who is taking in these comments. Is it GBSM? Just curious. Thanks!
This makes a good deal more sense, as monthly passes will probably be used by actual city residents,
not just tourists.
Would love to see these fares lowered for more equity! This makes the monthly pass much more
appealing
Thank you for proposing to lower the fee for the train to the airport. It was always odd to me how the
current fee is so much higher than other major cities in which I've lived. The blue line from downtown
Chicago to OHare is $5. The MARTA in Atlanta is $2.50 flat rate anywhere. Ridership will increase with
lower fees. Thank you for recognizing this!

fullest. This is not a comment on the hardworking employees who get the trains and buses moving,
rather this is a comment on the accessibility and privilege it takes to use RTD at all. This past Sunday
4/16, for example, I had to take the trains to get down to Arapahoe in DTC by 11:30 am. According to
my Maps and Transit map, the easiest route was taking the H to the E train. However, when arrived to
the 18th/Stout stop for the H train, it had been cancelled for reasons of which I do not know. So then I
had to wait an additional 20 minutes for the next H train. When that H train came, I took it, no
problem, and transferred to the E train. As I was taking the E train, everyone was removed from the
train at Southmoor and we had to wait another 15 minutes for the next E train. So I was over 30
minutes late to my destination. Had I been an employee relying on this, the schedule would have

been completely wrecked and I likely would've been in trouble. It is exactly this kind of unreliability
that makes RTD inaccessible that harms the people who rely on it. I urge you to adopt these
changes, implement them as soon as possible, and keep pushing for state funding to further improve
the fare and pass structure toward affordability and equity to make our transit system accessible for
all. Thank you. Rachel Fischer

I really do not agree with lowering regional and airport fares. It goes against your own equity analysis
and just reduces revenue. Local fares are too high, but the bulk of the savings goes to regional and
airport fares. Reducing those fares is not going to move the needle on ridership as much as better
and more frequent transit within Denver. The A line will always have trouble competing with
personal transport. Ditto with regional rail, especially lines with less frequency than the A, like all of
them. Focus more on Denver and less on your regional partners. There is much more to gain in terms
of equity, ridership, climate and air quality. The price is too high for local transit, yes, but the real
problems are frequency of service and travel times and safety concerns.
Make RTD free forever. Drivers seemed much happier and it's 85% paid for by taxes anyway
I think that restructing fairs for everyone in the RTD area will be a great thing. I have friends that do
not have much money to get RTD to different places and doing this, I think would be good for them.
Also families with children, this too will assist them with getting to baseball games, schools and family
outings. Thanks in advance!
$88 is more reasonable for a monthly pass, although still overpriced (as an example, Chicago offers a
monthly pass for $75 and Omaha, a city with a similar size to Denver, offers one for $55). I would love
to ride the bus everyday bot it is cheaper for me to drive my car. The monthly rate needs to be set at
a rate that makes it a reasonable choice.
This is SO MUCH BETTTER than the current structure it's not even funny. Please, please, *please*
ensure that this goes into place. The simplification of the fare structure will provide huge benefits in
terms of day-to-day usability, and making passes only $88/month is a huge benefit to increasing
ridership.

As for the fare structure, I think that the proposed structure is more equitable...but I must add that I
was in Miami earlier this year, and their transit system doesn't require a special card...all of the buses
and trains have an option to just tap your credit or debit card to pay the fare. As for "programs" I am
very disappointed that the Boulder bus station has remained closed for many months...through the
windows there has been NO change in what the interior looks like. Have you abandoned this station,
which at one time had more riders than Union Station?

It would be wonderful if the rate for non-profit organizations and bulk purchases were lowered. All
our students are blind and in an independence program and buy monthly passes--we are
strengthening their travel skills and they will continue to ride public transportation because of this
training.
No cost fare for students would be very helpful for our students here at Lotus that utilize Public
transit. We are a charter and do not have busing so many of our students take RTD.
I think the suggested fare changes are great. They are much easier to understand and a lot more
realistic for people to afford. Lower cost will encourage more people to use public transportation.
However, you have to do something about the smelly homeless people taking up several seats on the
lightrail. I would use it more, but I know I will have to encounter smelly homeless people and have to
suffer through that the entire ride. I also wonder what they have done to my seat before I arrived. It is
very discouraging because I want to use public transportation more.
Wow, something that makes sense from RTD. Nice work and historical occasion - first time I can recall
RTD not making a bone-headed decision. Now on to Boulder/Longmont light rail please....
After reading about the recommended fare structure, thanks, I like it, but please accept this
comment: I avoid using RTD because of safety issues. Recently while riding I witness an assault
(during the day) at a train station. Very distressing, an event that lingered in my thoughts for days.
Regardless of what RTD might do with rates, without acceptable behavioral norms I will continue to
avoid using RTD, both trains and buses
I think the new structure would not be a bad idea but I also think the idea of prolonging the discount
card would also not be able to battle the. Ninety instead of five years why not 7or 10 yrs?

Why is this not implemented yet? It is clear from a year of community feedback that it is wanted and
needed. It is a good first step to true Equity which would be eliminating fares altogether. The fare free
August 2022 clearly showed the impact specific to the RTD service area of increased ridership with
zero fares.
This new fare structure is much easier to understand and allows for tourists to see the city more
easily.
How will this effect the live program
I applaud RTD for putting a new fare structure on the table. The new fares actually make me want to
use transit more now to get to/from work, as it would be better for me financially. I hope the new
fares are approved!
I'm literally just voicing my support. This plan is amazing, absolutely no complaints.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

March 8, 2023

March 28, 2023
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2023 service
changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 30 service changes proposed for May 2023 provide opportunities for bus and rail operators to vote
new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations plan for
the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan
(SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP implementation to provide
the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on-transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI): benefits and services are
provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income
and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The May 2023 service change
proposal includes two major service changes out of 30 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required to be

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes
will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10%
more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 24 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming May 2023 runboard. Of
these 30 changes, two services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater than that
of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes are
shown in bold in the following table.
Modified Services (20 services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans,
increase reliability)
Seasonal Adjustments (10 services)

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes
based on race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:
• Of the almost 88,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes,
low-income populations represented a higher share of population than service area averages. Of
this cumulative figure, nearly 50,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.

•

The two bus routes with major service changes serve above-average low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the service area overall, low-income equity populations received a
greater increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to higher income
populations. Low-income areas had a +1.67% benefit above higher income areas. Minority
populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less) compared
to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.

Conclusions:
Although one of the major service changes resulted in a potential disparate impact at the route level,
Title VI concerns are minimal at the network level when comparing the service changes between the
January 2023 and May 2023 runboards. In aggregate, a review of all routes/lines found no adverse
impacts between equity and non-equity routes/lines. Overall, the system-wide service increases have
positively impacted equity populations slightly more compared to non-equity populations. Therefore, no
system-level disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed major service
changes in the May 2023 service change proposal.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success while maintaining compliance
with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the equity implications for all subsequent
service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future
service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

This document summarizes the analysis of service changes between the January 2023 and May 2023 runboards
to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes
RTD proposes changes to 24 bus route/patterns and six rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming May 2023 runboard. Of
these 30 changes, two services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes listed below
have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services being
eliminated.

Service Adjustments (one service)

Route 10 – East 12th Street: extend service to Colfax and
Billings via 11th and Peoria and terminate westbound trips at
Union Station

Service Reinstatement (one service)

FF2 – Boulder Express: Reinstate service on the FF2
(Boulder Express) with three trips in each direction

Findings

Alterations to the proposed May 2023 service changes include extending the alignment of Route 10 and
reinstatement of the FF2 Boulder Express pattern of the Flatiron Flyer. Of these routes, both serve high
concentrations of low-income populations and Route 10 serves high concentrations of both minority and lowincome populations.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes with major service changes and as a
proportion to the District overall, low-income equity populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were
more positively impacted) compared to higher income populations. Low-income areas had a +1.67% benefit
above higher income areas. Minority populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively
impacted less) compared to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate
Impact threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.
Finally, though there were no cumulative adverse impacts at the network level, a potential disparate impact was
identified at the individual route-level: of the two routes/lines that had major service changes, FF2 had potential
disparate impact finding but no disproportionate burden finding.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
January 2023 and May 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy
An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Colorado Revised Statutes 32-9-119.7 Farebox Recovery Ratios – Plans

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles

a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2017 to 2021 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the May 2023 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.
Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of census blockbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted February 21-22, 2022. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 68 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,
number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the three major service
changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis
Proposed service changes for the May 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service were
categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or higher income) for comparison.
Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior network
using 2017-2021 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

Changes by Transit Mode
As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, 21 bus routes will undergo service changes.
Of these, four routes will see an increase of bus service by over 49 total weekday revenue service hours.
Changes to Route 10 exceeded the major service change threshold and FF2 is a reinstatement of previously
suspended service; both account for almost 41 of the additional daily revenue service hours. Rail services will
have service level adjustments to increase service to midnight.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
No major reductions/eliminations.

Major Service Change Increases
Two bus routes had major service changes which include service increases of 25% or greater. This includes one
modification to alignment on Route 10 and a reinstatement of a route pattern on the Flatiron Flyer. While below
the percentage threshold, the reinstatement of service to pattern FF2 is considered a major service change and
is therefore included in the review.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual route follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Proposal: Extend route into Aurora to Colfax Ave and Billings Street via 9th and 11th Avenues and Peoria
Street. Headways between 9th Avenue and Clermont Street would be 60 minutes. All westbound trips
would terminate at Denver Union Station.
As shown in Table 4, a higher percentage of the District’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed Major Service Increase as compared to non-minority population (2.41% vs. 2.11%,
respectively). This difference does not exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold (1.90%). Therefore,
a route-level disparate impact is not found. Moreover, a higher percentage of the District’s low-income
population stands to benefit from the proposed Major Service Increase as compared to higher population
(3.30% vs. 2.06%, respectively). This difference does not exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold
(1.85%). Therefore, a route-level Disproportionate Burden is not found.

As shown in Table 5, a lower percentage of the District’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed Major Service Increase as compared to non-minority population (0.81% vs. 0.40%,
respectively). This difference does exceed the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.73%). Therefore, a
potential route-level disparate impact is not found requiring further examination (i.e., access to key public
service destinations, community engagement and network level analysis). However, a higher percentage
of the District’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed Major Service Increase as
compared to higher population (0.93% vs. 0.51%, respectively). This difference does not exceed the
10% disparate impact threshold (0.46%). Thus, there is no Disproportionate Burden at the line-level.

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program update, a network analysis is required in addition to route- and
line-level analysis. A network level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for Title
VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

10

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 49 weekday revenue hours.
Of the almost 88,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher share of population than District averages. Of this cumulative
figure, nearly 50,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023
At the network level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The two bus routes with major service changes serve above-average low-income
populations.

In review of Routes 10 and FF2 at the network level, there are no potential disparate impact or
disproportionate burden findings.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the January 2023 to May 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.3%) and
minority population (36.9%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2017-2021
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 36.9% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.049
million) the low-income population percentage of 14.3% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.005 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine3.
The thresholds summarized in Error! Reference source not found.6 yielded 831 (38% of all) block groups
above the district average for low-income population, and 830 (38%) block groups above the district average
for minority population.

1

Based on existence of the route within the January 2023 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2017-2021 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population and
results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter
mile of bus stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District.
This comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. No major changes were proposed for rail
services with the May 2023 runboard.

For system-level bus service changes, non-minority populations stand to benefit slightly more than
minority populations, (2.93% vs. 2.82%, respectively). However, the difference does not meet the Disparate
Impact Threshold of 2.63%. Therefore, no system-level disparate impact findings are found with the proposed
major service changes. Low-income populations stand to benefit more than higher income
populations (4.24% vs. 2.57% respectively), with low-income areas benefitting 1.67% more than higher
income areas. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service
changes.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the District,
as well as highlight the two bus routes with major service changes (orange). The Route 10 benefits low-income
and minority populations, serving the 9th and 11th Avenue and Peoria Street corridors with a longer alignment
and more connections into Aurora. The FF2 pattern of the Flatiron Flyer is currently suspended and is proposed
to be reinstated with three trips in each direction/peak period.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

The network changes that are proposed between January 2023 and May 2023 include modifications to service
that include schedule adjustments, changes to summer schedules and trip availability, additional trips, and longer
spans of service. The major service change increases were entirely invested in bus services. No major service
reductions were included.
Route-level Findings:
•
•
•

Of the 30 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, one had a potential disparate
impact finding.
Route FF2 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving -0.33%
less of a benefit than non-minority populations.
Route 10 had no potential disparate impact and no disproportionate burden findings.

Error! Reference source not found.8 summarizes major service changes by change type, provides findings
of potential disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens based on a comparative difference analysis, and
provides the individual route service change.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed May 2023 service changes4 include adding improvements to Route 10 and FF2,
both of which serve low-income populations at rates higher than the District average. These service changes
signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution of service improvements.

Service Equity Analysis: May 2023

Systemwide-level Findings:

18

•

Of the almost 88,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes with a
major service improvement (Routes 10 and FF2), low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted services to low-income populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus routes with a major service
change and as a proportion to the District overall, low-income populations received a greater
increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to higher income populations.
Low-income areas benefited +1.67% more compared to higher-income areas. Additionally, minority
populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less)
compared to non-minority populations. However, this difference did not meet the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore no system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed changes.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital) and recovery uncertainty serves as
justification for maintaining the May 2023 service changes proposal.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
January 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

October 12, 2022

October 25, 2022
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for January 2023 service
changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community Value.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Interim Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service changes proposed for January 2023 provides opportunities for bus and rail operators to
vote new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall operations
plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System Optimization
Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP implementation to
provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers

Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The January 2023 service
change proposal includes four major service changes out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is

Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 18 bus routes and eight rail lines in the forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, four services have proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service and thus meet established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the following table.

Modified Services (23 services)

race/ethnicity or income.

•

The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

•

For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted
by the elimination of service to the C and F lines; however, the burden on low-income populations
relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold

•

Although staff is proposing that the C and F lines be permanently discontinued, all stations
currently served by the C and F lines will continue to be served by rail service at 15-minute peak
headways. More specifically:

•

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be served by
the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E line required to
continue to Denver Union Station

o

The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served by
the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to
continue to 18th•Stout Station

o

These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of
these light rail lines

When considering the demographics within the service areas of lines/routes with major service
changes and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity
populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared
to non-equity populations; minority areas had a +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and
low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income areas

Conclusions
Although two of the major service changes resulted in a disproportionate burden at the line level, Title VI
concerns are minimal at the network level when comparing the service changes between the August
2022 and January 2023 runboards. In aggregate, a review of all routes/lines found no adverse impacts
between equity and non-equity routes/lines. Overall, the system-wide service increases have positively
impacted equity populations slightly more compared to non-equity populations. Therefore, no systemlevel disparate impact or disproportionate burden is found related to the proposed major service changes
in the January 2023 service change proposal.

Summary of Findings
• Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes
(both bus and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of the service changes between the August 2022 and January 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology
RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 18 bus route/patterns and eight rail lines of RTD’s forthcoming January 2023 runboard.
Of these 26 changes, three services meet established thresholds for a major service change. The routes/lines
listed below have proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services
being eliminated.

Service Adjustments (one service)

Service Eliminations (two services)

Route 30 – South Federal: extend span of service weekdays
and Sundays in bi-directional pattern
C Line: regular service on the C Line is discontinued
F Line: regular service on the F Line is discontinued

Findings
Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Further, though staff is proposing that the C and F Lines
be permanently discontinued, all stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail
service at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue
to be served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue
to Denver Union Station. Moreover, the stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to
be served by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue
to 18th•Stout Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution
of service improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.

When considering the demographics within the service areas of routes/lines with major service changes and as
a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income equity populations received a greater increase
in service (i.e., were more positively impacted) compared to non-equity populations. Minority areas had a
+1.84% benefit above non-minority areas, and low-income areas received a +1.67% compared to higher income
areas. For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are not disproportionately impacted by the
elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on low-income populations relative to higher
income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.
Finally, though there were no cumulative adverse impacts at the network level, potential disparate impacts and
disproportionate burdens were identified at the individual route-level: of the three routes/lines that had major
service changes, two lines had a disproportionate burden finding.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
August 2022 and January 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and
two major service decreases (eliminations) of formerly suspended routes. These changes and all others have
been reviewed individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential
impacts to the communities RTD serves.

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify services that are
underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping
with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics used to
identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series
of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority
populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human
Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023

1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25%addition or reduction in the service
hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject
to
an
equity
analysis
that
includes
an
analysis
of
adverse
effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than higher income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology
Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2014 to 2018 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the January 2023 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service changes
impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in changes
made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional differences were
compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line proportions of equity
populations.

evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:

Low-income status for population within the District is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on 150%
of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based on local
context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the non-white
and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area was based on the collection of block groups
within district boundaries.

1.E.1.b

Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of census blockbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted September 26-27, 2022. The comments collected on service changes
during these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity
Office reached out to 10 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023

A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the routes/lines individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the District. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, nearly 19 bus routes will undergo service
changes. Of these, five routes will see an increase of bus service by 56 daily revenue service hours (56
weekday, 28 Saturday, 37 Sunday). One of the routes, Route 30, exceeded the major service change
threshold and account for 16 of the additional daily revenue service hours. The suspended C and F Lines will be
permanently removed from service.

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases/Restructuring (service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service)

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
Major Service Change Increases

Route- and Line-Level Analysis

Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and/or
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. In summary, the review of these adverse impacts determined the following:
•

Two lines met the threshold for a potential Disproportionate Burden

A complete listing of all potential DI and DB findings can be found in Appendix B.

Network Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program update, a network analysis is required in addition to route- and
line-level analysis. A network level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for Title
VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 56 daily revenue hours
Of the over 63,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes (both bus
and rail), minority and low-income populations represented a higher share of population than district
averages. Of this cumulative figure, 33,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

One bus route had major service changes, which includes service increases of 25% or greater. This includes one
modification to span of service (Route 30).

1.E.1.b

Service Equity Analysis: January 2023
At the route level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major service
changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average minority or low-income
populations

In review of Route 30, there are no adverse impacts. In review of all rail Lines (C Line and F Line),
there were no adverse impacts for minority populations at the network level. However, there is a
potential disproportionate burden for low-income populations when aggregating the proposed
changes to all rail lines.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the August 2022 to January 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas higher income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (16.8%) and
minority population (35.4%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

There are 1,916 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District2. Using the 2018 5Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 35.4% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.019
million) the low-income population percentage of 16.8% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure. This
is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine3. The thresholds
summarized in Error! Reference source not found.4 yielded 751 (39% of all) block groups above the district

Based on existence of the route within the August 2022 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2018 5-Year estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population and
results in a different base population used to determine low-income percent of population.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate to determine overall impacts to underlying
population. Table 4 summarizes the change in service for block group population within one quarter mile of bus
or rail stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to population in the District. This
comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service changes
compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. Table 5 summarizes the change in rail service
using the same methodology.

For bus service, equity populations stand to benefit more than non-equity populations, with minority
populations benefitting 1.84% more than non-minority population and low-income populations benefitting
1.67% more than higher-income populations. For major service changes to rail service, minority populations are
not disproportionately impacted by the elimination of service to the C and F Lines; however, the burden on lowincome populations relative to higher income populations slightly exceeds the threshold.

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the District,
as well as highlight the one bus route and two rail lines with major service changes (orange). The Route 30
benefits equity populations, serving Federal Blvd with longer hours throughout weekdays and Sundays. The C
and F Lines are currently suspended and are proposed to be permanently discontinued. However, all stations
currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail service at 15-minute peak headways.

Summary of Findings
The network changes that are proposed between August 2022 and January 2023 include modifications to service
that include additional trips and longer spans of service. The major service change increases were entirely
invested in bus services. Major service change decreases resulted in the discontinuation of the C and F Lines.
The C Line has been suspended since January 2021, and the F Line has been suspended since September 2020.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed January 2023 service changes4 include adding improvements to Route 30,
which serves high concentrations of equity populations. Although the C and F Lines are proposed to be
permanently discontinued, stations currently served by the C and F Lines will continue to be served by rail service
at 15-minute peak headways. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the C Line will continue to be
served by the D Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the W or E Line required to continue to
Denver Union Station. The stations served prior to the discontinuation of the F Line will continue to be served
by the E Line, with transfers at I-25•Broadway Station to either the D or H Line required to continue to 18th•Stout
Station. These service changes signify the agency’s commitment to ensure an equitable distribution of service
improvements and to minimize impacts with the permanent discontinuance of these rail lines.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s on-going pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital) and recovery uncertainty serves as
justification for maintaining the January 2023 service changes proposal.

Of the more than 36,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus route with
a major service improvement, minority and low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted services to equity populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the District overall, both minority and low-income populations
received a greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to nonequity populations. Minority areas had +1.84% benefit above non-minority areas and low-income
areas received +1.67% compared to higher-income areas

•

Of the over 27,000 people with access to rail stations with major service decreases, low-income
populations were impacted at a lower rate than the higher-income district average, whereas minority
populations represented a higher share of the population than non-minority populations.

Split Route 12 into the former Routes 7 (see page 14) and 12, with the
northern portion operating as Route 7 between 38th/Blake Station and
Northglenn at 112th Station, and the southern portion continuing operating
between Englewood Station and 38th/Blake Station as the Route 12. This
proposal is aimed at improving on-time performance, by creating two
shorter route alignments with separate operating schedules and greater
opportunities for schedule recovery.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Schedule adjustments are proposed to coordinate the anticipated changes
to the Route 15 operating schedule.

Extend the weekday span of service. The route currently operates from 9
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. northbound, and 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. southbound. This
extends service to cover from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. both directions. Sunday, add
southbound service over the alignment. Due to a previous configuration that
is no longer in use, route 30 only runs northbound on Sundays from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m.

Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Reroute route 76 in the area between I-70 and Olde Town Arvada Station to
enhance operational safety. New northbound routing will be R – 52nd Ave, L
– Vance St, C – 53rd Ave, to regular routing. New southbound routing will
be C – Vance St, R – 52nd Ave, L – Wadsworth Blvd, to regular routing. This
will add service to stops #21428 and 22763, without losing service to any
current stops.
Schedule adjustments resulting from running time analysis, aimed at
improving on-time performance are proposed.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for
better connections, weekdays, Saturdays and Sundays.
Adjust the meet times at Colorado at 72nd Ave Station with the N Line for

Responding to frequent requests from Denver International Airport
employees, schedule adjustments modify the schedule to leave DIA 2-5

In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an
equity analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people
of color and low-income populations.
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by
minority persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall
not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, nonHispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse
effects absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of
multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall
ridership. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of
the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated
from customer surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment
media subject to the fare change.
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute
change as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Threshold, a determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that
are disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are
also used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-lowincome populations.
An average fare analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare changes on the
average fare paid per boarding. The average fare analysis determines whether the changes
disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority or nonlow-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.
MyRide Stored Value Card System
RTD introduced its current MyRide stored-value smart card system (SV system) in 2013. Customers
using a MyRide card receive a $0.20 discount when purchasing a full-fare three-hour pass. Customers
using a Discount MyRide card issued to seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders
receive a $0.10 discount when purchasing fare for a half-fare three-hour pass.
At this time, the SV system is nearing the end of its serviceable life, and the agency will replace it with
account-based ticketing (ABT) system while retaining customers’ option to use newly issued smart cards
compatible with the existing smartphone app.
Existing MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new ABT system.
Due to this system incompatibility, customers will be required to take action to transfer any stored value
currently held via MyRide cards either:
•
•

To an ABT system account accessible via smartphone app or
To an ABT-compatible smart card if they do not intend to use a smartphone app to show proof of
valid fare

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.

DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 1033

1.E.1.b

As a result of the implementation of the ABT system along with the practice of fare capping, the
discontinuation of the SV system, and the need for customers to take action to move from the older
generation system to the newer one, staff recommends the elimination of the existing MyRide SV
discounts of $0.20 and $0.10 given to customers purchasing full-fare and discounted three-hour passes,
respectively.
To make this process as smooth and timely as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue
the sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June 2022, ahead of the installation of
the new validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards
incompatible.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than non-minority customers and an even
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all customers as a whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a Disparate
Impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than higher income customers and even a
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all customers as whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a
Disproportionate Burden.

Conclusions:
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the MyRide Stored Value Discount Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any
direct or foreseeable agency financial impacts.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Plan priority of Customer
Excellence in establishing a streamlined process for the new ABT system with a central focus on the
customer experience.

In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an equity
analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people of color
and low-income populations. The proposal to eliminate the discounts on MyRide Smart Card Stored Value
(Full-fare and Discount MyRide card) calls for such an analysis prior to the board taking action.

Methodology
RTD’s Title VI Program outlines the agency’s Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, as
well as the way in which RTD conducts fare equity analyses. In the case of the proposed fare product
discount elimination, the analysis aimed to answer one main question: does eliminating the MyRide
Stored Value (SV) $0.20/$0.10 discount disproportionately impact minority and low-income customers?
To answer this question, staff utilized data from the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey to identify
any potential disparities in the proposed fare change.

Findings – 2019 Survey Data
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
Disparate Impact Analysis (Minority Customers)
The analysis found that minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than non-minority customers and an even smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all
customers as a whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disparate Impact.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis (Low-income Customers)
The analysis found that low-income customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than higher income customers and even a smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all
customers as whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disproportionate Burden.

Considerations – MyRide Card Sales
A review of the MyRide card sales reports further suggests minimal impacts due to the overall low demand
for this fare product. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021.

1.E.1.b

Introduction
RTD is proposing the elimination of the MyRide Smart Card Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount. RTD
introduced its current card-based smart card system in 2013. Initially, this system was only used for
institutional passes for employers, neighborhoods, and colleges. RTD introduced the first method of
electronic fare collection for use by individual customers in 2016, the MyRide stored value smart card. On
initial implementation, customers could purchase and reload MyRide cards at RTD’s sales outlets.
Additional sales channels (two major grocery store chains and online accounts) were added in late 2016
and in 2017.
Dating back to the 2016 fare structure, a per-trip discount ($0.20 per full fare 3-hour trip; $0.10 per halffare 3-hour trip) as well as free transfers were included to incentivize the use of electronic fare collection.
However, due to delays in implementation, RTD continued to offer free transfer on all 3-hour tickets and
continued to offer paper 10-ride ticket books with a similar per-trip discount. These policies were
continued using the current fare structure, which was implemented in 2019. However, the 2019 fare
structure does not include a per-trip MyRide price incentive for the two new discounts that were created
then, a separate youth discount and an income-based fare discount through RTD’s then-new LiVE
program1. The $0.20/$0.10 discount per 3-hour trip only applies to trips with full-fare MyRide cards and
half-fare “Discount MyRide” cards for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders.
In late 2017, RTD added a new method of electronic fare collection, mobile ticketing, which was very well
received and now accounts for 19.4% of RTD’s fare revenue according to the February 2022 report. In
contrast, MyRide never fully took off due to inconveniences caused by technical limitations, especially
the fact that funds loaded online cannot be used for travel until the next day or later. At this time, RTD’s
current card-based system is end-of-life. RTD will replace it by adding account-based ticketing (ABT)
functionality and the option to use smart cards to the existing mobile platform. Customers will be able to
utilize the system through the RTD mobile app or physical smart cards. In addition to the fact that
decommissioning the old system is a technical necessity, the new system offers several customer
advantages. The new system includes real-time reflection of account balance, reloading, and fare
payments, as well as the option for fare capping (“best fare”). Fare capping provides flexibility for
customers to take advantage of the pricing and convenience of RTD’s day and monthly passes without
having to decide on a particular fare product in advance and without having to pay the full amount in
advance.
The current MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new system. RTD
will have to convert the current stored value to stored value in the new system, but due to the
incompatibility, this process will require some manual work and customers will have to take some action.
In order to make this process as seamless as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue the
sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June, ahead of the installation of the new
validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards unusable.

Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) functional mission to provide
public transit services within the Denver area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all fare changes to determine
whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income
populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document the proposed fare change and to identify
potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Disparate Impact Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority persons as
a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than
or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all persons
who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
2. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by low-income
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A low-income
population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health
and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. RTD will then analyze
the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If
a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Fare Change
Description of Changes
The fare change proposes to eliminate the discount on MyRide Stored Value transactions. Currently, Full
Fare MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.20 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass fare,
while Discount MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.10 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass
fare. Youth and LiVE program customers receive no discount when using MyRide Stored Value. The
$0.20/$0.10 discount is fixed across all Service Types (Local, Regional, Airport). The decisions upon which
not to integrate MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount in the account-based ticketing fare system are
shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Considerations for Removing MyRide Store Value $0.20/$0.10 discount
Consideration

Detailed Explanation

Customer Experience

The current MyRide Stored Value product is a single-trip product. Fare is deducted from
the stored value balance each time a customer taps their card on a bus or rail platform
reader for the first boarding of a trip and when transferring to a higher-priced service level.
(Note that no fare is deducted for taps (transfers) at the same service level within 3 hours
of the first tap.) As a result, the customer cannot purchase daily or monthly passes (period
passes) on the MyRide card, affording potential savings. Additionally, single trips
purchased on a MyRide card do not accumulate to period passes, leading some customers
to pay more than if they had purchased a day or monthly pass.

Technology

Eliminating the MyRide Stored Value discount allows for a seamless transition from the
current card-based to the new Account-Based Ticketing system by simplifying fare
calculations. Moreover, RTD’s fare structure with multiple service types and fare levels
requires creating and maintaining a more complex algorithm to calculate and track fares.

Customer Service

Issuing product exchanges is cumbersome because of the inconsistent pricing between
other fare products (paper and mobile tickets) and the MyRide single trip. In addition, the
lack of a one-to-one exchange between products results in customer confusion and
additional manual work for Customer Care staff.
Fare Capping is an electronic fare collection system feature that calculates and charges
single trips and automatically accumulates single trips into period passes. Fare Capping
increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to purchase period passes in
smaller increments. As a result, customers have peace of mind that they are paying the
best fare available.

1.E.1.b

The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely
affected by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., nonminority or non-low-income) who are adversely affected.3
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD’s Title VI Policies, RTD shall—
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and overall
users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and
overall users.4
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Threshold, a
determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-low-income
populations.
Within this report, an Average Fare Analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare
changes on the average fare paid per boarding. The Average Fare Analysis determines whether the
changes disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority
or non-low-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.

Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount was undertaken using
data from calendar year 2019, and therefore does not reflect the changes in ridership resulting from the
ongoing COVID pandemic. Calendar year 2019 ridership and revenue data formed the basis for the analysis
as it aligns with the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS). The 2019 CSS comports with the
FTA data requirements5 for conducting fare equity analyses (i.e., customer fare payment and demographic
information). The only changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the
changes in the average fare per boarding due to pricing changes; the Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities.

from customers surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment media
subject to the fare change.

Data Sources

MyRide Stored Value transactions for calendar 2019 were retrieved from RTD’s Business Intelligence
platform. Within the data warehouse, transactions are delineated by Customer Category (e.g., Full Fare,
Discount, Youth, LiVE) and Service Type (Local, Regional, Airport). With some additional analysis, MyRide
Stored Value boardings could be classified as first boardings, free transfers and upcharges. With this level
of delineation, MyRide Stored Value fare revenue could be calculated.
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, onboard customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare
payment. The 2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research
surveyors conducted 3,811 surveys.

Customer Satisfaction Survey Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while being the most recent and comprehensive on-board survey undertaken by RTD, does
have some limitations. Low response rates for MyRide Stored Value customers on certain Service Types
and by certain Rider Categories created some challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address
the limitations of the data by aggregating together the demographics for some MyRide Stored Value
customers.
The following demographic assumptions were used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●
●

Demographics for Regional MyRide Stored Value were aggregated with the demographics for
Airport MyRide Stored Value, due to too few survey responses.
Demographics for Seniors (65+) and Individuals with Disabilities were aggregated together, due
to both groups paying the same fare rates and experiencing identical pricing changes with the
proposed elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount.

Racial/Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified
themselves as “Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include
those who refused to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey
include: African American/Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin,
Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Indian, and Other (please specify).

Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Poverty Guidelines. To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines were used to determine
which populations would be considered low-income.

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

Systemwide ridership and fare revenue data for 2019 used in the Average Fare Analysis was retrieved
from the National Transit Database (NTD). Only ridership and fare revenue for fixed route services was
considered; Access-a-Ride and other Demand Response services ridership and revenue was excluded.

Packet Pg. 1043

Table 2 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions
by household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare
Equity Analysis was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey
respondent accurately using U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 3 presents the income categories used in
the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within
the income ranges that corresponded to the 150% HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size
were identified as low-income. This may overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents
the most inclusive low-income definition. The analysis did not include those survey respondents who
refused to respond to either of the household income and household size questions, as they could not be
properly categorized.

Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI
Policies. While elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount would result in a fare increase for some
populations, the systemwide change resulted in a 0.14% increase in the average fare. While all customer
populations are expected to see an increase in the average fare, the proposed fare changes are expected
to have a lesser impact on minority and low-income customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and

The Average Fare Analysis provides an overview of the proposed fare changes. Appendix A provides the
detailed tables that provide the average fare change by minority and low-income status and by specific
fare payment method. The tables include the absolute and percentage change between existing and
proposed fares, and the proportion of minority and low-income customers that would be affected by each
fare change.
Table 4 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority and non-minority
customers to all customers. For minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.434 to
$1.436, a 0.09% increase. For non-minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.444 to
$1.446, a 0.16% increase. For all customers, the average fare would increase from $1.441 to $1.443, a
0.14% increase. The percentage point difference between the percentage change for minority customers
and non-minority customers is -0.08%, indicating that while both groups would experience an increase in
their average fare, minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller increase than nonminority customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Additionally, the difference between Minority
and All Customers is even smaller at -0.05%. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s
Disparate Impact threshold, the fare change would not represent a Disparate Impact on minority
customers.

Table 5 presents the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for low-income customers to nonlow-income customers. For low-income customers, the average fare would increase from $1.431 to
$1.432, a 0.07% increase. For non-low-income customers, the average fare would increase from $1.444
to $1.446, a 0.16% increase. For all customers, the average fare would increase from $1.441 to $1.442, a
0.14% increase. The percentage point difference between the percentage change for low-income
customers and higher income customers is -0.10%, indicating that while both groups would experience
an increase in their average fare, low-income customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller
increase than higher income customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Additionally, the
difference between low-income and all customers is even less at 0.07%. Applying this difference in

Impact or Disproportionate Burden thresholds. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with
the implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.

Fare Change Equity Analysis Conclusions
The proposed fare changes required a fare equity analysis to identify any potential disparate impacts on
minority customers and/or disproportionate burden on low-income customers. The technical analysis
using survey data found:
•
•

No potential disparate impact on minority customers associated with the MyRide Stored Value
discount elimination
No potential disproportionate burden on low-income customers associated with the MyRide
Stored Value discount elimination

The result of this equity analysis concludes that minority and low-income customers will not be limited or
denied the benefits of the proposed fare changes.

MyRide Stored Value Card Sales Considerations
The overall demand for MyRide Stored Value by RTD’s ridership have been extremely low and suggests
minimal impacts. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021 as shown in Figure 1.

average fare changes to RTD’s Disproportionate Burden threshold, the fare change would not represent
a Disproportionate Burden on low-income customers.

2022 RTD MyRide Customer Survey
Supplemental to the fare equity analysis, a targeted survey was launched on March 23, 2022 to collect
feedback from customers of the considered changes to the MyRide program. The survey was utilized to
inform the equity analysis and to evaluate how the potential changes would affect existing customers.
The survey was sent via email and social media channels to 19,180 MyRide and LiVE customers and a total
of 2,490 responses were received indicating a 13% response rate. See Appendix B for the 2022 RTD
MyRide Customer Survey instrument.
Demographic Characteristics and Smartphone/Internet Access
•
•
•

Approximately 46 percent of participants were men, 47% were female, and 1% Non-Binary;
Approximately 25 percent of participants were non‐Hispanic whites; and
Approximately 20 percent of participants were low-income6;

Table 6 captures the response rates obtained from the survey questions that are relevant to the
assessment. Specifically, the survey suggests there is a high level of satisfaction with the MyRide discount
for 3-hour trips and the MyRide program. Additionally, over half of respondents are unlikely to use the
alternatives (e.g., 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass) to the Full-Fare or Discount Fare MyRide card.
Participants were asked how frequently they ride RTD services and a majority (63%) are defined as
infrequent7 customers. This suggests that MyRide customers are not frequent enough to warrant the
purchase of 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass. The most popular alternative was to purchase the 3hour or DayPass mobile ticket at 61 percent. Nearly all participants reported having a smartphone (96%),
a data plan with their cell phone provider (92%) and have access to wifi (95%). This suggests that the
alternative to purchase mobile tickets is a viable option and accessible for existing MyRide customers.
In conclusion, the survey results indicate there is a high satisfaction with the MyRide program and the
associated discounts for 3-hour trips. Although there is an unlikelihood with customers utilizing

threshold for their household size.

alternatives, there are current options available or will be available as noted in the forthcoming Mitigation
Measures section. Additionally, customers who use the current MyRide stored value card will have the
option to switch to a new card on the new ABT fare collection system, which allows for fare capping. As
previously noted in Table 1, fare capping increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to
purchase period passes in smaller increments. As a result, customers will pay the best fare available.

Mitigation Measures and Public Outreach
Mitigation Measures
The findings of this analysis do not prompt RTD to consider possible measures to avoid, minimize, and/or
mitigate adverse impacts on minority or low-income customers. Albeit there were no adverse impacts
presented, the following provides an overview of the already-planned or implemented measures for the
MyRide transition:
•

•

Introduce mobile 10-ride ticket packs on the Masabi mobile ticketing platform with the same
pricing as the paper 10-ride ticket books or 10 trips with the current MyRide cards. This way
customers who use MyRide primarily for the $0.20/$0.10 discount and do not ride enough to
benefit from fare capping do not have to “go back to” paper if they want the same price. Note
that this price advantage only applies to full fare and Discount (senior/disability) fare, there is no
additional discount for using MyRide or 10-ride ticket books/packs for Youth and LiVE fares.
Introduction of mobile stored value on the Masabi platform as a payment method. Initially, mobile
stored value can be used as a payment method to buy mobile tickets. Once ABT is implemented,
customers will be able to use it for tap-and-ride as well.

•

•

•
•

Introduction of the “vendor portal” on the Masabi platform, which allows cash-paying customers
(or customers with credit/debit cards who prefer to purchase in-person) to buy mobile tickets or
mobile stored value at the RTD sales outlets.
Transition: “True up” the fund balance on the current full fare and Discount fare (senior/disability)
MyRide cards when creating the new Masabi stored value during transition, so customers can
take the number of trips that they expected when they loaded/re-loaded their current MyRide
card. For example, a full-fare MyRide card balance of $2.80 will translate into a $3 Masabi account
balance (i.e., old balance equates to new balance). Note that this does not apply to Youth and
LiVE MyRide cards since there is no additional “MyRide discount” for those.
New retail network targeting convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores for cash-paying
customers (or anyone who prefers to purchase in-person) after the initial implementation of ABT.
Paper LiVE 10-ride ticket books are now available for purchase by individuals, through all channels
where paper 10-ride ticket books are available

Public Outreach
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI equity
analysis, RTD has established a transition and conversion strategy which will inform current MyRide
customers of the program’s discontinuation, how they can transfer any existing MyRide balances for
future use on RTD, and the alternative fare products, discounts and tools that are available to them
moving forward. A mix of targeted outreach, in-system and on-vehicle assets, digital and social media,
community outreach and Public Relations will inform and educate not only MyRide customers, but all RTD
customers, employees, stakeholders, and the public, of the features and capabilities of the ABT system
and how their journey on RTD will be adapted and improved as a result of its implementation.

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) conducts ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes
(i.e., bus, light rail, and commuter rail) to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Federal
Transit Administration’s accompanying Circular 4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients” (Title VI Circular) as well as to ensure equitable distribution across RTD’s
system. The analysis in this report compared minority access to that of non-minority access as well as lowincome access to that of non-low-income access across six service performance metrics: stop amenities, vehicle
loads, revenue hours, on-time performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability.
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is for minority and low-income routes and lines to
achieve within 10% or better of their counterparts per service performance metric. A metric above the 10%
threshold but within 20% would result in a “marginal” score. A marginal score would flag that metric as a caution
and area for improvement. Any composite score that exceeds 20% for minority populations would indicate
“adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide disparate impact 1 finding per the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). A disparate impact finding requires RTD to take steps to reduce the potential effects. Any
composite score that exceeds 20% for low-income populations would result in a system-wide disproportionate
burden 2 finding. RTD will consider opportunities to reduce the potential effects where practicable.
This analysis found no adverse impacts across stop amenities, vehicle loads, revenue hours, on-time
performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability. In fact, most of the six service performance metrics
performed as good or better on minority and low-income lines and routes than non-minority and non-low-income
lines and routes. However, the revenue hours of service metric for minority bus routes received a marginal score
and is thus flagged as an area for improvement, with 14.25% less revenue hours provided on minority local and
regional bus routes than non-minority local and regional routes (43.88% vs. 57.12%, respectively). It is also
important to note that, at the system level, a lower percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on all
minority modes of service than all non-minority modes of service (45.23% vs. 54.77%, respectively), with a
difference in revenue hours of service at 9.54%. Though this does not meet the 10% marginal score threshold,
it is very close and should be flagged for improvement accordingly.

Title VI
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide public transit services within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In the Title VI Circular, the FTA requires that RTD
document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI Program to the FTA
every three years.

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

Part of RTD’s compliance with the Title VI Circular is ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes
(local and regional bus, light rail, and commuter rail). The Title VI Circular does not require monitoring for
demand response service. Aligned with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff will conduct an annual review of
resource and service distribution. The objective is to ensure there is an equitable distribution across RTD’s
system. The analysis in this report compared minority access to that of non-minority access as well as lowincome access to that of non-low-income access across six service performance metrics for date compiled during
calendar year 2022:
•

•

•
•
•

•

Stop amenities: RTD analyzes the distribution of stop amenities in the RTD system (specifically,
shelters; seating; lighting; elevators; digital displays; signs, maps, and/or schedules; waste receptacles
and ticket vending machines) to identify any potential disparities.
Vehicle loads: RTD evaluates whether weekday local, regional, SkyRide, Bus Rapid Transit, light and
commuter rail vehicles are overcrowded by comparing the load/seat factor for each vehicle type and time
period (i.e., peak and midday). RTD used automated passenger counter data to calculate compliance
with the maximum load standard. The maximum load factor is the ratio of the total number of passengers
on a trip to the total number of vehicle seats on each individual trip. The standard is equal to or greater
than 125% of the seats for local (peak), where all other vehicle types and time periods abide by a
standard of equal to or greater than 100%. For each route, the count of the trips that exceeded the load
factor are divided by the total number of sampled trips to determine the percentage of trips that exceeded
the load factor. RTD requires that vehicle load standards be met 60% of the time.
Revenue hours: RTD evaluates the amount and distribution of revenue hours of service provided in
census block groups. The hours while in service include trip start to finish.
On-time performance: RTD defines “on-time” as no more than one minute early or five minutes late,
measured at time points.
Vehicle assignment: The FTA expects that the average age of vehicles on minority and/or low-income
lines/routes should be no more than the average age of vehicles on non-minority and/or non-low-income
lines/routes.
Service availability: RTD considers persons residing within one-half mile of bus stops and/or rail
stations as having service available. Service availability is expressed as number and percentage of
District-wide population and is determined by vehicle mode.

Title VI Service Performance Measure Rating Scale Rubric
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is for minority and low-income routes and lines to
achieve within 10% or better per service performance metric. This range will guide RTD in establishing a baseline
to set targets for subsequent years. A metric above the 10% threshold but within 20% would result in a
“marginal” score. A marginal score would flag that metric as a caution and area for improvement. Any composite
measure that exceeds 20% would indicate “adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide disparate impact
finding per the Federal Transit Administration. RTD will work to improve service and access on an on-going basis
to ensure RTD’s equity goals are achieved and for compliance with RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Program.

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

In the past, RTD has been unable to examine vehicle assignments consistently or accurately. This is because
bus vehicle assignments are put together in blocks that typically consist of operations on multiple routes (referred
to as interlining or through lining), making it impossible to assign buses on a specific route and therefore
rendering an analysis of vehicle assignment difficult.
However, in 2022, RTD produced a methodology to pursue the vehicle assignment analysis. The analysis utilizes
service “recap” data and relies on making key assumptions. It includes typical vehicle type and garage
assignments by route; service equity classification (i.e., low-income or non-low-income and minority or nonminority) of routes based on in-service hours as well as geographic demographic data; and vehicle age data, by
vehicle type and assigned garage.
Equity and non-equity routes are first identified by their typically assigned garage, then with known typicallyassigned vehicles, the average age of vehicles is assigned. The overall average vehicle ages are then compared
between equity and non-equity routes to ensure equity routes are within an acceptable threshold range of
difference.
For light rail and commuter rail, there is no specific alignment for a certain model or year. Additionally, all 66
commuter rail vehicles were purchased in 2014, leaving no difference in the average age of commuter rail
vehicles between equity and non-equity routes.

Income to Poverty Level In The Past 12 Months (Block Group Level Data) USDOT National Address Database (NAD)
To adjust for the fact that some census block groups are only partially within the District, the fraction of each block group's population within the transit district was calculated by using the
percentage of address points within the district and each block group. This address fraction was the factor used to proportion Census counts resulting in demographics within buffers for
each service and PnR. Address points come from the USDOT National Address Database.

** Population totals for the RTD district vary between statistics for race and income/poverty in part since the Census is a full count, and the ACS is an extrapolation based on a sample, and in part
because the ACS total excludes those whom poverty status is not determined.

2025-2028 Title VI Program Update Proposed Policy Change Feedback
Thumbs up
This change is great. It's confusing to understand but I get it now. I like it.
The Denver NAACP appreciates RTD’s commitment to ensuring equitable access to public transit and
mitigating potential disparities affecting BIPOC and low-income communities.
After reviewing the proposed updates to the Major Service Change Policy, we fully support these changes
and believe they will strengthen transit equity across the region. Thank you!
Son para mejorar
So that RTD does not make changes so easily. Love it
RTD SUCKS!
RTD does not provide equitable service to my area. People who have no transportation can only travel on
weekdays, but only as long as it is not a holiday.
It sounds good based on my limited understanding of the proposed changes. If I had a more nuanced
understanding I may agree or disagree more strongly.
I think this plan would be more equitable and responsive to the needs of all communities than the former
plan.
I think the expansion, especially to cover impacts of 36 months of service changes is positive.
I think that’s a large enough change to affect people, smaller percentage, fewer people. RTD has to do
the most good for the most people.
I think it's a great idea, but I know that RTD has issues with communication. I think it would be better to
be &lt;25%, but I understand the challenge that could present RTD.
I think it would limit the ability to make changes that best fit the needs of frequent riders
I support expanding the definition of a major change to include periods shorter than 12 months,
especially given the tri-annual service changes that occur. I would also ask that "unplanned" or
"unofficial" schedule/service changes (for example the SE corridor light rail slowdowns that started June
2024, or the route 19/52 detours on the way out of downtown Denver) be eligible to be evaluated as
"major changes", as I think it is beneficial to allow these impacts to trigger an equity analysis, in order to
help prioritize fixes and restoration of service where there is a disproportionate burden caused by
unplanned service disruptions.
I am concerned that the cumulative change period of 36 months may not be enough time for census data
to be updated to account for changes in population/demographics, and therefore progressive service
changes that are in response to population/demand evolution over this 36 month period would end up
being analyzed against outdated data that did not keep pace with the actual population/demographic
changes that the service change is responding to.
I do not support this policy change because changing the criteria behind major service changes will result
in more route changes requiring equity analyses. Does RTD have the staff capacity to perform more
reviews?
Bipoc as well as pWD should always be considered when big changes are happening!
Disproportionate Burden Policy (Low Income)
With the current economy, any changes to better identify low incomes helps.
This is beneficial because Im low income
This is also great. This was explained clearly and I fully support this change.

Major Service Change Policy

This a good step in the right direction but still a very conservative definition of low income. I worked on
Boulder's guaranteed income pilot project and we grappled with definining low income too. Our
conclusion was that 40k-50k per year was our definition of low income and I suggest that RTD use a
more inclusive definition of low income to include households that make at least 50k or less per year
Packet Pg. 1093

1.E.1.b

After reviewing the proposed updates to the Low-Income Definition, we fully support these changes and
believe they will strengthen transit equity across the region. Thank you!
RTD SUCKS!
Redefining the guidelines to align with a broader poverty threshold seems like an important first step for
creating more equitable programs in the future. Agree.
Probably not enough people for the help that's needed but, it's great that you've done this.
My dad used to be able to raise a family of 6 off of a 65K salary. You'd be homeless if that were the case
today.
More for the people. This is better.
It's a good idea
It would help more people ride RTD.
It is certainly great that we are increasing the threshold to cover more people. I also think that with the
Denver metro being a bit more expensive than the "federal standard", it may make sense to check with
Denver income metrics and set the standards based more on that.
I want to know how much it will cost the taxpayers first. Sounds wonderful but I think we need all the
details! What is the cost?
I support increasing the threshold used to define "low-income", however I do not think 200% of the HHS
poverty guidelines is a high enough cutoff. In the city of Denver, a worker making minimum wage
($18.81/hr) and working full-time (40 hr/week) for 50 weeks out of the year would not be counted as
low-income using this metric ($37,620 annual income vs $30,120 cutoff for a single-person household). I
would strongly advocate for ensuring that the metric used to determine "low income" includes workers
making at or near minimum wage, especially given the amount of low-wage shift-work jobs that require
transportation to/from work at early/late hours where RTD's service is historically more limited. I suggest
changing the definition to be more in line with how affordable housing in the area is treated, using
something in the range of 50-80% AMI
Additionally, if there is any way to define a "low-income" workplace based on median hourly wages, I
believe that would be extremely beneficial in categorizing not only where people live but also where they
work to better match equity analysis activities to travel patterns.
I agree because it is a move in the right direction. I hope that we can continue to increase this limit. As
the federal government does consider 30% AMI, close to 200% FPL, extremely low income; 50% AMI
($46,650 for a family of 1) very low income; and 80% AMI ($71,900 for a family of 1) low income in
Jefferson County, Colorado.
Better support for those impacted by lower incomes.
As long as it is to improve and stable and doesn't keep affecting us
Fare Equity Policy
Yes because now federal bus now only goes to 62nd.
The Denver NAACP appreciates RTD’s commitment to ensuring equitable access to public transit and
mitigating potential disparities affecting BIPOC and low-income communities.
After reviewing the proposed updates to the Fare Equity Policy, we fully support these changes and
believe they will strengthen transit equity across the region. Thank you!

Attachment: Attachment B - Draft 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update (5119 : 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update)

The incomes considered certainly qualify as low-income. Much of my work is around affordable housing,
which uses the Area Median Income as the basis of affordability. I am wondering if RTD is required to use
the federal poverty level, or if using a regional AMI would lead to more realistic income levels.
The Denver NAACP appreciates RTD’s commitment to ensuring equitable access to public transit and
mitigating potential disparities affecting BIPOC and low-income communities.

Thank you! I enjoy this change.
Sometimes some people don't go places. Its better
RTD SUCKS!
Need free rides because i don't have cash. I'm poor so why doe sit matter it the change if no free rides.
Packet Pg. 1094

It helps.
I like this because we need better fares and need changes that will not affect
I agree with the changes as stated, but I also wonder if fare collection/enforcement would benefit from
inclusion here too. For example, if a large fine is imposed for fare evasion that may become a
disproportionate burden on someone who was struggling to afford the fare in the first place. Treating onthe-spot fare collection as the default behavior (or other methods that I'm not considering here) for fare
enforcement instead of fines would potentially lead to more equitable outcomes, especially if coupled with
robust marketing campaigns around LiVE fare eligibility and enrollment.
Good idea. I'd like to learn more about fare equity across rtd regions, and the state.
Good for us
As long as machines can always take cash, that’s great.
Agree that cash should still be supported!

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) conducts ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes
(i.e., bus, light rail, and commuter rail) to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Federal
Transit Administration’s accompanying Circular 4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients” (Title VI Circular) as well as to ensure equitable distribution across RTD’s
system. The analysis in this report compared minority access to that of non-minority access as well as lowincome access to that of non-low-income access across six service performance metrics: stop amenities, vehicle
loads, revenue hours, on-time performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability.
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is for minority and low-income routes and lines to
achieve within 10% or better of their counterparts per service performance metric. A metric above the 10%
threshold but within 20% would result in a “marginal” score. A marginal score would flag that metric as a caution
and area for improvement. Any composite score that exceeds 20% for minority populations would indicate
“adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide disparate impact 1 finding per the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). A disparate impact finding requires RTD to take steps to reduce the potential effects. Any
composite score that exceeds 20% for low-income populations would result in a system-wide disproportionate
burden 2 finding. RTD will consider opportunities to reduce the potential effects where practicable.
This analysis found no adverse impacts across stop amenities, vehicle loads, revenue hours, on-time
performance, vehicle assignment, and service availability. In fact, most of the six service performance metrics
performed as good or better on minority and low-income lines and routes than non-minority and non-low-income
lines and routes. However, the revenue hours of service metric for minority bus routes received a marginal score
and is thus flagged as an area for improvement, with 14.25% less revenue hours provided on minority local and
regional bus routes than non-minority local and regional routes (43.88% vs. 57.12%, respectively). It is also
important to note that, at the system level, a lower percentage of revenue hours of service are provided on all
minority modes of service than all non-minority modes of service (45.23% vs. 54.77%, respectively), with a
difference in revenue hours of service at 9.54%. Though this does not meet the 10% marginal score threshold,
it is very close and should be flagged for improvement accordingly.

Title VI
Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide public transit services within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In the Title VI Circular, the FTA requires that RTD
document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI Program to the FTA
every three years.

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

Part of RTD’s compliance with the Title VI Circular is ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes
(local and regional bus, light rail, and commuter rail). The Title VI Circular does not require monitoring for
demand response service. Aligned with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff will conduct an annual review of
resource and service distribution. The objective is to ensure there is an equitable distribution across RTD’s
system. The analysis in this report compared minority access to that of non-minority access as well as lowincome access to that of non-low-income access across six service performance metrics for date compiled during
calendar year 2022:
•

•

•
•
•

•

Stop amenities: RTD analyzes the distribution of stop amenities in the RTD system (specifically,
shelters; seating; lighting; elevators; digital displays; signs, maps, and/or schedules; waste receptacles
and ticket vending machines) to identify any potential disparities.
Vehicle loads: RTD evaluates whether weekday local, regional, SkyRide, Bus Rapid Transit, light and
commuter rail vehicles are overcrowded by comparing the load/seat factor for each vehicle type and time
period (i.e., peak and midday). RTD used automated passenger counter data to calculate compliance
with the maximum load standard. The maximum load factor is the ratio of the total number of passengers
on a trip to the total number of vehicle seats on each individual trip. The standard is equal to or greater
than 125% of the seats for local (peak), where all other vehicle types and time periods abide by a
standard of equal to or greater than 100%. For each route, the count of the trips that exceeded the load
factor are divided by the total number of sampled trips to determine the percentage of trips that exceeded
the load factor. RTD requires that vehicle load standards be met 60% of the time.
Revenue hours: RTD evaluates the amount and distribution of revenue hours of service provided in
census block groups. The hours while in service include trip start to finish.
On-time performance: RTD defines “on-time” as no more than one minute early or five minutes late,
measured at time points.
Vehicle assignment: The FTA expects that the average age of vehicles on minority and/or low-income
lines/routes should be no more than the average age of vehicles on non-minority and/or non-low-income
lines/routes.
Service availability: RTD considers persons residing within one-half mile of bus stops and/or rail
stations as having service available. Service availability is expressed as number and percentage of
District-wide population and is determined by vehicle mode.

Title VI Service Performance Measure Rating Scale Rubric
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is for minority and low-income routes and lines to
achieve within 10% or better per service performance metric. This range will guide RTD in establishing a baseline
to set targets for subsequent years. A metric above the 10% threshold but within 20% would result in a
“marginal” score. A marginal score would flag that metric as a caution and area for improvement. Any composite
measure that exceeds 20% would indicate “adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide disparate impact
finding per the Federal Transit Administration. RTD will work to improve service and access on an on-going basis
to ensure RTD’s equity goals are achieved and for compliance with RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Program.

Title VI Service Performance Monitoring Report

In the past, RTD has been unable to examine vehicle assignments consistently or accurately. This is because
bus vehicle assignments are put together in blocks that typically consist of operations on multiple routes (referred
to as interlining or through lining), making it impossible to assign buses on a specific route and therefore
rendering an analysis of vehicle assignment difficult.
However, in 2022, RTD produced a methodology to pursue the vehicle assignment analysis. The analysis utilizes
service “recap” data and relies on making key assumptions. It includes typical vehicle type and garage
assignments by route; service equity classification (i.e., low-income or non-low-income and minority or nonminority) of routes based on in-service hours as well as geographic demographic data; and vehicle age data, by
vehicle type and assigned garage.
Equity and non-equity routes are first identified by their typically assigned garage, then with known typicallyassigned vehicles, the average age of vehicles is assigned. The overall average vehicle ages are then compared
between equity and non-equity routes to ensure equity routes are within an acceptable threshold range of
difference.
For light rail and commuter rail, there is no specific alignment for a certain model or year. Additionally, all 66
commuter rail vehicles were purchased in 2014, leaving no difference in the average age of commuter rail
vehicles between equity and non-equity routes.

To adjust for the fact that some census block groups are only partially within the District, the fraction of each block group's population within the transit district was calculated by using the
percentage of address points within the district and each block group. This address fraction was the factor used to proportion Census counts resulting in demographics within buffers for

** Population totals for the RTD district vary between statistics for race and income/poverty in part since the Census is a full count, and the ACS is an extrapolation based on a sample, and in part
because the ACS total excludes those whom poverty status is not determined.

2024 Onboard Survey
From August 19 to December 10, 2024, RTD conducted a systemwide onboard transit customer survey providing
a snapshot of weekday trip characteristics across 99 bus routes and 10 rail lines with 18,285 customer responses
(excluding visitors). The survey resulted in 66% sample of trips for bus and 33% sample for rail. Data is
weighted1 to the estimated weekday ridership of 170,000 originating rides. The snapshot also provides data on
customer demographics of all ages including household income, race/ethnicity, and spoken language(s).
The sample is large and helps provide a description of the variability and diversity within the RTD customer
population. To aid the comparisons in this report, two statistical tests were performed to determine if the results
are reliable or due to chance. Chi-square tests2 found a statistically significant association between race or
ethnicity by income plus customer onboard time of day and frequency of ridership by income. Two proportion
Z-tests3 found statistically significant differences between customers that identify as BIPOC or non-BIPOC in
relationship to having a valid driver’s license, transfers per trip, owning a vehicle, and rail or bus vehicle mode.
Testing low-income by non-low-income customers realized statistically significant differences in having a valid
driver’s license, transfers per trip, owning a vehicle, and rail or bus vehicle mode.
Race/ethnicity and income are compared in the following pages and called out with an asterisk (see graphs)
when significantly significant.

Key Findings
The result of the onboard survey provides a rich illustration of the RTD weekday ridership characteristics
emphasizing the travel behaviors and transit dependencies of low-income and BIPOC customers.
•

Customer Characteristics: BIPOC, low-income, and linguistically diverse customers responded to the
onboard survey at much higher rates than their district averages. Notably, customers identifying as Black
or African American are onboard at nearly four times their district average. More than half of BIPOC
respondents (53%) are under the age of 35. Additionally, 58% of the customers identify as men.

•

Travel Behavior: The vast majority of respondents report they are frequent/regular (95%) use of RTD
transit services. BIPOC (69%) and low-income (73%) customers are the most frequent, indicating neardaily use. These groups report higher bus ridership and lower rail ridership when comparing them to the
overall average and are more likely to require transfers to complete their trips. Among low-income
respondents, over half (53%) board transit during the midday period (9 AM to 3 PM).

•

Transit Dependency: Survey responses indicate a high level of transit dependency among BIPOC and
low-income customers. Fewer than half of BIPOC respondents (47%) and only 39% of low-income

Weighting and expanding survey data are crucial steps in market research to ensure your findings accurately represent
the target population and allow for more reliable generalizations. Weighting adjusts for discrepancies in the sample's
demographics compared to the population, while expansion helps you translate sample findings into estimates for the entire
population.

or if observed data significantly deviates from expected data

respondents have a valid driver’s license. While 57% of all customers indicate they have access to a
household vehicle, only 39% of low-income respondents report the same. Even among those with vehicle
access, nearly two-thirds of BIPOC and low-income customers say they could not use a vehicle for the
trip they were making at the time of the survey. Overall, just 27% of customers say they have a vehicle
available and could have use it for the surveyed trip.
•

Fare Payment: BIPOC and low-income customers are more likely to use the 3-hour pass or single trip
fare at slightly higher rates than their counterparts. Approximately 14% of the customers report using a
discounted fare product such as for LiVE (income-based) program participants, seniors, Medicare
recipients, or individuals with disabilities. BIPOC and low-income customers are also significantly more
likely to pay cash onboard and report below-average access to debit or credit cards.

Results
Customer Characteristics
Race or Ethnicity
The racial or ethnic breakdown of customers in the onboard survey is displayed in Figure X.1. There are two
notable differences between the customers in this sample and the demographic breakdown of the RTD service
area, as derived from the 2019-2023 American Community Survey (ACS) five-year estimates (i.e., populationbased data). First, customers who identify as Black or African American make up 19% of RTD transit service
customers, significantly higher than the regional average of 5%. Second, customers who identify as white are
found on RTD transit services less frequently, at 44% compared to the regional average of nearly 63%.

Of the 30% of respondents who reported they speak a language other than English at home, only 22% took the
survey in Spanish or one of the twelve other languages available. The majority of customers who took the survey
in English (71%) reported that they speak English “very well,” while only 22% of customers who took the survey
in a non-English language reported they speak English “very well.” Of the customers that speak a language other
than English at home, 40% are considered limited English proficient. Overall, 12% of the customers in the survey
reported they are limited English proficient, which is well above the RTD service area average of just under 7%
using ACS data. Among customers completing the survey in a non-English language, Spanish speakers accounted
for 98%, followed by Haitian Creole (0.7%) and Cantonese (0.3%).

at a combined vehicle rate of 44% and are found onboard buses at a lower rate (41%) and rail at a higher rate
(51%) than their boarding percentage. Low-income customers board at a rate of 33% combining bus and rail
and are found onboard buses at a higher rate (37%) and rail at a lower rate (22%) than their boarding
percentage. Furthermore, non-low-income customers board at a combined rate of 67% and are found onboard

Further, customers with at least one vehicle in their household were asked if they could have used a vehicle for
the trip they were making at the time of the survey. Even though BIPOC and low-income customers reported
having access to a vehicle, over 62% stated they could not have used the vehicle for the trip they were currently
making. Interestingly, out of the 18,285 people that provided a snapshot of their current trip, only 27% stated
they had a vehicle and could have used it for that trip.

Fare Product Type
The top three types of ticket/fare products customers’ use for their trips are the 3-hour pass/single trip, day
pass, and monthly pass. As shown in Figure X.16, BIPOC and low-income customers show a slight preference
for the 3-hour pass/single trip comparing them to non-BIPOC and non-low-income customers. Overall, ticket/fare
product usage is similar across the groups. Exempt tickets include no-cost tickets such as free-ride coupons for
the general public active military, law enforcement, fire fighters, and aides for customers with disabilities; RTD
employee, spouse, dependent, retiree, board, and contractor passes; and free fixed-route service access for
Access-a-Ride customers.

Fare Category
Nearly 86% of customers use the standard fare for their trips. As shown in Figure X.17, low-income customers
use the highest percentage of LiVE (income-based discounts) at 10%, a higher usage rate than non-low-income
customers at 6%. Non-BIPOC customers use the senior (65 and over) fare type at twice the rate of BIPOC
customers. Medicare and the Individuals with Disabilities Special Discount reduced fares were used similarly
across all groups.

Proposed Low-Income Definition Graphs
Due to the proposed low-income definition as part of the Title VI Program update, staff produced ridership trip
characteristics using income status at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level. The graphs below draw
comparison between the new low-income definition and non-low-income population (i.e., above 200% FPL).

Boardings by Income Status
Boardings were nearly evenly split between low-income and non-low-income customers, with 52% of customers
identifying as low-income and 48% as non-low-income. The change from 150% to 200% of the federal poverty
level increased the low-income customer population by 19%.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Contract Extension for
One Year

May 14, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
May 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute a one-year extension of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal Security
Services (AUS), including the amendments discussed below, for a total cost not to exceed
$22,062,288.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Steve Martingano, Acting Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal POST-certified police officers, secondary
employment officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD
customers, facilities, and property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. The second option year was executed from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, following approval
by the Board on May 31, 2023. A third and final option year term extended the contract from July 1,
2024, to June 30, 2025.
Currently, the menu of services provided under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
• Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities including bus and rail stations
• Fare enforcement
• Patrol services
• Enhanced security presence during large-scale events
• Integrated security technology services
• Security command and dispatch center staffing and monitoring
• Federally required commuter rail Second Crewmember position duties and responsibilities
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute a one-year extension with AUS to
continue providing system-wide security services. This extension will allow RTD to perform a

Packet Pg. 1142

1.E.2

competitive procurement for ongoing security services consistent with the summary scope of work
unanimously approved by the Board on February 25, 2025. RTD anticipates having a new contract in
place by June 30, 2026, subject to a successful procurement and Board approval.
During the term of the existing contract AUS has fulfilled the contract requirements to a satisfactory
level, and assisted RTD in continuity of services.
In addition to extending the contract for an additional one-year term, the below modifications are
recommended to the contract terms:
•
•

Maintain staffing levels up to 9,481 per week (Q3 staffing levels in the current SOW) for the term
of the contract
A 3% increased hourly wage rates for armed and unarmed security services
o Armed Security Services – Transit Security Officer:
Wage level: $28.28 (currently $27.46)
Hourly billing rate: $45.03 (currently $43.72)
o Unarmed Security Services – Transit Security Specialist
Wage level: $23.90 (currently $23.21)
Hourly billing rate: $35.22 (currently $34.19)

The above proposed amendments are anticipated to enhance overall contract performance and ensure
adequate coverage as RTD continues to shift its resource allocation to increase its internal police force
and decrease reliance upon contracted security while also responding to increased demand for security.
Hourly wage increases are intended to improve recruitment and retention, are supported by market data
are consistent with increases in prior years of the contract.
In adopting this Recommended Action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:
o The hiring of additional unarmed security officers to serve in ambassador and customer
service roles, and
o Continued deployment of contracted security personnel in higher visibility uniforms,
yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves.
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued viability of RTD Police
Department to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving
system reliability and decreasing delays, thereby improving system reliability and decreasing
delays and meeting the requirements mandated by federal guidelines for commuter rail services,
so that RTD can continue services for commuter rail functions

Packet Pg. 1143

1.E.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $19,639,532 of which
$9,819,766 is accounted for within the FY2025 Budget. The remaining funds will be requested through
the FY2026 Budget process.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Vision Zero

May 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Alicia Leitgeb, Transportation Planner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Vision Zero (VZ) is an initiative originating in Sweden with the goal of eliminating all traffic fatalities and
severe injuries. Locally, the City and County of Denver and City of Boulder are recognized as VZ
Communities and are working on infrastructure changes to improve safety in their communities. The
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) is also recognized as a VZ Community and has also
adopted a regional VZ commitment to make roadways safer for all users.
In October 2024, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution supporting VZ to eliminate traffic fatalities
and severe injuries. This resolution included six actions related to the incorporation of VZ principles into
RTD’s planning and operations. This presentation seeks to address the actions laid out in the resolution.
As the sole multi-modal transit agency in the Denver metropolitan region as well as the state, RTD does
not have legal authority over much of the right-of-way (ROW) on which its transit vehicles operate. RTD
has authority over rail ROW and other property the agency owns, including transit stations, facilities, and
vehicles. RTD owns less than four percent of the over 9,000 total stops in its 2,345 square-mile service
area, and the roads on which RTD buses operate are mostly controlled by the Colorado Department of
Transportation or local jurisdictions. Typically, those entities determine the design and configuration of
their roadways. When possible, RTD works closely with its partners to ensure that streets and
intersections are appropriately designed to accommodate RTD transit vehicles and to balance operational
needs with safety treatments. RTD also actively participates as a member of DRCOG’s Regional VZ
Work Group, which coordinates VZ planning within the DRCOG region.
Other transit agencies, such as the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART), Santa Clara
Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), have
adopted a safety perspective that aligns with the principles of VZ, although they are not typically
branded as VZ initiatives. These activities have included adopting station access policies, providing
funding for local jurisdictions to undertake infrastructure improvements, completing Safety Action Plans
(i.e. VZ Plans), installing suicide prevention signage at stations, and engaging in safety awareness
campaigns.

Packet Pg. 1145

1.F.1

In the Denver metro region, RTD staff collaborate with state and local partners on roadway infrastructure
improvements, bus stop relocations, and long-range planning studies to support VZ priorities. Several of
RTD’s current activities are also aligned with the principles of VZ, such as a preference for bus stops
located after an intersection (i.e. “far-side” bus stops), rail safety week campaigns, and the safety and
mental health resource cards carried by RTD police officers and available on transit vehicles.
DISCUSSION
With the guidance of the Board and the General Manager and CEO, the agency will assess the
establishment of a multi-pronged VZ Program with both internal and external focus areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item. If a comprehensive VZ Program is
pursued, costs of implementation will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Customer-Facing Communications, Real-Time Information,
and Service Alerts

May 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
Will Adams, Senior Manager, Customer Care
Patrick McMahon, Manager, Software Architecture and Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
DISCUSSION
RTD maintains several internal and external systems and inputs that support customer-facing
communications and information. The various systems support dozens of data feeds, platforms, and
applications that support station signage, RTD’s Next Ride application, third-party mobile applications,
and Service Alerts.
The agency has four main goals for its customer-facing communications. These four goals directly align
with RTD’s Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value, as well as the agency’s
Strategic Initiatives to create a Welcoming Transit Environment and support Customer and Community
Connections.
1. Enhance the Customer Experience: clear, timely, and accurate communication helps customers
navigate the transit system confidently and efficiently.
2. Promote Transit Access and Utilization: proactive communications support customers’ full access
to RTD’s services and continued utilization.
3. Support Bus and Rail Operations: digital signs, mobile apps, and Service Alerts reduce customer
confusion and reliance on staff for information.
4. Build Trust and Transparency: consistent updates, especially during unplanned and planned
disruptions, demonstrate that the agency values customers and their time.
Traveler Information System (TIS)
Across each of RTD’s modes of transportation (i.e., Bus, Light Rail, and Commuter Rail), different
systems exist, and each one is unique and provides different feed types. TIS provides real-time vehicle
locations for bus and rail, and the system architecture has three components: input, storage and
transformation, and outputs. The TIS feed is problematic to manage and it is difficult to ensure that
consistent information is provided to customers. TIS was originally implemented using a legacy coding
framework, and the backend language is now considered obsolete. The system relies on costly legacy
middleware to function, for which there is limited internal staff expertise and vendor support. It is also
very susceptible to maintenance challenges, data feed errors, and outages.
Digital Signage
In May 2024, staff provided an in-depth overview of its signage program at stops and stations. The
presentation to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee outlined improvement projects

Packet Pg. 1166

1.F.2

underway, a station assessment that had recently launched, and a timeline for additional amenities
enhancements. Several different signage types and technologies exist across RTD’s system, and each
type is separately managed and maintained. RTD’s public information system uses three types of digital
signs to communicate information to customers. The first category is Variable Message Signs (VMS),
which display one to three lines of text. VMS are original to RTD’s rail system and primarily installed at
light rail and commuter rail platforms. The second category of digital signs is public information displays
(PIDs). PIDs are the screens installed at RTD’s transit centers and facilities, as well as select bus stops.
RTD has approximately 130 PIDs across its system to display schedule information and other must-know
content. The third category of digital signs is universal advertising totems (UATs). UATs refer to the
large, freestanding, walk-up screens recently installed at light rail and commuter rail platforms. The first
UAT was installed on March 9, 2023, and by the end of 2024, more than 100 UATs were in operation.
Service Alerts
RTD’s Service Alerts provide real-time updates about planned and unplanned disruptions, delays,
detours, and other changes impacting bus and rail services. Customers can sign up to receive alerts by a
specific bus route or rail line. Alerts are sent via email and text message, as well as displayed in RTD’s
Next Ride app and multiple downstream systems and third-party apps. Service Alerts are managed,
drafted, and disseminated by RTD’s Customer Care team, Monday through Friday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
However, Bus Dispatch sends all unplanned service disruption alerts at all times. In 2024, RTD sent
12,239 Service Alerts.
Outside regular business hours, rail-related Service Alerts are managed, drafted, and disseminated by
light rail controllers, commuter rail controllers, and Denver Transit Operators. The first responsibility of
dispatchers and controllers is to ensure RTD maintains safe operations and frontline employees have
accurate and timely information that supports the safe movement of buses and trains. Staff is drafting a
proposal to increase Customer Care support for all Service Alerts outside regular business hours.
Mobile Applications
RTD offers several web-based applications (“apps”) to support customers’ use of its bus and rail
services, as well as to provide access to real-time information and operational updates.
There are five separate apps available to customers, including:
• NextRide: trip planning, scheduling, service disruptions, and vehicle tracking
• MyRide: mobile ticketing
• Transit Watch: reporting personal safety and security concerns
• QRyde: Access-a-Ride information and scheduling
• Demand Trans: FlexRide information and scheduling
Each of the apps provide different navigation, functionality, and branding, and the five apps differ in
their ability to be downloaded (i.e., availability in an app store or web-based access). Multiple
applications create confusion for customers and provide a less-than-ideal user experience. Significant
time and resources are annually expended to maintain, market, and promote the agency’s different apps.
In 2024, RTD announced plans to bring the separate apps into a single user interface to improve the
customer experience and implement best practices. A multi-phased timeline and scope of work were
developed by staff in early 2025 to implement this project. In May 2025, a public solicitation process
was initiated to select a vendor to support RTD’s efforts to create one app during a 10-month process.

Packet Pg. 1167

1.F.2

The project will commence by combining the functionality of Next Ride, MyRide, and Transit Watch
apps. Feedback will be solicited from Directors, employees, and customer stakeholders as part of the
app creation process. Following user and accessibility testing in late 2025, the newly created app will be
available in Q1 of 2026 for download from app stores (i.e., Apple Store and Google Play). In 2026,
subsequent efforts will launch to integrate QRyde and Demand Trans, RTD’s two remaining apps, into
the newly created single app.
Improvement Projects Underway
In addition to recent enhancements to RTD’s mobile app, website, and Service Alerts, staff is
redesigning RTD’s information technology infrastructure to modernize its framework. The effort will
ensure a standardized structure that supports the various data feeds and customer-facing outputs. The
backend enhancements will ensure the various data feeds, which are based on different vehicle tracking
technologies, are supported and provide consistent information for customers. Efforts commenced in
2025 to also remove and replace inoperable digital signs at rail stations with upgraded technology and
equipment. A station assessment that began in 2024 is again commencing to review all rail stations and
establish a comprehensive set of data points. The assessment is reviewing all existing customer
amenities and identifying opportunities for potential improvement.

Customer Communication Goals
1. Enhance the Customer Experience
Clear, timely, and accurate communication helps customers navigate the transit system confidently and efficiently

2. Promote Transit Access and Utilization
Proactive communications support customers’ full access of RTD’s services and repeat utilization

3. Support Bus and Rail Operations
Digital signs, mobile apps, and service alerts reduce customer confusion and reliance on staff for information

4. Build Trust and Transparency
Consistent updates, especially during disruptions, shows that the agency values customers

§ RTD maintains several internal and external inputs to support customer-facing communications
• Bus, light rail, and commuter rail operations are each unique and provide different data feeds
• Includes station signage, Next Ride app, third-party mobile applications, and service alerts

§ The Traveler Information System (TIS) provides real-time vehicle locations (bus and rail)
§ The system architecture has three parts
• Input
• Storage and Transformation
• Outputs (i.e., customer interface)

System Challenges: TIS
§ The Traveler Information System’s data feed has various sources, and it also depends on the vehicle type
• No standardized process for receiving the feed
• Feed is problematic to manage
• Difficult to ensure consistent information is provided across different modes

§ TIS was originally implemented using an incorrect coding framework
• The backend language is now considered obsolete
• Relies on costly legacy middleware to function
• Susceptible to maintenance challenges and data feed errors

System Challenges: TIS (cont’d)
§ Lack of flexibility with planned and unplanned schedule changes
• Scheduling software does not accommodate schedule changes (e.g.,
construction zones, slow zones, and special events)

• Changes must be “hard coded” so that schedule changes are reflected
across customer-facing channels

§ Light Rail Operations uses SCADA (track sensors) to provide an estimated real-time location of the vehicle
• RTD internally developed a GPS data solution
• Soft launch implemented in March 2025

§ Bus Operations uses INIT system with GPS position and location algorithm
• Does not account for traffic pattern changes, weather incidents, vehicle accidents, or crowd sourced data

§ Commuter Rail Operations uses Wabtech (third-party solution)
• RTD has no direct control over the data feed
• Regularly faces outages and downtime, leading to a lack of reliability

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit “Legacy” Customers

May 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On March 24, 2020, the Board of Directors approved the May 2020 Service Changes, as amended,
which established a category of “legacy” customers for RTD’s paratransit services. Per the Board of
Directors Recommended Action Item from the March 24, 2020, monthly Board meeting agenda packet,
this was defined as follows:
COMMITMENT TO PARATRANSIT CUSTOMERS
Access-a-Ride is our federally mandated, ADA-compliant, complementary paratransit
service. The service is provided during the same service hours as fixed-route buses and is
offered within ¾ of a mile of fixed-route bus service and within ¾ of a mile from a rail
station.
While we finalize work on the new service deployment for fixed-route service, we are
keenly aware of how any reductions to fixed-route services might impact the ability of our
Access-a-Ride paratransit customers to gain access to service.
RTD is committed to our Access-a-Ride customers, and we understand the best way to
continue to meet the needs of this at-risk population is to grandfather in customers who
might be impacted in those areas where all fixed-route service is eliminated.
Grandfathering, i.e. the continuation of service to existing Access-a-Ride customers in
areas where all fixed-route service is eliminated due to the May service deployment, is
recommended by staff as a solution to this concern. Upon approval of this action by the
Board, staff will work with its Call Center team and software provider to adjust training
and update software to assure that Access-a-Ride paratransit service to those customers
who are grandfathered in is offered at the same levels and in the same areas as those
immediately prior to the May service changes.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 1199

1.F.3

While the Board of Directors approved granting “legacy” status to those customers who were existing
Access-a-Ride customers at the time the May 2020 Changes were approved, in practice, the locations
themselves have continued to remain active. This is inconsistent with what was approved by the Board
of Directors, and staff is seeking Board guidance regarding the path forward.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
When an analysis was completed in September 2020, the estimated financial impact of continuing to
provide service within the “legacy” locations was estimated to be at least $2.8 million annually.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Program Modifications

May 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On November 13, 2024, the General Manager and CEO, in addition to associated staff, presented the
initial findings of the American Public Transportation Association’s (APTA) peer review of RTD’s
paratransit services to include Access-a-Ride (AaR), the agency’s complementary American with
Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service, and RTD’s Access-on-Demand (AoD) premium supplemental
paratransit service, which was commissioned in February 2024.
DISCUSSION
Consideration of this Discussion Item aligns with the Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and
Financial Success.
Phase I proposed recommendations, which were developed leveraging the APTA peer review report,
were presented to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee and to the Board of Directors in
November and December 2024. Subsequently, staff has engaged in additional public outreach and has
considered community feedback offered during the public comment periods during the ensuing
Operations, Safety and Security Committee and Board of Director meetings following the presentation of
the initial recommendations. Based upon this customer feedback and staff analysis, staff is presenting
two revised scenarios and is seeking Board guidance regarding the path forward.
Scenario 1 Revised AoD Modifications
• $6.50 base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
• $20/trip subsidy
• 50 trips/month cap
• Service area and hours align with AaR
Scenario 2 Revised AoD Modifications
• Tiered fare based on number of trips taken
o Up to 30 trips: $4.50 base fare/$2.25 for LiVE eligible customers
o 31-50 trips: $5.50 base fare/$2.75 for LiVE eligible customers

•

o 51-60 trips: 6.50 base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
$20/trip subsidy
60 trips/month cap
Service area and hours align with AaR

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact of the Scenario 1 program modifications contemplated is a
reduction of approximately $6,165,528, or 40.2%, in current yearly AoD program costs of $15.3
million. The overall estimated financial impact of the Scenario 2 program modifications contemplated is a
reduction of approximately $5,043,072, or 32.9%.
