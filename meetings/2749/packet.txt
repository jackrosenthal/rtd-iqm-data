2018 Operating Expense Adjustments
The operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment reflects an
increase of $24.8 million from the 2018 Adopted Budget to $700.4 million. This increment consists of
an increase of $24.5 million on the Base System, a decrease of $2.4 million in FasTracks
Project/Construction, and an increase of $2.7 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $24.5 million increase for the Base System, major elements are $4.1 million for a budget
adjustment from $1.80/gallon to $2.20/gallon for diesel fuel; $1.4 million in bus operations trainee
wages and fringes not included in the adopted budget; $4.9 million in cost increases for fixed route
contractors; a transfer of $0.7 million from the Elati division overhead door project to fund the Platte
division overhead door project; $0.5 million increase in facilities maintenance overtime; net $0.5 million
in total in additional funds for various facilities maintenance projects either not fully funded or not carried
forward from 2017; $0.2 million in additional funds for ISO certification in Asset Management; $0.2
million for cellular data capture for live video on buses; $0.2 million for overtime for security staff; $0.5
million for increase to worker’s comp insurance; $.0.3 million for contracted maintenance on VMWare;
$2.7 million for development changes related for fare structure changes; $0.2 million for SmartCard
spare parts; $0.4 million in increase to Mobile Ticketing fees; $0.8 million to replenish the $5.0 million
contingency fund; and previously approved transfers.
For FasTracks Project, the $2.4 million decrease consists primarily of a $7.0 million reduction to the
SERE betterments budget; offset by a $4.0 million increase to the North Metro betterments budget; $0.2
million in consultant work for TIES due to North Metro expansion; and other miscellaneous items. For
FasTracks Operations, the $2.7 million increase consists mainly of $0.2 million in costs for commuter
rail VMS takeover; and previously approved transfers.
Major changes in Amended Budget operating expenses are summarized by department below (summary
excludes previously approved transfers and expense projects carry-forward unless noted), shown in
detail on the attached Amendment A.

Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget. Debt
principal payments also will not change. This is due to the absence of debt refundings/issuances since
the Adopted Budget. Capitalized interest is expected to show no change. On FasTracks, interest
expense is budgeted to remain unchanged from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not
change. Capitalized interest is expected to remain the same. No new financing will be issued during the
remainder of 2018 for either Base System or FasTracks.
2018 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $188.4 million, consisting of $59.4
million for Base System and $129.0 million for FasTracks. The net increase over the 2018 Adopted
Budget new capital is $0.595 million. These changes result from program changes that have occurred
since the 2018 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.1

Total new capital is $59.4 million for the Base System. New capital changes for Base System result in a
net increase of $0.5 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. Adjustments to new capital
funding from the 2018 Adopted Budget include additional funding of $0.2 million via budget transfers
for projects including Secure Storage Containers, Support/Service Vehicles, and CCTV Retrofit on LRV.
Projects receiving new funding totaling $0.3 million are Laptop Computers for Vehicle Maintenance and
design work for the Mezzanine Addition for Operator Training at Elati. Please see Attachment B for
detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
Total new capital is $129.0 million for FasTracks (Project). New capital changes for FasTracks result in
a net increase of $0.092 million to new capital from the Adopted Budget. This results from updated
project schedules for current projects that changed the projected expenditures in 2018, adjustments for
grant funding, changes in cost estimates, and corrections to the Adopted Budget. Changes to new
capital funding from the 2018 Adopted Budget include $1.0 million in additional expenses for the East
Line and Southeast Rail Extension, offset by reductions in spending of $0.9 million to FasTracks Admin
Projects and the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility. Please see Attachment B for detail and Program
Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2018 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/17 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2018 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/17 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2017.
Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $639.7 million, a decrease of $103.8 million from
the 2018 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2017 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved transfers,
project scope changes, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward amount, the Base System
portion is $81.0 million and the FasTracks portion is $558.7 million. Major capital carryforward projects
are 16th Street Mall Paver Repair, expansion of the Customer Care Telephone Center, East Corridor closeout, and North Metro rail construction. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital
attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $0.6 million on a combined basis from the
2018 Adopted Budget.


Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $3.3 million from the 2018 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School March 2018 forecast. The 2018 Amended Budget
incorporates the baseline forecast of 4.1% over 2017 actual sales/use tax revenue. The 2018

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.1








Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds September Baseline forecast which called for a 4.9%
increase over the then projected 2017 level.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to decline $0.6 million
from amounts in the 2018 Adopted Budget. On the Base System, grant revenue is projected to
decrease $4.2 million in CC&D and FTA funds for the Colfax Avenue planning study, WIN
program funding, CMAQ funding, and Homeland Security grants, offset by increases in capital
maintenance, SOGR, and FASTER grants. For FasTracks, grants are budgeted to increase $3.6
million due to higher carryforward for various grants. Contributed capital (not shown in the table
above) is projected to increase $2.3 million from third-party betterments and project
contributions.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to remain unchanged in the 2018 Amended Budget for both Base
System and FasTracks. We will revise our estimates in the 2019 budget based on more months
of actual data. Of projected fare revenue of $146.8 million, $115.2 million is attributed to the
Base System and $31.6 million is attributed to FasTracks (Operations). Fare revenue is
forecasted on the basis of a fare revenue model being used to estimate and allocate fare revenue
between Base and FasTracks and within FasTracks service corridors, and which takes into
account ridership decline. Using this model, in 2018 a higher proportionate amount of fare
revenue was allocated to Base System and a lower amount was allocated to FasTracks than in
previous periods in which FasTracks fare revenue had been overestimated.
Other operating revenue will remain flat from the 2018 Adopted Budget.
Investment income is budgeted to be $4.4 million higher based on forecasts of rising interest
rates, with $0.5 million of this increase in the Base System and $3.9 million in FasTracks.

Although the primary sources of revenue are budgeted to remain flat, other sources of funding are
anticipated to materialize or have done so to support the budgeted increase in operating expense. These
include: 1) third-party funding, 2) increase to the unrestricted fund balance at year-end 2017 which
becomes the beginning fund balance for 2018, 3) release of unspent funds from closure of capital
projects, and 4) deferral of certain projects scheduled for 2018 to 2019. Capital expenditures (on-going
and carry-forward) in 2018 will be funded by previously issued debt proceeds and previously identified
project funding.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $3.2 million from the
Adopted Budget to $47.5 million reflecting the funding sources described above, net of amended budget
revisions to both revenue and expenses, replenishment of Board-Appropriated fund, and increases to
reserves per fund balance policy.
FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $15.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
is used to fund any changes in the FasTracks schedule that could not be forecast at the time of adoption

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.1

of the annual budget. The purpose of this reserve is to allow the District to accommodate minor
changes to the FasTracks schedule without requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from
the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account is budgeted at $71.5
million. These project reserve balances remain unchanged from the 2018 Adopted Budget.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2018 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2018 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2018 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 to amend and appropriate funds for the proposed 2018
Amended Budget, to increase the appropriation by $28.6 million to $1,329.0 million as detailed
above in the Discussion section overview of the 2018 Amended Budget, and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward (previously approved capital funds) by $103.8 million to
$639.7 million.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2018 Adopted Budget and amend the
budget with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2018 Adopted Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2018 Adopted
Budget does not reflect the necessary capital carryforward adjustments, capital budget adjustments,
and material changes to the operating and administrative budget.

Approval of Selection of Employee to RTD
Salaried Trusts

CFO/AGM,

Date: June 13, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: June 26, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing William Weidenaar to a term expiring
12/31/2020 as a trustee for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Luong (Lou) Ha a Trustee who is a Pension Plan participant has retired from RTD; thereby leaving a
vacancy for an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Benefit (Pension) plan to serve as the same
trustee on both of the Trusts be selected by the Board.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and employee William Weidenaar is
recommended for appointment as a trustee to the Plans.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended: It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee

that the Board of Directors approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing William
Weidenaar to a term expiring 12/31/2020 as a trustee for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e.,
Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.

2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening committee to
return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the committee has reviewed
applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan requirements, consistent with the
goals of existing Board resolutions.

Purpose of Fares
• Fare Revenue is used to offset the cost of operating and
maintaining transit services and facilities
• Fare changes are intended to increase revenue in response
to actual or forecasted increases in operation and
maintenance costs (inflation)
• An objective is to minimize the ridership loss involved in fare
increases
• Operating costs are identified and forecasted through:
• Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
• FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE)

Approach to Ridership & Fare Revenue Modeling
• Ridership & Fare Revenue modeling fundamentally based on expected
customer & organization response to changes in product availability & product
pricing
• Modeling relied on price elasticities to forecast customer response, and assumed
attrition/sign-up rates for organizations
• The Pass Program Working Group (PPWG) recommendation is a comprehensive update to
RTD’s fare product offering. Given the number of changes in product structure and
pricing, it is likely to involve a number of customer groups shifting between products
• For this reason, it is important to recognize that the PPWG recommendation results reflect
these shifts and migration of customers between products; ridership & revenue results for
a single product/fare type may include impacts from changes to other products/fare types

1.C.1.a

Importance of Considering Fare Changes as a Package
• The PPWG recommendation should be reviewed as a package of changes,
given the inter-connectedness of the changes from a modeling/forecasting
perspective.
• Many of the components of the PPWG recommendation are inter-connected from a
modeling and forecasting perspective. Looking at a single product/fare type in isolation
may provide an inaccurate representation of ridership and revenue outcomes
• For example, introduction and growth of the Low Income program is expected to result in
a shift of customers out of the Non-Profit program and general fare products, and is
expected to attract some new customers to RTD services

Importance of Considering Fare Changes as a Package

• The shift to utilization-based pricing for the Eco Business
program has a number of anticipated customer shifts in
behavior
• If the SLA-based price for the businesses increases, some customers are expected to
migrate to FlexPass and general fare products, and some customers are anticipated
to cease using RTD services.
• If the SLA-based price for businesses decrease, the opposite is expected to occur.

• In all four of the examples, General Fare products have been impacted, with some policy
changes resulting in growth and others resulting in declines
• Selecting only individual components of the recommendation would require re-evaluating
the full fare structure and determining impacts on revenue sustainability and ridership

1.C.1.a

Importance of Considering Fare Changes as a Package
• The dedication and effort of the PPWG stakeholder participants should also be
considered
• The PPWG was composed of a broad group of stakeholders from across the Greater
Denver Region, many with interests specific to their constituencies
• Over the course of 12-months, these stakeholders dedicated their time working through
the difficult task of reaching a consensus on how to structure a comprehensive fare
package that would be financially sustainable to RTD, and amenable to the vast majority
of stakeholders
• To reach this consensus, difficult compromises were agreed to. Stakeholders were willing
to forego some discounts (e.g.: Business, Neighborhood Pass Programs) in order to
provide benefits to other groups in the region (e.g.: Young People, Low Income residents)
• Selecting only specific components of the PPWG recommendation risks undermining the
goodwill and consensus building efforts established through the PPWG process

Three Alternatives at a Glance
1. No Increase in the Base Fare
• Doesn’t generate enough revenue to meet fare revenue targets in current SBP/APE
• Insufficient revenue generated by eliminating discounts and transitioning to utilization pricing
for pass programs to introduce additional discount for Youth or Low Income Program

2. Regularly Scheduled Fare Change
• Local One-Way $2.60 to $2.90
• Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.00
• Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.00
• Utilization pricing in Eco/Neco/College

• Maintain Nonprofit Program (Adult &

DISCUSSION
Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus and rail validator installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new buses
and rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 330,330 active cards in circulation. During the month of
May 2018, 1.4M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
public. As of May 2018, approximately 24,500 cards were issued, of which 18,200 (74%) were full
fare cards and 6,300 (26%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases
and reloads) was $39.97, with a total value loaded of $3,228,600. There were nearly 983,000 trips
taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $2,604,300. Of these trips: 78% were
local, 19% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto their MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $20,800 in cash value reloads. As of July
1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since
launch, King Soopers has processed $39,400 in cash value reloads.
On February 23, 2018, the MyRide program was expanded by offering customers the option to get a
new MyRide card and load initial cash value at Safeway locations. Since go-live, Safeway has loaded
324 new MyRide cards, totaling $11,400 in sales. There are active discussions to expand the program
at King Soopers locations.

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize
