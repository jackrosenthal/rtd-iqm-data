BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: May 4, 2018

From:

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel

GM

Date:

May 4, 2018

Board Meeting Date: May 15, 2018

Subject:

Resuming Collection of Marijuana Tax Revenue

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt the attached resolution stating that additional voter
authorization is not required for RTD to resume collection of marijuana sales tax revenue pursuant to
SB18-088.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals as follows:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management (pursuit of financing leading to additional funding).
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability (identify opportunities to enhance revenue; revenues exceeding
forecast).
BACKGROUND AND DISCUSSION
Before the enactment of Senate Bill 17-267, the state levied two sales taxes on retail marijuana sales:
(1) The 2.9% general state sales tax levied pursuant to article 26 of title 39 of the Colorado Revised
Statutes. (2) The retail marijuana sales tax: a 10% special sales tax levied on retail marijuana sales only,
pursuant to article 28.8 of title 39. Senate Bill 17-267 increased the total rate of state sales tax levied
on retail marijuana sales, as authorized by prior voter approval, by exempting retail marijuana sales from
the article 26 2.9% general state sales tax and increasing the rate of the article 28.8 retail marijuana
sales tax so that, without reducing total state sales tax revenue attributable to retail marijuana sales,
only one state sales tax would be levied on such sales. The bill was introduced and passed in the last
days of the 2017 legislative session, and no special districts like RTD and SCFD were asked for fiscal
notes – as they would have been, had anyone anticipated that the bill would affect them.
Because their enabling statutes specify that RTD, the Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD),
and health services districts (HSDs) may levy sales tax only on transactions upon which the state levies
sales tax “pursuant to the provisions of article 26 of title 29, C.R.S.,” the exemption of retail marijuana
sales from the article 26 general state sales tax inadvertently exempted such sales from RTD, SCFD, and
HSD sales taxes, even though the state continued throughout to levy sales tax on marijuana sales. In
addition, because some other special districts and authorities had laws allowing them to collect sales
taxes only upon transactions upon which the state levies sales tax, without specifically referencing
article 26, Senate Bill 17-267 made it unclear whether such entities could continue to levy sales taxes
on retail marijuana sales.
To correct these unintended consequences and allow RTD, SCFD and HSDs to resume collection of
marijuana tax revenues, a bipartisan coalition of 23 Senators and 35 Representatives (Senators Gardner,
Aguilar, Coram, Court, Crowder, Donovan, Fenberg, Fields, Garcia, Grantham, Guzman, Jahn, Jones,
Kagan, Kefalas, Kerr, Martinez Humenik, Merrifield, Priola, Todd, Williams A., Zenzinger, and Moreno;
and Representatives Becker K., Arndt, Bridges, Buckner, Coleman, Duran, Esgar, Exum, Foote, Garnett,
Gray, Hamner, Hansen, Herod, Hooton, Kennedy, Lawrence, Lee, Lontine, Melton, Michaelson Jenet,
Pabon, Pettersen, Rankin, Roberts, Rosenthal, Salazar, Singer, Thurlow, Weissman, Young, Benavidez,
Ginal, Kraft-Tharp, and McLachlan) approved Senate Bill 18-088, which was signed into law on February
22, 2018.

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.A

Senate Bill 18-088 acknowledged the 2017 bill’s “inadvertent and unintended” exemption of marijuana
sales tax revenue from RTD, SCFD, and the HSDs, noting that the exemption was “inconsistent with
prior voter approval to levy broad general sales taxes obtained by” RTD, SCFD, and other entities that
had formerly been collecting marijuana tax revenues. The 2018 bill stated that it was “curative and
remedial legislation to correct an oversight in Senate Bill 17-267 and ensure that the original intent of
the general assembly in enacting Senate Bill 17-267” was honored, and that RTD, SCFD and the other
entities “be able to continue to levy sales taxes on retail marijuana sales on and after July 1, 2017, is
realized …”
The General Assembly further found, as stated in the text of the bill, that the 2018 corrective bill was
“consistent with existing state tax policy and prior voter approval to levy broad general sales taxes
obtained by” RTD, SCFD, and the other affected districts, and “to clarify that retail marijuana sales
remain subject to sales taxes levied by the affected special districts … so long as the continued levying
and collection of [such] taxes … complies with the requirements of the Colorado constitution and
applicable decisions of the Colorado supreme court and Colorado court of appeals.”
The bill therefore amended article 26 to clarify that RTD, SCFD and any other entity that had previously
been collecting marijuana sales tax under article 26 “retains its authority to continue levying sales tax
upon retail sales of marijuana under this article 26.”
Finally, the bill stated that “the governing body” of RTD, SCFD, and each other district for which the bill
was correcting this inadvertent and unintended exemption “shall determine whether the levying of such
sales tax complies with the Colorado constitution and applicable decisions of the Colorado supreme
court and Colorado court of appeals and, if the governing body of any such [district] determines that
additional voter approval is required to levy sales tax upon retail sales of marijuana, the [district] shall
not resume levying sales tax upon such sales until voter approval is obtained.”
The 2018 curative bill was enacted with this unusual provision because, at the time the General
Assembly was considering Senate Bill 18-088, the Colorado Supreme Court had before it a lawsuit
against RTD and SCFD challenging the ability of the General Assembly to make changes to the tax laws
without voter approval if such changes caused even incidental and minor increases in tax revenues. The
undersigned advised the Board that it would be prudent for the Board to await the outcome of that
lawsuit before making the above-required determination as to the need for additional voter approval.
The Colorado Supreme Court has now spoken, in its unanimous April 23, 2018 decision in TABOR
Foundation v. RTD, et al., 2018 CO 29. In that opinion, the Supreme Court for the first time considered
what the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) means when it requires a “new tax” or a “tax policy change
directly causing a net tax revenue gain” to go to the voters for approval. While the facts before the
Supreme Court were different, the Supreme Court supported the conclusion that where voter approval
had previously been obtained to collect sales tax, a bill like SB18-088 – which states that a district
“retains the authority” to “continue” levying a sales tax and that sales “remain subject to” such taxes,
and which corrects an indisputably inadvertent and unintended exemption from such taxes – does not
create a “new tax” or a “tax policy change” so as to force the entities to return to the voters to once
again get approval that the voters had already granted.
Simply put, the Supreme Court stated that the word “new” in “new tax” suggests “creation, not
alteration,” and cited the dictionary definition of “new” as “never existing before” and “appeis aring …
for the first time.” Thus, a bill that fixes a mistake to allow resumed collection of a tax for which prior
voter approval had been obtained is not a “new” tax: the tax existed before.

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.A

Likewise, the Supreme Court noted that “tax policy change” “contains ‘policy,’ which, in this context,
suggests a significant change: It means ‘a principle, plan, or course of action.’ … [C]onstruing ‘tax policy
change’ to encompass any tax change would render the word ‘policy’ superfluous.”
The Supreme Court also noted TABOR’s “central concern: constraining tax hikes.” Finally, the Supreme
Court noted that RTD’s voters had already approved “a broadly worded and unqualified sales tax” for
RTD.
Considering all of the above factors, plus the fact that the voters had approved the marijuana taxes at
issue, voter approval is not required to correct the inadvertent mistake and resume direction of marijuana
sales tax revenue to RTD. Where the voters had previously stated that an authority like RTD should
receive tax revenue, an inadvertent suspension of such existing – not “new” – taxes due to a legislative
mistake – not a conscious principle – shouldn’t thwart that prior voter decision and require the voters to
go back and re-state what they had already decided was right.
If there is any doubt in this matter, the Supreme Court also noted that TABOR is to be viewed through a
“lens of reasonableness,” and that “We have consistently declined to adopt interpretations of [TABOR]
that would unreasonably curtail the everyday functions of government.” There is additional appellate
case law supporting the ability of the legislature to correct a mistake without such correction creating a
“new tax” or constituting a “tax policy change.” Under these circumstances it would be unreasonable
and expensive to require RTD to have to hold a new election to resume receiving marijuana tax revenue.
Everything in the TABOR Foundation decision supports the conclusion that additional voter approval is
not required for RTD to resume receiving sales tax revenue from retail marijuana sales.
SCFD’s governing body has already unanimously determined that additional voter approval is not
required for SCFD to resume levying the tax.
The Colorado Department of Revenue has advised RTD and SCFD that because SCFD’s and RTD’s
boundaries are contiguous, it will not resume collection of marijuana tax revenues for either district until
both of them determine that no additional voter approval is required (or, if one or both determine
additional voter approval is needed, such approval is obtained). DOR only makes changes to its tax
collection twice a year, on July 1 and January 1, and requires 45 days’ advance approval by a district
for such changes. Thus, if RTD wants marijuana tax revenues to resume effective July 1, RTD has only
until May 17 to notify DOR.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the attached resolution on or before May 17, 2018, will allow RTD to timely notify the
Department of Revenue of the determination by RTD’s governing body, which will in turn allow DOR to
resume collection of the tax effective July 1. It is estimated that this tax contributes approximately
$600,000 per month, or over $7 million per year, to RTD’s revenues. If approval is delayed beyond May
17, RTD will lose approximately $3.5 million more, on top of the $7 million or so in revenue that RTD
has lost since SB17-267 was enacted.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and adopt the attached resolution. This will allow RTD to
resume receiving marijuana sales tax revenues after July 1.
2. Postpone consideration of the Recommended Action. This is not recommended due to the May
17, 2018 deadline to notify DOR. Any postponement will result in loss of at least $3.5 million in
tax revenues.

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.A

3. Reject the Recommended Action and determine that resumption of tax collection without
additional voter approval does not comply with the Colorado Constitution and applicable decisions
of the Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado Court of Appeals. This is not recommended,
because the Colorado Constitution and applicable decisions of the Colorado Supreme Court and
Colorado Court of Appeals indicate that additional voter approval is not required to comply with
the Colorado Constitution and applicable decisions of the Colorado Supreme Court and Colorado
Court of Appeals.
(Note: The above Recommended Action and accompanying Resolution does not contain an exhaustive listing or analysis of all of
the reasons that voter approval is not required of RTD. The above also: (1) is not intended to convey or constitute legal advice
to any person or entity other than RTD through its collective Board of Directors; (2) does not create an attorney-client
relationship with any other person or entity; and (3) does not waive the attorney-client privilege.)

WHEREAS, before July 1, 2017, the District Sales Tax was levied upon retail sales of
marijuana; and
WHEREAS, both before and after July 1, 2017, and now and continuing, a sales tax on
the retail sales of marijuana has at all relevant times been taxed by the state; and
WHEREAS, in the text of SB18-088, the Colorado General Assembly noted that:
exempting marijuana sales tax revenue from levy by RTD and other affected special districts and
limited purpose governmental entities was inconsistent with prior voter approval to levy broad
general sales taxes obtained by RTD and such other entities; that SB18-088 was curative and
remedial to correct an oversight in SB17-267 and ensure that the original intent of the General
Assembly in enacting SB17-267 was honored; that SB18-088 was consistent with existing state
tax policy and prior voter approval to levy broad general sales taxes obtained by RTD and such
other entities; that SB18-088 was meant to clarify that retail marijuana sales remain subject to
such taxes; and that RTD and such other entities that had previously been collecting marijuana
sales tax under article 26 retained their authority to continue levying sales tax upon retail sales of
marijuana under article 26; and
WHEREAS, under applicable decisions of the Colorado Court of Appeals and the

TABOR Found. v. Reg’l Transportation Dist., 2018 CO 29 (Colo. 2018) (the “RTD Supreme
Court Decision”), the District’s authority to levy the District Sales Tax under Section 32-9119(2)(a), C.R.S. and the voter approval obtained at the above elections, the District has received

while entities must have voter approval in advance for a “new tax” or “tax policy change,” the
Court cited the definition of “new” as “never existing before; appearing, thought of, developed,
made, produced, etc. for the first time,” and noted that “policy” suggests a significant change – a
principle, plan, or course of action; and
WHEREAS, SB 18-088 did not create a new tax on the retail sales of marijuana that had
never existed before or that was appearing for the first time, and was not creating a significant
changed principle or course of action, but instead corrected an inadvertent and unintended error
by expressly authorizing the resumption of taxation of retail sales of marijuana that had
previously been taxed by the District before July 1, 2017; and
WHEREAS, the above is not an exhaustive listing of all of the reasons that voter
approval is not required for RTD to resume taxation of retail sales of marijuana; and

From:

Date:

Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2018

Subject:

Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and
Budget Transfer due to Operator Wage
Increases

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase contract authority for the following fixedroute contracts: First Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract
#14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27”
(contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases
over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to $6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these services are rebid.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018
Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased costs
incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00
 Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00
This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services; Task Goal #1, Fiscal
Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and Human Capital.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two companies to provide fixed-route service. These two companies
are First Transit and Transdev. They operate under the terms of four (4) separate contracts, each of

Packet Pg. 11

2.B.1

which is for a three (3) year term with two (2) one-year options. Collectively, these contractors
provide approximately 45% of RTD’s fixed-route bus service.
First Transit provides service under three contracts:
 “Group 24” (“First Transit Commerce City”) which is operated out of the First Transit
Commerce City location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was
implemented on 8/17/14. This contract provides approximately 334,700 revenue hours of
service per year.
 “Group 26” (“First Transit Longmont”) which is operated out of the First Transit Longmont
location. This contract includes local service in Boulder and Longmont and was implemented
on 1/3/16. This contract provides approximately 189,400 hours of service per year.
 “Group 27” (“First Transit Denver”) which is operated out of the First Transit Denver location.
This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on 5/13/17. This
contract provides approximately 344,600 hours of service per year.
Transdev provides service under one contract:
 “Group 25” (“Transdev Englewood”) which is operated out of the Transdev Englewood
location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on
1/4/15. This contract provides approximately 339,700 hours of service per year.
DISCUSSION:
Historically, the starting wages paid for operators by the private contractors have been approximately
$1.00 per hour less than the starting wage for bus operators for RTD. In February of 2018, RTD renegotiated its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and
increased the starting wage for bus and rail operators from $17.59 to $19.40 per hour. The starting
wages for bus operators for the private contractors are currently as follows:
First Transit Commerce City (Group 24)
Transdev (Group 25)
First Transit Longmont (Group 26)
First Transit Denver (Group 27)

$15.38 per hour
$15.71 per hour
$15.43 per hour
$15.43 per hour

Due to the low unemployment rate in Colorado and the highly competitive labor market, there is
concern that the disparity in operator starting wages between the private contractors and RTD will
entice a high number of bus operators at the private contractor operations to “jump ship” – to quit
their jobs and apply for jobs with RTD. As a result, our contract partners will lose employees and be
unable to meet their service commitments to RTD and our customers. This will result in dropped
service for our customers and a decrease in reliability, one of the primary determinants of transit
ridership. In order to mitigate a large-scale migration, it is recommended that RTD renegotiate the
existing Contract Agreements with First Transit and Transdev so that private contractor operator
wages can be adjusted to a more competitive amount relative to the new starting wage for RTD
operators and the local Denver labor market for drivers.
After extensive conversations with First Transit and Transdev, the parties have mutually agreed that
adjustments to the starting wage for First Transit and Transdev bus operators would be appropriate
given the current market conditions and the result of RTD’s contract negotiations and that the
adjusted starting wages for the private contractors should be between $18.00 and $18.50.
In addition to the adjustment to starting wages, it will also be necessary to adjust the wage scales
for existing operators as well. Wages for operator trainers, dispatchers and street supervisors will

Packet Pg. 12

2.B.1

also be increased as wages for these positions are typically determined based on an operator wage
plus a stated per-hour increase (eg.- the operator wage plus $1.00 per hour).
The proposed Board action will provide the necessary increases in contract authority to cover the
increases in wage costs from a proposed effective date of April 1, 2018, through the end date of the
existing contracts. Language will be included in the contract amendments to ensure that ALL of the
increased compensation resulting from this action will go towards the agreed upon wage increases
for drivers and related positions and that none of the increased compensation will go towards
corporate overhead and/or profit.
The projected timelines for rebidding the First Transit and Transdev contracts are as follows:
First Transit “Group 24” – expires August, 2019 – to be rebid in 2018
Transdev “Group 25” – expires January, 2020 – to be rebid in 2019
First Transit “Group 26” – expires January, 2021 – to be rebid in 2020
First Transit “Group 27” – expires May, 2022 – to be rebid in 2021
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The total cost of the private contractor wage increases for 2018 is $4,998,797.00. It is
recommended that RTD transfer funds from the 2018 Board-appropriated reserve, to the above
referenced contracts, to cover the cost. The Board-appropriated reserve will be replenished in the
2018 Amended Budget. Funds for subsequent years will be included in the new 2019-2024 Midterm Financial Plan (previously known as the SBP) and in the requested budgets for those years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1) Increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts: First Transit “Group 24”
(contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract #14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26”
(contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to$6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these contracts are re-bid.
In addition, authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the
2018 Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00

Packet Pg. 13

2.B.1



Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00

2) Do not increase contract authority for cost adjustments to the fixed-route contracts or authorize
budget transfers to cover the increased costs associated with wage adjustments for private
contractor bus operators and related positions. This course of action is not recommended, as it
may prompt a mass exodus of employees from the private contractors and further increase our
collective inability to meet service requirements and the expectations of our customers.

What Caused the Problems?
u The OCC assumed the initial power problem on train 4045/46

was due to a train-related fault
u The Traction Power System (overhead catenary system) did

not experience any faults and indicated a normal state at the
OCC
u The overhead wires were intact and the traction power

system remained energized, however a piece of the
hardware assembly supporting the OCS had failed
u The “steady arm” component of the cantilever beam

supporting the OCS fractured
u The free swinging steady arm made contact with the passing

trains and broke the shear pins supporting the trains’
pantographs causing the trains to lose contact with the
overhead wire and lose power

Communications With Passengers
u RTD has expressed major concerns about our

communication with our customers and RTD
u The criticism is well founded
u Communications directly with passengers on the failed

trains, with other passengers on the line, and with RTD
was disjointed, unreliable, and inaccurate at times
u Despite considerable efforts by DTO staff

uCommunication Systems were not used effectively
uEfforts were confused with results (many messages were
made – but often proved unreliable due to the lack of
specifics or changing circumstances)
uOur passengers were just not well informed – neither was
RTD

Why Did These Events Lead to a Major Disruption?
u During initial stages, the OCC failed to accurately

assess the cause and magnitude of the problem
u Attempts to couple the first disabled train were

complicated by extreme weather conditions and a steep
grade
u Severe weather affected decisions that may have led to

evacuating passengers on to the right-of-way
u Trains were stranded at least 4 miles from the closest

station
u Inexperience - DTO personnel have not encountered

this type of incident before
10

Attachment: RTD Board of Directors 4-20 Incident Presentation (3470 : University of Colorado A Line

2.C.1.a

Lessons Learned for DTO Operations
u Treat all disabled trains between stations as a potential

emergency – understand the potential for a prolonged
event
u Operational tactics need review – focus on taking care

of the passengers first – moving the train is secondary
u Limit the time passengers are stranded before

evacuation is ordered. FRA and RTDC view evacuation
to the ground as a last option.
u Review SOPs and the EPREP

– plug gaps

u Training for operations personnel needs to be re-

examined especially procedures and preparation for
dealing with abnormal circumstances

Lessons Learned About DTO Communications
u OCC communication systems were not used effectively
u Customers received inconsistent and unreliable

information
u The OCC was slow to realize the magnitude of the

problems and, as a result, important information flow
was compromised
u Reliable descriptions of the service impacts were not

conveyed to RTD via the ReadyOps Notification system
u DTO did not supplement the OCC with additional

customer service staff until well into the emergency
u On-board and station announcements were not used

effectively

Lessons Learned About Communications (cont’d)
u Quality matters not just quantity
u During emergencies, staff the OCC with additional

communications staff
u Utilize existing systems and technology better

uThe OCC could have communicated directly with
passengers on-board the disabled trains – it did not
uReadyOps messaging was too generic – notifications
require specifics
uStation public address and variable messaging systems
were underutilized
u Review reliance on ReadyOps notification system
u Automated communications are not enough

Re:

Service Availability - April 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 98.7% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in April 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase from
181.61 hours in April 2017 to 1883.01 hours for the month of April 2018. The year to date
numbers show an increase as well from 1033.46 in April 2017 to 5,099.3 hours in 2018.
While RTD did provide in excess of 98.7% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 2707 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their schedule
days off). This represents approximately 21,656 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Contributing to our service challenges in April were multiple bus bridges and special
events. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address
ways to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

May 10, 2018

Subject:

2017 CAFR and Report to Governance

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: May 10, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.
GM CORE AND TASK GOALS MET
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1: Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. RTD is also required
to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government organizations to
be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual documents. The
accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2017 audit. In addition to the requirements set forth
in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of
1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
As stated in the auditor’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of RTD as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the 2017 and
2016 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the
year ended December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2017 as prepared by staff and audited by RTD’s independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources, such as rating
agencies and other legal covenants, require RTD to enter annual audited financial statements into
the record.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
Denver, Colorado
In accordance with Colorado statutes and Regional Transportation District (RTD) bylaws, the enclosed Comprehensive Annual Financial
Report of the Regional Transportation District as of December 31, 2017, has been compiled. Responsibility for the accuracy of the
presented data and the completeness and fairness of the presentation, including all disclosures, rests with RTD. Management believes
the data, as presented, fairly sets forth the financial position and operating results of RTD. Disclosures necessary to enable the reader
to gain the maximum understanding of the financial affairs of RTD have been included.
In developing and evaluating RTD’s accounting system, consideration has been given to the adequacy of internal accounting controls.
These controls are discussed by the Chief Financial Officer in the Letter of Transmittal. Within that framework, we believe RTD’s
internal accounting controls adequately safeguard assets and provide reasonable assurance of the proper recording of financial
transactions.
This report has been prepared according to the guidelines recommended by the Government Finance Officers Association of the United
States and Canada. In accordance with these guidelines, the accompanying report is presented in three parts:
1.

Introductory Section, including the Chief Financial Officer’s Letter of Transmittal.

2.

Financial Section containing the independent auditor’s report, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the financial
statements, notes thereto and supplemental information.

3.

Statistical Section, including selected tables of unaudited data depicting the financial history of RTD, demographics, and
other miscellaneous information.

Colorado law requires the governing bodies of local governments to have an independent audit of RTD’s financial statements
performed. RTD has complied with this requirement and has included the report of the independent auditors in the Financial Section
of this report.
Preparation of this Comprehensive Annual Financial Report could not have been accomplished without the dedicated efforts of the
entire financial staff. Should you have any questions or comments, please contact Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer.
Respectfully submitted,
Doug Tisdale
Chair, Executive Committee

May 8, 2018
Mr. Doug Tisdale
Chair, Executive Committee
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the close of each fiscal year a
complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and
audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant
to that requirement, we hereby issue the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District (RTD)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning the finances of RTD. Consequently, management assumes
full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable
basis for making these representations, management of RTD has established a comprehensive internal control framework that
is designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable information
for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Because the cost of internal controls should not
outweigh their benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather
than absolute assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As management, we assert that,
to the best of our knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by RubinBrown, LLP, a firm of licensed certified public accountants. The goal of
the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2017, are free of material misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. The independent auditor
concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally mandated “Single Audit” designed to
meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent
auditor to report not only on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and legal requirements involving
the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s separately issued Single Audit Report.
GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to accompany the basic financial
statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement
the MD&A and should be read in conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transit service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the Colorado General Assembly (Assembly)
found that public transit was a necessary part of the growing Denver Metropolitan Region. The Assembly found that public

3.B.1.a

RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of Broomfield, and portions
of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 2.92 million people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a fifteen-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents to serve four-year terms
to govern RTD. There are approximately 180,000 residents per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for
setting policy, overseeing the agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
RTD employs over 2,779 men and women, making it one of the largest employers in the eight county areas. In addition, RTD
contracts with private carriers to provide access-a-ride, fixed route and commuter rail services employing over 2,058 men and
women. Besides its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding purchased
transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood, and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all of the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities of its component unit,
the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation established to facilitate RTD’s use of
lease/purchase financing.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions embodied in the annual
appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning,
administration, development, debt service, and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which
expenditures cannot legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All departments of RTD are required to
submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager uses
these requests as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager then presents this proposed budget
to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the
proposed budget and to adopt a final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as stated in the adopted
appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for capital projects not completed, for a period not to
exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager to approve certain line-item transfers within the budget. Budget-to-actual
comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is considered in the broader
perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most populated area of the state and
the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies
represent a diverse mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic balance
in employment centers.

sector involvement was the best method to ensure the continuation of this vital component. Thus, the Regional Transportation
District was created as a political subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public
mass transportation system for the benefit of the District.”

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a Constitutional Amendment (the “Amendment”) that limits taxes,
revenue, and spending for state and local governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the
District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the
Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of the Southeast and Southwest light rail
lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to
1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted
the District from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the
increased tax revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program.
At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate
the transit system financed through FasTracks.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), which is the six-year operating
and capital improvement plan of RTD excluding FasTracks. Historically, FasTracks has been excluded from the SBP because
the program was primarily for capital expansion. In addition, the Board of Directors adopts a financially constrained Annual
Program Evaluation (APE), (which is a six-year operating and capital improvement plan that includes the FasTracks
program). The SBP and APE are components of the long-term transportation planning program for the Denver metropolitan
area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG). As the FasTracks program continues to transition
from capital expansion to operations, RTD will migrate the SBP and APE into a single short, medium and long-term Financial
Plan which will include the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the development
of RTD’s annual budget.
The long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing activities and to optimize
those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that assets
are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: (1) the costs of a
control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and (2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and
judgment by management.

The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2018 report forecasts that the economy is expected to grow at a more
moderate pace; demographic change, growing inflationary pressures and rising interest rates will slow consumer spending.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators:

3.B.1.a

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control structure, including that portion
related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2017 found no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant
violations of applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as necessary due to modification.
The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments, expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting,
accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly manage its assets and liabilities.
Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes
financing capital projects beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has a dual rating for its 1.0% sales tax credit. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax
credit as “Aa1”, Standard and Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AAA” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit
“AA” that are secured by the 0.6% sales tax. Moody’s Investors Service rates the sales tax credit as “Aa2”, Standard and
Poor’s Corporation rates the sales tax credit “AA+” and Fitch Ratings rates the sales tax credit “AA” that are secured by the
0.4% sales tax.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection of investment principal while
providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes
in eligible investments, benchmarks, and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities,
agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed
securities. The total average return on investments for the year was 1.4%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets and
control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile and general liability. RTD is self-insured for liability, the
limits of which are $387,000 per person and $1,093,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental
Immunity statute. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts
above this covered by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide property coverage up to $1,663,245,896 for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock
(other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy and Faithful Performance Bond; a $3,500,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond;
Felonious Assault Policy; travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fidelity coverage on the Trustees of the Union
Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health and Welfare Union Trust, Legal Trust, and the employees
administering the health benefits program for salaried employees. With the growth of Light Rail Transit (LRT) services, RTD
has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies that provide coverage when required under
operational needs.
The Risk Management Division coordinates these programs internally for RTD.

Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an adequate internal control structure
is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to those programs. This internal control
structure is subject to periodic evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.

3.B.1.a

Independent Audit: State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The accounting firm
of RubinBrown LLP was selected to perform the 2017 audit. This audit also was designated to meet the requirements of the
Federal Single Audit 2 CFR 200.501, Uniform Grant Guidance and related 2 CFR 200, Uniform Grant Guidance – Uniform
Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit Requirements. The auditor’s report on the financial statements and
schedules are included in the Financial Section of this report. The auditor’s report related specifically to the single audit is
included in a separate report.
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in
Financial Reporting to RTD for its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This
is the twenty-fifth consecutive year that RTD has been awarded this prestigious award.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish an easily readable
and efficiently organized Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the contents of which must conform to program standards.
This report must also satisfy both GAAP and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. We believe our current Comprehensive Annual Financial Report meets
the program’s requirements and will be submitting it to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Preparation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report on a timely basis was made possible by the
dedicated services of the entire staff of the Finance Division. Each member of the division has our sincere appreciation for the
contributions made in the preparation of this report.
Finally, without the leadership and support of the members of the RTD’s Board of Directors, preparation of this report would
not have been possible.
Sincerely,
Heather McKillop
Chief Financial Officer

Report On The Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the
related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise RTD’s basic
financial statements as listed in the table of contents.
Management’s Responsibility For The Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors’ Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from
material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk
assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation
and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no
such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Independent Auditors’ Report

3.B.1.a

Opinion
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of RTD as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the
changes in its financial position and its cash flows for the years then ended in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that
the management’s discussion and analysis and pension plan summary information on
pages 23 through 35 and 87 through 90, respectively, be presented to supplement the
basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the basic financial
statements, is required by Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which considers
it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements
in an appropriate operational, economic or historical context. We have applied certain
limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with
auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted
of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management’s responses to our
inquiries, the basic financial statements and other knowledge we obtained during our
audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any
assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with
sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Supplementary And Other Information
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the financial
statements that collectively comprise RTD’s basic financial statements. The
accompanying budgetary information, introductory section and statistical section are
presented for purposes of additional analysis and are not a required part of the basic
financial statements.

3.B.1.a

The budgetary information is the responsibility of management and was derived from
and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the
basic financial statements. Such information has been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements
or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other additional procedures in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America.
In our opinion, the budgetary information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the financial statements as a whole.
The introductory and statistical sections have not been subjected to the auditing
procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements, and accordingly, we do
not express an opinion or provide any assurance on them.
Other Reporting Required By Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated May 8, 2018 on our consideration of RTD’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,
contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that report is to
describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and
compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on internal
control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an
audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering
RTD’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of our financial statements this narrative overview and analysis
of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader
to focus on significant financial activities and identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars.
Key Reporting Implementations
In fiscal year 2016 RTD implemented the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 72, Fair Value
Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is to enhance the comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures to provide
comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Financial Highlights
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total liabilities and deferred inflows
of resources by $3,413,509 and $3,322,352 respectively. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2017 was
$(223,204) compared to $(214,479) in 2016. RTD’s unrestricted net position was negatively impacted by the implementation of GASB
Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68). GASB 68 required RTD to record the amount of unfunded
pension liabilities. More information on the pension plans is available in the Notes.
The net position of RTD increased by $91,157 during the current year compared to an increase of $145,414 in the previous year. The
increase for 2017 and 2016 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax and grant revenues, net of increases in operating
expenses and non-operating expenses which resulted from an improving economy combined with revenue enhancement and expense
reduction initiatives undertaken by RTD.
RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues increased $34,589 (6.1%) in 2017 and
increased $22,080 (4.1%) in the previous year. In 2017 and 2016, The District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased
consumer and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth of 1.4% and 1.6%, low unemployment
of 2.8% and 3.3% as well as growth in personal income of 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively.
For 2017, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue and expenses of $683,158
compared to a loss of $641,186 for 2016. The increase in operating loss for 2017 was mostly due to FasTracks launch of A and B line
depreciating assets for a full year and betterments for the North Metro and South Corridor Extension build-outs. The increase in operating
loss for 2016 was mostly due to the FasTracks launch of the University of Colorado A line and B line commuter rail, purchased transportation
service. RTD anticipates operating losses, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $93,317 (2.6%) and increased $165,289 (4.8%) in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Debt decreased in 2017 due
to the refunding and partial extinguishment of the DUSPA bonds. Debt increased in 2016 due to issuance of the 2016A FasTracks Sales
Tax Bonds for the purpose of funding additional FasTracks projects.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $115,840 (57.3%) in 2017 and increased $32,922 (19.4%) in the previous year. The
decrease in 2017 occurred as a result of Eagle P3 project construction being in final phase of completion. The increase in 2016 was a result
of RTD securing a small starts grant for the Southeast Rail Extension, construction of the Civic Center Station and betterments for the I225 corridor.

RTD’s capital assets, excluding depreciation, increased $420,558 in 2017 and increased $634,633 in 2016. The increase in both 2017 and
2016 was primarily due to the build-out of the FasTracks project.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s financial statements are
prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses the same basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises.
Under this method of accounting, an economic resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting is used. Revenue is recorded
when earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements of revenues, expenses and
changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial statements.
The statements of net position presents information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of
resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve
as a useful indicator of whether the financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and
changes in net position presents information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and expenses of RTD for the
fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital grants and local contributions to determine the change in
net position for the year. That change combined with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end
of the current fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the changes occurs,
regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows reports cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from operating activities, capital, and
related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and investing activities. The result of these activities added to the
beginning of the year cash balance reconciles to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements
of cash flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the following: RTD’s ability
to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and
operating income (loss); and the effect of investing, capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the data provided in the statements
of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, and light rail service in a 2,342 square mile area in and around Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are
supported by a 0.6% and 0.4% sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services in the Denver area. The 0.4%
sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for
enhanced transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance,
investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.
Financial Analysis
Condensed Financial Information - Condensed financial information from the statements of net position and statements of revenues,
expenses, and changes in net position is presented below.
Statements of Net Position – As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded
total liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,413,509 and $3,322,352, respectively. The largest portion of this excess, in 2017
and in 2016, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these capital assets to provide public transportation services to
customers; consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although RTD’s investment in capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that funding required to repay this debt will be obtained from other sources such as sales and use tax, since

the capital assets themselves cannot be used to pay the related debt. The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2017
was $(223,204) compared to $(214,479) in 2016. Substantially all of the unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has
been appropriated or reserved by the RTD Board for future capital acquisition and reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation during
the budget process. The deficit balance in Unrestricted Net Position includes an allowance for a Net Pension Liability of $330,955 in 2017
for the represented employee defined benefit pension plan (see Note I). RTD has recognized this liability in its financial statements in
accordance with GASB Statement 68; however, RTD is current in making all required contributions under the collective bargaining
agreement.

In 2017, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation increased $202,016 (3.1%) for acquisition of revenue equipment, buildings, land,
and construction in progress for the projects in the FasTracks program.
Current liabilities increased $16,940 (7.1%) in 2017 primarily due to higher volume of Ecopass 2018 contracts processed at end of year
resulting in recording of unearned revenue.
Noncurrent liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $43,877 (1.0%) in 2017 primarily due to change in the Net Pension Liability recognition
of deferred resources as require by GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions, and GASB Statement 71,
Pension Transition for Contributions Made Subsequent to the Measurement Date.
The net position of RTD increased by $91,157 during the current year compared to an increase of $145,414 in the previous year. The
increase in 2017 and 2016 was due to higher operating revenues, sales and use tax collection increases a one-time gain recognized for a
bond refunding, net of increases in operating expenses and non-operating expenses.

3.B.1.a

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 14.2% and 13.4% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly
and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by
$5,595 (4.2%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $14,092 (11.7%) in 2016. Passenger fares changes in 2017 were minimal. The increase
in 2016 was due to new fare boundaries and pricing, in addition to the launch of the University of Colorado A line commuter rail services.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.7% and 0.6% of total revenues in both 2017 and 2016; this includes
revenues from advertisements primarily on RTD’s buses and external wraps on light rail vehicles. Advertising and other income increased
$1,356 (23.4%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $456 (8.5%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 and prior year was due an increase in
advertising revenue related to a stronger economy, new rail lines and revenue for lease and naming rights.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 60.4% and 56.0% of RTD’s total revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Sales and use
tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service area. Sales and use tax increased $34,589 (6.1%) in 2017 compared
to an increase of $22,080 (4.1%) in 2016. In 2017 and 2016, the District experienced growth in tax revenues due to increased consumer
and business-spending activity as the District continues to experience population growth of 1.4% and 1.6%, low unemployment of 2.8%
and 3.3% as well as growth in personal income of 3.8% and 1.9%, respectively.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 8.1% and 7.7% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016. Grant operating
assistance increased $3,077 (4.0%) in 2017compared to an increase of $3,952 (5.4%) in 2016. The operating assistance is a federal grant
revenue program used to perform capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The increase
in both 2017 and 2016 is the result of grant funding sources being available during the year.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 6.4% and 0.6% of total revenues in 2017and 2016. Investment income increased
$56,659 (889.3%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $3,207 (101.4%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 was due to the gain from
extinguishment of DUSPA Bonds. The increase in 2016 was due to fixed securities getting better yields.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.5% and 1.6% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016. Other income
decreased $973 (6.2%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $4,184 (36.7%) in 2016. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental
income from retail space, parking, and miscellaneous other items. The decrease in 2017 was due to reduction of asset sales, which was
primarily attributable to the sale of three Fort Lupton parcels sold in 2016.

Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 8.7% and 20.1% of total revenues in 2017 and
2016. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $115,840 (57.3%) in 2017 and increased $32,922 (19.4%) in the previous year.
The decrease in 2017 was a result of lower capital contributions related to completion of major construction projects. The increase in 2016
was a result of RTD securing a small starts grant for the Southeast Rail Extension, construction of the Civic Center Station and betterments
for the I-225 corridor.

Salaries and wages–Salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting for 19.2% and 19.0% of the total RTD expenses
in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $8,885 (5.4%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $12,842
(8.5%) in 2016. Increases in both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based) and progression increases, and additional
service provided with the openings of new rail lines.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 10.2% and 11.2% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Fringe benefits decreased by $4,947
(5.1%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $19,990 (26.2%) in 2016. The fluctuations for both 2017 and 2016 is primarily due to
implementation GASB Statement Nos. 68 and 71 establish standards for measuring and recognizing net pension liabilities.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 5.0% and 6.1% of the total expenses in 2017 and
2016 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $7,494 (14.4%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $6,704 (11.4%) in
2016. The decrease in both years is primarily due to a decrease in diesel/gasoline fuel prices.
Services – Services expense accounted for 8.6% and 6.8% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Services expense includes contracted
services such as security services; vehicle, equipment and right of way maintenance services; advertising and marketing services, and legal
services. Services expense increased $18,763 (32.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $21,189 (26.6%) in 2016. The increase in 2017
was primarily due to contract services for betterments for North Metro Rail and South East Extension projects. The decrease in 2016 was
primarily due to the contract service deduction for Westminster Station IGA and U.S. 36 managed lane project (Phase I).
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.8% and 1.7% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Utilities expense includes electric,
telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities. Utilities expense increased $2,283 (16.1%) in 2017 compared to an
increase of $547 (4.0%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 and 2016 occurred primarily due to traction power costs due to the opening of the
University of Colorado A line and the B Line commuter rail.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.5% and 1.2% of total expenses in 2017 and 2016. Insurance expense includes RTD’s self-insured
cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims. In addition, RTD purchased insurance in its efforts to protect assets. Insurance
expense increased $2,937 (28.3%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $2,280 (28.1%) in 2016. The increase in both years 2017 and
2016 was due increased frequency and severity of claims.

3.B.1.a

Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 17.7% and 18.2% of the total expenses in
2017 and 2016. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted transportation services for bus, commuter rail, access-a-Ride,
and call-n-Ride services. Purchased transportation costs increased $2,446 (1.6%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $43,389 (38.3%) in
2016. The increase was primarily due to the opening of the University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail purchased transportation
service in 2016.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, park-n-Ride facilities, and use of
communication towers. Leases and rentals expense decreased $459 (14.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $174 (5.0%) in 2016. The
decrease in 2017 was primarily due to RTD’s need for reduction of office space due to completion of EagleP3 project. The decrease for
2016 was primarily due to reduction in stadium management lease costs.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other defined categories.
Miscellaneous expenses increased $30 (0.7%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $348 (7.7%) in 2016. This category includes additional
one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 27.7% and 25.8% of the total expenses in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Depreciation expense is a non-cash systematic allocation of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets.
Depreciation expense increased $26,479 (11.9%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $69,623 (45.6%) in 2016. The increase in both 2017
and 2016 occurred primarily due to the FasTracks assets that were placed in revenue service.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 7.3% and 9.0% of the total expenses in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Interest expense decreased $11,926 (15.4%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $2,414 (3.0%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 interest
expense is due to partial refunding of Sale Tax Bonds, Certificates of Participation and partial extinguishment and refunding of DUSPA
bonds. The decrease in 2016 is due to reduced principal resulting in decrease in interest expense.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other expense categories. Other expense
increased $1,723 (137.0%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $164 (11.5%) in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to issuance
costs for 2017A/2017B Sales Tax FasTracks Revenue Bonds. The decrease in 2016 was a result of reduced financial issuance costs.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way; buildings and improvements; leasehold improvements;
revenue and non-revenue vehicles; shop and service equipment; security and surveillance equipment; computer equipment; and furniture.
RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in 2017 was $6,804,036 compared to $6,602,020 in 2016. The
increase in capital assets in 2017 was $202,106 (3.1%) compared to an increase of $470,412 (7.7%) in 2016. RTD acquires its assets
with sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants, and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds and certificates of
participation. The increases during 2017 and 2016 were primarily due to the cost of planning, design and construction of FasTracks projects
and fleet acquisition.

Major capital asset events during the 2017 fiscal year included the following:
FasTracks North Metro Corridor - The North Metro Corridor is an 18-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and 162nd
Avenue, passing through Denver, Commerce City, Thornton, Northglenn and unincorporated Adams County. A construction contract was
entered to complete the commuter rail line from DUS north to 124th Avenue by 2018 with an option to extend construction to 162nd Avenue
if additional funding is identified. In 2017, expenditures related to the North Metro Corridor were approximately $121,418.
East and Gold Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) RTD was selected for inclusion in the FTA Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private
partnership to design, build, finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements contemplated under the FasTracks program.
The Eagle P3 project is a $2,185,000 project that includes a Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East and Gold Line Corridors as well
as the Northwest Rail Electrified Segment. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to a concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
through a competitive bid process culminating in a contract price that was $305,000 below internal estimates. The project is expected to
be fully in revenue service in 2018.
The Eagle P3 project will be completed in two phases. Phase I includes the East Corridor, Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility and design
work for Phase II. Phase II includes the Gold Line Corridor and the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment. The Eagle P3 Project elements are
described below:
FasTracks East Corridor - The East Corridor is a 23.6-mile commuter rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station and Denver
International Airport. The East Corridor opened for revenue service in April 2016.
FasTracks Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility - The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility is designed to service the four planned
commuter rail corridors (East Corridor, Gold Line, North Metro, and Northwest Rail) included in the FasTracks plan. The Facility opened
in 2015.

3.B.1.a

FasTracks Gold Line Corridor - The Gold Line Corridor is an 11.2-mile rail transit corridor between Denver Union Station to the vicinity
of Ward Road, passing through northwest Denver, unincorporated Adams County, Arvada, and Wheat Ridge. The Gold Line is planned
to be open for revenue service in 2018.
FasTracks Northwest Electrified Rail Segment – The Northwest Rail Corridor, described previously, includes a project segment,
referred to as the Northwest Electrified Rail Segment, extending from Denver Union Station to Westminster. This segment opened for
revenue service in Summer 2016.
FasTracks I-225 Rail Line – The I-225 Rail Line is a 10.5-mile extension of RTD’s existing light rail line from the Southeast Line Nine Mile
Station to the East Line commuter rail transfer point near the intersection of Peoria Street and Smith Road. The project includes eight
stations and serves the Aurora City Center and the Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. This line opened for revenue service in February
2017. In 2017, expenditures related to the I-225 Rail Line were $12,158.
FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension – The Southeast Rail Extension extends the popular Southeast Rail Line from Lincoln Station to the
new RidgeGate Parkway Interchange at I-25. The project will add 2.3 miles of light rail. New stations will be built at Sky Ridge Medical
Center, Lone Tree City Center and RidgeGate with a 1,300 space Park-n-Ride facility. In 2017, expenditures related to the Southeast Rail
Extension were $76,635. The project is expected to open for revenue service in 2019.
Additional information on RTD’s capital assets can be found in footnote D of this report.
Debt Administration
Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bond, a Transportation Infrastructure and Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan,
certificates of participation, and a Purchase and Assignment Agreement. The 2017 outstanding debt was $3,521,291 compared to
$3,614,608 in 2016. Outstanding debt decreased by $93,317 (2.6%) in 2017 and increased by $165,289 (4.8%) in 2016. The decrease in
2017 is primarily due to refunding and extinguishment of DUSPA Bonds. The increase in 2016 was due to issuance of a 2016A FasTracks
Sales Tax Revenue Bond.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction of assets. The sales tax
revenue bonds were $2,088,744 and $2,190,533 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The sales tax revenue bonds
decreased $101,789 (4.6%) in 2017 compared to an increase of $177,313 (8.8%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 is primarily due to
refunding of DUSPA bonds. The increase in 2016 is primarily due to issuance of the 2016A FasTracks Sales Tax Revenue Bond. The
sales tax revenue bonds are payable from RTD’s sales and use tax revenue. RTD is required to maintain certain minimum deposits, as
defined in bond resolutions, to meet debt service requirements. The bonds may be redeemed prior to maturity, at a price equal to the
principal amount plus accrued interest thereon and a premium to the date of redemption.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation relate to financial obligations issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc.
(Authority), a nonprofit corporation. The Authority issued Certificates of Participation (Certificates) with the proceeds being used to
acquire certain equipment and facilities to be used by RTD. RTD leases the equipment acquired with the proceeds from the Certificates
under separate Master Lease Purchase Agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its own
debt. Certificates outstanding were $1,176,397 and $1,199,275 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Certificates
outstanding decreased $22,878 (1.9%) in 2017 compared to a decrease of $31,585 (2.6%) in 2016. The decrease in 2017 and 2016 is
due to principal payment reducing debt.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2017 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD, representing 60.4% and 56.0% of the
total revenues in 2017 and 2016 respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect
the level of funding available to RTD during its fiscal year.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services provided. Passenger fares accounted for 14.2% and 13.4% of total
revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Passenger fare collections may be affected by fare levels charged by RTD. In January 2016,
RTD implemented a fare increase and modification to fare products offered to customers.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations and capital
expenditures. Grants and local contributions provided 16.8% and 27.8% of total revenues in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Grant funding
and local capital contributions are only available for use by RTD for qualifying expenditures after appropriation is made by the awarding
agency.
Each year, RTD proposes an Amended Budget at mid-year to the Board of Directors for appropriation in order to adjust revenue and
expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget
amendments to the Board of Directors for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.

The following table summarizes outstanding debt obligations as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 with comparative information for 2015.

In June 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2017 Amended Budget in which revenue was adjusted downward to reflect economic
conditions and results and certain adjustments to appropriated expenditures were made to accommodate the expected lower funding
availability.
RTD is in various phases of construction and testing on the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), the North Metro rail line and the Gold Line.
Each of these FasTracks projects is expected to open for revenue service during the next few years. Additional funding for other capital
projects within the FasTracks project scope have been deferred due to a lack of funding.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this organization. Questions

3.B.1.a

1. Organization
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency, a political subdivision of
the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly (the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9,
C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the
responsibility for development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the benefit of
the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield
and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each board member is elected to
serve a term of four years by the constituents of the district in which the board member resides. As required by Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component unit. The
component unit discussed in note A.2 is included in the RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance of its
operational or financial relationship with the District.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to
competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the
Bill was amended requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill
was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private transit companies. In May
of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is
provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entity – Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit corporation on behalf of RTD
for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a public offering collateralized by an installment purchase
agreement with RTD. RTD’s General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves
as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows pronouncements 14 and 61 issued
by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units
in the primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying financial obligations
of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016. No separately audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted for on the flow of economic
resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of
resources, liabilities, deferred inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues
and expenses from non-operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and
producing and delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal
operating revenues of RTD are charges to customers for services. Operating expenses include the cost of services,
administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as
non-operating revenues and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply GAAP in its presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted
resources are available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they
are needed.

Attachment: RTD 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2018) (3480 : 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance)

NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

3.B.1.a

RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original maturity of three months
or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost or amortized cost which
approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more than one year from the date of purchase are carried
at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of operations. Materials and supplies
are stated at cost using the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method.
7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are recorded as prepaid items.
Escrows are deposits held in escrow during the period of construction. At the time projects are completed, escrows
are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may be forfeited by RTD upon breach of contract.
8. Receivables
Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from outstanding balances. Management
provides for probable uncollected amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on
its assessment of the current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management has
used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts
receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as assets with an initial,
individual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of one year. Maintenance and repairs are
charged to current period operating expenses and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition
of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts
and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A pro rata share of proceeds from the sale
of property and equipment, which were acquired with federal funds, is required to be invested in a similar asset.
Interest is capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of participation from the date of the borrowing until
completion of the project. The amount of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally
restricted) interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest earnings on issuance
proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated by weighted average construction expenditures
multiplied by the weighted average interest rate of the outstanding obligations.

11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10–20 years
30 years
8–25 years
3–10 years

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the accompanying financial
statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately $350,394 and $336,323 at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively.
12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred outflow
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred outflows of resources, represents a consumption of
net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized as an outflow of resources
(expense/expenditure) until then. RTD’s deferred outflows were $95,038 and $107,526 as of December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate section for deferred inflows
of resources. This separate financial statement element, deferred inflows of resources, represents an acquisition of net
position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that
time. RTD’s deferred inflows were $19,302 and $5,764 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other qualifying absences. The
number of days compensated in the various categories of absence is based generally on length of service. Compensated
absences, which have been earned but not paid, have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage and personal injury are recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD.
In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are
recognized as they are incurred.

Total interest cost of RTD consisted of the following as of December 31:

3.B.1.a

Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is collected from the farebox.
Sales of monthly passes are recorded initially as unearned revenue and recognized as income at the end of the month
for which the pass is used. Sale of MyRide stored value, Mobile ticketing, ten ride and day pass tickets are recorded
as income at the time of sale. Sales of college based passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are
recorded initially as unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount
recognized in each month determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered. Sales
of Eco Pass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given year, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue. Sales are recognized as income at the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated
evenly over the number of months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable sales made within the
District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the District. As described in Note D, under the terms
of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2007A, Series 2010A, Series 2010B, Series 2012A, Series 2013A, 2016A,
2017A and 2017 B bond resolutions, and TIFIA Sales Tax Loan and Series 2016A, sales and use tax revenue is pledged
for payment of debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado, Department of Revenue and
are remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service from the collections, as required under RTD’s bond and commercial
paper resolutions, and remits the balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the merchant. Sales and Use Tax Bonds
debt service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax revenues in the amount of approximately $3,962,030
through 2050. Principal and interest paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $108,393.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government, through the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Grants are also
awarded to RTD by state of Colorado through the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state
governments issue grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $75,500 and $185,324 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating
assistance grant revenue was $80,412 and $77,335 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Other contribution revenue was
$10,895 and $16,911 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP
establishes appropriate measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides a
reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local governmental units. The preparation
of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are
based upon management’s best judgments, after considering past and current events and assumptions about future
events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

15. Revenue Recognition

3.B.1.a

For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources
related to pensions, and pension expense, information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions
to/deductions from the plan’s fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by

18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In 1992, Colorado voters
approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) Amendment in
which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of government revenues. The Amendment also requires
that an Emergency Reserve, referred to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service
be maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies. The Amendment does not specify the
asset composition of the Restricted TABOR reserve. In 2016, RTD’s Restricted TABOR reserves were comprised
entirely of interest bearing investments. In 2017, RTD’s Restricted TABOR reserves were comprised of $7,603 of
real property and equipment and the remainder was comprised of interest bearing investments.
19. Reclassification of Marketable Interest Bearing Investments

Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under this act, all uninsured
public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal
Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in escrow by some other bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall
prescribe by rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held in its
own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly identified as being security
maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public
depository. The depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or pledged and is
at all times entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $5,191 and $46,919 collateralized with
securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent but not in RTD’s name.

Concentration of Credit Risk, it is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment
funds shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a specific maturity, a
specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the portfolio should, however, be flexible, depending
upon the outlook for the economy and the securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted investments. As of December
31, 2017, RTD was in compliance with these limits. More than 5.00% of the District’s unrestricted investments in U.S.

In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such Agency obligations below the highest rating category, but no
lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to be invested in Agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements
of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1
(m) (II) shall not apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in Agencies, with any
more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal documentation governing the
transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum
exposure limits listed above.
At December 31, 2017 and 2016, RTD had $396,604 and $607,668 of cash and investments that were restricted under the
provisions of bond agreements.
Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement
and Application, which would generally require state and local governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's
goal is enhance comparability of governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets
and liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard expands fair value disclosures
to provide comprehensive information for financial statement users about the impact of fair value measurements on a
government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that the District has the ability to
access at the measurement date. Examples derived from NYSE, NASDAQ, Chicage Board of Trade, Pink Sheets.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly
on the measurement date. Examples include Matrix pricing, market corroborated pricing; inputs such as yield curves and
indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on the reporting entity's reasonably
available information concerning the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including
assumptions about risk. Examples include investment Manager Pricing for Private Placement, Private Equities, and Hedge
Funds.

• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position
is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general

obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary
net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate
is 3.78% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA

Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Pension Plan was established pursuant to
collective bargaining agreements between RTD and the Union. This plan covers substantially all full-time union-represented
employees in accordance with the union agreement. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by
Compusys, Inc.
Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected by the participant and the
spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the Plan are paid to participants who have attained age 65 and have been with the Plan for
ten years. The benefit amount is based on final average earnings, years of employment under this Plan and age at date of
retirement.
Early retirement, effective January 1, 1992, any Participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited service and
terminated employment prior to attaining age 50, will be entitled to an early retirement benefit starting on the first day of any
month after he has attained age 50. The Plan was amended effective January 1, 2011. The years of credited service needed
to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal
and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee, who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire, should die, his beneficiary
will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2,000
will be paid in a lump sum to the pensioners designated beneficiary.
Disability benefits, an individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment with RTD
as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit provided he or she has worked for at
least ten years for RTD in covered employment or any of its predecessors. An individual will be considered totally disabled
upon receipt of a disability award from Social Security. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to
qualify for a disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Deferred Vested Retirement Benefit, an individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason
other than retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked for at least ten
years in covered employment for RTD or any of its predecessors. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested benefits as early
as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and terminates active employment on or after
attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be
payable at any time after age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement disability benefit was increased from five to ten years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
Benefit structure for participants hired on or after January 1, 2011. The following changes are included:
•
•
•
•
•

The benefit multiplier is changed from 2.5% to 1% with a new benefit schedule. (Priority 1).
Regular retirement is changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service.
Sick and vacation payouts are no longer included in the pension benefit calculation. (Priority 2).
Vesting is changed from 5 years to 10 years.
Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%.

A “Trigger Policy” has also been provided that will partially rescind the modified benefit structure when certain Plan funding
benchmarks are achieved. If the total Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) is less than 11% of payroll, pension benefits would
be restored in the order of priority listed above. The "Trigger" remains in effect until such time as the 11% ARC is restored.

• The maximum service included in the benefit calculation is reduced from 30 years to 25 years. (Priority 3).

Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using a Single Discount Rate that
reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position
is projected to be sufficient to pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general

obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that the plan’s projected fiduciary
net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is 7.00%; the municipal bond rate
is 3.57% (based on the weekly rate closest to but not later than the measurement date of the “state & local bonds” rate from
Federal Reserve statistical release (H.15)); and the resulting Single Discount Rate is 4.54%.

whom were hired prior to January 1, 2008. The plan is a single-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Fringe
Benefit Services, Inc.
Benefits Provided
Normal retirement eligibility age is 65 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit 2.5% of average final compensation
times credited service. Early retirement age is 55 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit if retire or terminate from
active status on or after age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee
terminates from active status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for each year between ages 60
and 65, and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.
Disability retirement is five years of credited service, totally and permanently disabled, and entitled to a Social Security
disability award; monthly benefit unreduced normal retirement benefit, payable upon approval for Social Security disability.
Pre-retirement death eligibility is five years of credited service; monthly benefit survivor pension assuming the participant

the participant would have reached age 55 and is reduced for early commencement. Survivors of married participants may
elect to receive an annuity or a lump sum distribution. Survivors of unmarried participants will receive a lump sum distribution
if death occurs while the participant is actively employed with RTD. The lump sum is the present value of the survivor’s pension
above but determined as if the participant was married and the spouse was the same age as the participant.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service; monthly benefit if not eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or if elected within six months, a lump sum equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits,
payable in lieu of all other benefits in the Plan. Employee monthly benefit if eligible to retire normal retirement benefit, early
retirement benefit, or a lump sum equal to the present value of an immediate accrued benefit, payable in lieu of all other
benefits in the Plan.
Forms of annuity payments for normal form are 50% Joint and Survivor Annuity if married, Single Life Annuity otherwise.
Optional Forms are 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 100% Joint and Survivor Annuity with 5-year or 10-year Certain and Life Annuity
(60 or 120 months guaranteed) Social Security Adjustment (Age 62 or Age 65) Lump Sum.
Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and completed months in the year
of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is
average of participant's highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service immediately
preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2016, using the following actuarial
assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with a liability roll forward to December 31, 2016 for
disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017:
Inflation
Salary Increases
Investment Rate of Return

3.00%
4.75% - 9.75%, based on age
7.50%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in
which best- estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense
and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate
of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage including expected
inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the pension plan’s target asset
allocation as of the December 31, 2016 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017) are
summarized in the following data and reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon
which the disclosure is based:

RP-2014 Blue Collar Mortality Tables for healthy annuitants, blended 70% male / 30% female for participants and 30% male /

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2016 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as

The actuarial assumptions used in the January 1, 2015 valuation were based on the results of an actuarial experience study
covering the period January 1, 2009 – December 31, 2013.
Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.50%. The projection of cash flows used to determine
the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the
applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available
to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on
pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.
The discount rate does not incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/As or higher).
Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following present the net pension liability of the Plan, calculated using the discount rate of 7.50%, as well as
what the Plan’s net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point
lower (6.50%) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.50%) than the current rate:

Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan represents full-time salaried employees hired after January 1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted
amendment No. 8, effective January 1, 2008. RTD contributes 9% of the employee’s qualifying wage. Contributions totaled
$3,981 and $3,478 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to the Plan. Membership was 596 and
520 active employees in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust was formed pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective
July 1, 1971, between Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 (ATU 1001) and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by
the City and County of Denver, through July 3, 1974, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) thereafter. In addition
to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust
benefits. The Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there continues
to be a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability) for represented employees
of RTD and certain officers of ATU 1001 and health care benefits for retired employees actively working 600 hours or more
per quarter. The Trust is funded through contribution by the employer and employee, the share of benefit plan contributions is
set by the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). RTD’s contribution was $19,065 and $19,025 the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault for each
employee and funds the Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Legal Services Trust. The Trust self-insures part of its
health benefits, life insurance coverage and short-term disability. The plan issues audited financial statements, which include
financial information for the plan. The financial statements may be obtained from the plan: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare
Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 80014-2602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (the Plan), created in accordance with Internal Revenue Code
Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to
future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement,
death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid time off (PTO), vacation, and
sick leave based on time in service; employees are not allowed to accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation
accrual and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon
leaving RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle of conservatism by
assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay in the near-term.

Union Station Alliance (USA) Lease
In December 2012, RTD entered a contract with Union Station Alliance (USA) to renovate and lease RTD’s historic Denver
Union Station Building. The renovation by USA included a hotel, Amtrak facilities, office space, retail and restaurant services
as well as renovation of the Great Train Hall. The renovations were complete and open to the public in July 2014. The
agreement includes a 60-year lease to USA to operate and maintain the facility in which RTD will participate in certain revenue
collections.

Operating Lease – Civic Center Transfer Facility
In 1976, RTD entered into an operating lease for a portion of the land on which the Civic Center transfer facility is located in
downtown Denver. As collateral for the lease, RTD must maintain an account balance with a minimum market value of $1,500 in
an escrow account, the interest on which accrues to RTD until the lease expires. This amount in escrow is included in restricted
assets in the accompanying financial statements.

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been leased to and subleased
back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been
leased to and subleased back. As part of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received
from each counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third party trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD under the transactions and are
therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.
Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2017, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and the purchase of buses and
light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the purchase of buses/light rail vehicles total $291,887 and
$560,716 in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements of these grants. At
December 31, 2017, RTD had a commitment to provide $179,032 in matching funds in order to receive $221,624 in future
federal and state grant funds.
Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific groups of routes, not to exceed
58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January 2018, slightly over 54.18% of RTD’s non-rail transit services
are delivered by private contractors operating under the auspices and direction of RTD.
ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), RTD was mandated to provide paratransit service to
the disabled individuals unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses, operating the same days and hours of service as the fixed route
service. This service, called Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb (with door-to-door assistance upon special request) transportation
system offered to disabled individuals who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Passengers eligible for
Access-a-Ride service must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD non-commuter fixed route. Since September
1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 requirement to provide paratransit
service to the disabled individuals unable to use fixed route buses.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build, finance and operate several of the transit improvements
contemplated under the FasTracks program, including the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, the East Rail Corridor, the Gold
Line Rail Corridor and the electrified segment of the Northwest Rail Corridor (together, the “Eagle P3 Project). The Eagle P3
Project is being delivered and operated under a concession agreement that RTD has entered with a concessionaire that has
been selected through a competitive proposal process. The selected concessionaire is known as Denver Transit Partners (DTP),
a special purpose company owned by Fluor Enterprises, Uberior Investments and Laing Investments.
The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016 and Phase II completed in
2018. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011
through 2017 for completed project elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the
B Line in 2016 with testing and revenue service of the final corridor, the G Line, expected to occur in 2018. RTD will assume
ownership of the entire project once certain contractual criteria and final completion occurs. Under the terms of the

concessionaire agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017 through 2044
in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance services by DTP. The principal and interest
payments are fixed amounts for the term of the agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to
certain inflation measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes, special services
and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail Line. The North Metro Rail
Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and
Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue in North Adams County. The North Metro Rail Line is expected to open within the
next few years.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct the Southeast Rail Extension
Project. The Southeast Rail Extension includes 2.3 miles extending of the existing Southeast Light rail Line from Lincoln Station
through the City of Lone Tree to RidgeGate Parkway Station featuring a new Park-n-Ride with a structure of 1,300 parking
spaces. The Southeast Rail Extension is scheduled to open in 2019.

RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Co of Gainesville, Inc. for diesel fuel. The contract is structured as a single year contract.
The estimated (no locked-in price) commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2018 is $18,900. RTD estimates usage of 9.0
million gallons at unit cost of $2.10 per gallon: 5.2 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 3.8 million gallons of RTD private
carrier’s usage.
Contingencies
Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to audit by FTA. Although the
outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an
extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.
Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a
loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit
option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under the provisions of the Colorado
Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving
personal injury and property damage is $350 per individual and $990 per incident.
For Workers’ Compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess of $2,000. The amount
of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk
Management determines incurred claims by investigating the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on
the day of assignment, reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and based
on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement of net assets. Changes in the
balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and Worker’s Compensation during the past year are as follows:

RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or labor/employment claims
under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract
disputes being considered in contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or workers’ compensation reserves, project
contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially affect the financial statements of RTD.
RTD’s prime contractor for the North Metro Line has asserted claims primarily seeking compensation for delays on the
project. These claims are scheduled for arbitration in late 2018 and are estimated to be up to $70,000. RTD is contesting
these claims and believes it is likely to prevail.
RTD’s concessionaire has asserted a series of change in law and force majeure claims which, if successful, could entitle the
Concessionaire to monetary relief estimated to be up to $70,000. RTD is contesting these claims and believes it is likely to
prevail.

RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the budget also includes proceeds
of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures include capital outlays and bond principal payments, and
excludes TABOR rebates under Amendment One, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as gains and losses on
disposition of, property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration,
development, debt service, and capital outlays for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager submits to the
Board of Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following January 1, which is
made available for public inspection and comment. On or before December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an
appropriation resolution by the Board of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence
of such adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation.
RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the General Manager to approve certain transfers within the budget.

3.B.1.a

In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State Constitution (Article X, Section 20)
that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR). The limits on property taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation
and local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment excludes spending from certain
revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts, property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves
(balances). The amendment requires voter approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year
debt. Revenue earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve retention of
these revenues. In addition, the amendment mandates that reserves equal 3% of fiscal spending be established for declared
emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted the Regional Transportation District from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning the Amendment through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further
exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined in the Amendment for the purpose of paying any debt
incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%,
effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD
from any revenue and spending limitations on the additional tax and on any investment income generated by the increased tax
revenue, and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the FasTracks program. At the time
that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the rapid transit
system financed through FasTracks. RTD has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to the Amendments’ limitations. This
debt was authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks rapid transit improvement program. Based
on estimated fiscal year spending for 2017, $25,735 interpretation. RTD believes it is in compliance with the requirements
of the Amendment based on the interpretations of the Amendment’s language available at year-end.
NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On February 28, 2018, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local
1001 (ATU) expired. RTD has a single CBA that primarily covers operations and support staff as well as some administrative
positions. Contract negotiations between RTD and ATU for a contract renewal began early in the fourth quarter of 2017. On
March 27, 2018, a new three-year CBA was ratified to be effective March 1, 2018 through February 28, 2021.
On January 1, 2018 Risk Management self-insured liability limits increased. The limits which are $387 per person and $1,093
per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statue.
RTD’s concessionaire-provided commuter rail services on the East Corridor (University of Colorado A Line) and the Northwest
Electrified Rail Segment (B Line) are operating under a five year waiver granted by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).
The waiver was granted to allow these revenue service operations to continue as specific grade level crossing gate timing
issues are addressed. In addition to the FRA, The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) also exercises regulatory
authority of commuter rail services and is in agreement with the provisions of the FRA’s five year waiver. Both parties agree
that once certain conditions are met, a waiver for the Gold Line Corridor (G Line) may be granted to allow revenue operations
to commence. RTD believes that the conditions will be met to allow the additional operations to commence and does not
believe an additional waiver will be necessary after the expiration of the five year period.

Attachment: RTD 2017 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (05-2018) (3480 : 2017 CAFR and Report to Governance)

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS

The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act limits RTD’s tort claims exposure to $350 per person and $990 per occurrence for
claims that accrued after July 1, 2013 and before January 1, 2018. Claims that accrue after January 1, 2018 are subject to
limits of $387 per person and $1,093 per occurrence.

* Fiscal year 2015 was the 1st year of implementation, therefore only three years are shown.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 measurement date, January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation date): The mortality assumptions were updated
to RP-2014 blue-collar tables published by the Society of Actuaries with project scale MP-2017. This change increased the liabilities by 2.113 million.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 measurement date, January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation date): Assumption changes were a result of a
change in the Single Discount Rate changing from 5.00 percent to 4.54 percent, measured at the end of the year.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2017 (December 31, 2016 measurement date, January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation date): the
administrative expense assumption was updated from $165,000 per year, payable monthly, to $150,000 per year, payable monthly. The updated administrative expense
assumption is expected to be more reflective of future administrative expenses for the Plan. The administrative expense assumption is used for determining the
actuarially determined contribution and does not impact Total Pension Liability.

Assumption changes for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2016 (December 31, 2015 measurement date, January 1, 2015 actuarial valuation date): the amount
reported as Assumption Changes resulted from a change in the salary increase assumption (average weighted salary increase changed from 4.00% to 5.00%). This
change is expected to be more reflective of future plan experience.

Auditing standards require the auditor to ensure that those charged with governance receive additional information
regarding the scope and results of the audit that may assist the governing body in overseeing the financial reporting and
disclosure process for which management is responsible. The following section describes matters which are required to be
reported to you.

Regional Transportation District
We have audited the basic financial statements of RTD for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit was performed
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards
applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement and presented in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit
evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also assessed the accounting principles
used by RTD and the reasonableness of significant estimates made by RTD’s management, as well as evaluated the
overall financial statement presentation.

Professional standards also require that we obtain a
significant understanding of RTD’s internal control to plan
the audit. However, such understanding is required for the
purpose of determining our audit procedures and not to
provide any assurance concerning such internal control.
Accordingly, we express no such assurance.

Our responsibility, as described by professional standards,
is to express an opinion about whether the financial
statements prepared by management with your
assistance are fairly presented, in all material respects, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles and whether RTD complied in all material
respects with the applicable compliance requirements of
its major federal programs. Our audit of the financial
statements and compliance does not relieve you or
management of responsibility for the accuracy of the
financial statements and/or compliance with applicable
requirements.

No new accounting policies were adopted, and the
application of existing policies was not changed.

Management is responsible for the selection and use
of appropriate accounting policies. In accordance
with the terms of our engagement letter, we will advise
management about the appropriateness of
accounting policies and their application.

We noted no transactions entered into during the year for
which there was a lack of authoritative guidance or
consensus, with the exception of the P3, which the
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) has
yet to address.

Significant accounting policies are described in Note A.

We performed the audit according to the planned scope

Our consideration of internal control was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and was not designed
to identify all deficiencies in internal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, and therefore,
material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified.

A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a
material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those charged with governance.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or
detected and corrected, on a timely basis. We did not identify any deficiencies that we would consider to be a
material weakness.

A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or
employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements
on a timely basis.

Regional Transportation District
In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of RTD as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, we
considered RTD’s internal control over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for designing our auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of RTD’s internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness
of RTD’s internal control.

As the project is nearing full completion with several amendments and anticipated amendments to contract
provisions, we recommend that management perform a comprehensive review of the key clauses of the
P3 agreement, which include but are not limited to, completion of project, termination clauses and changes in
service, for any potential accounting, budgetary and financial reporting impacts. We would recommend
performing this review at least annually with a key member of financial management related to the impacted
areas as noted above.

We noted that the P3 contract/projected deviated from the original timeline, scope and payment terms due to
economic and inflationary changes in the Denver Metro Area. Review of the anticipated timeline and accounting
impacts was evaluated at inception of the agreement, regarding the impact to the accounting, budgetary and
legal impacts; however, the impacts to financial reporting were not consistently evaluated throughout the project
to consider the changes.

The recodes occur for various reasons not limited to correcting errors, utilizing
different funding sources or refining/finalizing the accounting for a project. The
recode entries are created by the budget analyst and reapproved by the
individuals who approved the original transactions. The Accounting Manager then
reviews and approves posting of the entry. While the Accounting Manager will
consult with the FasTracks Program Control Manager or the Chief Financial Officer,
depending on the nature and sensitivity of the recode, there is no other formal
documentation regarding approval of the recode. We recommended that
management continue to enhance the policy whereby recodes that meet certain
quantitative or qualitative characteristics, such as a change in funding source or
project, be approved by the Program Control Manager or other appropriately
designated individual.

This proposed statement would require that interest cost incurred during the period of construction be recognized as an
expense in the period in which the cost is incurred using the economic resources measurement focus.

Purpose is to enhance the relevance and comparability of information about capital assets and the cost of borrowing for a

Subject:

Budget Transfer for Commuter Rail Third Party
Services

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: May 9, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 22, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the
commuter rail operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements .
The FasTracks Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds
that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.
This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:
Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.

Core Goal #1 – Successful

BACKGROUND
Since the T-Rex project, RTD has worked with third party partners, including stakeholders, local
governments, and private entities, on betterments associated with its construction projects. These
betterments have included enhancements to RTD rail lines and facilities beyond the original
construction plans and concurrent construction of associated facilities for third parties. The third
parties requesting the work reimburse RTD for all costs associated with these betterments, so these
betterments are done at no net cost to RTD.
With the opening of the Eagle commuter rail lines, RTD also may see service impacts from third
party construction projects that require access to the right-of-way. These could include utilities that
pass under the track, or construction on bridges over the track. In these instances, DTP may be
required to provide access to the track, or to modify service, to allow the third party construction to
proceed in a safe and timely fashion.
DISCUSSION
RTD anticipates that eight third-party projects planned for 2018 will impact operations on the Eagle
P3 projects. These impacts may include construction of the actual betterments, provision of
flaggers to ensure safety along the corridor for third party construction, power shutdowns a t the
locations of the improvements, and potential bus bridges to provide service to patrons during a
shutdown of service. RTD must pay DTP for its costs related to these improvements, or contract
with a private bus operator to provide bus bridges when RTD does not have operators available to
provide the service. This transfer will allow RTD, DTP, and its third party partner entities to continue
work on these projects in a timely manner.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 177

3.B.2

There will be no net financial impact to RTD. RTD will be compensated by third parties for all costs
incurred on their behalf. These revenues will be included in the 2018 Amended Budget and will be
used to replenish the FasTracks Management Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2. 82 million from
the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party
reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it
will incur for work associated with third party agreements. The FasTracks Management
Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that will be received
from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at
this time. Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is
not recommended since it will delay work on the associated betterments and on construction
projects undertaken by outside entities.

Long-Term Funding
§ There has been no change in the Board’s funding policy since 2016 – the contribution
continues to be determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based
on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer to
contributing

§ Last year, based on January 1, 2016 actuarial valuation results and an estimated
2016 net investment return of 9.4%, the Plan was projected to reach 100% funding in
2043 with a $4.6M contribution each year if all assumptions were met in the future

§ What changed since last year?
Ø The actual net investment return for 2016 was 9.3% based on the 12/31/2016 Plan audit
Ø The Plan experienced a $2.3M salary gain in 2016 (2.5% average salary increase for
continuing actives compared to an expected weighted average increase of 5.0%)

§ Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100%
funding in 2042 (1 year earlier) with a $4.6M contribution each year if all actuarial
assumptions are met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year
beginning in 2017

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ What happened since the final January 1, 2017 valuation results were issued?
Ø The Board approved a $5.1M contribution for the 2018 Fiscal Year; the actuary’s
recommended contribution was $7.3M

Ø The investment return in 2017 exceeded the 7.50% assumption – the preliminary 2017 net
return is 14.2%

§ Reflecting January 1, 2017 valuation results, a $5.1M contribution in 2018, and a
14.2% preliminary net return on assets in 2017, if all actuarial assumptions are met
each year, including a net investment return of 7.5% per year beginning in 2018:

Ø If future contributions are equal to $5.1M (or the recommended contribution if lower), the
funding level is projected to reach 100% in 2031 (end of the 14-year amortization period) with
recommended contributions dropping below $5.1M in 2022

q The recommended contribution ranges from $4.9M in 2022 down to $0.8M in 2032

Ø If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2019, the Plan is expected to achieve
100% funding in 2031 (end of the 14-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $5.1M in 2022

q The recommended contribution ranges from $5.9M in 2019 down to $4.7M in 2022 and $0.8M in 2032

Current State
• Fare Box Revenue
• Fare Box Revenue targets are set by the RTD Board of Directors
• The Board’s Fiscal Policy Statement directs staff to plan on a fare adjustment every three
(3) years to adjust to inflation
• Policy directs staff to review potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to
ensure that it:
• Is understandable
• Is implementable
• Is equitable
• Achieves the revenue levels established in the Mid-Range Financial Plan (Formerly SBP & APE)

• The current Mid-Term Financial Plan for 2018-2023 incorporates a planned fare increase
assumption in both 2019 and 2022.
• Approximately 10% in 2019 and 10% in 2022

Three Alternatives at a Glance
1. No Increase in the Base Fare
• Doesn’t generate enough revenue to meet fare targets in current SBP/APE
• Insufficient revenue generated by eliminating discounts and transitioning to utilization
pricing for pass programs to introduce 70% discount for Youth or Low Income Program

2. Regularly Scheduled Fare Change
• Local One-Way $2.60 to $2.90
• Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.00
• Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.00

3. Pass Program Working Group
Recommendation
• Local One-Way $2.60 to $3.00
• Regional One-Way $4.50 to $5.25
• Airport One-Way $9.00 to $10.50
• 70% discount for Youth
6

• Maintain Nonprofit Program (Adult &
Senior/Disabled products offered at 50%
discount on the full fare;
• Youth at 70% discount)

• 70% discount for Youth
• 40% discount through the Low Income
Program

Alt 1. No Increase in Base Fare: Modeling Results
• Leaving the Base Fares unchanged results in a sizeable revenue shortfall (-$36 million) compared to
the cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
• This revenue shortfall remains sizable, even with the elimination of some fare discounts (e.g.:
FlexPass, MyRide, ValuPass, etc.)
• Compared to the Baseline, this alternative results in higher ridership, due to the lower Base Fare

• The Regularly scheduled fare change would result in revenue slightly below (-$2 million) the
cumulative Strategic Budget Plan fare revenue target for 2019-2021
• Compared to the Baseline, the Recommendation results in a very slight increase in ridership, due in
part to the greater discount offered to Youth customers

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2018. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 35 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 88.8% did not meet goal of 92.0% but was improved over 2017.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Ridership for the first quarter of 2018 was down 0.5%. In 2017, ridership was down 1.0% in the
first quarter and down 1.7% for the year. This mirrors the national trend. The goal for 2018 is an
annual measure and the target is positive ridership growth for the year. We will continue to monitor
ridership.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 2.1% and 1.8%, respectively, but are currently
short of the budgeted annual goals of 3.0% and 2.6%. We will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to attrition,
retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy.

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize

Subject:

Quarterly Investment Report

Information

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2018 attached.
The District invests in high quality fixed income securities that mature within 5 years or less. Actions
taken by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) typically impact these types of securities
so a summary of recent FOMC activity follows:
On May 2, 2018, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announced that it would leave short term
interest rates unchanged in the 1.5%- 1.75% range. The committee expects that “economic activity
will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.” and
that inflation is expected to run near the committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective. Consistent with its
statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to maintain maximum employment and price stability.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”

The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

1st Quarter

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.392%
0.355%

Enhanced Cash Tier:

Packet Pg. 250

3.C.6

RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

-0.098%
0.272%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the first quarter of 2018 was 1.70% which
produced earnings of $1,627,849. The current yield for the month of March was 1.73% which would
produce annualized earnings of $7,055,418.

Historical performance of RTD investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmarks is reflected in
the following graphs:
