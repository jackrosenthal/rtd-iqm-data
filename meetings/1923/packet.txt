BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 4, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

June 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: June 10, 2014

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 4060’ Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in
an amount not to exceed $26,720,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 40 additional
60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 406,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have become
unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. Many of the parts required for the
repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the
replacement of the 9100 Series buses over three years, 40 buses in 2013, 40 buses in 2014 and 18
buses in 2015.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement was
the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17, 2013.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the
purchase option for a guaranteed quantity of 40 additional articulated buses.
DISCUSSION
The 60’ articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 55
passenger seats and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the purchase option for
a guaranteed quantity of 40 articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $26,720,000. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to New Flyer for the purchase of
forty (40) additional articulated buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 11040' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053
with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $46,428,700 for the purchase of 110 additional 40’ transit
buses and associated spare components.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
RTD’s existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 14 years old and have accumulated on average 610,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus
manufacturer, Orion Bus Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required
for the repair of the buses are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for
the replacement of the Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014
and 64 buses in 2015.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an
inflationary price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or
PPI which is published monthly.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a guaranteed quantity of 110 additional 40’ transit buses.
DISCUSSION
The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger

count system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 35
passenger seats, and two spaces for storage of large items such as child stroller and shopping caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
guaranteed quantity of 110-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $46,428,700. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2014
Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st
Quarter 2014

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the first quarter of 2014 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 1st quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 1st quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet the goal during the first quarter. First Transit
reported three of the four passenger accidents during the 1st quarter as non-preventable. First
Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct proactive retraining to increase operator
awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 1st quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
While on-time performance did improve slightly from 2013 levels, the contractors as a group did
not meet the target of 88.0% Local On-Time Service in the 1st quarter. First Transit Longmont
did meet the goal with 89.4% Local On-Time Service in the 1st quarter. RTD is working with the
private contractors to use the OTP report to identify and campaign routes with on-time
performance issues. The contractors also report that they continue to experience route delays
due to construction and detours. Increased passenger loads and associated boarding delays also
contribute to running behind schedule. The contractors continue to address on-time performance
issues with operators, but always tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes
late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 1st quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely

Packet Pg. 7

1.C.1

manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.


OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors as a group met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in the 1st quarter.
Veolia did not meet the goal with .0005 Complaints per Boarding in the 1st quarter. First Transit
and Veolia Transportation continue to investigate and address customer complaints with
operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance to retrain operators on the
importance of good customer service and automatic vehicle location software to improve on time
performance. The contractors also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at
monthly safety meetings.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Belleview CnR - Call-n-Ride ridership had not met minimum expectations of 3 boarding's per hour as of
January 2014. Discontinued flex route due to low ridership in January 2014 and Call-n-Ride ridership
has gone up to over 4 boarding's per hour.
Belmar CnR - Call-n-Ride ridership had not met minimum expectations of 3 boarding's per hour since
opening in April 2013. After analysis, the Call-n-Ride will have major changes recommended for the
January 2015 Runboard.
Evergreen CnR - Call-n-Ride ridership has decreased this past year. Two major areas of ridership loss
occurred at the Assisted Living facilities and schools. Contact has been made with these locations. The
Assisted living facilities have committed to talk to each new resident about the service. The two
schools that currently use the service sent out notices to all existing students reminding them about the
service during the summer and the schools will contact all new and returning students before school
starts in August to alert them of the service and to get their trips booked.
Federal Heights - Call-n-Ride ridership had not met minimum expectations of 3 boarding's per hour.
Marketing took place in December. Adjustment to boundaries was done in January and May. Ridership
up to 3 boardings per hour.
Golden - Added a 3rd bus in January 2014 Runboard. Ridership up.

Packet Pg. 10

1.C.2

Highlands Ranch - Call-n-Ride ridership has not met expectation of 3 boardings per hour.
Marketing took place in December. Ridership is up from 1.8 to 2.4 boardings per hour.
Lone Tree - Call-n-Ride ridership has historically been right below or right above 3 boardings per hour.
Recent ridership has gone up to 6 per hour. This is due to additional construction in the area and
employees using light rail and the Call-n-Ride to get to work. Marketing will take place in 2014.
Parker - Call-n-Ride ridership has not met expectation of 3 boardings per hour. Met with Town staff and
have come up with an action plan for 2014 to market Call-n-Ride. Ridership in the 2 boardings per hour
range.
South Thornton and Northglenn/Thornton - These Call-n-Rides combined as one as the
Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride in the January 2014 Runboard. The new combined Call-n-Ride has
been working well operationally and the numbers have met productivity.

Customer Complaint Analysis - First Quarter
2014

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 1 st Quarter of 2014. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2014 is .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
For the 1st Quarter of 2014, RTD, First Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver, and First Transit
Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. Veolia had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0004 complaints
per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0003
complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2014, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 2014, the complaints in this category decreased 11.1% compared to 2013. In
many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but running late. However, from
the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 4.9
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 5.4 complaints per day.
Bus Early – For 2014, complaints in this category decreased 20.9% compared to 2013. “Flashbacks”
for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible passengers see the prior bus
running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are addressed whenever the
CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The YTD average in this

Packet Pg. 16

1.C.3

category for 2014 is 5.8 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 7.2 complaints per
day.
Bus Late – For 2014, complaints in this category increased 17.5% compared to 2013. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2014 is 10.59 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 8.91
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – For 2014, complaints in this category increased 21.4% compared to 2013.
On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks are performed to
determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, the private
contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the
buses and RTD is in the process of installing a system on its buses. These incidents are also reviewed
on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving
performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD
average in this category is 4.16 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 3.38
complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – For 2014, complaints in this category increased 3.4% compared to 2013. In the
majority of cases, video evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and
treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or explaining policies
(requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating area, addressing inappropriate
behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative manner. Operators
are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated passengers in a discourteous
or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling similar situations in the
future. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 10.08 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 9.64 complaints per day.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
2014, complaints in this category decreased 22.2% compared to 2013. Investigation into
discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD average in this
category for 2014 is 0.23 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was .30 complaints
per day.
Fare Dispute – For 2014, complaints in this category decreased 9.1% compared to 2013. It appears
passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares to be paid upon boarding.
Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2014 is 1.22 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 1.33 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – For 2014, complaints in this category increased 20.1% compared to
2013. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a regular basis to ensure
all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the recently completed
ADA refresher training provided information to remind operators of the procedures to follow to ensure
passengers in mobility devices are able to board the bus. In cases where video evidence shows
operators are not following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.3

category for 2014 is 7.44 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 6.13 complaints
per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator –For 2014, complaints in this category decreased 14.6% compared to 2013.
The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus Operator Training
Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are ensuring that operators are provided up-to-date
information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the
category for 2014 is 0.39 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was .45 complaints
per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 2014, complaints in this category increased 10.8% compared to
2013. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm buses are on route and either on
time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived.
Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus passed.
Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the
bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed
up due to the bus being full. Some “Pass Up” complaints relate to passengers with mobility aids being
passed up because the securement area was full. These complaints are tracked independently, and
represent a small number of the total “Pass Up” complaints (29 of the total 844). Information regarding
overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and
adjustment as needed and as resources will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 9.38
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 8.37 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

1st Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of January, February, and March. These
tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have

Packet Pg. 20

1.C.4

the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31, & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Access-a-Ride 1st Quarter Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 1st quarter of 2014 compared to the same period
of 2013. Productivity increased from 1.21 to 1.27 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 11%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased service without an increase in resources.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased slightly (approximately 2%) during the
1st quarter of 2014. Access-a-Ride is approximately 5% under budgeted revenue hours through the
first quarter of 2014.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on time performance through the 1st quarter of 2014 decreased as compared to the same period
in 2013. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges. Staff continues to
work with our carriers to address operator shortages, scheduling issues, and passenger boarding times.
In our continuing efforts to better understand on time performance, a comprehensive analysis was
conducted which identified a disparity between carrier and passenger on time performance. Carrier on
time performance is used to measure our carrier’s ability to pick up our passengers within their
prescheduled 30-minute window, with an additional 15 minutes in order to mitigate any unforeseen
circumstances such as traffic, weather, and accidents. This on time performance standard is also
utilized to assess penalties on the carriers in the event that they do not meet this goal. The passenger
on time performance standard is measured by passenger pickups performed within the prescheduled 30minute window. The disparity between both standards has prompted staff to report these statistics
separately and to focus their attention on implementing steps to improve both standards accordingly.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the 1st quarter of 2014 as compared to the same period in
2013. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

Subject:

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The CollegePass and EcoPass programs continue to gather valuable data through the taps registered on
both the Platform and Bus Validators. Since January 2014, first boardings on buses and trains average
449,000 for the CollegePass Program and 607,000 for the EcoPass programs on a monthly basis.
When examining the card tapping data by transportation mode during the month of April 2014, (May is
atypical due to school schedules) we can determine how College Pass holders and Eco Pass holders
utilize RTDs transportation options on an average weekly basis:
Buses
 Approximately 114,000 first boardings per week by College Pass holders
 Approximately 137,000 first boardings per week by Eco Pass holders
Light Rail
 Approximately 35,000 first boardings per week by CollegePass holders
 Approximately 35,000 first boardings per week by EcoPass holders
Collaboration continues on the Phase 1 Web Portal Enhancements. Three days of testing have been
scheduled for June 16-18, during which time the Smart Media Technology Team and subject matter
experts from within RTD will test the enhancements being made to the portal. New functionality that
will be tested is as follows:





Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
Increased search capabilities within the web portal
Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.
User Role enhancements that limit the actions a Web Portal user can access based on their job
responsibilities.

The process to review all CollegePasses with a 6 year contract began in early May. Since the beginning
of 2014, 9000 students now hold CollegePass cards that will not expire until the student leaves the
college or university, or until the 6 year period has passed.
A system constraint was identified in the Smart Media Technology relating to the number of cards that
the system can process when a SmartCard needs to be deactivated, suspended, recharged or when a
monthly subscription needs to be placed on the card. In partnering with our vendor Xerox, we have
identified potential solutions to this issue; however the implementation of those solutions will delay the
go-live of MyRide Monthly Passes and Stored Value.
Xerox has provided RTD with the cost and schedule impact estimates for the following items:





A method by which we can increase the amount of memory on both bus and platform validators
A “smart action list” that will prioritize the processing of frequently used cards and remove
infrequently tapped cards from validator memory
Estimates for upgrading current validator versions to newer technology

The SMT Program Team and Information Technology have provided a series of recommendations to the
program Executive Sponsors in the areas of technology, process and people. Additional programming for
the Smart Media Technology system has been evaluated and we are in the beginning stages of
conversation with Xerox as to when this body of work can begin. We are also evaluating internal
business processes to identify areas where changes can be made to help remediate the validator
capacity issue. And finally, we are closely examining the current roles and responsibilities of those RTD
staff that are supporting the SMT programs and infrastructure to ensure that we have adequate staff
and the correct skill sets in place to move Smart Media Technology toward the successful
implementation of MyRide and Stored Value.

Status
In order to streamline the support of both the bus and
platform validator technology, responsibilities for both types
of validators have been assigned to separate teams. The
Mobile Technology Group will be responsible for
maintenance and repairs on the bus validators and the
Treasury technicians will maintain and support the platform
validators. We are also producing a series of monthly
metrics for both Bus and Platform Validator Maintenance to
assist in identifying recurring issues, as well as baseline the
repair turn-around time between the time the issue was
reported and the time the issue was resolved.
New Braille stickers have been manufactured and installed
on all of the Platform Validators.

There continues to be a trend in employee turnover in the
area of Fare Inspection. Weekly card inspection rates are
down significantly. The SMT Program Team continues to
work with the Fare Inspection group to provide training
materials and assistance to “on-board” new fare inspectors.
Fare Inspection Leadership continues to provide weekly
metrics on the SmartCards that are scanned on RTD light rail
trains. We review trends relating to the number of cards
scanned, the number of cards that were not tapped on a
validator before boarding a train, as well as how many
handheld devices are in use on the light rail trains. These
metrics are reviewed with RTD Executive Sponsors on a
weekly basis.

during the time of the move.
A contract has been awarded to a new vendor that will
supply SmartCard media going forward. RTD, Xerox and G&D
are in the final stages of finalizing the card certification
agreements, paving the way for RTD to order SmartCards
from the new vendor.
