#### 1. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 40-60’ Articulated Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to exceed $26,720,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 40 additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.

Motion:              Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 24, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that this action is the exercise of an option to continue the replacement of RTD’s articulated buses.  Dean Shaklee, General Superintendent of Maintenance, noted that the request is for 40 buses to replace our 9100 Series Articulated Buses; these buses are 14 years old and average 406K miles per bus.  He said these buses have reached their useful life so staff would like to replace them.

Bruce Abel explained that a Request for Proposal (RFP) was done last year with the contract being awarded to New Flyer.  RTD has already procured the first 40 buses for replacement along with 12 vehicles for the FreeMetro Ride.  He stated that this is a continuation of the replacement process.

Chair Sisk asked if staff had gone through a replacement process to determine if the buses are at the end of their useful life or if it is just based on the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) guidelines.  He questions why there are 40 buses that need to be replaced at the same time.  Bruce Abel commented that the FTA guidelines are actually 12 years for useful life.  He said that his team works with the Finance Department and State of Good Repair to determine when the buses will be replaced.  Bruce Abel explained that fleets are not replaced all at one time; this is the second year of a phased replacement.  He said that as the buses are delivered staff will prioritize which buses are replaced first based on condition.  Bruce Abel reiterated that staff has extended the useful life of the buses an additional two years so RTD has really gotten the best bang for our buck.

Director Lasater inquired if staff would use the retired buses as donor buses for hard to get parts.  Dean Shaklee said that some parts will be taken for spares but not every bus will be stripped down.  He shared that the buses are sold at auction, noting that a running bus brings RTD a lot more money than a non-running bus.

Committee Chair Solano wondered if these buses would go into primarily RTD managed areas or to our contractors as well.  Bruce Abel said that since these are articulated buses they will go into RTD service as our contractors do not operate articulated buses.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 110- 40' Transit Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $46,428,700 for the purchase of 110 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare components.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 24, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Dean Shaklee stated that this action is to replace the existing 2000 Series Orion transit buses that have exceeded their useful life.  The buses are 14 years old and have an average of 620K miles.  He shared that the bus company went out of business several years ago, making getting parts to maintain the buses very difficult.  Bruce Abel noted that this represents the second year of a multi-year phased replacement.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Fare Task Force Update

Bruce Abel introduced Lacy Bell, Project Manager of Planning.  He said they would be reviewing a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the June 10, 2014 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Bruce Abel stated that the objective of the Fare Task Force is to simplify RTD’s fare policy in an equitable and cost-effective manner.  He reiterated that this study looks forward to 2016 when RTD will be opening our new Commuter Rail lines.

Bruce Abel noted that at the last Board meeting, Zoë Williams of 9to5 thanked RTD for allowing her group to participate in the Fare Task Force.  Bruce Abel explained that staff has identified an opportunity for the public to work with the Task Force at the problem identification phase to help determine what they perceive to be current problems with the fare structure.

Bruce Abel informed the Board that there are three terms that will be very important to understand as they are all interrelated but very different at the same time.  They are (1) fare structure (i.e. local, express, regional); (2) fare level (actual cost for each fare structure); and (3) fare program (i.e. EcoPass, NeighborhoodPass, Nonprofit Agency Reduced Fare Program).  He said that the Fare Task Force will begin looking at structure, then levels, then programs so there is a logical progression.  Bruce Abel explained that our current fare structure is a hybrid; RTD has distance based and class based fares.

Bruce Abel highlighted that in looking at the peer agency fare comparison, RTD is close to the average fare for our comparison agencies.  RTD’s fares versus the average are as follows:

- Local Cash Fares: $2.25 (RTD) versus $2.22 (Average)

- Express Cash Fares: $4.00 (RTD) versus $3.31 (Average)

- Regional Cash Fares: $5.00 (RTD) versus $4.50 (Average)

- Local Monthly Pass: $79.00 (RTD) versus $81.62 (Average)

Bruce Abel also highlighted that while RTD’s service area is 2,326 square miles, the average service area of our peer agencies is 827 square miles.

Lacy Bell shared that a Request for Proposal for a consulting firm had been issued; proposals are due June 13, 2014.  She said that after a firm was selected the next steps would be:

- Update peer review

- Identify alternative fare structures

- Develop evaluation methodology

- Evaluate alternatives

- Provide recommendations

- Assist with public outreach

- Final report

Bruce Abel indicated that the timeline is broken into three phases: (1) Structure to be completed Q1 of 2015; (2) Fare levels to be completed Q2/Q3 of 2015; and (3) Programs to be completed Q2/Q3 of 2015.

General Manager Washington noted three important items based on the presentation:

1)      This is a very complex issue.  Staff is being very deliberate and do not want to rush the process.  He shared that other agencies have rushed to increase or decrease fares with disastrous effects on the bottom line or budget.

2)      Staff is making no assumptions as to the results of the Fare Task Force.  He pointed out that many people are expressing that the process is taking too long as people need help now but that assumes that fares will be decreased.

3)      When the Strategic Budget Plan was first presented to the Board in May, there was a lot of discussion about staff making the assumption of a fare increase.  He noted that in the Board Bylaws[[1]](#_ftn1) it discusses the District doing an analysis every three years to determine if a fare increase is warranted.  The next analysis would be in January of 2015 but staff has decided to wait until 2016.  General Manager Washington reiterated the importance of having the result of the Fare Task Force before making a decision.

Director Daly said that when he rides the West line there seems to be a lot of confusion for the passengers about fare zones.  He hopes this is something that might be able to be simplified.  Director Daly recognized that they match to local, express and regional but that correlation is not evident to the riders.  Bruce Abel stated that the opening of the West line was one of those water shed moments that helped illustrates some of the paradoxes in our system.  He noted that previously a rider could ride a local bus from Golden to Downtown but now they must go through three zones on the light rail.

Director Daly suggested the Fare Task Force looks into having a family ticket plan.  He said it can be very expensive if a family of five or six is trying to use the West line.

Director Hoy pointed out that based on General Manager Washington’s comments, the time for the next fare increase would be now as it has not happened since 2011.  He believes that waiting to look at the fare in 2016 is just too long.  He stated that he is an advocate for the Board evaluating the fare every year.  Bruce Abel explained that the Fare Policy makes an assumption that fares are reviewed every third year to reconcile changes in the Consumer Price Index.  He said that with the Fare Task Force in place it really does not make sense to look at changes until 2016.  General Manager Washington reiterated that staff did not feel they could propose a fare change without having the Fare Task Force results.  He also noted that in the past, the public has hated having yearly nickel and dime increases.  He said this feeling may have changed, which is why the public outreach will be so important.

Director Hoy commented that in previous discussions staff indicated that this was just a fare simplification; however, it really seems like it is now tied into a change of fares as well.

Director Rivera-Malpiede wondered how long RTD had been offering the Non-profit Agency Reduced Fare program and how many agencies participate.  She also wondered how many transit agencies offered similar programs to help low-income riders.  Bruce Abel said that RTD has been offering this program for at least 15-20 years with approximately 250 non-profit agencies participating.  He stated that he was unsure of how many other agencies offered a similar reduced fare program.  General Manager Washington told the Board that perhaps this can be added to the scope of work for what the consultant will be looking at with our peer agencies.

Director Lasater shared that from personal experience people take small, incremental cost increases better than a large increase every three years.  When he was on the E-470 board the plan was to increase the tolls 25 cents every three years but people were very angry.  Director Lasater explained that when they moved to the license plate toll they began increasing it 5 to 10 cents every year.  He stated that there were very little complaints when done this way.  Director Lasater wonders if there has been a mindset adjustment since RTD’s experiences.  General Manager Washington agreed that this is something to look at again but noted public preference is not the only consideration; the internal cost is huge to change the fare every year.

Director Lasater asked if RTD had done an analysis of ridership when fare was increased.  He noted that E-470 saw a drop in usage but an increase in revenue; eventually the ridership came back.  Bruce Abel stated that what really drives RTD’s ridership is the price of gas.  There have been instances when the fare has increased and ridership has as well.

Chair Sisk thanked staff in advance for reaching out for public input at an earlier stage.  He believes this is a critical component of the Fare Task Force.  He encouraged staff to not limit the people with whom they are consulting; he feels this is an opportunity to really talk to our community, not just our non-profit agencies.

Director Rivera-Malpiede echoed Chair Sisk’s comments; she wholeheartedly agrees that this is a pivotal point for this agency to outreach to all 15 Districts.  She believes this is an opportunity not just for the income challenged, but for all our communities.

Committee Chair Solano thinks that it is great that we are doing a fare study.  He feels this needs to be done as thoroughly as possible in a timely manner.  Committee Chair Solano requested that staff come back to the Board every few months for a review and analysis.  He also suggested having a similar process as the Northwest Area Mobility Study for public communication.

Director Anderson commented that there are a lot of issues on the table with this, fare structure being one.  She agrees with Chair Sisk and Director Rivera-Malpiede that the Task Force needs broad participation.  She said it is not just the income challenged community that has issues with fare but the whole spectrum of people.  Director Anderson noted that when the Board raised fares before it was not easy; no matter what RTD does it will not be easy but it needs to be done thoroughly with a great deal of thought.

Bruce Abel stated that staff will be briefing the Board about the Task Force’s status/progress on a quarterly basis.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) After further discovery it was determined that this fare analysis is not part of the Board Bylaws but is outlined in the 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement that was approved by the Board at the October 29, 2013 Board Meeting.

##### a. Fare Information

#### 2. Smart Card Project Status Update

Judy McMurphy, Project Manager, informed the Board that over the past few weeks her team has been doing trending analysis on the reports that are coming from the Smart Card machines.  She said this has provided a lot of interesting information about how our riders are using their cards.  She shared that through this analysis they have identified that there are changes that need to be made in our equipment for people that tap frequently versus those that do not.  Judy McMurphy said that her team was working closely with Xerox to increase the number of cards that a validator can hold.

Judy McMurphy said that she was also looking internally at some of RTD’s business processes and system elements that are in place to support the program to improve its performance.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if Smart Cards will be able to address users that might have more than one Pass (i.e. NeighborhoodPass and EcoPass).  Judy McMurphy said absolutely; her team is monitoring reports for each company to make sure an employee does not show up more than once.  She said that fare inspectors and bus drivers are also being trained to look at the card to make sure the picture matches the user.

Chair Sisk stated that he hopes we get Smart Cards sooner rather than later.  He shared that recently he was on a SkyRide that was 20 minutes late leaving.  Chair Sisk noted that it can be frustrating watching someone put thirteen one-dollar bills into the machines.  He believes that Smart Cards would really assist in expediting the boarding process.

Bruce Abel stressed that staff is working diligently to have Smart Cards stood-up in a very professional and customer focused manner.
