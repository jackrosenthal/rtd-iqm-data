will be responsible for the overall performance and organizational effectiveness of
the RTD in carrying out its mission and objectives of being one of the nation’s
premier public transit agencies in providing safe, reliable, affordable and timely
service to the greater Denver region. The GM/CEO will work closely with the RTD
Board to provide accurate transparent advice, counsel and recommendations as
the Board works to set short and long term policy for the RTD in order to carry

1.C.1.a

The ideal GM/CEO candidate will be a passionate, dynamic and forward thinking
leader with strong interpersonal and communication skills and exceptional
negotiating skills. The GM/CEO will be a balanced leader who has the ability to
manage and lead an organization in a highly political, complex and transparent
environment. The GM/CEO must be someone who is capable of working
collaboratively with represented employees and building bridges internally and
externally to create opportunities for the advancement of the RTD’s strategic
objectives. In order to ensure the RTD’s success, the GM/CEO must be
progressive in identifying technological initiatives and other forward thinking
business practices that maximize efficiencies and offer service options to its
customers. These best practices will in turn allow the RTD to be a strong partner
to the local business community and the greater Denver region thereby advancing
the region’s economic development and environmental goals. Additionally, the
GM/CEO will work closely with the community and be an advocate for their needs
as it relates to mobility and regional development. The GM/CEO must listen
carefully and respond timely and appropriately to the public’s needs and requests.
The RTD takes great pride in its diversity and inclusion efforts and places great
value on workplace diversity and seeks a GM/CEO who will advance its goals of
offering a workplace environment and culture that embraces inclusion. The new
GM/CEO must continue to support and build upon a diverse and inclusive
workplace culture.
Interested candidates should possess a bachelor’s degree (graduate degree
preferred) in management, planning, public administration, transportation,
business, engineering or closely related field and at least 10 years of senior
management/executive management experience with supervisory, budgetary and
management responsibility over multiple divisions and functional areas. In lieu of
a bachelor’s degree, relevant work experience will be considered. Experience
working in or with the public sector/public transportation industry, local
government, or transportation or related organizations is highly desirable.

Attachment: Interim GM-CEO JD (4179 : GM/CEO Job Description)

As the RTD continues to complete one of the nation’s largest capital expansion
programs, the GM/CEO will work closely with the Board, staff, community, elected
and appointed officials and all other stakeholders to ensure that the day-to-day
administration of that program is completed on-time and on-budget. The GM/CEO
will also lead a highly talented and committed workforce that oversees day-to-day
operations and maintenance thereby ensuring that RTD continues to deliver a
high level of rail, bus and paratransit services to its customers on a daily basis. In
doing so, the GM/CEO will create a positive work environment by leading his/her
executive leadership team and engaging with employees on a daily basis, both in
the offices and out in the field, to foster a collaborative, innovative, progressive
work culture and positive work environment.
