Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 13
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 13 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $978,957.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula and modification to the graphics, radio
wiring and emergency exit door to the original price quotes results in a per bus unit cost of $75,555 for
a FlexRide bus and $73,926 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace
eleven - 2011/2012 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the FlexRide service and provide two
expansion buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2011 and 2012 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 8 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in
service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $978,966.55. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Purchase Forty-six (46) 40 foot Low Floor
Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of forty six (46) new 40 foot
transit buses from Gillig, LLC and associated spare components, and extended warranties for a total
price not to exceed $22,527,120 with an option to purchase up to 264 additional 40 foot buses over a
five year period.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 20, 2019 for the procurement of new 40 foot transit
buses. Proposals were received on August 13, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from three companies: Gillig, New Flyer and Nova. The proposers submitted
their cost per bus as follows:
Nova Bus
New Flyer
Gillig
$458,924.00 $479,900.00 $462,252.00
The proposals were rated according to costs as well as independent evaluation by members of RTD Bus
Maintenance staff on the ability of the proposers to comply with RTD’s technical specification
requirements, their estimated lifecycle costs and their qualifications. Although Gillig was not the lowest
cost per bus, staff members unanimously rated Gillig the highest in meeting RTD’s technical
specification requirements, lifecycle costs and qualifications, and subsequently Gillig received the highest
overall rating. Gillig has proven experience and qualification in manufacturing of transit buses, being one
of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig also has a history of
meeting delivery schedule requirements.
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to that which is currently utilized at RTD, with a proven seating
layout that is approved by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) to maximize wheelchair

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

passenger space. The buses are equipped with clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements.
Overall, the estimated lifetime of each bus will reduce emissions by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases,
6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and 0.25 tons of Particulate Matter as compared to the engines in the
current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of forty six (46) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $22,527,120. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 264 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly. Additional future bus purchases from these options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to enter into the agreement with Gillig, LLC for the purchase of
forty six (46) 40’ transit buses and various spare components and extended warranties. This is
the recommended alternative.
2. Purchase buses from another manufacturer. This may result in a slightly lower initial capital
purchase price but will result in additional operational costs for spare parts, add complexity to the
fleet thereby reducing efficiency, as well as delay delivery of the buses. This is not
recommended.
3. Do not proceed with the purchase of new 40’ transit buses. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This will also increase ongoing maintenance costs and affect fleet reliability.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2019. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals (82.9%) in the second quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 84.5% was below goal of 86.0%. For 2019, the goal of 86.0% reflects passenger OTP,
which is consistent with fixed route. The deficiency is caused by a combination of not being able to
maintain adequate staffing levels, a high rate of operators on FMLA, and the increasing number of trips
requested during peak travel hours along with software limitations of current software to smooth the
demand.
Goal 5.3 – Improve ADA Courtesy
Average ADA complaints per boarding of 0.002 was higher than goal of 0.001. Staffing challenges
are leading to a higher number of complaints.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Year-to-date ridership for 2019 was down 3.5% from 2018. The decline was centered in bus service
and mirrors the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Year-to-date fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 5.4% and 4.0%, respectively, over the
same time last year but are currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 14.2% and 13.6%. These
goals for 2019 are annual measures and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to attrition,
retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy. Bus operator vacancies
are improved over first quarter and year-end 2018. Bus mechanic vacancies have grown mostly in the
body shop which offset improvements in general repair.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2019

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions currently
operated by First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce City
and Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District. The
performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2019 key performance
measures through the 2nd quarter 2019. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement throughout the remainder of 2019. The following is a more detailed discussion
of fixed route contractor performance through the 2nd Quarter of 2019.


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000
miles through the 2nd quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet goal (2.11) but are addressing
identified trends through enhanced training and safety pep-rallies. As a result of these efforts,
First Transit Denver is already seeing an improvement in the beginning of Q3. First Transit and
Transdev continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations
for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at
monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities
and on the street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 2nd quarter. Of the 9 passenger accidents that occurred during the 2nd quarter, only
one was classified as non-preventable. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.19
Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles compared to 0.31 during the 1st quarter. All of the bus
operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger
safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 2nd quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

Packet Pg. 20

1.C.2



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 2nd
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (85.4%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected
detours and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators
with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly
basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to
discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 86% on-time performance. Running time
issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 2nd quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 2nd quarter. Deficiencies were identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive
Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have been
implemented to address these issues. A new Maintenance Manager was also hired at the
Longmont facility. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations to
ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive maintenance inspections on-time,
working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for
mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of .0004 Complaints per
Boarding in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool
to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above
regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors
also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
2nd Quarter Summary 2019

RouteMatch Mobile Application Option

Daisy Wall and Mike Holcomb, RouteMatch Community Engagement and IT Developer,
showed APAC the On-Demand mobile application both on screen and using a screen reader.
They demonstrated how a trip would be booked and a few features.
The On-Demand application allows for integration of other types of trips (e.g., taxi, rideshare), as well as RTD trip negotiation and immediate incorporation of the trip into the RTD
system.
RouteMatch is working with two expert/consulting organizations to complete an accessibility
audit (DC in Phoenix, and Georgia Tech Center for Inclusive Design Innovation). They will
identify areas that need to be addressed to improve accessibility.
This application is currently being used in Seattle and Toronto, and RouteMatch is working
to improve the application further to be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.0 AA, as well as looking to incorporate as many improvements as possible to
comply with the WCAG 2.1 amendment without creating significant time delays.

Update: RTD Rapid Transit Plans

Rapid Transit is a dedicated fixed guideway/lane for transit. It may dedicate an existing travel
lane to buses all day, or only in peak periods, or a lane maybe added and dedicated to buses
(although there are few places where this growth is possible). RTD has not made decisions
about any additional Rapid Transit corridors yet. They are currently conducting a feasibility
study.
Bill Sirois and Michael Washington, RTD, provided an overview of the status of the Rapid
Transit feasibility study. The study started looking at any area where bus rapid transit would
make sense, then conducted several evaluation stages to narrow down the list – eliminating
less feasible options and increasing the data gathered on options remaining.
Currently, they are conducting the tier four evaluation on eight remaining options: Colorado
Boulevard; Federal; Speer/Parker Road; 38th; South Broadway; Alameda; North I-25; and
Havana. Tier four evaluation, among other elements, is considering which corridor will most
successfully meet Federal funding criteria. This tier will result in three-four options for further
data gathering and analysis.
The tier four evaluation results will also feed into RTD’s Transportation Transformation (T2)
planning process. The T2 process is looking at how to optimize service now, and where to

prioritize resources for 2050 (this is the first long-term planning since FasTracks; it is a 2year process).

Other Updates


Update: Review changes to the Access-a-Ride survey
Based on Access-a-Ride feedback there were a few changes made to the survey. The
questions are being finalized and sent to the consultant (BBC Research) who will start
conducting the survey outreach next week.



Status Report: CCDC paratransit Issues mailed and RTD response
CCDC sent a letter to RTD articulating seven concerns, several of them paratransit
related. RTD drafted and mailed a response. In the future, RTD have Access-a-Ride
concerns go through the APAC discussions.



Update on ACPD
May’s ACPD meeting included:
o Awards for eight ADA heroes. One was for an Access-a-Ride receptionist:
Abby De Herrera.
o Specifications for parking areas. Reviewed preliminary data on a third handicap
placard (purple) for people of short stature or wheelchair that cannot reach
the standard parking meter. This is not federally recognized so there are some
places that will not take it.
o Improvements for enforcement handicap placards on private property.
Enforcement is weaker on private property; local law enforcement is less likely
to intercede.
o Safety issues on bus route #20. This route has many medical facilities,
therefore there are more riders with wheelchairs, crutches, etc. Suggestion
was talk with route drivers on how to improve safety.
o Pedestrian lights at civic center are not being observed.
o City and County of Denver’s 16th mall project. The environmental impact study
is nearing completion. Concerns were raised about the project’s proposed
removal of curbs. ACPD will send a letter of concerns and interests to Denver
public works (decisions makers).
o Next meeting is the 3rd Thursday (August 15th?), at Blake street RTD offices.

Special Services 2nd Quarter Report

RTD’s FlexRide services are currently operated by Via Mobility, MV Transit and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. With FlexRide bus divisions located in Boulder, Denver and Evergreen, our contract partners
provide FlexRide services to 21 distinct service areas throughout the RTD District. The performance for
Via Mobility, MV Transit, and the Senior’s Resource Center is measured on Ridership, Customer
Contacts, Preventable Vehicle Accidents and Productivity (boardings per service hour).
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
Via Mobility, MV Transit and Senior’s Resource Center as a group, reduced Customer Contacts and
remained consistent with the same period in 2018 for Preventable Vehicle Accidents. Our contract
partners did experience a decrease in ridership, but remained productive in many of the FlexRide
services. FlexRide staff continue to monitor low performing FlexRide services to help increase ridership
and productivity. The following is a more detailed discussion of the FlexRide contractor performance
through the 2nd quarter of 2019.
Ridership
Total FlexRide ridership for 2019 was less than the prior year. Boardings in 2018 were 236,819 and
2019 were 223,716. Low fuel prices contributed to the decrease in ridership, which gives customers a
low-cost alternative to using the FlexRide service. Seasonal variations in ridership associated with the
end of the 2019 school year also impacted ridership in many of the FlexRide service areas. This
included Brighton, Evergreen, Federal Heights, Longmont and Parker FlexRides. Arapahoe, Dry Creek
and South Jefferson County FlexRide services did experience modest ridership growth when comparing
2019 YTD to 2018 ridership.
Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a decrease in overall customer contacts through the 2nd quarter 2019 compared to
2018.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator related
(within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement. Starting in the 2nd Quarter of
2018, customer contacts were further monitored for an “at fault” and “not at fault” classification, based
on the investigation and review of the contact.

1.C.4

During 2018, driver turnover was higher in the first part of the year in comparison to 2019 and may be
the contributing factor to lower customer contacts.
The number of all other customer comments received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new
service or a change in service which can include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site
issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
2nd Quarter 2019: 201
2nd Quarter 2018: 199
Preventable Accidents
The preventable accident rate through the 2nd quarter 2019 remained at the same level as the same
period in 2018 with 13 preventable accidents. Contractors have continued to retrain operators identified
as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of “ride-alongs” performed by operations
specialists and training staff.
2nd Quarter 2019: 13
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.912
2nd Quarter 2018: 13
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.912
Productivity
A number of FlexRide areas continued to remain productive. Most of these serve business parks that
connect with the light rail (Arapahoe, Meridian, North Inverness and South Inverness) or communities
where residents utilize the service (Golden and Superior). Staff continue to monitor FlexRides with low
productivity and work with the local municipalities and RTD Marketing to identify strategies for
improving ridership. The attached 2019 Special Services 2nd Quarter Report provides the productivity
numbers for each of the FlexRides and some other special services for which RTD provides cost-share
funding. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service is 3.0 boardings per hour.

Customer Comment Analysis - 2nd Quarter
2019

Customer comments through the 2nd Quarter of 2019 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2018. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 2nd Quarter of 2019 was 8,017. The total number for the same period in
2018 was 9,623. Specific customer comment categories showing improvement in 2019 include “Bus
Did Not Show,” “Bus Early,” “Bus Late,” “Discrimination,” “Improper Procedure/Operator,” “Incorrect
Information” and “Passed up Passenger at Stop.” The customer comment categories of “Careless
Driving/Operator,” “Discourtesy/Operator,” and “Fare Dispute” showed increases over 2018. RTD and
the private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action as
needed to address deficiencies and improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 2nd Quarter of 2019. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2018.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:









Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.




Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings

Packet Pg. 38

1.C.5









wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator
wages effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in
applicants and employee retention. With the increases in headcount, additional strategies are
being implemented to help reduce the amount of dropped service and the associated comments.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2019, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 57.7% compared to the
same period in 2018. RTD and the private contractors are showing strong improvement regarding
operator headcount. Continuing efforts to reduce operator vacancies will help ensure that service is
provided per published schedules. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 4.02 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 9.50 comments per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 15.1% compared to the same
period in 2018. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 39

1.C.5

YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.80 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 4.47 comments per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 11.7% compared to the same
period in 2018. Improvements to staffing levels have resulted in improvements in this category.
Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually reviewed by RTD
Service Planning and Scheduling. As a result, a significant number of service changes were made in May
to improve on-time performance and service reliability. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is
6.74 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 7.64 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 4.5% compared to
the same period in 2018. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.85
comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 3.68 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 15.7% compared to the
same period in 2018. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed proper
procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or
explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating area,
addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 8.93 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 7.72 comments per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 20.8% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.23 comments per day. The comparable number for
2018 was 0.29 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 3.5% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.98 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 0.94 comments per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 18.7%
compared to the same period in 2018. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2019 is 5.66 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 6.96 comments per day.

Packet Pg. 40

1.C.5

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 4.5% compared to the
same period in 2018. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, Operations
Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide
operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns.
Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact on this
category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and Trainers,
and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.35 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 0.36 comments per day.
Passed up Passenger at Stop – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 16.0%
compared to the same period in 2018. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (99 of the total 1764 = 5.61%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 9.75 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 11.60 comments per day.

Re:

Service Availability – August 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.62% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in August 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflects a fairly
consistent number compared the same month (August) last year. Service delivery overall has
improved steadily since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





August 2019 – 163.56 hours
August 2018 – 163.00 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,567.77 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,155.01 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in August were special events (such as: Rolling
Stones Concert, CU Fall Semester start, August service change combined with school trippers,
Colorado Bicycle Classic, Rockies home games, Broncos pre-season home games, the Rocky
Mountain Showdown and unplanned bus bridges).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.62% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,721 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 21,278 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.

Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Second Quarter ~ April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement
Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain-clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain-clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

Re:

Service Performance 2018

Attached is the annual report on RTD service performance by route and service class.
The report evaluates the two primary measures of cost-effectiveness and productivity
to illustrate how each route meets RTD Service Policies and Standards. In particular
it highlights which routes are performing well and which are not and need attention.
The service development staff uses this report to help plan for proposed service
changes each year, along with other more detailed information. As always, staff is
available to discuss this report with Board members and others.

Service Performance 2018
Networked Family of Services

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to
help make judgments about performance. Each
rectangle labeled by service type represents the domain
for routes that meet or exceed the 10%
minimum/maximum performance requirements for that
service class. So this is a case where it’s bad to be
“outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective—maximize ridership within
the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy
per
boarding.

comparative analysis of all classes of services,
illustrating both absolute and relative performance.

Same subsidy,

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak
periods and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly
exceeds the minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line
at 25 boardings per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute
frequency, and the green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see
RTD’s Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).
NOTE
In 2017 the new fare revenue allocation model was implemented. Also all bus and rail ridership boardings
are now obtained from our automatic passenger counters (APCs). Thus, relative to years earlier, bus
boardings are about 8% higher in general than before.

Overview
RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service
development and performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or
demand? Should service be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s
general approach is as follows. Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the
services together in a network to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-ofservice with demand, thus improving performance and sustainability.

1.C.10.b

Definitions
 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Vehicle (Train) Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: A new revenue allocation model was implemented in 2017. Revenue allocation is based
on cash fare equivalents, fare zones, rider surveys and total fare revenue. The average fare for local bus
service is calculated as a basis, then local cash fare equivalents are calculated by fare zone. These
average fares are then applied to boardings by route, class and zone.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus
depreciation on all RTD assets, excluding interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost
allocation model allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting
line items are assigned to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10%
of routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate
the acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each
class of service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted
data, assuming the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard
deviation and confidence intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average.
The following table gives the current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Bus boardings and service hours reasonably match each other as shares among the service classes. Rail
and Mall services carry many riders relative to the resources they require, while Call-n-Ride and Access-aRide are the opposite. The Subsidy per Boarding (cost-effectiveness) and Boardings per Hour (productivity)
charts also reflect these balances, though rail has a lower cost-effectiveness and higher productivity than
bus services.

Comparison by Class of Service
It is useful to compare all of the classes of service together to help judge the equitable distribution of
services throughout the District. One size does not fit all, so there are a variety of services classes to meet
a variety of market needs, each with its own performance expectation or standard. Customer market share
by class of service is depicted in the Boardings chart and resource allocation is depicted in the Vehicle
Hours chart. Since a boarding may be a transfer and over 50% of all customer trips include at least one
transfer, there is overlap among the classes which is not captured in the chart. Often a customer’s trip
could not be completed without the connectivity that RTD purposefully designs into its networked family
of services. The map illustrates RTD services by service class and the underlying density warrants for
service coverage.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of August, 2019 listed in route number order.
Route 1 Alameda Ave – This service meets the 10% subsidy standard, but is slightly short of the 10%
productivity standard. The continued slide in ridership performance is related to both changes in ridership
and a slight increase in hours for CBA compliance and service performance.

Route 27 East Yale Ave - In an effort to increase productivity on the Route 27, it was split in to two
separate route services. In August of 2018, the new Route 26 - West Yale Avenue service began operating
between Southwest Plaza and Englewood Station. The new Route 27 – East Yale service now operates
between University Hills and Ulster - Tufts.
Route 28 28th Ave - Service east of the CBD continues to fall below the service standard, likely due to
changing demographics. Previous plans to consolidate the eastern segment of the Route 28 with the Route
43 (proposed in the A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plans) failed adoption in 2016.
Route 31L North Federal Limited - This route has been discontinued with the implementation of the G
Line bus and rail service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy continue to perform below standards, likely
due to changing demographics east of the CBD. With the move of the VA Hospital, this service continues
to perform below standards.
Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was replaced in August 2019 with the new Platte Valley FlexRide
service.
Route 39L North Colorado Limited – Route exceeds the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the
10% subsidy standard. This route is planned to be restructured in the North Metro Bus and Rail service
plan.
Route 46 South Dahlia Street – Meets the 10% subsidy standard, but slightly below the productivity
standard. This service was reduced in 2017 and truncated in 2018 to increase productivity.
Route 67 Ridge Road – This service meets the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. It was recommended for discontinuance in 2012, but it was retained due to the absence of
alternative services in the SW Jeffco area.
Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — This route was discontinued with the implementation of the G Line
bus and rail service plan.
Route 80L West 80th Limited – Significantly under performing in both ridership and subsidy standards, this
route has been merged with Route 80 in the G – Line bus and rail service Plan.
Route 85 Chatfield Avenue — This route was discontinued in August 2018.

Attachment: Performance 2018 Complete (3924 : Service Performance 2018)

Route 3L East Alameda Limited - This service performs well above the 10% productivity standard, but
falls just below the 10% subsidy standard as a result of its peak only operation. Two pm peak trips were
consolidated in 2018 to increase cost effectiveness.

1.C.10.b

Regional Transportation District
Route 87L South Wadsworth Limited - The route currently exceeds the 10% boardings per hour standard,
though below the subsidy per boarding standard. We will continue to monitor its performance for further
action.
Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This service was discontinued in January 2018.

Route 104X Commerce City Denver - Serving a relatively small commuter market this service saw a
decline in ridership and an increase in operating cost which has pushed its subsidy per boarding below
10% standard although it meets the productivity standard. However, this route will likely be positively
impacted by the North Metro Bus and Rail service plan.
Route 112 West 112th Avenue – Currently this route exceeds the 10% boarding per hour standard, but
falls slightly short of the 10% standard for subsidy per boarding. Route restructure in May 2018 made to
improve the efficiency of the route. Overall boardings per hour increased in 2018 over 2017.
Route 116X South Simms – This service meets productivity standard, but has performed below the
subsidy standard since the introduction of the W Line light rail service. A slight reduction in operating cost
shows decrease in subsidy per boarding for 2018.
Route 128 Broomfield/Wagon Road - Route falls short on both subsidy and boardings standards. Route
restructure occurred in May 2018 to improve overall efficiency. Further adjustments are possible.
Route 131 Iliff – Current falls below both standards. Will be monitored.
Route 139 Quincy – Meets productivity standard, but is just below the 10% subsidy standard. Will be
monitored.
Route 145X Brighton/Denver Airport - This service continues to fall below the subsidy standard, but meets
productivity standard. This service is proposed to be restructured in the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — This route was newly implemented in April 2016, formed from former
segments of Routes 10, 130 and 169. A service reduction was made in August 2018 to improve
productivity. There was a slight increase in productivity, but a large increase in operational costs has
worsened the subsidy per boarding and it does not yet meet standards.
Route 169L Buckley/Tower DIA Limited – Due to the length of this service and surrounding land use, it
falls short of the subsidy standard, but significantly exceeds the productivity standard. The route was
truncated at Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run in 2018 in an effort to increase effectiveness and come in to
compliance with the CBA. 2018 performance is seeing increases in performance in both subsidy and
boarding per hour.
Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield – January 2019, route was extended to serve the Kestrel Development,
which should increase ridership.
Route 236 Boulder Junction/US 36 & Table Mesa - Service was introduced in January 2017. Current
ridership remains low and is being considered for restructure.

1.C.10.b

Regional Transportation District

Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved
somewhat. It remains below subsidy and productivity standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and
rail service plan. The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe
and the Route 410 in Parker. Service meets productivity standars, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. Will be monitored.

Route EV Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver – This route is below subsidy and just above ridership standards
and will be monitored. Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018.
Route J Longmont/Gunbarrel Boulder — This route is below subsidy standard. We will continue to monitor
before taking further action.
LD/LX Longmont/Denver - Performance of this service is down slightly from the former Route L service it
replaced. Current proposals would adjust service levels on the Route LD to better match ridership
productivity and improve subsidy performance.
Route R/RC/RX Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased
modestly, but it still does not meet service standards. Two midday trips were discontinued January 2019,
due to low ridership and to improve subsidy performance.
Lone Tree FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. Both ridership and
productivity improved slightly from 2016. However, the City has their own Lone Tree Link service since
2015, which competes for ridership between the Lincoln rail station and several large employers. Services
will be reevaluated with the opening of SERE in 2019, when the Link will be discontinued.
*Louisville FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. RTD is working
with City on marketing service and adding a shopping trip to help ridership.
*Thornton FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is below subsidy standards. RTD will continue marketing
with assistance from the municipalities and North TMO.
B Line – Though ridership on the B Line had improved in 2018 operations cost increases pushed the
subsidy per boarding figures below the 10% standard. More recently, the introduction of the G Line service
has had an effect on the ridership on the B Line, which we will continue to monitor.
R Line – The R Line was implemented in February of 2017. Weekend service was reduced in 2018 to
better match ridership demands. The SERE Service plan returned the weekend service levels in 2019.
Current data shows an increase in ridership to 48 boardings per hour weekday, 36.6 brdgs/hr. Saturday
and 45 brdgs/hr Sunday.

Subject:

Adoption of the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial
Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 11, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement states that on an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Mid-term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital
and operating programs. Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that RTD will prepare an annual update
of the FasTracks plan which will be integrated with the Base System plan into the Mid-term Financial
Plan incorporating actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital
and operating programs.
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan consisting of the Base System and FasTracks.
The Base System MTFP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6%
sales/use tax, and FasTracks operations activity. The FasTracks MTFP includes expense and projects
(non-operational) funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information
used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that
the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial
Plan serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are
developed to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such
as principal and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs
to the District. The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during
the six-year time period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that
RTD will have adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and
use tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term

Packet Pg. 82

2.B.1

Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of ColoradoLeeds School of Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement, Transit Asset Management
Plan and State of Good Repair priorities. Projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of
revenues and funding sources available for their completion and operation.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that
receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the MTFP qualifying
projects are included in the TIP.
Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2026-2040 are presented
separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Base System
The attached MTFP for the Base System incorporates the 2019 Amended Budget with necessary
adjustments and best estimates at this time. The Base System plan drafts were presented to the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee on May 7th and July 9th for discussion. The final
presentation follows in this document on September 17th with staff recommendation for Board
adoption on September 24th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2020-2025 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2019 Amended Budget. The column titled Forecast Amended Budget 2019 in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget.
The Base System plan is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the
projections:
1) March-2019 sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business
2) Minimum/must-have requested capital and expense projects approved in the previous
year’s plan with costs in outlying years, including fleet requirements
3) High priority new project requests within State of Good Repair parameters, including fleet
requirements
4) Reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical requested projects
5) SOGR allowance in 2025
6) Use of previously-issued debt and internal funds to support planned fleet purchases
7) New COP (Certificates of Participation) financing issued in 2022 to support planned fleet
purchases
7) Contribution to reserve funds in all years of the plan
8) No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route service through this period
Exhibit I summarizes the Base System 2020-2025 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
Revenue estimates:

Packet Pg. 83

2.B.1



Fare revenue of $124.4 million in 2020 is based on the recommended fare change
proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. The fare
revenue through the six-year period is sourced from assumptions in the fare change
proposal and a fare rate increase in 2022 and 2025. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March-2019 semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2019-2025. In all years of the Mid-term Financial plan,
the medium baseline forecast from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6%
is apportioned to the Base System. (Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The
mean forecast through 2020 is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $646.0
million on the low side and $732.3 million for the upper bound (at 1% sales/use
tax rate). The upper bound estimate is 6.1% higher than the medium baseline
forecast, meaning that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow
somewhat strongly over the next year.
Likewise, economic threats pose
downside risk to the forecast, with a 6.4% lower bound. The values of the high
and low forecast bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that
a 0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast values
will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue projected receipts are based upon past trends, formula allocations, and
known proceeds. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer Price Index (CPI)
(obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA
and miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2020. (Line 4)
Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items
and necessary increases/reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2020:
2.6%
2021:
2.6%
2022:
2.6%
2023:
2.6%
2024:
2.6%
2025:
2.6%
 Operating expenses include higher costs for purchased transportation contracts in all
years of the plan as various contracts are re-bid. The additional costs excluding start-up
costs are programmed at $7.2 million beginning in 2020 and then escalated.
 Service increase consists of the cost of new service projects to be operated by RTD in
2020-2022 to include the Golden FlexRide service. RTD costs will be reimbursed in full
with contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
RTD will make the
determination in future years whether to continue such service. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, HLine extension, and SERE are fully allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers for all years of the plan. In addition, a portion of overhead costs is also allocated
for the Commuter Rail Lines. Thus, Base total expenses are reduced by the amount of
the allocation. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2020 and then escalated at the CPI rate for 2021-2025. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at the 2019 lock price of $2.30/gallon and escalated at the
national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)

Packet Pg. 84

2020:
2.2%
2021:

2022:
2.3%
2023:
2.2%
2024:
2.3%
2025:
2.2%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.90/gallon in 2020, which is same cost per gallon used in the
2019 budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/musthave operating and maintenance projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs
in outlying years, plus high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities.
These projects are detailed in Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available
cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end.
Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV.
o It should be noted that included in the operating projects line item is an allocation to
FasTracks for certain projects that serve both the Base System and FasTracks. Also,
a SOGR allowance of $3.5 million is included in the year 2025. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks bus service, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
Investment income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year by
1) using debt amortization schedules for current debt and 2) forecasting new interest
expense on anticipated new debt issued based on forward interest rate curves. (Line 16)
The line item for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
capital projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs in outlying years, plus the
minimum required new fleet, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR
priorities, detailed in Exhibit II. Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to
exceed cash flow constraints determined in the plan model. Other projects may be added
based on available cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances
at year-end. Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV.
(Line 19)
Regarding the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted operating
reserve:
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3
million in 2020-2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of $41.4 million in
2025. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund not be funded until 2024 and then
at $3 million each year through 2025. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$6.0 million in 2025. The capital replacement fund was drawn to zero in 2018 to
support capital expenditures (fleet acquisition). (Lines 21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including
revenue shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and
funded with available cash flow. In all years of the Base System plan, the
unrestricted operating fund will be funded with available cash flow, but staff
recommends that the unrestricted operating fund be drawn minimally in 2020-2023

Packet Pg. 85

2.B.1

to help balance the plan. This fund is projected to reach a balance of $28.6 million in
2025. (Lines 22 and 35)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be $76.0 million in 2025.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to
be necessary over the course of this six-year plan. (Line 23)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
New debt issuance of $30 million will become necessary in the plan in 2022. (Line 25)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year for current and future debt using debt amortization schedules. Principal payments
are forecast on both existing and new debt balances. (Line 26)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at each yearend, estimated changes to restricted reserves, available project funds, and the use of
previously-issued COP-bond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30,
and 31)
The plan is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$2 million each year through 2025 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its MTFP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the plan will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the plan, Title VI impacts
are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. A comprehensive Title VI review will be
undertaken and a certification of review will be issued by the Title VI manager.
FasTracks
The underlying assumptions for FasTracks in the 2020-2025 MTFP are consistent with those used in
the Base System:
 Fare revenues are projected based on the fare structure changes approved by the Board in
September 2018, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates.
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the March 2019
Leeds forecasts.
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate.
 Additional fixed guideway grants are assumed beginning nine years after corridors enter
revenue service.
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the Base
System.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the Base System and the FasTracks plan bus service
increase feed directly from the Base System plan.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the North Metro project include startup costs to prepare
for revenue service under RTD operation.
 Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project are assumed at
0.3% of installed asset value, starting seven years after the corridors enter revenue service.
The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the FasTracks plan is approximately
$5.6 billion. There are two changes from the 2019-2024 MTFP:
 Additional funding for the North Metro settlement, approved by the Board in October 2018 $15.0 million
 Increase in estimated third party in-kind contributions for the Eagle Project, offset by an
increase in estimated revenues - $15.0 million

Packet Pg. 87

2.B.1

Project-by-project costs are included as Exhibit VII.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current plan would require identification of
funding sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore,
the FasTracks plan is a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards
completion and any changes approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected FasTracks cash flow through 2025 does not require Base System funding to support
FasTracks corridor operations and maintenance. However, funding from the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) will be needed in 2024 and 2025 to fund FasTracks corridor operations and
maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2025 is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Mid-term Financial Plan provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive
unrestricted year-end fund balance in each year of the plan while growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the plan, and may
challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2020 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan.

Packet Pg. 88

2.B.1

2. Defer the adoption of a 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan to a later date. This is not
recommended because the Mid-term Financial Plan identifies the capital programs, expenditures,
and service guidelines for the 2020 budget process and adoption of the plan serves as a
confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2020 Budget.
3. Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2020-2025
Mid-term Financial Plan. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the Mid-term
Financial Plan adoption and possible delay in the 2020 budget process.

Our current frame pulling machine is now obsolete. The company we purchased it
from is no longer in business and we can no longer find safe replacement parts. The
machine is also very dangerous to use, and no longer is meeting our needs to
straighten the frames on buses. The replacement machine is a safer and more
accurate means of straightening vehicle frames. This machine is needed to help us fix
accident vehicles and get them back on the street in as timely a fashion as possible.
This is a critical piece of equipment for body shop repairs that must be replaced.

Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management System (CRM)

Location
Civic Center Plaza (CCP)

Project Description
TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the Distrct.

predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR

Mariposa Light Rail Division Recent cyber security audits from DHS and Parsons identified several deficiencies in
the Supervisory Controls Environment (SCE) security environment. Currently, there is
no Security Information and Event Monitoring (SIEM) within the SNE or authentication
of switch access control to the SCE domain. Additionally, a two-layer Remote Access
architecture is required since the SCE gateway is directly to the Internet. The
Supervisory Controls Department is requesting funding to purchase software and
hardware technology to support SIEM, RADIUS, and Remote Access functions within
the SCE. The target technologies are the QRadar SIEM, HP RADIUS server, and
Bomgar RAS server. These technologies will address 100% of the information security

Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.

Standard Security Architecture for
Supervisory Controls (SC SSA)

Location
Project Description
Mariposa Light Rail Division The existing Supervisory Controls Network (SCN) has limited cyber security features
both in the Mariposa Computer Center and Communication Houses. The SCN enables
the Light Rail OCC to operate and manage the Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) fleet from within
the Mariposa OCC. The Supervisory Controls (SC) department has adopted a Standard
Security Architecture used in Industrial Controls environments to security critical
controls from unauthorized access and comply with recent cyber security audits from
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Parsons Security. The SC SSA
establishes a high level of network compartmentalization and integrates multi-layer
security technology within the SCN to minimize propagation of Malware and
unauthorized access. Specifically, the SC SSA compartmentalizes the core computing
environment (Mariposa Computer Room) and the extended networks (Comm Houses)
to establish firewalled gateways within and between corridors to reduce networkwide Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). The SC SSA also
allows for secured communication with the RTD IT environment to share Light Rail
Vehicle (LRV) and alignment data between systems. The SC SSA will address
approximately 70% of the cyber security issues identified in the recent audits.

Cab Signaling on LRVs

Districtwide

The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet and the additional LRVs on order. Additionally the project funds
would provide for new signal software for each of our existing corridors that currently
have Automatic Train Stop (ATS) functionality.

Project Description
Project is to replace the bus wash at East Metro. Bus wash is over 15 years old and will
have reached the end of its useful life. The bus wash is breaking down more
frequently and repair parts are getting more difficult to find.
This hoist is an original hoist in the building. It has reached the end of its useful life
expectancy. The brake hoist requires constant maintenance and parts are becoming
obscure. NABI buses will not work on this hoist due to the age of the hoist and the
lifting capacity.
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

Project Description

Longmont to Boulder @ SH 119

Longmont/Boulder

Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the SH 119
Corridor to connect Boulder and Longmont in accordance with the recommendation
of the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that approximately half
of the total costs for this project would be grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in
the corridor would raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately 5,000
daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates and design will be established
through environmental clearance and preliminary engineering ahead of construction.
The project is anticipated to take two years to construct.

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system to
a full account-based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to purchase
and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account-Based Ticketing
features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based smart card
accounts to account-based smart card accounts. Expected to be completed by January
2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M. RTD anticipates receiving
a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

The existing Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) is model ST80 and does not meet current
credit card security standards which is one of RTD s greatest security vulnerabilities.
The TVM should have P2PE, EMV and meet PCI-DSS. P2PE is a point-to-point
encryption solution which is a combination of secure devices, applications and
processes that encrypt data from the point of transaction to the bank. EMV stands for
Europay, MasterCard, and Visa. These three companies developed the chip reader
technology for secure transactions. Companies that don t use EMV will take
responsibility for fraudulent transactions. EMV (chip and pin) is a service that is visible
to our customers and they have come to know, expect, and associate with modern
security. PCI-DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which sets
the requirements for organizations and sellers to safely and securely accept, store,
process, and transmit cardholder data during credit card transaction to prevent fraud
and data breaches. Scheidt & Bachmann (S&B) has proposed an upgrade to the ST80
TVM because they are out of PCI-DSS compliance so the operating system needs to be
upgraded to Windows 10 in order to work with the FareGo back-end. This is a request
for $2,800,000 to be spent by 2022 on an open procurement to replace all ST80 TVMs
and the backend system. With this plan all of the old TVMs will have P2PE, EMV and
meet PCI-DSS by the fall of 2022.

Project Description

15L Route Improvements

Colfax - East - ITS

Request is to proceed with the Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project. RTD has
received a Federal Ladders of Opportunity grant to fund a capital project to reduce
travel time and increase security and ridership for 15L bus route. The project
includes: stop amenity improvements (repair and replace existing amenities, lighting,
shelters, security cameras), bus bulbs at a few locations, transit signal priority (TSP),
and bypass lanes/queue jumps. The project includes East Colfax from Broadway east
to Potomac (near I-225). It is important to note that from Yosemite to Potomac, the
project will only include improved stop amenities.

University of Denver AV Shuttle

Park-n-Ride

RTD has applied for grant funding from USDOT to implement a fleet of autonomous
transit vehicles at the University of Denver campus. The vehicles use EasyMile s EZ10
(the same vehicle used for the 61AV pilot) and operate from University Station, south
on High St, and east on Iliff Avenue, where the vehicles would turn around on an
internal campus road and return to the light rail station via the same route. This
application was submitted in partnership with the City and County of Denver,
Transportation Solutions, University of Denver, and EasyMile and requested
approximately $6.3 million in federal funds. RTD's proposed contribution to the
project would be $25,000. We expect award notification to occur before summer
2019, with the project activities beginning shortly afterwards. The schedule for the
project includes one full year of planning and setup and two years of operation. If
awarded funding, RTD expects to begin planning activities in the summer of 2019 and
begin operation in the summer of 2020.

Project Description

FlexPass Program

Blake Street Office

RTD offers to its Riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The
FlexPass program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for
RTD as well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to
overall customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to
choose their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the
program at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to
participate including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5
million in annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March
2010, RTD contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for in the immediate Smart Card
plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the district.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

compliance.
Project is to purchase and continually fund a suite of equipment, software and
cybersecurity specialist consulting services designed to identify security and
compliance gaps in our IT systems, remediate those gaps, and monitor for and
respond to suspicious activity in a timely manner. Assessment and mitigation requires
specialized skill sets and separation of duties (from RTD systems specialists) which are
more cost-effective and operationally effective to outsource at this time; additional
equipment and services are needed to achieve compliance and security goals such as
network separation, threat monitoring, and asset discovery.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

The business case is to enhance the existing Mobile Ticketing fare collection system to
a full account-based ticketing platform. In order to do this, RTD will need to purchase
and install validators on all bus and rail cars, enable the Account-Based Ticketing
features in the Mobile Ticketing platform and convert existing card based smart card
accounts to account-based smart card accounts. Expected to be completed by January
2022 or before. Total project budget is estimated at $3.6M. RTD anticipates receiving
a grant for $1.8M. RTD will provide a local match of $1.8M.

Project Description
This is incremental funding required for the existing Clever Devices contract #16DO18 contract hosting and warranty for the service planning and scheduling software
system.
Risk Management is looking for ways to improve our service level to both internal and
external customers. By upgrading our risk management information software, we will
avoid making data entry mistakes, automate processes and create efficiencies that
would allow the claims representative the opportunity to be more proactive. The
added functionality of a new system would result in improved communication and
assistance for injured employees as well as providing critical claim histories on bodily
injury and property claims which can be a red flag for potentially fraudulent claims.
SSAM and the Executive Safety and Security Committee is dedicated to improving the
safety of employees and the general public. Enabling an automated and hands free
compilation of claims data in our enterprise data warehouse or other software
employed by SSAM would provide SSAM and the Committee with facts and trends on
which to focus safety measures to reduce injuries.

RTD’s Rider Alert system is being replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead/Supervisor rather than reporting
directly to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

guide with a strong emphasis on multimodal connections and to develop a universally
legible wayfinding system connection to transit. This will improve first and last mile
connections to RTD services by standardizing wayfinding in the District and making it
easier to implement wayfinding systems in the future. RTD has committed $25,000 in
local match and Aurora and Denver has also committed a total of $25,000 in local
match. The total project budget is $250,000 and RTD s local match of $25,000 (10% of
the total project budget) will leverage $200,000 in DRCOG grant funding.

RTD has a GIS consultant to provide the following services: mapping services that
cannot be performed in-house, monitoring of the District's boundary for any new
annexations, and providing RTD with the most up-to-date list of precincts by countyj.
RTD has required this service since the creation of RTD in 1969 to keep accurate
records of district boundaries.
This project is an equity training initiative intended to mitigate the risk of both Title VI
and EEO discrimination lawsuits and complaints. The training will aim to provide RTD
employees and applicable contractors with cultural competency, implicit bias
management, de-escalation tactics and a basic understanding of civil rights
requirements. To save cost, a consultant will develop a training program
incorporating a train the trainer or train the facilitator approach. The Transit Equity
and Civil Rights offices will then collaborate to extend and maintain the training
program without consultant support. Customer facing (security officers, operators,
sales outlets, etc ), senior, and executive level employees are the priority for this
training initiative.

Security Command Center University Project

Location
Districtwide

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Carahsoft for licenses for the Salesforce Licenses (Customer Care Case Management/CRM) for an
amount not to exceed $2,200,000 over 4 years. Subscriptions for the Customer Care Case
Management/CRM will be paid annually.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #5 – Communication
BACKGROUND
The current TrapezeCom complaint management software is approaching end of life. RTD has selected
MTRAM (MAOIR) as a replacement for the scheduling and Runcutting needs. Since Trapeze will not be
the source of the scheduling and Runcutting data, trapeze Com will not work anymore for RTD’s case
management needs.
Starting in 2018, the Information Technology team along with Customer Care and Marketing began
researching various approaches for the districts CRM needs. Modern CRM solutions are moving toward a
cloud-based, specialized solution.
During the research phase, demonstrations of several vendor’s solutions were held with RTD business
units to determine the functionality needs and best fit for RTD business processes. Through this series
of demos and requirements gathering sessions, the determination has been made that for the Customer
Case Management/CRM will utilize Salesforce. Some examples of the Customer Case Management/CRM
modules include:
1

3

Service Management/ Case Management
Digital Marketing Management
Social Engagement Management

The Board previously approved a total of $5,000,000 for the Enterprise Customer Relationship
Management program in the 2018 - 2023 Strategic Budget Plan. The contract authority recommended
in this board action will use a portion of this approved funding for this set of subscription licenses.
DISSCUSSION
RTD conducted an RFI to obtain pricing for these modules with the National Association of State
Budget Officers (NASBO). NASBO have pre-negotiated contracts with the State of Colorado. The State

bid and awarded these contracts through their standard procurement processes and these contracts
allow other governmental agencies to utilize them.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,200,000. Funding for these licenses is included in the
approved CRM Program budget.
The yearly breakdown for the licenses is as follows:
2019
2020
2021

$250,000
$625,000
$650,000

the Customer Care Case Management/CRM will be paid annually.
2. Remain on our existing Trapeze Com implementation which will become unusable after 2020.

Approval of the 29th & Welton Property

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 11, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors extend by two 90-day terms (for a total of six months) the option for the sale of the real
property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”), including
execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
This action addresses one of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the policy goals of Resolution 17 in 2010, the TOD Strategic Plan by supporting
creation of mixed-income housing near transit stations.
RTD originally acquired the property at 29th and Welton in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for
local businesses that was lost during the construction of the Central Corridor LRT. The property is
currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s
parking management system.
In 2010, the RTD Board adopted the TOD Strategic Plan to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. The Board also
approved the TOD Pilot Program to test implementing the new TOD Strategic Plan. Pursuant to that
policy direction, RTD selected the Welton corridor as a Pilot Program site because of a combination of
favorable market conditions for redevelopment and the City and County of Denver’s (the “City’s”)
commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation & Revitalization
Strategy (the “Vision Plan”), which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor including
activation of RTD’s 29th and Welton property. The plan emphasizes the need to retain housing
affordability in the Welton corridor.
Beginning in 2014, RTD staff and the Denver Office of Economic Development (OED), now Denver
Economic Development & Opportunity (DEDO) began discussions around how to partner to implement
the community vision established in the Five Points Business District Vision Plan as part of the RTD TOD
Pilot Program implementation.

Packet Pg. 122

2.B.3

Following RTD Board authorization of the option for sale in December 2016, RTD and the City executed
the option agreement in September of 2017. In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase,
the following conditions precedent must be met:
i) successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium project
according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the City;
ii) the selected developer reaching an agreement on business terms with the City; and
iii) the selected developer securing the financing necessary to complete the project.
The City also has the right to assign the option to the selected developer, meaning the selected
developer could purchase the property directly from RTD on the same terms as the City and subject to
the same conditions. The term of the option is two years from the date of its execution, with the ability
to grant two ninety-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction. The final purchase price for
the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of the Property. The option agreement is set
to expire on September 25, 2019.
To date, RTD and the City have completed a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixedincome condominium project on the Property. OED led the RFQ process, and RTD participated in the
selection panel. However, the selected developer has not secured the financing necessary to complete
the project. If granted a six-month extension, the selected developer will reconfigure the proposed
development to focus on housing over commercial space, thus enabling them to secure financing and
come to an agreement on business terms with the City.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to extend the City’s
option to purchase the Property through two ninety-day extensions, or six months.
If the City fails to exercise the option during the extended option period, RTD would remain the
property owner and any subsequent decisions about the Property would require Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,000 per year maintaining the proper ty. If the property is
sold, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation. If the Option is exercised, RTD will
receive the amount determined by a fair market value appraisal of the Property. Per Board policy,
proceeds of the sale would be contributed to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors extend by two 90-day terms (for a total of six months) the option for the sale of the
real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”),
including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not extend the Option to Purchase the Real
Property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver CO. This is not recommended because
RTD does not have any current or future transit need for the property, and because this would
be inconsistent with the goals of the TOD pilot program previously approved by the Board in
December of 2010.

William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager,

Through:

David A. Genova, General Manager & CEO

Date:

Subject:

Summary of Proposed Option terms for 29th and Welton TOD Pilot Project

Planningfjtjkl(/~

The following memo summarizes the issues addressed in the December 6, 2016 Planning and
Development Committee, and provides a point by point summary of the items outlined in the Board
Report regarding the terms of the proposed option.

Staff recommends this approach as striking a

balance between multiple policy goals, and as a means to continue the partnership and working
relationship with the City of Denver established in 2010. This approach also seeks to balance limiting
the number of constraints placed on an actual transaction to allow the District to maximize revenue and
simplify negotiations, while still protecting the District by insuring the land is not sold if the developer
procurement process and negotiations (both led by City of Denver) are unsuccessful.
Governing Policies:
•

2016 District Goal of Fiscal Sustainability

•

2010 Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution Only Attached) and 2010 Pilot Program

Goals & Objectives:
•

Leverage RTD assets through sale of non-transit property at appraised Fair Market Value.

•

Encourage creation of mixed income communities near tran sit through partnership with
Denver's Office of Economic Development. RTD's partnership w ith the City of Denver (both
Community Planning and Development and Office of Economic Development) to bring forward a
project meeting City and RTD goals extends back to 2010, over 6 years.

•

Promote cooperation with other stakeholders, and leverage public/ public partnerships to meet
strategic goa ls.

2.B.3.b

Packet Pg. 126

Proposed Transaction Structure:
•

Denver's Office of Economic Development ("OED" ) leads RFQ process for development partner
for a mixed-income condominium project. RTD participates in the RFQ selection process.
o

OED is prepared to commit substantial funding to cover the gap between units priced
for households making 80%-100% of Area Median Income.
•

A buyer making 80% of AMI can afford a 1 bedroom unit priced at $170,000.

•

1 bedroom market-rate units in downtown Denver are priced starting in the low
$300,000's.

o

OED has committed that the RFQ will require that a minimum of 25% of units be
income-restricted to buyers at 80-100% of AMI, and that preference will be given to
respondents who propose developing a project with a higher proportion of affordable
units.

•

RTD grants an option to buy the property to OED. OED may only purchase the property if it
meets certain conditions (see Option Terms below).

•

If those conditions are met, OED may choose to either buy the property directly or assign the
option to buy to the selected developer on the same terms. Allowing assignment of the option
to the selected developer will allow OED, if they choose, to bring forward all the proposed terms
to Denver City Council as a single package for Council approval.

•

If the OED does not exercise the option, RTD will keep the property. The reasons why OED
would not be able to exercise the option are if:
•

RFQ is unsuccessful (ie-no qualified responses); or

•

OED is unable to reach agreement with the selected developer on the amount
of subsidy OED will provide; or

•

the selected developer cannot secure lender financing to build the proposed
project.

•

RTD's grant of an option to OED simplifies the process because the selected developer
negotiates all business terms directly with OED.

•

RTD's grant of an option creates certainty for respondents to the RFQ that the property will be
available at previously agreed on terms.

•

Simplification and certainty of process are more likely to result in a successful RFQ solicitation.

Some of the key option terms:
Length of Option:
•

2 years from execution.

Two 90 day extensions (at RTD' s discretion) if needed to

complete the transaction. For example, if all terms have been negotiated, and the
developer is awaiting finalizing documents with a lender, an extension could be granted

to allow that to occur. If the option conditions are not met within the 2 year timeframe,
OED could seek an extension from the RTD Board of Directors who would have to
approve the extension .
Option Price:
•

Fair Market Value based on appraisal. Per standard RTD policy, if the option is not
exercised within 6 months of the appraisal date, the appraisal must be updated.

Conditions for exercising or assigning the Option :
•

Successful procurement of a developer who commits to build a mixed-income
condominium project with a minimum of 25% units at 80-100% AMI.

•

OED and the selected developer reach an agreement on business terms for the amount
of subsidy required to build the project.

•

The selected developer secures the financing necessary to complete the project.

•

OED may assign the option only to the selected developer, and only if all of these
conditions are met; or

•

OED may exercise the option directly only if all of these conditions are met.

Process for exercising the Option:
•

OED or selected developer provides written notice that the conditions have been met,
and delivers the purchase price (appraised value} to RTD .

•

RTD delivers the deed to the property to OED or the selected developer.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve an option agreement between RTD and the city to acquire the
RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton Street for the development of mixed-income
housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) has been working
closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented Development team to plan for the development of
mixed-income for-sale housing on this site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on
this joint effort to provide critical affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Points
neighborhood.
OED’s mission is to advance economic prosperity for the city and its businesses, neighborhoods
and residents. As part of this mission, OED invests federal and local funds in the development
and preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, OED
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, OED invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.
Respectfully,

Michael B. Hancock

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary for a sub-lease of the vacant portion of the real property located adjacent to Civic Center
Station on Colfax Avenue between Lincoln and Broadway, Denver, Colorado (the “Property”),
contingent on the National Medal of Honor Museum (“NMOHM”) selecting Denver for its new
museum. This would increase RTD revenues by approximately $123,000 annually.
This action addresses one of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
As the reconstruction of Civic Center Station was planned, it was determined that a portion of the land
used for the original station was no longer needed under the new design. At the request of City and
County of Denver (the “City”) and local partners, this portion of land on the south side of the lot was set
aside for future development. Potential uses for the site discussed to date have included art installations,
food trucks, hotel developments, and a consolidated RTD headquarters, among others. Due to
complications on the site and the fact that RTD holds it through a ground lease that will expire in 2075,
development has not occurred.
Meanwhile, the NMOHM has conducted a nationwide search for a site to construct its museum. The
NMOHM Board has narrowed down their selection to two cities: Denver, Colorado, and Arlington, Texas.
The Denver site is State of Colorado property that is currently a surface parking lot at the corner of
Lincoln and Colfax. The NMOHM has indicated that a grand, park-like entrance to the museum on the
RTD-leased property across Lincoln is essential to Denver’s proposal. The NMOHM initially offered to
pay $1 per year to RTD to sub-lease the Property. A portion of the RTD Board indicated a preference
that the NMOHM cover RTD’s ground lease costs for the Property. However, as the NMOHM has not
agreed to cover RTD’s ground lease costs for the parcel, the City has stepped in to sub-lease the
Property and cover the cost itself, subject to City Council approval.
DISCUSSION
Approving the recommended action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the
authority to sub-lease the Property to the City for the remainder of the ground lease term, which
expires in 2075. The rent for the Property would equal a pro rata share of the larger parcel’s ground
lease cost, which escalates by 1% annually. The City or their designee would be responsible for
maintenance and security on the Property. Changes to the parcel would need to be approved by

Packet Pg. 133

2.B.4

RTD, could not negatively affect RTD operations and would need to accommodate RTD transit
needs, including pedestrian access, lighting, safety, and security.
If the NMOHM does not select Denver, the sub-lease would not be executed and any subsequent
decisions about the Property would require Board approval. If the NMOHM fails to meet certain
fundraising, construction, opening, and/or operating milestones, which will be set forth in the sublease, the sub-lease will terminate.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The portion of the land that would be subleased to NMOHM represents approximately 45% of the
square footage of the parcel. In 2020, RTD would expect to receive approximately $123,000 in rent
as a pro rata share of the ground lease for the larger parcel, and this amount would increase by 1%
each year per the terms of the ground lease.
If the property is sub-leased, RTD will no longer have a maintenance obligation and the ground lease
costs will be covered by the City until the expiration of the ground lease in 2075.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all
documents necessary for a sub-lease of the vacant portion of the real property located adjacent
to Civic Center Station on Colfax Avenue between Lincoln and Broadway, Denver, Colorado (the
“Property”), contingent on the National Medal of Honor Museum (“NMOHM”) selecting Denver
for its new museum. This would increase RTD revenues by approximately $123,000 annually, or
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his
designee to sub-lease the vacant portion of the real property located adjacent to Civic Center.
This is not recommended because RTD does not have any current or future transit need for the
Property.

Approval of Manion Contract Extension &
Dollar Increase

CFO/AGM,

Date: September 11, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
amount of the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installations contract with Manion Construction,
Inc. by $1,000,000.00, and extend the contract until December 31, 2020. Funding for this contract
amendment is provided by various RTD budget line items.
This action addresses Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services of the General Manager’s
goals for 2019.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract and was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
The contract allowed for two, one year options. To date, the following changes have been authorized:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
$ 200,000.00
$ 1,061,282.25
Second option year (2019) $ 405,250.73
$ 210,000.00
$ 1,676,532.98
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and both option years (2018 & 2019) =$1,676,532.98
The current contract is scheduled to expire in April 2020. We exercised the second option year earlier in
2019 based on the information we had at the time about the work that needed to be done. The reason
for seeking this increase above and beyond the original contract scope is that we have a backlog of
work that needs to be completed, and we need the ability to be able to support bus stop alterations.
We did more work than was originally anticipated. We also used this contract to do work at the 72nd
and Brighton park-n-Ride, to support the North Metro stand up. We intend to use this contract to do
some work to support the close-out of I-225 and North Metro, in addition to the Street Improvement and
Shelter Installation work.

Packet Pg. 136

2.B.5

Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. He provides quality work in a cost effective and timely manner.
DISCUSSION
This will increase the contract by $1,000,000.00, creating a total contract amount of $2,676,532.98
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $1,000,000.00 funding for this Board Action will come from various budget line items, both from
base and FasTracks, using local funding only.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to increase the amount of the annual Street Improvements &
Shelter Installations contract with Manion Construction, Inc. by $1,000,000.00, and extend the
contract until December 31, 2020. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by various
RTD budget line items.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to increase the amount of the contract by 1.000,000.00,
and do not extend the date until December 31, 2020 for the annual Street Improvements &
Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for
Bid (IFB). This is not recommended because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned work that needs to be done.
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2019 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

2020 Requested Budget Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: September 17, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2020 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors in conjunction with
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2020 Requested Budget for public review and
comment by October 15, 2019 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101). The
initial 2020 Requested Budget is included in this document in order to comply with these
requirements. A preliminary Requested Budget is posted to the RTD website and hard copies are
made available in the Board Office for public review.
At this time, staff is presenting the first draft 2020 Requested Budget. Preliminary 2020 Requested
Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a final budget will be presented in November.
The 2020 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November 12th Financial Administration and
Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to move to the Board of Directors for
ratification of the 2020 Adopted Budget on November 19th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and
provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2020
annual budget. Our previous communication included the 2020-2025 Mid-term Financial Plan, which
forms the basis for the 2020 budget, and which is scheduled to be approved by the Board on
September 24th.
The budget is driven by the top strategic goals established for the GM by the Board of Directors for
2020, which are: 1) strengthen transparent public communication/collaboration, 2) address transit
equity, 3) enhance current and future transportation methods, 4) strengthen safety and security, and
5) increase ridership.
During development of the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan, staff presented a balanced budget to
the Board for 2020. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for the Base System
and will work to continue to bring this budget as close to the MTFP as possible. Staff also
incorporates FasTracks budget numbers for both FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations. Both
the Base System and FasTracks preliminary budgets make up the 2020 Requested Budget presented
here.
The 2020 Requested Budget is compared to the 2019 Amended Budget below with change from
period to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2020 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses. The
budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating any necessary
adjustments will be the 2020 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This
Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant
revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts. Operating
expenses will also be revised for specific changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2020 Requested Budget based on guidance from the MidTerm Financial Plan. On a combined basis, the 2020 Requested Budget consists of the following:
(1)

Fare revenue:
a.
Farebox revenue is forecasted based on the recommended fare change proposal
presented by staff in 2018 and adopted by the Board. Fare revenue in 2020 is projected
to be 5.7% above the 2019 budget per the recommendation.
b.
Farebox revenue for the Base System is forecast at $124.4 million in 2020, a
decrease of $0.9 million from the 2019 Amended Budget. For FasTracks, fare revenue is
forecast at $48.5 million, an increase of $10.2 million over the 2019 budgeted amount.
Overall farebox revenue is budgeted at $172.9 million in 2020, an increase of $9.3 million
over the 2019 budget.

(6)

c.
Per the farebox revenue recommendation, ridership is forecast to show no growth
on the Base System and grow more significantly on FasTracks. Total combined revenue
ridership is projected to grow 4.1% in 2020 over that projected for 2019.
Other operating revenue:
a.
This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, parking income,
rental income, and miscellaneous operating revenue.
b.
Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2019 Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. The amount will change if more information becomes
available for the 2020 Recommended Budget.
Sales/use tax:
a.
Combined sales/use tax of $690.0 million is budgeted to increase 4.2% over the
2019 projection, per the CU-Leeds School of Business September forecast. The 2020
growth rate is the CU-Leeds Baseline forecast.
b.
The 2019 projection shows an increase in sales/use tax of 4.4% over 2018 actuals
per the CU-Leeds School of Business Baseline forecast.
Grant revenue:
a.
Total grant revenue is estimated at $373.4 million (including carryforward grant
funds), an increase of $14.8 million over the 2019 Amended Budget.
b.
Operating grant revenue is projected to be $89.7 million on the Base System and
$1.9 million for FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted to decrease
$0.4 million from the 2019 Amended Budget due to fluctuations in funding in fixed
guideway, bus facilities funding, CMAQ, CDOT, and FASTER grant funding for specific
programs. FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to increase $35,000 over the
2019 Amended Budget.
c.
Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $281.8 million. Of this
amount, $59.5 million is budgeted in the Base System and $222.3 million is budgeted in
FasTracks. Capital grant revenue is forecast to increase $10.8 million for the Base System
and $4.3 million for FasTracks over the 2019 Amended Budget due to fluctuations
carryforward amounts, federal competitive funding, and state FASTER grants.
d.
Large grants for the Base System include on-going plus new FTA bus and bus
facilities funding (5339), capital maintenance (5307), fixed guideway (5337), and state
FASTER grants, plus carry-forward of FTA Ladders of Opportunity grant funding and
DRCOG funding for 16th Street Mall reconstruction. The largest grants for FasTracks will
come from final draws on the FFGA for the Eagle project and carryforward of Small Starts
funding for SERE for FasTracks.
e.
As more information becomes available and the capital project carry forward budget
is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates may change accordingly in the Recommended
Budget.
Investment income:
a.
Combined investment income of $7.5 million is projected to decrease $8.2 million
from the 2019 Amended Budget due to forecast of lower interest rates on investable fund
balances.
Other (non-operating) income:
a.
Other non-operating income will decline slightly from the 2019 Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 168

2.C.2

(7)

b.
Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI but is offset by the Build
America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off (and a portion of which is
currently subject to sequestration).
c.
The amount will change if more information becomes available for the 2020
Recommended Budget.
Operating expenses:
a.
District-wide operating expenses (excluding Mid-Term Financial Plan expense
projects and expense project carryforward) of $725.5 million are budgeted to decrease
$17.8 million from the 2019 Amended Budget. Base System operating expenses are
budgeted to decrease $3.5 million, FasTracks Project expenses are budgeted to decrease
$12.4 million, and FasTracks Operations expenses are budgeted to decrease $1.8 million.
Both Base System and FasTracks operating expenses at this time are target amounts
derived from the Mid-Term Financial Plan but may change in the final 2020 budget as
deemed necessary.
b.
Mid-Term Financial Plan expense projects are not included in the 2020 Requested
Budget; these projects will be included in the final 2020 budget post-Board approval of the
Mid-Term Financial Plan.
c.
The expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense projects) is not
included in the 2020 Requested Budget; this will be identified and included in the final
2020 budget.
d.
FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $11.1 million of the decline in
FasTracks Project expenses due largely to completion of several FasTracks projects and
capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors.
e.
Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide,
BRT, the H-Line extension, Commuter Rail, and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks
based on resource drivers on a full-allocation basis, and thus, Base System total expenses
are reduced by the amount of the allocation. A portion of overhead costs is also allocated
for the Commuter Rail Lines. This is a full allocation including administrative and support
costs. The amount of the allocation in 2020 is $41.5 million in YOE (year of expenditure)
dollars.
f.
FasTracks Operations also includes a $74.0 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Commuter Rail operations and maintenance which began in
2016 and North Metro maintenance beginning in 2019. The latter amount is $8.0 million
of the total. The expense is included in the Rail Operations budget.
g.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.30/gallon, which is the lock price used for 2019.
h.
Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $2.90/gallon, which is the
same price as in the 2019 budget for no change.
i.
All District rent and the $5.0 million contingency fund controlled by the General
Manager are included in non-departmental expenses as well as various customary
miscellaneous expenses.
j.
Certain items may materialize after the Mid-Term Financial Plan approval and after
this Requested Budget is presented. These items will be discussed and prioritized with
senior management and it will be determined if funds can be made available to support
these expenditures.

Debt:
a.
Budgeted principal payments of $88.2 million on a combined basis are $11.4
million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the 2015A
COPs that began in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment of $10.0
million in 2020. The TABOR payment is structured to start repaying principal after the
Eagle project is fully in service.
b.
Base System principal payments of $65.8 million are $3.2 million higher than the
2019 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt.
c.
FasTracks principal payments of $22.4 million are $8.2 million higher than the
2019 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt and the
TABOR principal payment noted above.
d.
No debt issuance is anticipated for either the Base System or FasTracks in 2020.
Both Base System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund major
capital purchases and construction.
Interest expense:
a.
Interest expense is budgeted at $170.4 million, an increase of $18.2 million from
the 2019 Amended Budget mainly due a GASB rule to take effect in 2020 that no longer
allows capitalization of interest during construction.
b.
Of total interest expense, $16.8 million is budgeted for Base System and $153.6
million is budgeted on FasTracks. On FasTracks, the TABOR interest portion is $35.8
million.
Capital expenditures:
a.
Base System new capital expenditures total $45.4 million. This is the amount to be
approved in the Mid-Term Financial Plan for minimum critical projects and is escalated at
the CPI of 2.6%.
b.
FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $0.8 million. This is a
preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended Budget as estimates for
project expenditures in 2020 are reviewed and completed.
c.
Capital projects carry forward (previously approved capital projects) is not
estimated at this time but will be included in the Recommended Budget because it is based
on the 9/30/19 close of RTD’s financial statements.
Reserves:
a.
The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $26.6 million.
b.
The FasTracks management reserve is budgeted at $0.9 million at year-end.
c.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is budgeted for the Base System. Established in
2018, the purpose of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through
the fiscal year. The funds will typically be used to fund unbudgeted inflationary increases,
respond to emergencies, new regulations, and to cover cost overruns. The use of the
contingency reserve will be at the General Manager’s discretion.
Contributed capital:
a.
Contributed capital totals $137.8 million for FasTracks, which consists of thirdparty betterments, in-kind, and local match contributions for the Eagle project, R Line,
SERE, and North Metro.
Fund balances:

Packet Pg. 170

2.C.2

a.

Base System:
i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund for a total fund balance of
$26.4 million.
ii. No increase to the capital replacement fund for a total fund balance of $0.
iii. Increase of $2.0 million to the unrestricted operating reserve for a total fund
balance of $17.4 million. A larger contribution is not possible at this time in order to
balance the Base System budget.
iv. The unrestricted year-end fund balance is budgeted unchanged at $3.2 million at
this time, the same amount estimated in the 2019 Amended Budget. The amount for
2020 will be estimated with the 2020 Recommended Budget once the expense
project carry forward is brought into the calculation as well as any further
adjustments to revenue and expenditures.
v. Fund balances are increased in a manner as consistent with Board policy as
possible and the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
b.
FasTracks:
i. The total of the same funds for FasTracks is $44.7 million and reflects 3 months of
operating expenses for both FasTracks Project/Construction and FasTracks
Operations.
ii. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $103.5
million in 2020 from savings from construction under budget and planned account
growth.
c.
District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances including the FISA are projected at this time to
be 26.9% of projected District-wide operating expenses at the end of 2020.

The preliminary 2020 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the operating and
capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and FasTracks is included as Exhibit
I.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
2019 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3933 : Fiscal Policy Update)

REVENUE POLICIES

6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year
SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose is
to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using
sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

INVESTMENT POLICIES

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to manage expenditures to achieve service levels that will promote
effectiveness through ease of use and improved travel times.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment
and minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. RTD will invest in safety outreach
programs and personnel to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3933 : Fiscal Policy Update)

1. RTD financial assets are managed in accordance with the RTD Investment Policy
Statement which is reviewed and approved by the RTD Board on an annual basis.

1. On an annual basis, RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels, operating
costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to
be included in the Mid-Term Financial Plan will be evaluated using the following
criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
2
Packet Pg. 180

2.C.3.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018




benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7
below).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan
as the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the
cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to
the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks APE which will be integrated
with the SBP into the Mid-Term Financial Plan incorporating the actual costs incurred
and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating
programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3933 : Fiscal Policy Update)



1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately
3
Packet Pg. 181

2.C.3.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3933 : Fiscal Policy Update)

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.
4
Packet Pg. 182

2.C.3.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES

2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

6. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond coverage ratio for the
Base System (annual non-FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual sales and
use tax debt service for senior non-FasTracks debt) of four times for debt backed by
the 0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue
bond coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to

BUDGET POLICIES
1. RTD shall comply with all requirements of the Colorado Local Government Budget
Law.
2. As part of the budget development process, the Board will review the current goals,
objectives, and performance indicators for use in preparing the budget for the
following year. The Board will adopt the final performance indicators before the
adoption of the annual budget.
3. The Board will review the adopted fiscal policies annually or on an as-needed basis
to consider any changes that may be necessary.
4. There shall be a budgetary monitoring system that charges expenditures against
approved budget appropriations.
5. The budget shall be summarized for adoption purposes. The actual level of detail
required for adoption shall be determined by the Board.
6. The budget shall be prepared using Generally Accepted Accounting Principles with
the following exceptions:

 exclusion of gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment
 exclusion of the non-cash portion of long-term unfunded pension accruals.

Attachment: 2020 Fiscal Policy Statement (3933 : Fiscal Policy Update)

7. RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (all annual revenues
remaining after operating and maintenance expenses to annual debt service
requirements net of excess appropriations required for variable rate debt) of 1.2
times annual debt service.

7. The budget document shall be submitted to the Government Finance Officers
Association annually for consideration for the Distinguished Budget Presentation
Award, which evaluates the document as a communications device, financial plan,
operations guide, and policy document.
8. Quarterly performance reports will be presented to the Board of Directors to assess
RTD's performance on the adopted performance indicators.
6
Packet Pg. 184

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

9. A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is
greater than or equal to expenditures will be prepared.
10. Budgetary procedures that postpone the funding of necessary expenditures, such
as preventive maintenance or replacement of equipment, will be avoided.

12. RTD will monitor revenue sources regularly and amend the budget, as necessary,
to reflect the most current information available. RTD will also change the level of
expenditures, as needed, to maintain a balanced budget.
13. RTD will project revenues for at least six years and will update the projections
annually as part of the Mid-Term Financial Plan. Each existing and potential revenue
source will be reexamined annually.
14. As part of the Mid-Term Financial Plan, RTD also will prepare a six-year operating
expenditure plan that includes projections of annual service growth plus allowances
for operating costs of new capital assets.
15. A budget will be prepared that contains essential programs and projects needed to
support the goals and objectives of RTD, responds to citizen demand, and reflects
administrative evaluation of current needs.

ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING POLICIES
1. The accounting system will maintain records on a basis consistent with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles for enterprise funds.
2. The accounts of RTD will be reported using the accrual basis of accounting.
Revenues will be recognized when earned and expenses will be recognized when
incurred.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

September 11, 2019

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 11, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 17, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) system. The
PEAK system is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 197

2.C.5

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of September 9th, 1,322 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 670 have been approved,
368 have been denied and the remaining 284 are pending. Of the 368 denied, 263 of them were denied
because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount.
79 were denied because their address was out of District, 3 because it was a duplicate application, 1
because the applicant was already enrolled, and 22 because they didn’t meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:
 LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
 LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
 LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
 Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
 RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
 Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
 Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created and printed.
 The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
 RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
 Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
 Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
 RTD staff are performing quality control and making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos and working with applicants if a better photo is required.
 The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions.
 A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
 RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.

RTD is working closely with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to
work out remaining “bugs”.
Next Steps:
RTD is hosting training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit organizations that
are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD is working with PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services to leverage existing
contacts and avenues of communication at the three agencies.
RTD staff is planning additional Marketing and Outreach activities.
RTD is working with nonprofit agencies to ensure a smooth transition from the current
nonprofit program rules procedures to the new ones that go into effect in 2020.
RTD will refine Marketing materials and communications based on experience gained since
roll-out
RTD will conduct a survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program.
The team will use feedback from customers, partner organizations, and RTD staff to
evaluate potential enhancements to systems, procedures, and communications.
