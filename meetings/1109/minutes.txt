

457(b) Investment Policy
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board adopt the Regional Transportation District Deferred Compensation Plan
457(b) Investment Policy (attached). It is further recommended that the
General Manager or his designee(s) is authorized to appoint an Investment
Committee, retain an Investment Advisor and select appropriate investment
funds consistent with the guidelines outlined in the 457(b) Investment Policy.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to
move this to the full Board at the
November 27, 2012 Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Sylvia Francis began by informing the Board that we have a 457(b)
plan for employees for about 30 years. She explained that during
those 30 years we have not entertained any competitive bids. As

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on November 20, 2012
Page 3 of 12

our assets have grown the fees charged to the participants have
not gone down. She shared that about 18 months ago staff
started to conduct an analysis of the existing two record-keepers.
Staff found that the administrative and fund fees paid by
participants were higher than the fees charged by other providers
in the current market. Sylvia said staff also found that the return
on investment was not as high as some of the record-keeper’s
peers, education and investment advice have been lacking, and
there was no transparency in the fees the participants were
paying. She explained that based on this information staff decided
to creating an investment committee and do an RFP. The decision
was made to recommend Great West as the new record-keeper.
Sylvia explained that staff wants to take a proactive role to make
sure RTD provides the best benefits and experience for the
participants which is why they are proposing the new investment
policy so they can monitor the plans in the future. She shared that
staff has started enrollment and investment meetings.
Director O’Boyle said it was his understanding that currently
participants were paying the fees and with the new policy and
record-keeper RTD will pay those fees. Sylvia explained that
participants would still continue to pay the fees but those fees will
be lower. She said that because RTD wants to make sure we are
offering a good benefit to employees, RTD will hire a consultant to
look at the record-keeper, fees, etc. each year.
Terry Howerter stated that this person will review the investments,
portfolios, etc. and then report to the Investment Committee.
Director O’Boyle stated that this is a new committee. He asked if
the members will be comprised of people who participate in the
457(b) plan. Sylvia explained that each Assistant General
Manager will recommend someone from their area and the General
Manager will appoint the members.
Director O’Boyle stated that he is hopeful there will now be more
participation. Sylvia shared that she has already seen more
interest. Terry said that this is open to union and salaried
employees.
Director Hoy noted that the flat annual fee is estimated to be
around $40,000 per year. He wanted to clarify that we do not
have a confirmed amount yet. Sylvia explained that staff will do
an RFP for a consultant but wanted to get though the transition
first. She said it is difficult to find a consultant that will work on a
flat rate. She shared that she spoke with the consultant who is
currently working with us and the consultant said they would work
with us for $40,000 annually. Director Hoy commented that the
fee seems like a small fee based on the assets.

Terry Howerter told the Board that he is pleased to say that this year’s efforts by
all of the staff in bringing the budget in line with the SBP have been fantastic.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to
move this to the full Board at the
November 27, 2012 Board meeting.
Director Cohen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino outlined for the Board the process we have
gone through thus far. In April staff and the Board began
discussing the SBP. In July the Board approved the SBP. In
August staff and the Board began discussing the themes,
assumptions and key elements of the Budget. In September the
Board was presented with a first draft and in October there was a
Budget update. Jannette stated that tonight staff is presenting the
final Recommended Budget for approval next Tuesday, November
27, 2012.
Jannette reviewed the highlights of the Budget with the Board
from the Board Report and associated exhibits and attachments.
On the revenue side, the total District revenue was expected to be
up $10.9 million over the 2012 Amended Budget. Farebox
revenue is expected to be up 2.8% and sales and use tax revenue
up 4.5% based on the CU-Leeds forecast. These increases are
offset by a decrease in grant revenue. Operating expenses will be
down by approximately 4.1% on a combined basis. The cost of
diesel is budgeted at $3.50 per gallon. This will be an increase of
$7.7 million over 2012. The price of gas is budgeted at $3.54 per
gallon which has not changed.

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on November 20, 2012
Page 8 of 12

Jannette explained that Attachment A shows a detail of the
changes from the previous Requested Budget to the
Recommended Budget. The changes are primarily due to expense
projects carry-forward.
Jannette shared that the assumptions have not changed with
regards to interest expense and debt payments but we now have
the final numbers for our capital expenditures. The new capital
spending for the Base System for 2013 is $119 million and for
FasTracks is $663 million. Jannette highlighted that Attachment B
shows the detail of the New Capital Projects.
Jannette stated that the capital carry-forward numbers are also
finalized. This is defined as capital projects that were approved in
2012 and are slated for completion in 2013. The capital carryforward for the Base System is $120.9 million and for FasTracks it
will be $1,130.4 million. Jannette highlighted that Attachment C
shows the detail of the Capital Carry-Forward Expenditures.
Jannette reviewed the reserve fund balances with the Board on a
District-wide basis. The Board-appropriated fund is expected to
increase to $22.2 million, the capital replacement fund is expected
to increase to $15.0 million, and the FasTracks contingency
reserve will be maintained at a balance of $30.0 million. The
undesignated working capital fund or remaining fund balance will
total $30.9 million.
Jannette stated that the next step is to move the Budget forward
to next Tuesdays meeting for approval.
Director O’Boyle noted that FasTracks Projects and FasTracks
Operations are listed separately within the information presented.
He asked if we are ever going to integrate the FasTracks
Operations into RTD Operations. Jannette stated that these are
integrated within Exhibit 1. Terry Howerter stated that these are
deliberately kept separate as the FasTracks plan allows us to
design, build, operate and maintain the rail lines.
Director O’Boyle asked why there was a decrease in operating
expenditures due to the higher capitalization of FasTracks project
salaries. Terry explained that if an employee is working on a
capital project their salaries and wages are taken into account for
the asset of the project rather than in our expenses.
Director Deadwyler expressed her appreciation of Jannette and for
the time Jannette has spent meeting with her. She stated that she
still felt like she could not follow along at the pace like she wanted
to and asked if Jannette could meet with her before this item was
voted on at the Board meeting. Jannette said she would be more

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on November 20, 2012
Page 9 of 12

than happy to meet with Director Deadwyler.
Director Tayer expressed what great work he believes staff did on
the Budget. He stated that in particular he appreciates the
movement toward building up our reserves. He asked if staff feels
we are moving as the pace we projected in our fiscal policies or if
they feel we need to move faster. Jannette explained that we are
meeting our targets that were put forth in the SBP so she feels we
are moving at the pace we wanted.

Updates


Third Quarter Internal Audit Report (Holmes/Parker)
There were no questions on the Internal Audit Report.



Third Quarter Investment Report (Howerter/Morgan)
Brenden Morgan reviewed the Liquidity Tier and Enhanced Cash Tier information
from the Board Report.
Director Bagley commended staff for their good work. He noted that we beat
the benchmark index on both of these.
Director Hoy asked if we consistently use this benchmark. Terry Howerter
explained that these are periodically reviewed but we have used this one since
he began with RTD.




Annual Report to the Board – Interest Rate Swaps (Howerter/Morgan)
There were no questions on the Interest Rate Swaps.
September 2012 Financial Status Report (Howerter/MacLeod)
Doug MacLeod explained that while ridership appeared to be down, we had two
more Saturdays and Sundays than the prior year. With ridership begin at half or
less than half of ridership on weekdays, if these numbers were normalized it
would be the same. He stated that everything is tracking with our actual
compared to what we projected in our Budget.
Director Deadwyler asked why the sales and use tax was not closer to our actual
Budget. Doug explained that when we did the Amended Budget in June we only
had about 4 months of actual to base their numbers on. He stated that staff
was trying to be cautious about the numbers in the Budget. Director Deadwyler
asked what we do with the extra funds. Terry Howerter explained that is part of
what goes into the fund balance.
Director Gore asked why ridership is down. Doug explained that this was due to
the 8% service reduction that took effect in the beginning of 2012. There has
been a shift in these numbers that staff did not expect to see. Doug also
explained that the Mall Shuttle is one of the largest factors in the decrease in
ridership. The lights along 16th Street Mall were changed and staff did not
anticipate this having such a large impact on ridership.
Director McMullen asked staff to go over the cost recovery ratio as we exceed
30% consistently. Doug stated that this is reported on a quarterly basis and
30% is a statutory requirement. Fare revenue has to exceed 30% of costs after
excluding Para Transit costs. Doug stated that we routinely exceed the 30%
requirement.
Director Walker asked if there are other agencies experiencing similar gains in
sales and use tax. General Manager Washington said that in speaking with his
counterparts at other transit agencies they are seeing comparable increases.
Doug also stated that our sales and use tax numbers also align with what the

Minutes of the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting held on November 20, 2012

City and County of Denver is seeing.
IV.

Other Matters
Director James shared that he recently took a trip to Tampa and visited with the Tampa
Regional Transportation Authority. He met with the Chair of the Board and a
consultant, Ronny Douglas. He explained that the area is quite fragmented with
separate bus systems in every county. He stated that he may have shared more with
them but one of the things he found himself thinking was it validated the organization
that we have with one District. He also shared that they have an antique street car
that has been restored. It was recommended that RTD not pursue this.
