Re:

Service Availability – December 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.64% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in December 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a decrease
during the month of December over the same month last year. Although lost service year to
date is higher, a large portion of lost service occurred during the first half of 2018. Service
delivery has improved significantly since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related
reasons follows:






December 2018 – 124.27 hours
December 2017 – 626.37 hours
Year to date hours for 2017 – 6,261.47hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 10,100.03 hours
Total service availability for 2018: 99.21% (includes service loss for any reason)

While RTD did provide in excess of 99.64% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,425 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 19,400 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev. This number is also trending downward with
this December’s numbers lower than December of last year.

sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
The introduction of the Southeast Rail Extension service plan, which involves an extension of the E, F
and R Light Rail Lines in the South Metro area, is a notable part of this proposal. Also included is a
proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low ridership in an area with
overlapping transit service. A reduction of Saturday service to the Jefferson County Government Center
Station on the W Line light rail service is also proposed. With the expiration of grant funding for
expanded service on the Free Metro Ride and the review of ridership performance, it is proposed that
FMR service frequency be reduced. Additionally, a number of service changes aimed at increasing ontime performance and service reliability are included in these proposals. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

May 2019 Proposed Service Changes
BUS

Route 1 – 1st Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Move east terminal from Birch/Virginia to Virginia/Cherry, immediately behind King Soopers
at Leetsdale/Cherry for operator restroom and customer convenience. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
This proposal is an effort to relieve passenger overloads east of Monaco to VA Hospital by
adding selected trips between 9:00am and 1:00pm. Move short turn recovery location from
Oneida/Colfax to Leyden/Colfax, for operator restroom access. The new terminal is close
to Walgreens, McDonalds, 7-11. A weekday bus for recovery and on-time performance.
Revise recoveries at East Metro as necessary, for adequate recovery. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $241,000 annualized.
16/16L – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analyses on weekend services. No cost impacts are anticipated
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership performance, it proposed that this route service be discontinued.
Current ridership performance stands at 10.3 passenger per hour, which falls below the
Urban Local ridership standard. This proposal would impact approximately 55 weekday
passengers. Alternative service to the Route 33 can be found in using combinations of
Central and West Light Rail corridors, Routes 4, 9, 30 and 30Limited.
Cost saving impacts are estimated to be approximately $301,700 annualized.
Route 36L – Fort Logan Limited
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, for operator recovery and on-time performance. No cost impacts are

Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This proposal would, formalize the current 4-block route detour in Englewood, which was
put into effect due to the City having converted a part of Elati Street into a one-way
operation. The new Southbound route direction from Kenyon Street would be left on
Galapago, right on Ithica, left on Elati, to regular route. The new northbound routing from
southbound Elati, right on Ithica, left on Galapago, right on Kenyon, to regular route.

Route 65 – Monaco
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, for operator recovery and on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.

Free Metro Ride – 18th-19th Street
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Due to lower ridership (down from 82 passengers per hour to 62 passengers per hour) it is
recommended that the Free Metro Ride peak frequency be reduced from 15 trips per hour
to 8 trips per hour. Cost savings to FasTracks is estimated to be $281,500 annualized.

Rail
W Line - Light Rail/ Denver Union Station to Jefferson County Gov. Center/Golden Station)
It is proposed to reduce service between Federal Center Station and Jeffco Government
Center/Golden Station on Saturdays to every 30 minutes, consistent with Sunday service.
Under the proposed changes, this will require 6 all day trains rather than 7 as is used
currently and will be a savings of 1 all-day train. This will impact approximately 392
passengers who will need to choose a departure either 15 minutes earlier or 15 minutes
later. Anticipated FasTracks cost savings are estimated to be $134,600 annualized.
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE)
The Southeast Rail Extension Project is part of RTD’s 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan
to expand rapid transit across the Denver metro region. The project will extend the Southeast
Rail Line 2.3 miles from Lincoln Station to RidgeGate Station in Lone Tree. There will be
three new light rail stations: Sky Ridge Station near Sky Ridge Medical Center; LoneTree
City Center Station; and a 1,300-space Park-n-Ride at the RidgeGate Station (Sky Ridge and
Lone Tree Stations will be “Kiss-n-Ride” stations). Anticipated cost impacts to FasTracks
are estimated to be $5,162,000 annualized.
E – Line (Light Rail Route - Denver Union Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the E Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. In addition to extending the
line to the new station, minor running time adjustments are proposed. This proposal will
require 2 extra all-day trains for a total of 9 all-day trains.
F – Line 18th/Stout Station to Lincoln Station
It is proposed to extend the E Line Light Rail route to the Ridgegate Parkway Station
according to the 2004 FasTracks Southeast Rail Extension plan. In addition to extending
the line to the new station, minor running time adjustments are proposed. This proposal will
require 1 extra all-day train for a total of 8 all-day trains.
