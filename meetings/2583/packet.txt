B. Recommended Actions

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates, Inc.
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, said that Roger Sherman
was unable to attend but sent his regrets. She said that he would be
submitting minutes notes from the Impact 64 meeting as soon as they were
prepared.
Director Francone said Roger Sherman went to a Colorado city and county
managers’ conference in January. She said she had not seen a follow-up
report from Mr. Sherman for that meeting and indicated she would like to
hear what he took away from it. Sherry Ellebracht said she would ask Mr.
Sherman to provide notes and mentioned that he would be sending emails to
the Directors to schedule Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) one-on-one
meetings.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs, said Senators
Cooke and Lundberg asked for a moment of silence in the Senate for Transit
Security Officer Scott Von Lanken. She said the big conversation at the
Capitol was in regard to a bipartisan measure to increase transportation
funding for the state. While she stated that no such bill has been introduced,
her firm is encouraging both sides to work together to pass a measure that
would be referred to the ballot. She said the legislators are discussing what
kind of measure would be tolerable. She also mentioned that funding was a
big sticking point between the two chambers; while the Republicancontrolled Senate does not want general fund money to go toward transit,
the Democratic-controlled House wants to spend large sums on transit. She
said the difference between $250 million and $0 in funding is a lot but

Directors Archuleta and Mihalik were absent. Director Folska left early, and Director
Anderson participated via phone.

6.A

Megan Wagner, Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs, gave an update on the
legislative reception scheduled for February 8, 2017, at the Cooper Lounge.
She thanked Director Folska for securing the venue and said that 25
legislators indicated they would attend.
Director Broom asked whether any urban renewal legislation had been
introduced.
Jenifer Brandeberry said that Representative Beckman introduced a bill that
same day concerning Tax Increment Financing (TIF) requirements. Ms.
Brandeberry said that there is an ongoing conversation in the legislature
about how TIF mechanisms impact school funding and that TIF and TIF
reform have been topics at the state legislature for years. She said former
Speaker Hullinghorst had run a bill on TIF reform in the past and said TIF
bills could have impact on transit-oriented development.
Director Broom asked whether any new TIF legislation would be retroactive.
Jenifer Brandeberry said that any changes would be prospective and would
not affect deals that have already been made.
Director Folska asked for an update on construction defect legislation.
Jenifer Brandeberry said one bill about insurance had been introduced, which
was scheduled to be heard on February 8th. She said that the business
community and the coalition of interested stakeholders viewed that bill as
having only minor impact, though she did say that certain stakeholders have
stated they would not support the bill until they see the whole package of
construction defect bills. She said that the coalition has pushed for another
bill, SB17-156, which covers both binding arbitration and informed consent.
Ms. Brandeberry thinks that bill will pass, since there are House Democrats
that support it, but stated that its passage depends on the committees to
which the bill is assigned. She said that the House could introduce bills on
informed consent and that there would be competing House and Senate
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

hoped that compromise could be found in the middle of that range. She
stated that a handful of tax bills had been introduced that would have a
fiscal impact on the district and that the bills with the biggest impact have
the least likelihood of passing. She said that RTD Transit Police Chief John
Tarbert and his staff had issues with one particular bill, SB17-093 by
Senator Andy Kerr. The bill would allow bicyclists to ignore certain traffic
laws. She said other law enforcement officials also opposed the bill and
stated the bill died in committee on 3-2 vote. Finally, Ms. Brandeberry said
that her firm has been meeting with new legislators to give them background
information on RTD and information about openings and has offered to be a
resource in the conversation about transportation financing.

6.A

bills, but the fact that there are bills on construction defects at all is a huge
step forward. She stated that legislative leadership wants to see substantial
reforms, that the leaders recognize that the bill on insurance is not enough,
and that her firm would keep the Board informed.

Jenifer Brandeberry said that the emphasis was lack of resources. She said
that both parties have indicated that they want to do more for infrastructure
and that for some transportation is enough of a priority for the money to
come from the general fund. She said that, because of the budget
constraints and complicating factors in the constitution, policymakers have
so little room to make expenditures. She feels that, while there is a
legitimate argument for the money coming from the general fund, that
money is not enough to deal with the deficit in maintenance and operations
over time. She said the Senate Republicans do not want to go to the voters
to ask for new revenue unless the right package is put together, whereas
the House leadership is uncomfortable with the money coming out of the
general fund because doing so would take away funding from some of their
priorities. Ms. Brandeberry said there are two philosophies playing out,
though she did say the two sides want to compromise and that the
community has given them the support to make that overdue compromise.
She mentioned that RTD has been successful in building compromise and
could serve as a model for the legislature.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, said there was a lot of action in
Washington, D.C. He said that Elaine Chao was approved as Secretary of
Transportation and that the agency has leadership. He mentioned that
people are also paying attention to the proposed federal infrastructure
package and Speaker of the House said this would be a standalone bill. He
said the bill would not increase federal spending but rather would leverage
funds from the private sector though public-private partnerships. He said
that any new federal expenditures would likely be one-time payments,
possibly coming from tax money repatriated from overseas. He said that the
Democrats in the Senate have proposed a $1 Trillion infrastructure spending
package and that Congressman DeFazio (D-Oregon)has been working on
infrastructure legislation in the House of Representatives. Mr. Dino said that
whatever package comes out would come through the Republican caucus
and that the Democrats efforts will be ignored. He also mentioned that local
and county governments are interested in federal efforts to diminish or do
away with tax deductibility of municipal bonds and other publically-funded
bond instruments. He said that the Obama administration had tried to reduce
the deductibility of bonds and that the current administration wants to do

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker asked if there is a tone in the conversation on
transportation, whether that be safety, capacity, air quality, or some other
concern.

6.A

Director Folska asked Mike Dino when Federal Transit Agency (FTA) and
Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) administrators might be appointed. Mr.
Dino answered that the appointments should occur before spring, since
Elaine Chao has been confirmed and the agency has its leadership in place.
He said many of the people he has worked with in the past are still working
in the Department of Transportation (DoT) and speculated the DoT might be
better off currently than other agencies.
Director Francone asked about gas tax, as she had heard a rumor about
Congressman Buck working hard on legislation.
Mike Dino said the package coming out of the Speaker’s office does not
include tax increases. He mentioned that there are Republicans who have
talked about bringing earmarks back, which could potentially happen after
the 2018 elections rather than in the current legislative session. He said that
House Republicans feel the President has too much power over the federal
purse strings. Mr. Dino said that he does not foresee earmarks coming back
in the near future, because they are too much of a political hot potato. He
mentioned that President Trump tried to get rid of the Ethics committee, but
the Speaker prevailed.
Sherry Ellebracht said people are trying to reframe earmarks by calling them
“line item appropriations”. Mike Dino gave a brief history on earmarks and
said that previously people could ask for earmarks anonymously by the end
of the last earmark session their use had become more transparent. He said
that if earmarks were to come back they would require a lot of justification.
Director Anderson said she is concerned over the idea of “buy American”
and that the policy is getting even more stringent. She said that RTD is not
able to purchase trains or buses off the shelf through American
manufacturers.
Mike Dino said that the push to buy American is a concerning thing and that
the policy could become stricter, in that even the sourcing for the ultimate
product may be impacted. He mentioned that the potential trade issues are
concerning a lot of people and that the policy will continue to be debated
and evolve. He said that any infrastructure legislation introduced before July
4 would include a buy America provision.

away with the deductibility altogether. He mentioned that the APTA
Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. was a month away and noted
that it is important to recognize that the continuing funding resolution
expires on April 18, 2017. He said there is speculation on how that looming
deadline would potentially be used as leverage going forward.

6.A

Mike Dino also spoke about the new executive order on federal regulations
and explained that covered regulations are defined as having a $100 Million
impact or larger. He said that it may be worth taking a look at regulations
the Board thinks should be rewritten, since there is an environment in
Washington where improvements on regulations can be discussed, though
he did say it may still be difficult to get rid of some of these rules.
Director Anderson recalled lobbying Senator Brown, who always said there
would be no earmarks.

Mike Dino said that the I6 grant was a competitive Economic Development
Administration (EDA) grant through a Department of Commerce that would
have created a partnership among RTD, Jefferson County, and the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to develop businesses in the western
part of the metropolitan area. Competitive grant opportunity. He said the
grant application was not successful for the first round. He said that the
stakeholders met with the EDA regional administrators who encouraged the
Jefferson County Commissioners to put together a planning grant that could
put them in a better position to go after I6 grant funding again. He said the
planning grant would secure as much as $300,000 in federal matching
funds and that the Commissioners are interested in partnering with RTD and
NREL to move forward and the EDA is being very cooperative.
Committee Chair Walker mentioned he found a lot of value in earmarks for
one-time infusions of cash, especially for certain projects.
Mike Dino mentioned one instance when the City and County of Denver
asked for a Colfax streetcar study when RTD was not ready to participate
due to other commitments, creating tension between RTD and the City and
County of Denver.
Finally, Committee Chair Walker mentioned that certain federal regulations
were created for a reason, such as those created by court order, and that it
would be interesting to see how certain regulations are dispensed with.

B. Recommended Actions

• Termination of Lease between the Fiddler’s Business Improvement District
and the Regional Transportation District
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to terminate the Lease between the
Fiddler’s Business Improvement District (FBID) and the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) for additional public parking spaces for RTD
transit customers in the vicinity of the RTD Arapahoe Light Rail Station on
the west side of I-25. Proceeds of this transaction will total $1,100,000,
which will be deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, introduced Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Real
Property, to give the presentation.
Susan Altes explained that when the original lease between
Fiddler’s Business Improvement District (FBID) and RTD was
initiated it was during a time when RTD was unsure exactly
how many parking spaces were going to be needed at the
completion of the TREX line. She noted that at that time RTD
agreed to pay $35,000 a month for a little over 1,000 parking
spots. Susan Altes stated that eventually it was discovered
that RTD patrons only used approximately 470 of those spots.
The reduction of spaces needed resulted in an amendment to
Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Directors Archuleta, Folska and Mihalik were absent. Director Anderson participated via
phone.

the contract to reduce the amount of spots RTD needed. With
that amendment, Fiddler’s Green agreed to a repayment
agreement of $1,388,485, which included the repayment for
what RTD had paid into parking plus interest. She made
mentioned that FBID also came to RTD in 2011 to negotiate
the termination of the lease but FBID was unable to follow
through. Ms. Altes explained that FBID revisited the
termination of the contract late last year. She said that FBID
will have to pay $1,100,000 to terminate lease. The first
payment is due to RTD by January 31, 2017 in the amount of
$800,000 with 340 of the 470 parking spaces released back
to them. Their second payment of $300,000 is due on, or
before January 2018.
Director Broom asked if the motivation behind terminating the
contract is so more buildings can be built on this land. Susan
Altes replied by saying it is partially the motivation, but FBID
wants to ensure parking for new businesses coming into the
district.
Director Broom asked how the final figure was determined.
Susan Altes explained that it was determined by the asset
type.
Director Francone asked if there were any sanctions placed on
FBID when they failed to fulfill their contract in 2013. Susan
Altes stated that the agreement was terminated by lack of
funds. Director Francone asked if there were any early
termination penalties. Susan Altes replied that there were no
penalties assessed.
Director Tisdale questioned why patrons are using the Park-nRide across the highway instead of the lot on the west side
closer to the lightrail. Susan Altes responded that the Park-nRide on the east side of the highway is more accessible. The
lot to the west of the highway is located in a neighborhood
with some difficulty to get to.
Director Sisk asked what guarantees that FBID has to
demonstrate they will be able to fulfill their payment obligation
this time. Susan Altes ensured that FBID would fulfill their
agreement.
Director Anderson stated that this is an excellent idea.
Director Broom asked if those parking spaces are used during

• Approval of 2017 - 2019 Granite Paver Maintenance Contract for 16th
Street Mall Transitway Lanes
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for
16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $2,865,102.16. Funding for the first
year of this action is $915,680 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
Motion:

Director Broom made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp stated that staff is requesting to hire a
contractor to maintain the pavers on the 16th Street Mall per
the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and
County of Denver.
Henry Stopplecamp introduced Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Senior
Manager, Engineering/Chief Engineer to provide a more in
depth overview of the proposal.
Jyotsna Vishwakarma stated that staff typically puts out a bid
every three years. Jeff Cluphf, Park -n- Ride Construction
Manager, said his team is always looking for ways to do it
better and cheaper and the team is familiar with what type of
work is needed to maintain the mall. A request for bids was
submitted with the required specifications and now staff is
requesting to award the bid to the lowest bidder.

6.B

Director Francone stated that the math in the proposal did not
match up to what was presented. Jyotsna Vishwakarma
stated that prices were adjusted each year in anticipation of
cost of living increases.

Director Tisdale asked if the contract only covers the pavers
where the MallRide shuttles travel. Henry Stopplecamp
affirmed that this contract only covers the area where the
MallRide shuttles travel.
Director Solano stated that the previous contractors assigned
to maintain the pavers went into bankruptcy. He proceeded to
ask if Gallegos Corporation submitted the bid that lost. Jeff
Cluphf confirmed that Colorado Customs bid lower than
Gallegos Corporation and that’s why they were awarded the
contract. Director Solano stated that Gallegos Corporation
knew the work that was involved in maintaining the pavers
and knew that’s why their bid was higher, to encompass all of
the costs in maintenance of the pavers. Director Solano also
stated that in his opinion, Gallegos Corporation would have
been the better vendor.

give an overview of the inspection program.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone asked Henry Stopplecamp if he could
anticipate a solution to the high price of maintaining the mall.
Henry Stopplecamp stated that the contract is a year-by-year
contract and it is based strictly on work orders. If there are no
work orders, then the contract goes away.

6.B

Chair Hoy asked if both RTD and the freight company inspect the freight and
commuter train bridges. Henry Stopplecamp replied that only RTD does
inspect all of the freight bridges and Denver Transit Partners (DTP) inspects
the commuter rail bridges with the exception of Denver Union Station.
Chair Hoy stated that he was under the impression that the pedestrian
bridge at the Westminster station was being inspected by BNSF Railway.
Henry Stopplecamp replied that Westminster station is considered a tunnel
and Denver Transit Partners inspects that tunnel and BNSF periodically
checks it.
Director Broom asked if there were any continuing conversations between
RTD and The City of Aurora about the pedestrian bridge at 9-mile. Henry
Stopplecamp replied the City of Aurora has reached out to RTD and they
have planned to meet soon.
Committee Chair Lubow asked why RTD does not have in-house inspectors
for this type of work and Mr. Stopplecamp stated that RTD does not have
the in-house resources to offer this niched specialty and the independent
inspectors take on the liability of their inspections on those bridges.

• I-25 & Broadway Station
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, introduced the team
working on the I-25 & Broadway Station project; Kate Iverson, Manager of
Transit Oriented Development, and Jenifer Ross-Amato, Deputy General
Counsel. Bill Van Meter explained that they would go over presentation of
project to the Board.
Kate Iverson gave a brief overview of the station for the new Board
Members. She provided the history of the station, the transit operations,
physical layout, the expansion area, planning stages, activity around the
station and the next steps in development.
Jenifer Ross-Amato explained that there are several public entities looking at
forming an Inter-Governmental Agreement. She asked the Board to share

Ken Fleck explained that RTD is responsible for inspecting 102 bridges with
14 of those bridges being freight rail bridges. Within this inspection process
bridges are inspected for structural deterioration and overall safety. Ken
Fleck stated that RTD has used the same external bridge inspection service
for the past 15 years. Henry Stopplecamp added that bridge inspections are
a preventive maintenance but also stressed that they are a requirement from
Federal Railroad Administration and American Public Transportation
Administration.

any concerns with the team regarding the I-25 & Broadway Station, so they
may be shared with the other entities. She stated that RTD’s main objective
is to ensure that there is no impact to service during this transition.

Director Williams then asked for confirmation that RTD is entering into a
partnership with two entities and not the other two. Kate Iverson responded
that RTD has adopted an approval process governing how RTD responds to
unsolicited proposals from private development entities. She said that RTD
has not been given a proposal and that it would not be appropriate to enter
into a development agreement with an unfamiliar entity. She said RTD is
looking to work with the City and County of Denver and the URA to ensure
that RTD is part of the decision-making process.
Director Solano asked who owned the land under the flyover. Jenifer RossAmato stated that RTD owns it with a small triangle belonging to BNSF.
Director Solano stated that it is his understanding that this area has free
parking. He asked if the lot will convert to paid parking once it is paved.
Kate Iverson stated that there is not a specific plan for that area at this
moment. She reminded the Board that this will be a 25-year process, similar
to the build out of the Stapleton Development Area.
Director Walked stated that he participated in the initial task force for this
proposal. He remarked that he uses this station a lot when he uses the bus
to get to the train. He emphasized that he is interested in the design features
of the designated area in regards to the entrance and exit points.
Director Francone stated that she uses this station too and she stressed that
the construction and congestion makes it very difficult to get through the
area. She asked how many parking spaces are currently at that location.
Kate Iverson replied that there are 1050 parking spaces that RTD owns and
another 60 are on a short term lease. Director Francone stressed that the
objective should be not to lose any more parking spaces to developers.
Director Francone requested access to the full plan.
Director Broom asked if there was surplus property that the railroad owns
that could be incorporated in this plan. Henry Stopplecamp responded that
there is BNSF and Union Pacific property in that area, but he does not think

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Williams asked for confirmation that the private organization that
owns the former Gates land, the City and County of Denver, and RTD are
the entities involved in the project. Kate Iverson said the other parties are
the urban renewal authority (URA) and a metro district created by a prior
developer that will own and construct much of the public infrastructure on
the private organization’s land.

6.B

that they would be willing to share that property. Director Broom said this
area could be used for additional parking with a pedestrian overpass to allow
extra space for redevelopment. Kate Iverson stated that there may be
challenges for patrons to access a parking lot in that area.

Director Menten requested more information off line as she has a lot of
questions about Urban Renewal.
Director Williams asked if there is any relevant lessons to be learned from
the Alameda Station redevelopment. She stated there is some retail in that
area that is contributing to that plan. Kate Iverson said that the City and
County of Denver and the URA are interested in rescinding and reinstating
the urban renewal plan issued in 2001.
Director Walker stated that there needs to be accurate community outreach
to the constituents to inform them that there may be more parking within
the neighborhoods if parking spaces are abolished. He said the area is
walkable, so there may not be as much need for parking.
Director Anderson declared that this is a great idea to work with our
partners in Denver. She also specified that we need to protect the way our
commenters use this area, but at the same time, RTD has an excellent
opportunity to make this a great place.

• 16th Street Mall Transitway Rehabilitation Project: NEPA Process Update
Bill Van Meter introduced Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, to give a
brief overview of the 16th Street Mall transit way.
Susan Wood explained that any projects that are federally funded need to be
vetted through National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
Susan Wood proceeded to give a more in-depth history of the mall and
stated that historical importance of the historical design by I.M. Pei could
affect any reconstruction in the future. She explained that RTD has
participated in various studies over the years to find out the best practices
to mitigate the cost of the upkeep of the pavers. She said that through this
process it was evident that the scope of work needed to be broadened to
include the City and County of Denver. Susan Wood said that the scope
needed to encompass such factors as location, transit lanes, livability
factors, how the mall is being used, and how adjacent areas are being used
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk emphasized looking at the first and last mile, and he is also
interested in seeing budget positive and not budget neutral development. He
emphasized that RTD learned some very valuable lessons with the Union
Station process and gave up properties to get it done. He also stated that
RTD owes it to our taxpayers to bring in a revenue stream.

6.B

Susan Wood said in moving forward, RTD and the City and County of
Denver are discussing partnering for this project. She stated that the
environmental assessment and preliminary design would involve cost sharing
between the two agencies. She added that RTD’s own studies regarding
the mall will add value to the study that City and County of Denver will be
spearheading. Susan Wood stated that the City and County of Denver will
initiate an RFP for consultants for this project with RTD participating. She
also noted that a communications team has been formed between the two
agencies to keep both agencies informed throughout this project.
Susan Wood explained that in the first quarter of the year the committee’s
goal is to complete the procurement process. She said in the second quarter
of the year the consultant will begin work on the environmental assessment,
alternatives analysis, and the preliminary design. She stated that the goal is
to have the assessment completed by the end of the year.
Director Menten asked if the scope was being broadened to include other
parties and to spend more money. Susan Wood responded that there was
significant discussion about issues outside of just maintaining RTD’s portion,
and the conclusion was to work on all 16th Street issues at the same time.
Bill Van Meter stated that the Board is in alignment with the staff, who want
to limit our exposure and reduce, or eliminate, costs involved with
maintaining the pavers.
Director Menton asked what the annual maintenance cost would be if RTD
replaced it with concrete. Henry Stopplecamp stated that it would not cost
RTD anything to maintain concrete on an annual basis. He informed the
Board that RTD’s goal is to hand it over to Denver because it is a City street.
He then stated that the only reason we are maintaining the mall because of
the granite pavers and an agreement RTD made in 1984.
Director Solano asked if the Historical Society is still giving RTD push back.
Susan Wood stated that they will definitely be able to weigh in on any
decisions that are made.
Director Francone asked for clarification regarding how much of this project
is roadway. Bill Van Meter confirmed that approximately 30% of this
project is roadway related.
Director Walker stated that he is in agreement with this proposal. He has
participate in a large number of environmental assessments in the past and
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

by pedestrians and visitors. She stated that the revised scope should
include environmental clearance, an environmental assessment, and a
preliminary design.

6.B

said they are constructive and it will help identify the impacts at the larger
scope.
Director Anderson stated that the 16th Street Mall Shuttle is one of our best
services. She followed up by saying that it would be great to reduce our
maintenance costs and stressed that City and County of Denver’s entities
typically take care of roadways; however, our past agreement has keep us
tied to the maintenance. She stated that she trusts that RTD staff will have
the Board’s best interest in moving forward.

Henry Stopplecamp gave an update on the B, G, and R Lines and the
University of Colorado A Line. He said that the FRA removed the 10 mile-per
hour restriction at the BNSF at-grade fuel crossing and granted the
University of Colorado A Line waiver, which would allow testing to resume
on the updated hardware and software installed by Denver Transit Partners
(DTP). He said that the issue with the gates was that they remain lowered
10 to 15 seconds longer than intended, though he stated that the gates are
safe. He said that forward progress was being made to resume testing on
the G Line.
Henry Stopplecamp said that the next step for the University of Colorado A
Line would be for DTP to remove flaggers and for RTD to receive approval
from the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and proceed with the quiet zone
process. He said that ridership on the A Line was still strong, with17,000
boardings per day, 87% of which are on time and 97.7% of which are
within 15 minutes of schedule. He summarized that the University of
Colorado A Line delivered good performance and said that DTP had
prioritized eastbound runs to the airport rather than westbound runs toward
Denver. He mentioned that the Arvada parking structure opened the previous
week and said that RTD will receive spots in the adjacent parking lot
following the open G Line opening. He said that the 41st and Fox and Pecos
stations along the B Line would be opened on the upcoming runboard. He
also said that the R line would open on Feb 24th.
Henry Stopplecamp stated that the R Line crossings are working as intended
and that those particular crossings are different from those along the
University of Colorado A Line. He said that RTD has received signoff from
the PUC and City of Aurora with regard to the R Line crossings.

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer/Assistant General Manager of Finance
and Administration, explained that since the Finance division issues the
passes, her department conducted the audit. She stated that it costs RTD
approximately $1.3 million dollars every year to produce the passes. Heath
Copp reported out that through the audit it was discovered that RTD issued
434,000 passes in 2017.
Heather Copp confirmed that passes are given to Marketing in bulk for
surveys and new residence programs, to Board Members for their
discretionary use, for customer service requests, and some are given to Risk
Management for settlements and disaster relief situations. Heather Copp
said that Marketing has agreed not to send out three free bus passes with
initial surveys instead they will only mail out three once the survey is
completed. She also mentioned that the Customer Service group hands out
less than 300 a year. Heather Copp further explained that if RTD could
reduce the amount of passes given out then doing so will cut down on
printing costs. She stated that in moving forward if a Board member has a
constituent that is upset about a route then they need to forward that
person to the Telephone Information Center (TIC) for follow up and tracking
purposes. She stated that Board members can also forward information to
Barbara McManus, Executive Director of the Board Office for assistance.
Director Williams stated that she needs assistance from public relations on
speaking points. She needs to know what to tell agencies who received
passes in the past from previous directors.
Director Menten thanked Chair Hoy for making this change to the program.
She mentioned that the number of free passes the Board was issued was
shocking, averaging 6700 passes a year.
Chair Hoy said the decision to alter the allotment of the Free Ride Passes
from the Board has been made. He also stated that if there is a reason that

Packet Pg. 21

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy reminded the Board and staff that last year there was an audit on
Free Ride Passes. He said that in this audit, the findings showed that RTD
gave out Free Ride Passes, in the amount $1 million dollars. In the past, the
Board of Directors would get their passes and distributed them however they
wanted but that will not be the case in moving forward. Chair Hoy stated
that the reason he is bringing this up in Other Matters is because there is not
Study Session next week. He said that some Board members have asked
for their passes and he wanted to respond to their request sooner rather
than later.

6.B

it needs to go to a Board vote; then he will ask Rolf Asphaug, General
Counsel, to research.
Director Anderson said she did not understand this decision and she asked
to see the policy written out before it is adopted. She stated that she has
always given the Arvada Food Bank 100 coupons a year as did her
predecessors. She stressed that in all the years she has been in her seat
that she had never misused the passes. She said it was unfair that she was
not involved in this process and no one asked her what she did with her
passes.

B. Recommended Actions

• Salaried Trustee Appointments
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. ______
appointing Directors Bob Broom, and reappointing Director Judy Lubow and
employees Luong (Lou) Ha and Sylvia Francis, to terms expiring 12/31/2018
as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and
Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the February 28,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, explained that, pursuant to the resolution, Director Broom would be
replacing former Chair Tobiassen, and that Director Lubow and RTD employees Lou Ha and
Sylvia Francis would be reappointed.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said that there are two separate groups involved with the
pension trust but they meet at the same time. He said that the employee side is comprised
of the CEO and four employee members, two of whom are in the newer defined
contribution plan and two are in the pension plan. He said that the pension trust structure
was approved by the Board last year and that the appointments in the resolutions are
consistent with that structure.
Director Anderson said she would be voting yes on the resolution.

C. Updates

• Salaried Employee DB Pension Plan
Wendy Londa of Rael and Letson reported on the state of the salaried
employee pension plan.
She presented the following information:
 The total participant count decreased by 14 (from 701 to 687)
 The plan closed to new participants on January 1, 2008
 The active population decreased from 361 to 327
 The plan’s actuarial accrued liability increased by $11.3M (from
$146.5M to $157.8M)
 The actuarial value of assets increased by $2.7M (from $120.9M to
$123.6M)
 The unfunded actuarial accrued liability increased by $8.6M (from
$25.6M to $34.2M)
 The funded ratio based on the actuarial value of assets decreased from
82.5% to 78.3%
 The funded ratio based on the market value of assets decreased from
88.7% to 77.8%
 The recommended contribution increased by $0.8M from $6.8M to
$7.6M
Wendy Londa stated that, effective in 2016, the Board’s funding policy
changed from recommending a set contribution amount to an amount that
was “actuarially sound” based on recommendations of the actuary and
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Based on the investment return of -.5% in
2015, and with a funding assumption of $4.1 million and assuming all

The Motion: The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson,

Solano, Tisdale, Walker, Williams) and 0 against.
Directors Anderson, Folska, and Francone were
absent.

6.C

funding assumptions were met each year, she stated the fund would be
100% funded by 2043. She noted that the higher contribution in 2016
offset the plan losses in 2015. She commented that, due to the plan being
closed to new participants and decreasing in size, future investment returns
have a significant impact on the plan’s projected liabilities.
She said that her firm would continue to monitor funding levels, recommend
contribution amounts and methodologies, note the policies of other public
pension systems, and continue to report to the Board annually.

Leslie Thompson, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company, reported that the
pension plan for represented employees is in funding peril. She said that
contributions were not sufficient to offset liabilities and that fully funding the
plan going forward would require a 29% total payroll contribution, up from
the 18% currently contributed, and that the amount needed is increasing
each year. She said that, at current funding levels, the fund is expected to
be out of money by 2035, whereas last year the fund was projected to run
out in 2039. She said that the current assumption for returns on investment
is at 7% annually; at a realized 6% annual rate of return, the fund would be
depleted by 2033. She said that the accrued liability of the fund increased
$9 million to a total of $436 million and the annual rate of asset returns was
4.77%, short of the 7% assumed annual rate. She said that paying off the
plan immediately would require a lump-sum payment of $224 million. She
noted that the benefits offered to new hires are not as generous as those
granted to previous hires and that the costs associated with new plan
members were much less expensive.
Leslie Thompson stated that the last time the plan was fully funded was in
2002 and that the funded ratio degraded over time, to a low of 48.5% in
2016. She said that in 2002 over 100% of the required contribution was
made and since then the ratio has dropped and currently hovers around
50%; in comparison, she said the average percentage in the public sector is
in the 70s. She noted that reforms were made to the bargaining agreement,
such as Amendment 22, which significantly reduced benefits and changed
the vesting requirements, retirement age, and maximum years of service of
those hired after January 2011. She said that the unfunded liability accrued
for employees hired before that date is significant. She said that, at the
current rate, $40 million in annual benefit payments are required if all
benefits are to continue to be paid. She mentioned that she did not know if
it is legally possible to decrease benefits to retirees. She stated that the only
way to save the plan would be through additional contributions.
Director Broom asked whether employees pay social security, and Leslie
Thompson confirmed that they do.

• Represented Employee DB Plan

6.C

Director Tisdale stated that the salaried pension plan annual rate of return
for 2016 was 9.4% and asked for the rate of return for the represented
plan.
Leslie Thompson said the she was not aware of the rate for 2016, but for
2015 it was -.86%, a rate similar to that of the salaried pension plan over
the same year.

Leslie Thompson said the answer to that question was not within her
purview.
Director Lubow then asked why the funding levels decreased after 2002.
Leslie Thompson stated that the funding contributions were negotiated and
the liabilities increased due to pension plan improvements.
Heather McKillop stated that the benefits increased after 2002 and that
contributions did not keep pace, which meant that the funding gap widened.
General Manager Genova said the trust increased their contribution multiplier
at that time as well, which improved the benefit, but the contributions
remained the same.
Leslie Thompson said financial meltdowns in 2008 and 2009 were also a
factor. She said it is difficult for negotiated pension trusts to respond quickly
to financial meltdowns.
Director Sisk asked whether the union was aware of the situation, to which
General Manager Genova said yes. Director Sisk went on to say that the
Board had heard the same presentation last year and the outlook had not
improved. He said that RTD owes it to the union to help correct this drastic
situation, as the employees are the agency’s most valuable asset. He said it
would be hard to say to the newer employees that the vested employees
need to be taken care of when the contract is renegotiated in 2018. He
asked whether the prior pension had better return on investments.
Heather McKillop stated that the annual rate of return for 2015 was -.5%,
with the rate of return for the salaried plan running about the same. She said
that the salaried employee plan investment pool is quite different from the
represented pool. She said that investment returns were not good in 2015.
She stated that RTD has a systemically different plan from the represented
plan structure and that RTD took a different approach from the union by
putting new employees on the defined contribution plan, which was created
in 2008. She said that the two plans need to be dealt with in different ways.
Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked who was responsible for making up the shortfall.

6.C

General Manager Genova said a different trust manages the represented
employee plan, with three trustees from the union and three from RTD
management, and their decisions are based on consensus.
Director Deadwyler asked if the contract could be opened to amendment
prior to the five-year renegotiation period.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the represented pension plan would be
renegotiated at that time.
General Manager Genova said that the pension plan would be one of the
primary discussion points.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the union also makes contributions to the
pension plan
General Manager Genova said that the union employees do contribute an
agreed upon amount.
Director Deadwyler asked why RTD was not asking for more contributions
from the union since the plan is in jeopardy.
General Manager Genova said the contributions come from employees or
from RTD and that the union does not contribute directly.
Director Solano inquired as to the average age of an RTD pensioner, which
Leslie Thompson said she could not immediately recall. Director Solano said
that the situation looks bad for new hires.
Heather McKillop said the benefit multiplier had been reduced to 1%, down
from 2.5%, which was needed to stabilize the plan.
Leslie Thompson, answering Director Solano’s earlier question, said that
there are currently 1221 union pensioners, their average age is 75, and that
their average benefit payout is $1,500 per month.
Director Williams asked if any recommended Board action would result from
the presentation.
General Manager Genova said that the represented employee trust manages
the fund and that, unlike the salaried pension fund, the recommendations do
not come before the Board.

General Manager Genova said RTD and the union are getting ready to
renegotiate next year.

6.C

Director Williams said that the Board can see what is going on but cannot
act.

Heather McKillop said that the pension fund would be discussed during the
collective bargaining agreement negotiation cycle. She said that there is no
opportunity to make changes to the plan during the five-year contract
window.
General Manager Genova said that the trustees could make certain plan
changes.
Director Williams asked whether the same presentation would be given to
the represented plan trustees, and General Manager Genova said that it
would and at a much deeper level.
Chair Hoy said that the vesting period had been adjusted from five years to
ten and said that doing so seemed like a prudent move. He asked whether
there is a typical vesting period.
Leslie Thompson said that she had never seen a vesting period longer than
ten years and that the length of a vesting period depends on how much peril
the given plan is in. She said that the most common vesting period is five
years and specified that any contributions made by employees are always
entirely theirs.
Director Broom said that RTD issues debt and that the debt carries an
assigned rating. He asked what rating agencies say about the debt rating for
the pension funding for the District.
Heather McKillop said the ratings agencies ask a lot of questions because
RTD is liable for the salaried plans and the numbers are included in RTD’s
ledgers as mandatory financial disclosures. She said that, for the represented
pension plans, RTD is only liable for the 13% agency contribution, even
though the $244 million liability appears on the books.
Director Anderson asked whether the represented employee pension fund is
tied to their health and welfare plan. She recalled that there was a recent
issue with the Represented employees’ health benefits.
Leslie Thompson said that the health and welfare plan is entirely separate
from the pension plan.
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova responded that, other than through participation of
RTD management employees on the pension trust board, the Board could
not intervene.

6.C

Director Anderson said that RTD needs employees and that the contract
negotiators would have to consider the taxpayers’ ability to pay for pension
plans. She said that pension plans have changed drastically throughout the
business world and that currently companies offer IRA’s or other similar
plans. She concluded by saying the funding gap is serious, but it is nothing
the Board can fix.
Director Deadwyler recalled that the union employees did not receive a raise
for three years and asked whether the employee contribution amount of 5%
would be the increased following a salary increase.
General Manager Genova said that the employees did not see a wage
increase in 2013 or 2014 though they were paid a bonus that was nearly
equal to the amount the wages would have increased. He said they did
receive pay increases in 2015, 2016, and 2017.
Director Deadwyler asked whether higher salaries would result in larger
pension fund contributions.
General Manager Genova said that both RTD and employee contribution
amounts would increase slightly as a result of a pay raise.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that the
previous pay increase did result in an in the contributions by both RTD and
the covered employees.
Director Lubow questioned whether, considering the drastic reduction in plan
valuation after 2002 because of a variety of factors, the renegotiated
contract could include a provision to trigger a pension plan renegotiation in
light of financial emergencies.
General Manager Genova said renegotiating in the middle of a contract
would be complicated because of both the collective bargaining agreement
and the trust. He said the trust controls the plan and any changes to the
plan. He stated that the idea could be discussed though the trust would
have the final say.
Director Lubow said that it would be good to have the flexibility to adapt to
changing circumstances.

Heather McKillop said that there were some issues with the health and
welfare plan. She said that RTD increased contributions in 2016 and that the
plan seems to be doing well at this time. She confirmed that the health and
welfare plan is an entirely separate plan even though it has the same
trustees.

6.C

General Manager Genova said the trust meets frequently and that many
people are involved but stated that the trust has not come to an agreement
since the change to the plan structure in 2010 or 2011.

Committee Chair Menten said it was her impression that the union is
unaware of the funding situation and asked Bruce Abel to confirm whether
that impression was accurate.
Bruce Abel said that, with 2700 union employees, there will be a wide
variance in people’s understanding of the state of the trust. He said it would
not be appropriate for RTD to communicate directly with those employees
regarding the trust.
Committee Chair Menten concurred with Chair Hoy that private sector
pensions are rare. She clarified that the Directors should not attend
represented employee pension trust meetings, and Bruce Abel and Rolf
Asphaug both agreed.

• General Manager Contract Review
Cheryl Wallace, audit partner with Rubin Brown, presented an independent
review of the General Manager’s contract agreement. She said the estimated
salary in 2016 was $336,000 and $332,000 was actually paid. She said the
difference between those amounts was due to the budgeted reimbursement
of legal fees which were not requested. She said that the revised salary
estimate for 2017 is $344,000 and that one column had been added to the
contract review regarding discretionary bonus payments.

• December 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, presented the December 2016 financial review.
He said that the final numbers were undergoing an audit with Rubin Brown.
He stated that the final audited figures would be available in May, though
the sales and use tax accrual, ridership numbers, and fare revenue were final
as of the presentation. He said that December is typically a good revenue
month and that this December’s sales and use tax month returns were
RTD’s highest ever at $55 million, though that figure was .9% below
projections. He said that, while the total revenue for 2016 was $6.166
million below projections, the total revenue figure was much higher than any
year before, $22 million more than in 2015. He said that RTD was subject to
Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel said that he and Doug MacLeod, RTD’s Controller, were two of
the plan trustees and that trust receives a lot of conversation. He said that
the trust was one of the top issues at the bargaining table during the last
collective bargaining agreement discussions. He said that, with quarterly
meetings and other frequent ad hoc meetings, the trust is discussed
regularly.

6.C

Doug MacLeod reminded the Board of the 12% fare increase in 2016 and
noted that there was an 11% increase year-over-year in dollars collected,
some of which increase may be attributable to the $9 cost of a ticket on the
University of Colorado A Line. He noted there has been a shift purchasing,
as more day passes and fewer 10-ride passes have been sold. He said that
with so many factors to take into consideration it is difficult to pinpoint the
reason for the ridership decline. He said that increased fare revenue helped
to offset ridership drop.
Heather McKillop said that 2017 would be a volatile year and that she was
pleased that the actual revenues came within $2 million of the projected
figures of $700 million especially with so many changes overall. She said
that she hoped to see lower annual expenditures for the past year once the
books were closed and will report on the final numbers once the audit is
completed.
General Manager Genova said ridership was a topic of discussion at the
recent APTA CEO conference. He learned that there had been a decrease in
ridership across the nation last year, with an increase only in certain types of
services. He said that the attendees offered no solutions or guesses as to
why that trend is happening but stated that RTD’s ridership decline seems
average among the other transit agencies.
Director Deadwyler asked for more information on the refunds mentioned by
Doug MacLeod.
Doug MacLeod said that he would not be able to disclose certain things but
mentioned that a telecom company won a dispute over $2 million in tax
payments and that the other refund was over $700,000. He said that RTD
receives tax assessments from the Department of Revenue automatically
and frequently and that these adjustments were larger than usual.
Director Lubow asked whether the fare increase had placed the fare at a
point beyond which riders were willing to pay.
Heather McKillop said that it would be easier to determine whether the fare
increases were causing the ridership decline if it had been the only systemic
change. However, she said that, with three new lines and changes in fare
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

two fairly large tax refunds during the year totaling $3.2 million, which
accounts for more than half of the $6 million projection shortfall. He also
said that ridership decreased by 1.7 million last year to a total of 101.3
million riders using both revenue and non-revenue services. He said that
some of the decline in ridership could be accounted for in the opening of the
University of Colorado A Line. He further stated that annual fare revenue
increased by $4 million despite the decline in ridership.

6.C

structures, pinning the reason behind the decline to a single cause would be
difficult. She said that some information could possibly be gained by
correlating statistical information with fare increase and would report back
to the Board.
General Manager Genova pointed out that changes in zone structure could
also be a factor.

General Manager Genova said yes and noted that, when the economy is
good and gas is reasonably priced, people make convenience choices.
Director Broom said he had read that an increase in fares results in a 5%
loss of ridership and that previous level of ridership takes time to restore.
Doug MacLeod said that RTD adjusts fares once every 3 years. He said that,
in reviewing a number of previous fare increase years, RTD experienced a
ridership increase in every year except one. He said there may be a point of
elasticity at which people will not pay more but offered to look into the
question.
Director Solano said a newspaper article stated Denver has a larger
immigrant population than other major cities and asked whether staff had
taken into consideration the impact of an immigrant ban.
General Manager Genova said RTD would not be getting involved in those
politics. He said that some agencies, like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) and
other agencies that service sanctuary cities, are discussing the potential
impacts.
Director Solano said he has heard from civil rights attorneys that sting
operations are already underway in Denver and suggested that RTD adopt a
proactive contingency plan for the agency.
Director Tisdale said that, with fare increase of 10% and a drop in gas prices
of 10% on a month-to-month basis year over year, a 1.6% drop in ridership
does not sound like a shocking number. He suggested that RTD might have
budgeted aggressively but suggested the 1.6% decline could be attributable
to the price of gas.
Chair Hoy said that reviewing fare increases and reduced ridership would
render a picture of what is happening in Denver but noted that ridership is
down nationwide and that not every transit agency had a fare increase last
year. He said he suspects the ridership decline to be a national issue and
suggested that gas prices, the economy, employment levels may play a role

not necessarily related to the 2016 fare increase. He said that RTD changed
so many things last year system-wide that there has been a dynamic change
in how the agency collect fares.
Director Deadwyler said that her constituents are saying they are not using
RTD services because of cost of parking. She said that, when adding the
cost of parking into consideration, RTD services are not cost effective for
them.

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, gave the quarterly
investment report. He said the fourth quarter was interesting because federal
reserve increased rates by .25% and that, as interest rates rise, the value of
bonds goes down. He said that the value of RTD’s assets experienced a
slight decrease and that the fund performance is reflected in the balance
sheet. He stated that RTD’s investment goal is to mimic the performance of
certain benchmarks and that the agency continues to be in line with those
trends.

• SmartCard Project Update
Tonya Anderson, Electronic Fare Operations Manager, reported that the
Retail Point of Sale system located at King Soopers and Safeway stores
underwent the first live test on February 1. She said that pilot participants
made nine transactions totaling $325 during a two-week period. She said
that King Soopers’ kiosk went live first and that Safeway would go live any
day. She said that RTD is working on training the store manager at a second
store and that three stores will be participating by next month.
She stated that Conduent, the SmartCard project contractor, had completed
remediation on two of the three issues identified during the nine-week
testing period. She said her team was verifying Conduent’s proposed fixes.
Heather McKillop said May 10, 2017, would be the go live date for the
stored value cards in the pilot King Soopers store. She said that 2,000 pilot
users would be participating in the trial and that the pilot program would go
live to the public on May 24, 2017. She stated the project team has been
testing and that Conduent has been cooperating in order to fix any problems
before the go live date.
Director Menten said that the King Soopers store is located at Colfax and
Speer and asked the location of the others.
Heather McKillop said the other locations were both Safeway stores and that
one was at Alameda and Broadway and the other at Colfax and Garrison.

Chair Hoy asked whether the changeover from Xerox to Conduent was the
reason for the recent progress.
Heather McKillop said she was not sure of the reason but speculated the
new project manager may have had an impact. She said that the project
now had momentum and was happy for the progress regardless of the
cause.

Heather McKillop said that the cards could be loaded either by cash or credit
and that eventually vendors would receive 1.25% of the total amount of the
transactions. She said that currently the participating stores do not receive
any fee.
Director Williams asked whether any data collection was being performed
with respect to the users of the SmartCards.
Heather McKillop said yes but noted that one of the areas where RTD could
not regularly collect information was on trains. She said bus riders could not
board a bus without tapping and that commuter rail passengers are checked
regularly. She said RTD is working on new and improved ways of checking
SmartCards as well as Eco and College Passes.
Director Williams stated that RTD should partner with the firm that posts
seatbelt advertisements to raise awareness.
General Manager Genova said a fare enforcement report would be presented
at the next meeting. He said that San Diego started its own SmartCard
project in 2003 and that the city still does not have a stored value product.
He stated that San Diego uses a different provider, Cubic, which is big
player in the market.
Director Deadwyler said her constituents have complained about the location
of validators and asked whether they could be moved to a different location.
Heather McKillop said she assumed the validators were located close to
electrical conduits but offered to find out more.
General Manager Genova said that certain places on the platforms have a
natural flow and that platform areas are so large that the location of
validators might not be convenient for everyone.
Director Deadwyler said that the Dallas and Portland transit agencies have
the validators on the platforms themselves.
Packet Pg. 36

Director Broom asked whether the SmartCards could be loaded with credit

Director Solano asked whether fare evasion was factored into the budget.
General Manager Genova said that fare evasion numbers would be given in
the next presentation but that fare evasion was not factored into budgeting.

• NextRide and Trip Planner Demonstration

Tiffany Angel said that RTD publically released transit data for use by third
parties and that doing so was a good way to push out RTD-related
information at no cost to the agency. She said that eight third-party
applications currently use RTD data and that her team works closely with
the creators of TransitApp, an application used by 20,000 riders each
month. She said that RTD had recently launched location data for buses and
that the IT staff was working to do the same for light rail. She said the
location data for commuter rail service could not go forward without
negotiations with Denver Transit Partners (DTP).
Tiffany Angel said that the NextRide application launched December 21,
2016, on the RTD website. She said the RTD website itself received 16.5
million hits and 40 million page views annually, with 70% of traffic coming
from mobile devices. She said that Next Ride offered real time information
on bus location. She said a multifaceted marketing campaign would be
rolling out in March to promote Next Ride. She said the other product
launched recently was Trip Planner, which now gives both RTD customer
care agents and customers a similar interface, thereby improving customer
service. She said Trip Planner features real-time arrival and departure times
for buses.
Director Williams asked if RTD would be demonstrating the applications in
colleges and schools.
Tiffany Angel said she had not considered doing so but would take the idea
back to her team. She said the team had provided demonstrations via
GoToMeeting and would be able to tape those demonstrations and make
them available online.
Director Williams said that local transportation organizations are always
seeking presenters.

Tiffany Angel, Manager of Digital Communications, and Rahul Sood,
Manager of Software Architecture and Development, spoke about the RTDcreated NextRide and Trip Planner transit applications.

Tiffany Angel said her team has been in touch with the City of Boulder,
which just received a relevant grant for $70,000 and wants to help promote
the applications using that money.
Director Williams said that many of the organizations she works with outside
of RTD would want to promote these products and asked to speak to her
offline.

Tiffany Angel said that bike share information was not yet available on the
NextRide and Trip Planner applications.
Rahul Sood said that his team was working with the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG) to add a layer to the applications for bike
share locations.
Director Walker asked whether Zipcar locations were also displayed.
Rahul Sood said that information was not incorporated yet.
Tiffany Angel said that bike travel information would be included, as well as
special event services, following a second wave of funding that would allow
her team to expand the offerings in 2018.
Director Walker said that Uber had been collecting transit information,
though the company does not share it readily.
Rahul Sood said he recently attended an OpenTripPlanner meeting, which is
an open-source platform for multi-modal and multi-agency journey planning.
He said that RTD has access through that platform to data gathered by third
parties.
Director Tisdale asked whether standalone mobile applications would be
released for NextRide and Trip Planner
Tiffany Angel said her team was looking into mobile applications. She said
spending money is difficult to justify when third parties create applications
for free.
Chair Hoy asked for an explanation as to whether a mobile application would
be preferable to browser-based application.
Tiffany Angel said the decision is about packaging. She said people like to
download apps and to have home screen icons. She stated that using

Director Walker mentioned that one of the applications he uses shows bike

NextRide and Trip Planner via browser on a mobile device would give the
user the same experience as though they were launched via a mobile
application. She further stated that an application could deliver push
notifications, which would not be available on a browser.
Rahul Hood said that one of the benefits of a browser-based application is
that multiple phone versions need not be developed.

C. Updates

• 4th Quarter 2016 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety,
Security and Asset Management, stated that he and Steve Martingano
would provide an overview of the fare enforcement program and specifically
how it works.
Steve Martingano, Transit Police Commander of Fare Enforcement
Operations, commented that previously, fare enforcement fell under CRS 189-115, a criminal code, but now it is under CRS 42-4-1416(2), which is
similar to a traffic infraction. He stated that if someone fails to pay their
ticket, they will not be able to obtain or renew their driver’s license.
Currently, the first offense will result in a written warning. A second
offense will result in a ticket that is $82.50 or $106.50, depending on the
jurisdiction that it is written in. A third offense will result in a ticket and a
30-day suspension from all RTD services.
Steve Martingano added that fare enforcement is done by a Transit Security
Officer (TSO) or an off duty police officer. RTD’s light rail system is
currently divided into four zones: Central, Southeast, Southwest, and West.
The Central Zone has 14 transit officers, the Southeast has 22, the
Southwest has 9, and the West has 15. In December, a Fare Task Force
was created with six transit security officers to devote inspection time to
rush hour service. These officers are not restricted to zones or specific lines
and they allow other transit officers to handle calls for service and to
perform rides and bus checks.

Directors Archuleta, Folska, Francone, and Solano were absent. Director Anderson
participated via phone and left the meeting early.

6.D

General Manager Genova noted that the Fare Task Force was done without
adding headcount. Instead, RTD shifted its resources to create this
program.

General Manager Genova commented that the estimated cost of lost revenue
from fare evasion is $531,000 annually. He stated that when the cost
benefit analysis is examined, it does not make sense to harden RTD’s
stations. He noted that he called other transit agencies to get their
numbers, and LA Metro indicated that, while they had hardened stations and
added turnstiles, they still have fare evasion. In addition to hardening and
turnstiles, LA Metro is now adding an additional 77 fare inspectors. He
noted that there is a perception that people are riding RTD trains without
buying tickets. He explained that a lot of RTD riders use pre-paid fare media
that would not require them to buy a ticket, or stop at a kiosk.
Director Deadwyler asked if Eco Pass holders receive citations for failure to
tap their cards.
Steve Martingano said no. He noted for the people that do not tap their
cards, officers explain the process and indicate that failure to do so is
against RTD’s policy. The interaction between the TSO and the pass holder
is meant to be an educational moment to inform the pass holder of the
proper way to use their card. He noted that staff will be doing more
outreach and communication in schools to teach students how to use their
cards.
General Manager Genova stated that college students and Eco Pass holders
use pre-paid media, which is why they do not get a citation. He remarked
that people that use stored value cards, which decreases the amount every
time the card it tapped, will get a ticket for failure to tap their card.
Director Menten asked if RTD would hire additional members for the Fare
Task Force.
General Manager Genova said four new task force members would be
moved over from existing resources.
Director Tisdale commented that it is worthwhile to regroup staff in order to
capture fare evaders during rush hour service.
Mike Meader remarked that staff is currently examining commuter rail
numbers and is working on getting light rail figures closer to those numbers.
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Steve Martingano explained that staff examined the costs to harden stations
and the estimates ranged from $123 to $175 million dollars, with an
additional $16.7 million in annual operating costs.

6.D

Director Tisdale noted that the conversations he has had with women about
their reluctance to travel alone on bus or rail is striking and their concerns
need to be addressed.

Steve Martingano stated that the TSO’s go from the first stop to the last
stop and back. He said they come into contact with a lot of people, and
they make more contacts because they are on that train on a consistent
basis.
Director Sisk said it always interests him when facts get in the way of
opinions. He hoped that this presentation would put a lot of discussion
about fare evasion to rest.
Director Lubow asked if the $1.8 million estimate to add an officer to every
train was a net cost.
Steve Martingano stated that the total hours of service were figured into the
current contract in order to determine that number.
Director Lubow commented that staff should perform a cost analysis to
determine the net cost of adding an officer to every train as it may be
worthwhile and benefit RTD.
Chair Hoy added that the fines collected from tickets do not go to RTD. He
explained that, when people receive a citation, the fine goes to the county
or municipal court of the county. While RTD writes the tickets, the various
municipalities get the money.
Director Menten asked what the collection rate was for the counties.
Steve Martingano said that Denver County was the only one that responded
back to him, and in 2016, they collected $20,620 off of RTD’s citations.
Director Anderson stated that she does not think that an extra officer on
each train will make the system safer. She added that, being a woman who
travels alone, it is imperative to be aware of the surroundings and of what is
going on.

• Lost Service Hours Update
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, indicated that
there were a total of 270 lost service hours for the month of January. He

Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Mihalik observed that the Southwest zone has the fewest amount
of TSO’s, but contact the most people. He asked if the nine TSO’s assigned
to that zone are extremely proficient.

6.D

stated that, while lost service hours are improving, staff is still operating
under mandates.
Director Lubow asked if there are particular areas or routes that have more
lost service hours and if certain routes are more troublesome than others.

Director Broom asked if lost service hours are related to the weather.
Bruce Abel noted that to some degree lost service hours are directly
correlated to the weather conditions. He added that staff saw more of an
impact the previous year because there were more snow days than there
have been for the current year.

 55S Ridership Update (no back-up)
Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the 55S was the special bus service
implemented between Olde Town Arvada and Union Station until the G line
could be opened. He stated that ridership continues to be challenged and
this route is being socialized for the May service changes. He added that
ridership is at 6 to 7 passengers per hour, which is much lower than staff
had expected.
Chair Hoy reminded the Board that this route was established because the G
line was postponed. He wished more people would utilize the service, but
noted that even though it is available, many will not.
Bruce Abel added that Director Anderson has been apprised of the current
status of the 55S.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the 55S would continue until the G line
opens, or whether staff would remove the line from service.
Bruce Abel stated that conversations concerning the 55S will continue
through next month, and possibly, it would be included in the service
changes for May.

D. Other Matters
Chair Hoy stated that the Board should receive an email for the upcoming retreat
and noted that everyone would also need to fill out the attached survey. He asked
any Board members who did not receive the survey email to contact the Board
Office.
Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 14, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bruce Abel explained that staff uses daily information to determine if there is
disproportionate coverage and tries not to lose consecutive trips, if possible.
He added that certain routes are particularly troublesome, but staff strives to
make sure those routes are triaged appropriately.

6.D

General Manager Genova commented that the Board had been updated throughout
the day with what information was available concerning the accident on the
University of Colorado A Line, but there was still not much more to add. He stated
that staff had spent a lot of time at the scene in the morning and that the Aurora
Police Department (APD) did an excellent job. He added that staff was able to
review the functionality of the at-grade crossing equipment with the Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA), and they were satisfied that everything was
operating correctly. He noted that, as far as what the official finding may be, the
APD is in charge of determining the cause of death.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs and Facilities,
commented that the important thing was that every team worked well together to
examine the area and to determine what happened. He added that staff planned to
reopen the University of Colorado A Line by 9 p.m.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, explained that Nate
Currey, Senior Manager of Communications, had been talking to APD. APD stated
that, once they notify the next of kin, they will release the video of what happened.
He added that RTD would need to educate the media about the exit gates, as they
remain open if a vehicle is present in the crossing.
Henry Stopplecamp stated that there were three cameras that show the full
narrative of what happened.
Director Menten said that she was interested in seeing the video. She asked what
kind of numbers RTD has for people that have committed suicide on RTD’s system.
General Manager Genova commented that often times there needs to be evidence
to specify a suicide ruling. He said that staff has data for light rail going back all
the way to when it opened and staff can pull those numbers.
Director Lubow remarked that the Board received copies of a complaint to the FRA
which stated RTD does not have a safe system. She asked how that complaint
would factor into the FRA’s opinion of the University of Colorado A Line and the
current waiver.
General Manager Genova said the FRA would review all complaints and make a
final determination.

Director Broom asked if RTD’s risk management contacted the individuals that were
injured on the train. He further inquired about the damage to the train and asked if
it was significant.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said that the individuals would be contacted
through RTD’s insurance representative.

Director Deadwyler asked how staff was sure that this was an intentional act and
that the vehicle did not stall on the tracks.
General Manager Genova remarked that the way the vehicle was moving in the
video was very unusual. He noted that the approach to the crossing was strange,
and it moved slowly a few times before crossing the tracks.
Rolf Asphaug reminded the Board that the final determination would be made by
the law enforcement authority and coroner. He said that RTD does not need to
make any type of statement otherwise until the final report was released.
General Manager Genova noted that the three different camera angle recordings
would not be released until the investigation was completed.
Scott Reed added that in every interview RTD has done today, staff has used the
precursor of “According to Aurora Police”. He noted that staff has not said
anything that was stated as “According to RTD”.
Director Menten asked if there are cameras at every crossing.
General Manager Genova indicated that there are not any cameras at grade
crossings where there are no gates, which includes most of downtown Denver. He
stated that RTD has learned that video is incredibly valuable and there are four
crossings on the R Line that do not currently have cameras. He said staff is
examining the costs of getting cameras at those locations installed.

February Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Hoy opened the meeting by sharing his condolences on the passing of
Director Walker’s mother.
Chair Hoy reviewed the draft Board Meeting agenda for February 28, 2017, and
noted the length of service of the retirees. Barbara McManus said two retirees had
confirmed they would attend.
Director Francone commented that the C-470 Corridor Coalition cited in the Board
Meeting agenda has changed to a quarterly meeting schedule. She said the work of
the committee is largely complete, since the design work and fundraising efforts
have been completed and construction is underway.
Barbara McManus stated that she receives and reviews copies of the C-470
Corridor Coalition agendas and that she would reach out to the appropriate
Directors if RTD involvement were required.

Director Menten mentioned her involvement with the Jefferson County
Transportation Action and Advisory Group (JEFFTAAG). She said that one out of
every three meetings was canceled and, for many other meetings, her attendance
was not worthwhile.
Chair Hoy said that all of the Directors have both committee assignments and
personal commitments and responsibilities. He said he saw no issue with Directors
not attending meetings of outside organizations if doing so would be a waste of
resources.
Director Menten mentioned the local government meetings held at RTD and noted
that the meetings are attended by planners and other local government employees.
She asked whether elected officials are invited to those meetings.
Chair Hoy said the local government meetings are mostly for municipal staff
updates and outreach.
General Manager Genova said that Chair Hoy’s description is an accurate
representation and that he would provide the meeting invite list to Director Menten.
Chair Hoy said that elected officials are invited but those officials usually send their
staff. He said he received invites from city managers to certain events but
questioned whether some of those invitations should be extended to RTD staff
instead.
Director Francone asked why the General Manager’s Oversight and Performance
Management Committee (GMO Committee) was listed two places in the draft
agenda.
Barbara McManus said that committee reports, including the reports of the GMO
Committee, are located in one place on the agenda and the minutes are approved at
a separate juncture.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy said the Board would handle the C-470 Corridor Coalition in the same
way it treats the Northwest Parkway Public Highway Authority Board. He said that
Barbara McManus would alert the affected Directors if a given agenda warrants
their attention. He said that, despite his involvement with Adams County Economic
Development (ACED), he does not regularly attend meetings, since the
organization’s own transportation committee has little to do with RTD business.

6.E

Director Francone mentioned the GMO Committee would not convene again until
April or May.
Barbara McManus said the said General Manager’s strategic update takes place in
April, which then triggers the GMO Committee to reconvene.

Chair Hoy, speaking about the unanimous consent items on the agenda, said he
was surprised to see the lease termination at Fiddler’s Green on the agenda
because he thought the lease had been terminated years earlier.
General Manager Genova said that the current lease termination should go through
in this instance, as opposed to previous attempts at terminating the lease, because
RTD has been given written guarantees.
Director Francone asked whether the lease would still be in place if it is not
terminated.
General Manager Genova said that the lease would remain but noted the Fiddler’s
Green Business Improvement District is motivated to get out of the lease.
Director Francone asked whether RTD is satisfied with the amount of the lease
termination payment and whether the proceeds would go in the base account.
GM Genova said that the amount was reasonable and that the money would go into
the base.
Chair Hoy discussed the recommended action item concerning paver maintenance
on the 16th Street Mall and asked who had voted no in committee.
Director Menten said she voted no and may have been the only one.
General Manager Genova confirmed that the vote was 11 in favor and 1 opposed.
Director Menten said she would not approve the expenditure of additional funds for
the repair of the existing granite.

Director Deadwyler said that the General Manager’s strategic goals come out of the
March retreat, which Barbara McManus confirmed.

6.E

Chair Hoy said RTD is obliged to maintain the pavers because to do otherwise could
cause damage to the RTD shuttles. He said that the problems with the pavers may
be resolved soon.
General Manager Genova said the discussion would be a long process.
Director Francone made the motion to approve
moving the February 28, 2017 Board agenda to
the full Board.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Vote on Motion:

The motion passed with 4 in favor (Hoy,
Francone, Deadwyler, Menten) and 0 opposed.
Director Walker was not present on the phone
for the vote.

III.

Other Matters
Director Francone asked about the status of the Mobility Choice Blueprint Study.
Chair Hoy said the Mobility Choice agenda item is off the table for discussion and
that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG) would continue with or without RTD’s
involvement. He said Mobility Choice would likely be presented to the Board in the
future but said that the date has not been set.
Director Deadwyler said that Roger Sherman from CRL Associates stated a Mobility
Choice recommendation would be presented to the Board in the near future.
Director Francone asked for RTD staff’s opinion on Mobility Choice.
General Manager Genova said he felt that RTD’s participation in the study would be
a good thing. He said that, following the Board meeting at which the
recommendation was voted down, the Mobility Choice Board stated their desire for
RTD to be a part of the study, specifically because they saw the value in RTD’s
participation and its credibility in informing the process. He said the Mobility Choice
Board said they would work to change certain elements of the agreement and bring
it back before the RTD Board. He said that the Mobility Choice Board’s revised
proposal would lower the amount required for the study from $500,000 to

Motion:

6.E

General Manager Genova said he that sits as RTD’s member on the Mobility Choice
Board. He stated that Bill Van Meter would be a good choice for the oversight
committee. He said that the private sector is represented on the Mobility Choice
Board and that private sector funding could increase as more private entities
became more involved in the process. He said private sector contributions would go
toward both administrative costs and salaries of administrative staff.
Chair Hoy clarified that any monies contributed by government agencies could only
go toward the study rather than to salaries and that any other dollars spent would
come out of private coffers.
Director Francone said that her continuing objection was that she felt as though the
RTD Board had been left out of the process. She said that, because of the
possibility of a ballot initiative arising out of the process, she wanted RTD to be a
part of that conversation. She said she was hesitant to go forward without more
transparency and Board involvement.
Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Francone and said she recalled that CDOT
also disapproved of the study at the time the RTD Board voted down the Mobility
Choice recommendation.
General Manager Genova said that CDOT was on board with the study and was the
first public agency to agree to fund the study. He said that DRCOG discussed the
proposal with its own board and that they were a provisional yes vote as long as
CDOT and RTD agreed to participate.
Director Deadwyler said that at one time CDOT wanted to be part of a ballot
initiative in which RTD’s share of additional revenues would have been minimal.
She asked whether the result of the Mobility Choice study would result in a ballot
initiative with the same small share for RTD.
General Manager Genova said that any talk of a ballot initiative would be premature
and that any prior discussion of ballot initiatives took place before the bipartisan
conversation about transit funding took place in the legislature this session. He said

Packet Pg. 52

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

$400,000, revise the makeup of the Mobility Choice Board, and restructure the
oversight over the process. He stated the committee charged with oversight over
the process would consist of one representative each from Mobility Choice,
DRCOG, CDOT, and RTD and that this group would guide the day-to-day work of
the study and the scope of work that would go into a request for proposals (RFP).

6.E

that both the Metro Mayors Caucus and MPACT64 have issued statements that lay
out the parameters under which they would support a ballot initiative.

General Manager Genova said that the majority of any funds allocated from a ballot
initiative would go toward CDOT. He said that the Metro Mayors Caucus would not
support any initiative if the money going to local jurisdictions drops below a certain
amount. He said that people may not support an initiative in which large sums of
money go to RTD because RTD already reaps the revenues generated by the 1%
sales and use tax. He said that Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs has been
having discussions to see which aspects of a ballot initiative people could support.
He reiterated that any discussion of a ballot initiative coming out of the Mobility
Choice study is premature and that such a ballot initiative should not be considered
a foregone conclusion of the study.
Director Francone said that any additional transportation funding would go toward
roads and bridges rather than public transportation. She said that the legislature
may pass transportation legislation but RTD would not receive any more funding
than it does currently.
Director Menten said DRCOG already does a transit study, though they were not
willing to share the results with her upon her request. She questioned why DRCOG
would want to keep that information out of the public eye.
Chair Hoy said that the results of the Mobility Choice study would not belong to
DRCOG and that the oversight committee would make sure the information is
published.
Director Deadwyler offered strong support for supplying free ride coupons for the
Juneteenth and Curtis Park community events. She said that the Curtis Park event
had been shut down by Denver Police Department Chief White and that, following a
change of heart by Mayor Hancock, the event was reopened. She said that she
wanted RTD to participate in the event to make a strong push for the recruitment
of operators. She said that RTD had previously supplied one of the organizers of the
two events with 200 free ride coupons and had raffled off gift bags containing an
additional 180 coupons. She said that she does not want to discontinue providing
tickets because the publicity is good for RTD and that these events are a way to
keep the public involved.

Packet Pg. 53

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler said that the last time a ballot initiative was discussed the
proponents wanted to use the majority of the money to fix roads and bridges.

6.E

Chair Hoy noted that Director Deadwyler was seeking 380 tickets at a time when
each Director only receives 180 per year.

Director Deadwyler said she would hate to take away something RTD had been
doing for some time.
Chair Hoy said he empathized with Director Deadwyler’s concerns but did not think
her request fell within the existing policy. He said that others would ask for
exemptions as well.
Director Deadwyler said that handing out free ride coupons individually does not
always work but said that the Curtis Park and Juneteenth events are different.
Chair Hoy asked why a single event organizer had been given 200 tickets.
Director Deadwyler said the woman had been an RTD partner for years and that she
gave tickets to students, the elderly, and visitors to her community farm.
Director Menten voiced her support for the policy of giving only 180 coupons to
each Director.
Chair Hoy noted that the free ride coupons were reduced or eliminated agency
wide.
Director Francone asked whether another item could be substituted for the free ride
coupons.
Chair Hoy said there is no process in place to cover Director Deadwyler’s coupon
request and stated that the 380 coupons she requested is more than any Director
would receive during the year. He also noted that Directors would be taxed on any
coupons purchased over the 180 coupon limit and said this was an IRS issue rather
than an RTD policy.
Director Deadwyler said she did not understand why the free ride coupons would
be taxed and asked whether RTD would send an IRS 1099 form at the end of the
year to individuals who received free coupons. She also said that recently she

Packet Pg. 54

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that Chair Hoy’s interpretation of the free ride
coupon policy was correct, though he said he wanted to re-read the policy. He said
that, in the past, RTD received requests for fundraising efforts and would donate
monthly passes.

6.E

Barbara McManus said that was not entirely correct. She explained that Customer
Care uses information supplied by riders to correct service issues. She encouraged
Directors to have affected riders call either Customer Care or the Board Office to
report service issues and said that Customer Care could supply free ride coupons as
nominal compensation. She apologized for the confusion and said that the tickets
issued to those constituents did not come out of her annual pool of 180 coupons
but rather from Customer Care’s coupon supply.
Chair Hoy noted that RTD employees who in years past were given hundreds of
coupons to compensate inconvenienced riders now follow the same protocol with
Customer Care.
Director Menten said she received a request for free ride coupons from Bicycle
Colorado and questioned whether other organizations had previously received
tickets from RTD through other mean.
Chair Hoy said the free ride coupon audit was one of the few audits in which a
significant problem was identified. He said the next audit would be cleaner because
records are now being kept on free ride coupon issuance and a system is now in
place.
Director Deadwyler said she agreed with the policy limiting Director coupons to 15
per month. She said when she was first elected she wanted to put a stop to the
free ride coupons because of the amount of lost revenue but changed her mind
when she saw how much her constituents appreciated the coupons. She said she
had not contemplated special events such as the two she supported when she
agreed to the 180-coupon limit.
Chair Hoy said he used to give coupons to certain groups in the past but has had to
tell them they will not receive them going forward.
Director Deadwyler asked whether Customer Care could decide whether to supply
the 380 coupons for the events she would be sponsoring.
Chair Hoy said that Customer Care supplies customer service only and the entire
RTD organization is out of the business of handing out free ride coupons. He said

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

attempted to secure free ride passes for some of her constituents impacted by an
RTD service issue and that those constituents had to provide their personal
information before receiving the tickets.

6.E

he was ambivalent over the new policy because coupons have promotional value.
He said it the policy came about because it was time to control the problem.

Barbara McManus said that, for the upcoming retreat, the color of the dots would
be different for Directors and staff.
Director Menten agreed that staff priorities should be indicated by dots of a
different color.
Director Deadwyler said that, during the round-robin exercise, the priorities seem to
have been already decided by staff and that Board suggestions are not thoroughly
considered.
General Manager Genova asked what would happen in the case where an item
received nine staff dots and one board dot or, conversely, where another item
received nine board dots and one staff dot. He asked how each of those scenarios
would be treated.
Chair Hoy said that he would like to see the Board and the staff work
collaboratively and said that using differently colored dots would not be a
collaborative approach. He said he felt that using dots of different colors would
make it harder to work as a team.
Director Deadwyler said that using differently colored dots would allow both the
Directors and staff to know what the other group thinks.
Director Francone said that seeing whether a large division existed between staffsupported and Board-supported recommendations would be helpful.
Director Deadwyler said that staff has the opportunity to jointly discuss priorities
prior to the retreat but the Board does not have that same opportunity.
Director Menten stated that the Board and staff dots should have an equal point
value.

Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone spoke about the upcoming strategic planning meeting. She said
she likes having staff participation in the event but stated that, during the goalsetting exercise, she cannot visually differentiate between Director priorities and
staff priorities, which are represented by dots. She said staff’s participation is
invaluable, but the Board sets policy.

6.E

Director Walker said that the Board gets to see staff priorities through the budget
process. He said he saw no issue with staff meeting beforehand without influence
of the Board, because the Board can always vote to change staff recommendations.
He said the Board sets agency policy and that staff tells the Board how they
propose to carry out that policy.

Director Francone questioned whether a Board policy influenced by staff input is
really a Board decision.
Chair Hoy said that staff is involved because they are experts in their field.
Director Francone said that she would leave the dot decision to the facilitator
because the running of the retreat is up to him.
Chair Hoy said he would speak to the facilitator to see if had used differently
colored dots before.
Director Walker said that the Board could not do its work without staff, because
each Director would have to learn state and federal regulations, architectural
requirements, etc. He said the Board requires the technical expertise of the staff in
the same way they rely on constituent input. He said the process must be
collaborative and that the Board and the staff should all be working together.
Director Menten spoke about the Citizens Advocacy Committee (CAC) and asked
what value they bring to the agency. She said she would be willing to do away
with the group if they did not make contributions.
Chair Hoy said that there are ongoing discussions about the worth of the CAC. He
said that RTD pays for consultants to facilitate the group and that the Board
recently voted to expand the scope of the group to include areas other than
FasTracks. He said there is a reason the CAC exists.
General Manager Genova said the FasTracks Act required RTD to have an advisory
committee and said he would check with General Counsel Rolf Asphaug to see
whether that requirement still applies.
Chair Hoy said that the CAC does not have much to report lately and that their
reporting schedule would soon be changed from a monthly to a quarterly basis.

Packet Pg. 57

Chair Hoy agreed with Director Walker and stated that he does not see the benefit
in using differently colored dots.

6.E

Director Menten said that town halls are part of RTD’s outreach efforts. She said
she was not sure how much money is spent on telephone town halls and would
rather go out in the community personally if the outreach budget would support
that.

General Manager Genova said that he would check with Scott Reed, Assistant
General Manager of Marketing and Communications.
Director Menten said that Larry Matthews from the Wheat Ridge City Council asked
to see a critical path schedule, which would be supplied by Denver Transit Partners
(DTP), for the opening of the G Line. She said that Wheat Ridge passed a tax issue
in the previous election to allow for development around Ward Station and that the
city council feels they have made a mistake with the voters due to the delay in the
opening of the G Line. She said that, in the RTD local government meeting at which
Larry Matthews asked for a set opening date, Director Francone had said the date
could not be disclosed.
General Manager Genova said there had been a misunderstanding in that
conversation. He said the question was not whether the date could be disclosed but
whether the date could be set with certainty.
Director Francone said that Larry Matthews is seeking an estimated start date.
General Manager Genova said that it is still unclear when RTD can resume testing
and that DTP has not supplied a viable schedule that would determine the opening
date. He said that RTD is required to supply the schedule to the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA) because of the full funding agreement.
Director Walker said CAC was intended as a citizen’s council and that the question
of what their role should be still exists.
General Manager Genova informed the committee that a memorial plaque would be
erected for former RTD General Manager Cal Marsella in Union Station.

Retiree Awards
Chair Hoy noted there were ten retirees this month with three in attendance.
General Manager Genova stated that the retirees covered several departments in RTD and
asked the various Assistant General Managers’ to come forward to present their retiree to
the Board.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, recognized Larry Perkins for his
39 years of service. He noted that Mr. Perkins started at the old Alameda Shop and held
a Master Mechanic title. He also mentioned that Mr. Perkins is well known for
representing RTD at the APTA Bus Rodeos. Bruce commented that Mr. Perkins is looking
forward to motorcycling, fishing, and traveling now that he is retired.
Bruce Abel also recognized Larry D. Vogt, Bus Operator Instructor, for his 24 years of
service. Bruce stated that Mr. Vogt served in many capacities including Bus Operator,
Revenue Instructor, Non-Revenue Instructor, Group 2 Division Supervisor, Group 2 Street
Supervisor, Group 2 Dispatcher, and most recently Bus Operator Instructor. Bruce stated
that Mr. Vogt is a man of many talents and a true renaissance man.
Mr. Vogt stated that RTD has treated him exceptionally well and thanked his wife for
sticking by his side through a demanding schedule. He also mentioned that he always refers
people to RTD for jobs because it is a great place to work.
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, introduced Greg Pennington,
General Superintendent, to assist in the recognition of John Shaver.
Mr. Pennington explained how Mr. Shaver’s journey with RTD began in 1984 when he
was working as a subcontractor. His company was hired to remove some windows out
the buses that received wheel chair lifts: the old GMC4800. He affirmed that Mr. Shaver
did such a good job that RTD hired him full time in the body shop at Platte and he worked

Frank Bruno, Boulder, introduced himself as the new CEO of Via Mobility
Services in Boulder. Mr. Bruno stated that he served on the Board for 7 years
prior to being named CEO. He thanked the RTD Board in advance for their
consideration of the Access-A-Ride and training project and commended them
for the tremendous amount of work they do as Board Members.



Yolanda Begay, Denver, stated that she has spoken to the Board in the past and
apologized for the way she behaved. Yolanda expressed her concerns with high
priced fares and over congested buses, specifically route 48, and how
gentrification is affecting Denver. Ms. Begay asked the Board to consider
having more busses in areas where the bus system is passengers only form of
transportation and having longer busses to accommodate the increasing number
of riders.

Director Francone said that she attended the Jefferson County Parkway Public Highway
Authority meeting on January 19th. The meeting discussed the completion of a
beltway/roadway around Jefferson County. She was pleased to report that the progress
report was good, and mentioned that the Authority is looking for an Executive Director to
assist in the completion of the beltway.
Director Francone also informed the Board that she met with Heidi Ganahl, Colorado
University (C.U.) Regent. She referred to General Manager Genova to inform him that Ms.
Ganahl would be interested in having someone from C.U. involved in the pass program
study and she had several people in mind for the task.
Director Francone stated that she received a call from a constituent where they confused
RTA with RTD. With the help of General Manager Genova, Sherry Ellebracht, and
Brandeberry-McKenna she was able to figure out the problem. However, through this
process it allowed her the unique opportunity to meet with Polly Lawrence, the current
chair on the House Transportation Committee. Director Francone believes this relationship
will allow her to continually educate our Legislators.
Director Solano informed the Board that he will be attending a Town Hall at Adams City
High School on Saturday, January 28th at 10:00 a.m. He stated General Manager Genova

Henry
Stopplecamp,
Assistant

GM

Date:

February 2, 2017

Subject:

Termination of Lease between the Fiddler’s
Business Improvement District and the
Regional Transportation District

General

Board Meeting Date: February 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to terminate the
Lease between the Fiddler’s Business Improvement District (FBID) and the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) for additional public parking spaces for RTD transit customers in the vicinity of the RTD
Arapahoe Light Rail Station on the west side of I-25. Proceeds of this transaction will total $1,100,000,
which will be deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system.
BACKGROUND
The Lease, dated October 10, 2002, recorded October 11, 2002 at Reception No. B2193529 of the real
property records of Arapahoe County provided an additional 1,000 parking spaces for use by RTD transit
customers to be available on or after September 1, 2006; RTD paid a total of $1,680,000 through
divided monthly installments beginning September 30, 2002 through August 30, 2006. The Lease term
was established for 75 years starting September 1, 2006 through September 1, 2081 and established
minimal parking fees for RTD transit customers.
A First Amendment to the Lease, dated February 22, 2007, reduced the number of parking spaces to be
available for use by RTD transit patrons and approved repayment of money by FBID to RTD for that
purpose. The number of parking spaces available for RTD patron use was reduced to 470 and the
reimbursement by FBID to RTD amounted to 1,888,484.94 (which included consideration for the 530
spaces released by the First Amendment plus 5% interest per annum, compounded annually from the
date of each RTD payment.)
In 2011 the FBID requested termination of the Lease. RTD and FBID negotiated and agreed to terminate
the Lease including releasing, waiving and relinquishing all rights, duties and obligations against any
actions, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses arising under the Lease. The termination agreement
provided for FBID to pay RTD $1,000,000.00 by December 31, 2013 or the date on which the City of
Greenwood Village, Colorado would issue a building permit for construction of any building on Lot 1,
Greenwood Plaza South Filing No. 12, County of Arapahoe, whichever occurred first. The RTD Board
approved this transaction at the December 2011 Board Meeting, however, the FBID was unable at the
time to finalize the negotiated termination.
DISCUSSION
RTD and FBID have negotiated and currently agree to terminate the Lease. The Lease Termination
Agreement will provide that as consideration for the early termination of the Lease and First
Amendment, FBID shall pay RTD $800,000 in good funds on or before July 31, 2017 at which time
RTD will release 340 of the 470 remaining parking spaces under the Lease. Finally, FBID shall pay RTD
$300,000 on or before July 31, 2018 at which time the Lease will terminate as to all of the parking

11.A

spaces including releasing, waiving and relinquishing all rights, duties and obligations against any
actions, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses arising under the Lease and the final 130 parking spaces
will be released.
A Personal Guaranty with John W. Madden, Jr., as Guarantor, will be executed providing that Guarantor
personally guarantees the payments which FBID is obligated to make.
Parking at the Arapahoe Village Center Station parking structure averages at approximately 42%; with
approximately 466 of the 1,115 spaces utilized. No RTD transit patron parking can be verified in the
structure operated by FBID.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $800,000 in 2017 and $300,000 in 2018, for a total of $1,100,000. These funds will
be deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system upon receipt. This is consistent with the
original Board approval of this transaction in December 2011.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to execute all documents necessary to terminate the Lease between the Fiddler’s Business
Improvement District (FBID) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) for additional public
parking spaces for RTD transit customers in the vicinity of the RTD Arapahoe Light Rail Station
on the west side of I-25. Proceeds of this transaction will total $1,100,000, which will be
deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This will have no physical impact on parking spaces
necessary for RTD transit customers and RTD will not receive consideration at this time.

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Directors Bob Broom, and reappointing Director
Judy Lubow and employees Luong (Lou) Ha and Sylvia Francis, to terms expiring 12/31/2018 as
trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan, with termination
dates to provide for staggered terms. The terms of former Director Tom Tobiassen, current Director Judy
Lubow, and the above employees have expired 12/31/16. Reappointment of the above existing trustees
and appointment of Director Bob Broom to replace Mr. Tobiassen for terms ending 12/31/18 is
recommended.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve Bob Broom, Judy Lubow, Luong (Lou) Ha and
Sylvia Francis to serve as trustees on the Plans in accordance with the attached resolution. This
is recommended because the vacant positions need to be filled. In accordance with prior Board
resolutions, the two employees were previously screened for the positions and have served
capably.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require a revised
recommendation. This is not recommended since the positions are currently vacant.

Approval of 2017 - 2019 Granite Paver
Maintenance Contract for 16th Street Mall
Transitway Lanes

General

Board Meeting Date: February 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the
three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $2,865,102.16. Funding for the first year of this action is
$915,680 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
The Free Mall Ride bus service connects Denver Union Station and Civic Center Plaza, and carries
approximately 40,000 passengers per day on 16th Street in Downtown Denver (“Mall”). A portion of
the Mall, from Civic Center Plaza to Market Street was built in 1982 with granite pavers as the surfacing
materials. The right-of-way is owned by the City and County of Denver, but RTD took on the
maintenance of the Transitway pavers in 1984.
For the past three years, RTD has been spending approximately $1.1 million a year, on average, on
repairing the Transitway pavers. In 2013, the City and County of Denver committed to participate in the
cost of granite paver maintenance and pay RTD 30% of the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an
annual maximum of $300,000, for a period of ten years.
Over the past 18 months, RTD staff led an environmental clearance effort to evaluate different paving
material alternatives for the Transitway. Recently, a broader vision for the Mall has come under
consideration. This includes evaluation of the Transitway surface materials, as well as the location and
width of the transit lanes within the Mall footprint. This approach will address not only the need to
implement more sustainable materials, but also the long-term livability factors and uses of the Mall.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. Colorado Custom Rock Corporation tendered the
lowest competitive bid. They have been deemed responsive and responsible. Historically, previous
contractors have utilized eight employees and material vendors that supported approximately 10 parttime jobs for each Work Order. As needed, granite pavers are purchased from a separate vendor (Cold
Spring Granite).
The lowest responsive and responsible bidder as shown on the list below is Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation for the three-year contract amount of $2,865,102.16.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2017 Adopted Budget includes $915,680 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the remaining two years of the contract was included in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan.
DBE / SBE GOAL
All work will be completed by a single contractor. There was no DBE / SBE Goal established for the
original contract.
ALTERNATIVES
Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance
with Colorado Custom Rock Corporation, in the dollar amount of $2,865,102.16. Funding for the first
year of this action is $915,680 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the Transitway pavers to fall into disrepair, which will
lead us to reroute or discontinue the Free Mall Ride bus service.
Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as historically we have only had a couple of firms bid on
this work.
