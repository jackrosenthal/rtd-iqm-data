#### 1. DBE Committee Name Change

It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that the Board of Directors change the name of the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) Committee to the Civil Rights Committee which is more inclusive and comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Solano asked if the name change will affect the committee’s role and how it can be more inclusive.  Staff stated that the Civil Rights Division addresses complaints from the customer as they deal with all aspects of Title VI.  Director Solano asked if there could be some language in the rules that include the public participation and allows public to speak and let the Board know how Civil Rights are affecting them.  General Manager (GM) Phil Washington stated that there are a number of public interfaces with the Civil Right division.  The FTA requires RTD to go out and have public hearings when there are fare or inner service changes.  He also stated that the committee meets bi-monthly and representatives from disadvantaged businesses attend those meetings; there is also public participation at the Board meetings.

Director Lasater stated that DBE is very obvious to the business community and asked if the name change would mask the purpose, especially for new comers to the area that want to find out how to interact with RTD and Civil Right might be interpreted to do with anything but businesses.  Staff stated that all the SBO/DBE programs are housed under the Civil Right Division because they look at the entire scope of Title VI.  GM Phil Washington stated that the elements of Civil Rights are prominently posted on the website and the public can see each of the programs under that Division; also, all publications that go out of the public show that the DBE falls under Civil Rights.  This is consistent with industry practices to name this particular office Civil Rights as oppose to DBE Office.

Director Hoy asked how this change will affect the way we deal with DBE businesses.  GM Phil Washington stated that it does not change anything that is being done.  They will continue the compliance piece and this just makes it more inclusive.  Director Hoy stated that he understood that we are putting more tasks under Civil Rights but we are not losing any of the programs.  GM Phil Washington reminded the Board that the Civil Rights Division was created over 3 years ago and they are not changing anything in the department.  This is the RTD Board changing the name of the Board’s Committee.  The Civil Rights department has been in place, and the name change has no impact on the department’s role and responsibilities.

Director Solano asked how the name change will affect the disadvantaged business committee.  Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she has been part of the committee in the past, and that there are other committees like the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) and all this does is change the name of the committee to align it with the RTD department.

Committee Co-Chair Rivera-Malpiede declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.
