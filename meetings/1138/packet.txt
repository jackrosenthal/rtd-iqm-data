Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk
Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items
to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station
(DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments,
improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle
project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and
preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion
of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd
Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low
interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of
the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability of funding from
previously-approved RAM items.

C. Recommended Actions

• Contract Award to HNTB Corporation for Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve
as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an
amount not to exceed $2,022,091. It is further recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the
Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff time
and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These funds will
be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of
the air rights at Civic Center Station.
Bill Van Meter and Chris Quinn, project manager of the study, stated that
RTD issued a RFP in December 2012 for a consultant to conduct the study,
which will evaluate the overall mobility options in the Northwest area. The
evaluation committee includes RTD staff and CDOT representatives. The
study will determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment
will be allocated to the corridor and determine what remaining BRT elements
are needed; evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with
constructing the Northwest Rail Line in segments; evaluate the possibility for
extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont; and conduct a high-level
feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 downtown
Express lanes. The final product will prioritize a list of improvements for the
Northwest area. For each item the consultant will develop base year capital

and operations and maintenance (O&M) cost estimates and conduct fatal
flaw analyses of technical financial and environmental issues related to the
improvement.
HNTB has committed to achieve the 22 DBE goal; they already have 19
DBEs in their staff. They conduct their own outreach.
Director Sisk made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at
the February 19th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the
motion.
Discussion:

Director Solano asked if there is representation from the North
area in the committee. Chris Quinn stated they had
representation from the different cities in that area. Director
Solano also asked what the feedback from Thornton and
Adams County was. Chris Quinn stated that they provided
their feedback directly to the committee.
Chair Anderson commented that she has worked with HNTB
and finds them a very professional organization. She supports
this selection.
Director Bagley stated that this is a very critical study in the
North metro area. He asked what staff members will be
monitoring the process and if there is opportunity for other
members of the Board to be involved. He also asked if
significant activities will be brought to the Board since there
needs to be more oversight. Bill Van Meter stated that the
staff includes Chris Quinn, Nadine Lee, Rick Clarke and himself
as well as Pauletta Tonilas from the PI team. They are putting
together both technical advisory and policy advisory
committees which will have active stakeholders and public
representation. They intend to brief the Board on an as
needed basis to keep them informed. They expect the
Directors from the area will be very engaged in the study.
Director Bagley asked how the Board members are going to be
involved. Bill Van Meter explained that those details will be
set as they move forward with the discussion with HNTB.
General Manager Phil Washington stated that he will also be
directly involved and will provide oversight of the whole
process. They will bring major decisions to the Board and

welcome Directors’ input all along the way. The makeup of
the technical and policy committee was agreed upon by the
stakeholders, but that does not preclude the Board from
providing input.

Director Lubow advised that she will be very involved as one
of the RTD directors from that area and would like to sit on
the different committees.
Director Hoy asked General Manager Washington to bring a
report of their quarterly outreach meeting for each of the areas
they visit.
Director Solano also asked to be part of the committees as the
input from the North area seems to be lacking.
Director Sisk also looks forward to participating in any way he
can. He thinks all members should be involved to ensure this
is a successful study.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked that they have somebody in
the committee that is transit dependent, because they provide
a different perspective.

Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the February 19th, 2013 Board
meeting.

Discussion:

Lisa Dorrance, project manager for Aconex stated that
Aconex contract was approved by the Board in April 2010 to
provide an online construction and document management
system for the FasTracks Program. Since the original
implementation in 2010, RTD has used the system in 20
projects for FasTracks and Capital Programs. They have over
3600 users in different projects and about 1.9 million
documents and 1.7 have been generated from outside entities.
Stakeholders have really embraced the system. The original
contract was for three years with four one year options. The
cost of exercising all four option years at once would be
$480,000 ($120,000 per year) saving RTD $120,000 since
exercising each individual options would cost $600,000. The
funding for this contract is included in the 2013 adopted
budget.

• Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to

following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the
financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of

the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72 nd
Avenue.



Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce
payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under
TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the
Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving
interest costs and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s
Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance
remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the
NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage
of the low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to
accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not
impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the February 19th,
2013 Board meeting.
Director Walker seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter and John Shonsey stated that in December
2012 the Board approved the first eight opportunities
identified as part of the RAM. On January 22, 2013, staff
presented three additional items for the Board’s information.
These include: 1) refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower
than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow,
and provide additional capacity under TABOR; 2) Issuing debt
to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest
rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and
preserving additional capacity under TABOR and 3) issuing
sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance
remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment. All
these actions will have to be presented separately to the
Board.

Packet Pg. 11

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:

6.A

Staff has assigned a risk level of “low” to these additional
RAM items because they allow RTD to take advantage of
historically low interest rates to build more of the FasTracks
program. It will also have a positive financial impact to the
FasTracks capital program by refinancing existing debt issues.

Director Deadwyler asked if with the refinancing we are
adding additional years or money. Terry Howerter, Chief
Financial Officer, stated that they are not extending the
repayment period or adding additional money to the bond
issues, the lower interest rate will reduce the payments over
time. Director Deadwyler asked which Bonds. Terry explained
that these will be the two sales tax bond issues that will be
brought next Tuesday night. Cop issue would be the third
document that would probably be presented in March.
Director Lasater thanked the staff for helping him understand
the cost per mile from DUS to 72nd and found that it is the 3rd
lowest. The highest is double the average which is $52.1.
This is a complex area, but not as expensive as he had
thought. The most expensive is the Southeast corridor
extension. He thinks this is a great timing to move on this and
get entire corridor done. General Manager Phil Washington
clarified that two weeks ago he was referring that this portion
is the most expensive of this same line, not that the line was
the most expensive.
Director Bagley asked for clarification on the number of votes
needed to pass the items in the agenda. Marla Lien explained
that at the Board meeting they need 10 votes for issues that
authorize the General Manager to initiate procurement for
construction. For the debt issues would only need 8. In the
committee meetings they need a majority of votes.

• Central Rail Extension Update
John Shonsey, Chief Engineering for RTD and Andy Mutz, project manager
stated that this is a FasTracks project that adds 0.8 miles of rail from 30th &
Downing to 38th & Blake. It adds two stations and connects downtown light
rail loop to the East Rail Line. It is a single light rail vehicle and is part of the
Environmental Evaluation (EE) adopted by the Board in 2010.
The challenges faced by the project include signal timing changes in
downtown loop. The trains cannot operate per EE and as planned in
downtown loop due to the signal timing changes.
Andy Mutz stated that the staff conducted some brief studies in 2012.
They talked to the community as to what they would like to see. The
feedback is that they want to see the street car facility for streetcar
maintenance. The business Community believes streetcar will stimulate
economic development on Welton Street; it will connect Welton Street with
double track streetcar. The study’s scope included hiring a consultant for
additional study. For this they have found $500,000 from $305 million
savings from Eagle. The study would focus on resolving the operation plan
issue; study 2-3 alternative alignments into downtown and begin concept
analysis in ridership, operations and capital costs. It will also look at
outreach and coordination with CCD and local stakeholders and public on
preferred alignment. Study will also include recommendations on
presentation to RTD Senior Leadership Team and RTD Board and public
presentation upon approval and develop next steps for implementation
including funding.
Director Folska asked if they had had an opportunity to see what they are
doing at Colfax and if they have consider that people with disabilities have
issues getting on and off the streetcars. She also asked what will happen to
the existing tracks. Staff stated that they are coordinating with the City of
Denver on their study of Colfax, but that study is not only looking at
streetcars. They will be looking at the technology to use to address the

issues of the people with disability. They are not proposing to take out the
existing track at this point. The RTD portion of this remains the same as far
as capital. Getting into seeing whose paying for changes is not something
that will be covered by this study.

Scott Reed, assistant general manager for communications and Pauletta
Tonilas provided an overview of the FasTracks Public Information Division
which is a combination of RTD staff and Virtegic Group public information
consultant working as an extension of RTD staff; they operate in a seamless
mode while having different levels of expertise. They work out of the
FasTracks’ office. The PI Division is part of the RTD Communications
Department.
They also provided contact information for the different members of the
team.
Functional areas of the PI Program include: media relations, public
involvement, public outreach, crisis communications, government and
internal relations.
This team manages internal and external communications, outreach and
media relations for FasTracks program and its projects; provides strategic
communications and outreach advice to Senior Leadership Team and
FasTracks Senior Management Team; provides PI liaisons for each FasTracks
project; develops strategies to address and resolve program and projectrelated issues; develops collateral and other informational materials; ensures
consistency in use of brand/identity and ensures consistent messaging –
“One Voice” approach.
Pauletta also provided the highlights for 2012 which included activities in
public involvement, government relations, internal and media relations. They
also managed the speakers’ bureau for FasTracks. The FasTracks
impacts/community touches for 2012 included 46.7 million potential
audience impression, 3.96 million impressions from “Railvolutionary” outdoor
ads among others. The FasTracks Strategic PI Plan and Approach was also
included in the Board packet and is based on the feedback the Board
provided in 2012, focusing on promoting progress, being proactive, building
trust, developing of relationships and focus in a regional cooperation.
The support they provide to the Board includes an annual key messages
manual that they provide to each member. They also provide fact-sheets
and informational materials and outreach activities with/for the Board
members.

• FasTracks PI Update

6.A

For 2013 they will continue to provide quarterly FasTracks progress Fact
sheets. I-225 groundbreaking is scheduled for March 1. They are waiting
direction from Board Chair on the Board/Staff Communications Charrettes.
The West Rail line will open on April 26. They will hold the Board
communications training in spring. Public opinion survey will be held in
May/June and telephone town halls in the fall of 2013.

Scott Reed also pointed out that looking at the amount of projects they are
responsible for, they have the single largest program and they do a large
amount of work and sometimes it is not really visible because they are
dealing with other entities; however the overall impact of the team is great.
Director Folska thanked them for the presentation and asked how much does
a town hall meeting cost. Pauletta Tonilas responded that based on the town
halls from last year each call is 8 cents per call and with 45,000 that
actually participates the cost is 82 cents. Director Folska asked how each
town hall is evaluated. Pauletta stated that the real value is when people
call in to ask questions to the Board members or people calling back in
response to voice mail left. They want to make sure this is a two way
communication. Director Folska stated that most of the communications
seems to be one way and asked what they are doing to engage the citizens
more. Pauletta stated that they have changed some things in the program
to do more in the community. Sherman will be a community strategic
advisor, focusing on the charrettes and identifying tools to outreach and
engage people with social media.
Director Tobiassen thanked the team for the great work. He particularly
wanted to mention Tina Jaquez as he has worked with her in several
activities. He also acknowledged Kevin Flynn for his work in Facebook. He
commented on the Fly Over Video and people always appreciate the content
and grasp their attention. At some point he would like to know how they
measure their impact through the social media. Pauletta Tonilas stated that
Kevin has been tracking Facebook and other entities are sharing RTDs posts
in their websites.
Director Solano asked if they have a line for the impaired at the telephone
town hall. Pauletta Tonilas stated that they do have a line for the impaired at
the phone town halls. Scott Reed also stated that at the actual town hall if
they receive a request they will make sure to have sign language available.
For different meetings they try to focus on the areas where they are going to
host the meeting.

Director Lubow thanked them for their presentation and suggested that for
2013 based on what is happening on the North, she would like to see a real
push letting the citizens in the North area know what is happening.
Director Walker asked how well attended have the media groups been.
Scott Reed stated that they have been very well attended and received great
feedback as how they like to get information from RTD and what they think
is important about FasTracks for their readers/listeners. Scott also stated
that at the last meeting they had all the TV stations’ traffic reporters who
are very interested on how FasTracks is moving. It was a very good
opportunity to give them information and getting feedback from them.
Director Walker asked if that provides an opportunity for us to use their
coverage. Scott stated that it does not. Director Walker stated that he
does not mind when the reports don’t look so good, because it means they
are working hard.
Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked the team; she thinks we have the best PI
in the country. She acknowledged Brenda Tierney for her amazing work
because she has provided excellent support for that area in presentations for
the community. Director Rivera-Malpiede also stated that she will be
working with different Council members on the Sheridan Station. They have
a resident that is over 90 years and is very excited to be part of the process.
She also acknowledged Daria Serna, Sherman Hamilton and other team
members.
Director Solano stated that the Hispanic community is large and wants to
know how they will reach to them. Pauletta Tonilas stated that it is part of
the focus outreach efforts and have done some Spanish translations of their
presentations and expect to continue more of that. They have several groups
they work with.
Director Hoy thanked them for the video presentation.

Director Daly stated that he is very excited about the opening of the West
Corridor. Pauletta Tonilas stated that the reception is going at be at the end
of the line at Jefferson County Government. The events on the 26th will be
very similar to what has been done for other line openings. They’ll have the
VIP train; there will be station parties sponsored by the individual
municipalities. They will have free rides on the West Line on Friday. On
Saturday the entire system will be free and on Sunday they will start the
regular service. Director Daly asked about the parking station. Scott Reed
stated that those are part of the West corridor. They will have a special ride
for the Board.

Director Folska thanked them for the video. She would like to see the
community members talking about what FasTracks means for them.
Pauletta stated that in the past they have used community members for the
videos, but they wanted to do something different this time.

B. Updates
Committee Chair James began by thanking staff for the Public Information video that was
presented in the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting. He asked staff to email a link to the
video to all Board members. Scott Reed stated that the PI Team would be sending the video link
to all of our stakeholders throughout the District and would also ensure each Board member
received it. Committee Chair James encouraged Board member to share the link with their family
and friends.

• Denver Union Station Wynkoop Plaza Update
Mike Turner introduced himself as the Manager of Planning and Coordination. He stated
that he was speaking to the Board on behalf of Bill Sirois who was unable to attend the
meeting. Mike reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that can be found in
the February 5, 2013 Planning and Development Agenda Packet.
Director Lubow asked if we knew the cost of the four management options considered
and asked if that factored into RTD’s recommendation. Mike Turner explained that the
proposals had to be fiscally sustainable. He stated that staff was looking to see what kind
of success each entity had in fundraising, what revenues have been generated in
programming other public spaces, etc.
Director Walker wondered how many people the public area of the plaza could hold.
Mike Turner stated that the capacity was as many people as would fit in 40,000 square
feet of space.
Director Daly asked if a committee was formed to handle the civic entertainment and
duties and a conflict arose, would the committee come back to the RTD Board for
resolution. Mike Turner said that it would be very important for any issues to come back
to the Board, especially if there was a proposal that conflicted with RTD’s goals. He
explained that the RFP was also structured to try to address that very thing: recognizing
the work RTD has done with the stakeholder process, managing anything that conflicts
with maintenance issues, not conflicting with transit patrons, etc.
Director Solano noted that under Management Option 4 it states that the existing
organization selected can be either profit or non-profit. He asked if there had been a cost

Director Bagley thanked staff for their presentation. He noted that the process for the
public comment and the outcome for the Station building was outstanding. He feels the
activities that occurred after the selection of the group to do the Station building were
phenomenal. He believes staff will do something as good as that on this project. He
stated that being the RTD Board member that is assigned to the DUSPA Board, he takes
great pleasure in realizing this project is in good hands because of our experience. Mike
Turner shared that we had a public meeting on December 12th, 2012 where about 50 or 60
people attended; this high attendance was because we had a good list of people we could
draw on from our past work. He believes we got a lot of good input as to how people
want to see the space used.
Director Folska asked if this was a privately owned public space. She also asked what
kinds of controls and regulations for mediating issues, problems and concerns were in
place. Mike Turner stated that the space is owned by RTD.
Director Folska stated that in looking at someone else managing the space she thought it
would be interesting to see how that would fit into the Risk Allocation Matrix for the
monetization of revenue streams.
Director Hoy wondered what community organizations we reached out to. Mike Turner
stated that we used Union Station Alliance’s mailing list, our mailing list from our past
work, it was posted on DUSPA and DUS’s websites, and we asked the Lower Downtown
Neighborhood Association to provide the information to their members. He explained
that it was more of a targeted effort around Denver Union Station.
Committee Chair James expressed that he believes the outreach efforts are going very
well and thanked staff for their work.

C. Other Matters
General Manager Washington shared with the Board that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General
Manager of Planning, has been selected to attend the ENOS Center for Transportation Leadership
Executive Leadership. Bill will attend this and represent RTD in April. General Manager
explained that those selected are really the pinnacle of transportation leadership. He believes this
is another great example of RTD being the farm team for the industry.
Director Solano requested that the Board begin each meeting by saying the Pledge of Allegiance.
Chair Anderson said that she would be happy to institute the Pledge of Allegiance at each
meeting.

B. Recommended Actions

• Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board
of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking
facilities by third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass
transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators
to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent. In
addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with
the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence
before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for
private operation under the amended legislation.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the February 19th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Daly asked the group to introduce themselves, Sherry
Ellebracht, RTD’s Government Relations Officer, Jenifer
Brandeberry, and Julie McKenna both contract lobbyists at the
State House; Roger Sherman from CRL Associates, local
government liaison and Mike Dino with Patton Boggs in
Federal Items.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Tom Tobiassen
Jeff Walker

Jenifer Brandeberry provided the background for the Senate
bill; they have been working with several partners. The
request came from the City of Aurora to allow some flexibility
for RTD to enter in to agreements with third party to enhance
parking facilities around the Metro area. They have also had
extensive meeting with the City of Boulder about working
together on this legislation and the City has asked for an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). There are stakeholders in
the Capitol that are interested in passing this legislation.
Senator Todd from Aurora and Representative Kevin Priola
from Adams County are carrying it at the legislature. There
are also several groups including business and environmental
groups from the area such as Colorado Municipal League and
Colorado County that are in support.
Director Sisk stated that this is very important for the City of
Boulder and needs to have attention in terms of RTD working
with the different cities. Boulder has acquired transportation
infrastructure and he would be very concerned if RTD parking
stations are sold without the city being involved as they have
committed a good amount of money in enhancements. Jenifer
stated that they have been in conversations with Boulder to
identify what RTD owns and what the City does. They all
have agreed that flexibility is important and that is why they
went down the IGA piece; other cities expressed interest on it,
but after learning more about it have decided not to pursue
that. They feel that this legislation is a permissive and allows
the cities who want to take advantage of it to use it, but they
are not required to do so. In order to give Boulder what they
have asked, they are in ongoing conversations about the IGA
and how it would work. Director Sisk asks the Board to deal
with this in a very careful manner and not be hastening as
these agreements take time.
Director James generally likes the idea because RTD is not in
the development business; RTD would like to be catalyst in
good transportation. He likes the idea of maximum flexibility.
He has noticed that with regard to parking, the ability for the
private sector has been limited by the regional and financial
constraints. He likes the idea of getting the private sector
involved.
Director Lasater asked if this is only in TOD stops and no other
Park-n-Ride areas. He would like to understand what the bill
entails. If this is for TOD, how will this affect our riders? (i.e.,
Packet Pg. 24

would they have to start paying in areas where they didn’t
before?) Staff stated that RTD has limitation in terms of what
it can do to charge for parking. The definition of RTD owned
parking facilities is very broad and even private developers
who want to build facilities adjacent to RTD park-n-ride cannot
do it if they enter in an agreement with RTD. This legislation
will allow that anybody who wants to build parking and want
RTD to agree to not build a competing parking or using their
parking, they would have to come to this Board to come to
terms to an appropriate fare structure. Anybody that gets
permission from local jurisdiction on land use can build and
charge for the parking. If they want to have a target market
for RTD that we will not build a free facility next door, they
would have to come and negotiate with RTD.
Chair Anderson asked for the feedback from the City of Aurora
representatives.
Roberto Vanegas from the City of Aurora stated that they
understand that mutual cooperation is important. When they
look at the parking necessities as they continue building
stations, they realize there is a shortage and with the reality of
the budget constraints they will need other tools to build the
parking stations. This bill will allow what they are looking for
which is financial mechanisms so they can build additional
parking.
John Fernandez, City of Aurora Planning, stated that in 2009
the City did a corridor wide parking study and they found that
they have a 100% deficit. This legislation is just one more
tool to help them with cash contributors as well as working
with developers to increase the supply and at the same time
protect land for development. For example in one station
there are 600 spaces allocated by FasTracks; however they
see a need for 1200 on opening day. They have discussed
this with their Council and they have accepted the notion of
free base parking. They see the need for revenue to make it
all work. Based on the draft IGA with RTD they have until the
end of the year to come up with the packet and they would
have to address management, operations and maintenance as
well as fee structures.
Director Anderson commented that she thinks this is a
permissive bill and communities don’t have to do it; but they
can do it, especially if they are concerned about parking and

Director Deadwyler stated she does not understand the bill.
She understands why the cities might want to build additional
parking but RTD would not see any money. Director
Deadwyler is concerned this would hurt RTD users. She
worries they would stop using our services because now they
have to pay for parking. She would like the opportunity to
fully understand this bill before she can support it.
Director James stated that he likes this idea because it would
allow the private sector and other cities to develop parking
structure alongside an RTD’s Park-n-Ride and releases the
limitations that currently exist on what they can charge per
parking. RTD is not in the development business, but would
rather like to be a catalyst for good transportation oriented
development and this would advance that, while allowing
maximum flexibility.
Director Anderson asked if RTD could have a part of the
parking structure that would be free. Marla Lien stated that it
is possible; it would have to be negotiated. Director Anderson
based on the information provided in the packet, she will
support the legislation because it is permissive and provides
another mechanism to build parking.
Director Deadwyler asked if RTD would have a say on how the
private parking rates structure is established. She stated that
we are trying to get cars out of the street, but she is afraid
that high parking rates could force RTD users to drive. Marla
Lien stated that at this point anybody can build and charge for
parking in areas where RTD does not provide parking. In the
future if a party wants to provide parking they would have to
come to the Board for approval; it would not happen
automatically. The bill directly addresses RTD and its stations.
General Manager Washington stated that in each case that the
situation occurs they would have to come back to the Board.

Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 5, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the financial capacity to build it. This will allow a third party
to come in and build parking and serve the RTD station and
other projects. Marla Lien clarified that the local jurisdiction
has the land use authority. RTD does not zone. If a
jurisdiction wants or don’t want a pay-for-parking facility as a
permitted use, it is up to the jurisdiction to control their
zoning.

6.C

Director Walker stated that this is market driven and the
stations that have the need could benefit from it. It could also
solve issues in high traffic areas like the Colorado station,
where drivers are parking in the neighborhoods. He will
support, because it is a good idea and market driven.

C. Updates

• Government Relations Updates (State, Local, Federal)
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates stated that they have been
participating on the ongoing discussions on transportation funding; they
attended various meetings with both government and private groups. They
have participated in meeting with various groups in the metro area. Metro
Mayor Conference, Metro Area County Commissioners, private sector
coalition called The Colorado Transportation Coalition, Impact 64 which
consist of the metro mayors caucus and other 57 counties and Action 22
among others. They are all talking about what can be done about
transportation funding and it has a transit component. This is the first time
that CDOT is talking about a statewide initiative that has a transit
component in it. There is a sub-committee in the metro area that includes
county commissioners and mayors that are discussing if there is sufficient
support in the metro area for a statewide sales tax that would have a split
for roads and transit. The Metro Mayors Caucus will meet tomorrow and
this is a major item in the agenda to see if there is enough support in the
Front Range to roll that out into discussion with the other counties. It is
early but very critical on options for funding for RTD. He will keep the Board
informed. They will also measure if there is enough support from the private
sector for the campaign to increase the sales tax.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked what would happen in 15
years if the developer decides to stop the service. Marla Lien
stated that RTD would go back to what is in place today and
RTD would have to decide if it wants to acquire property and
build the facility.

6.C

Another issue is the Northwest Area Mobility Study. The feedback from
both North and South areas is much more positive which is good as the
study is critical to see what the officials in that area are thinking and what
the potential outcome can be.
Director Deadwyler commented that she had the opportunity to sit down
with Roger and he helped her understand what the CRL role is.

Mike Dino stated that there are several dates coming up that are important.
March 1 is the potential for more spending cuts to go into place. At the end
of last year, Congress postponed sequestration for two months and that
goes into effect March 1. Today the President asked for another short term
situation to avoid major budget cuts and find some more revenue streams.
This affects the possibility of new starts funding for RTD, particularly on the
Eagle P3 corridor. On March 27, the current budget for fiscal year 2013
expires, and that also has ramification for funding for Eagle P3. Congress
does need to make a formal action to formally approve the rest of the 2013
budget or they could shut down. On April 15 both chambers, Senate and
House, need to approve fiscal year 14 budget resolutions. If they fail to do
it, they would forgo their salary as part of the debt ceiling agreement. Each
chamber can agree on its own budget resolution and still keep their salary.
On May 19, the extension of debt ceiling needs to be approved. This is a
big challenge as the Republicans feel they dealt with sequestration at the
end of the year and the Democrats are still looking for revenue increases.
The House is on schedule to be in session for only 10 days this month.
They will continue to watch the new start funding which right now is off
schedule. They are working with staff on new starts rules that FTA is
implementing. RTD staff is running those scenarios and if those rules do
affect future funding for RTD, they will look to Congress to see if they can
be amended. Secretary Ray LaHood of US DOT is leaving his position.
Potential candidates include LA Major Antonio Villaraigosa, former
Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell and the National Transportation Safety
Board Chairman Debbie Hersman and there might be others.
For the legislative meeting in Washington he stated that usually they have a
dinner on Monday night to prepare the Board members for their visits and
they try to split into teams for the congressional delegations visits as well as
visits with other pertinent officials such as FTA. They try to keep a
consistent message. They will be looking at new starts funding and
message related to Eagle P3 and future opportunities. They will provide an
update on FasTracks and the success story on West Corridor and progress in

other corridors. They will be asking for $160 million for Eagle P3 for fiscal
year 2014 and of course thank them for the funding received up to date.

Jennifer Brandeberry mentioned that General Manager Phil Washington,
Chair Anderson, Director Daly as well as RTD staff did a presentation to the
House and Senate Transportation Committees this week and it was very
well received. It is not by accident that several members from the north
corridor specifically asked to be in those committees. She thanked the new
Board members who have been meeting regularly with elected state officials
and the feedback they have received is very positive. They are excited
about the West Line and looking forward to what is happening in the North
area.

D. Other Matters

B. Recommended Actions

• DBE Committee Name Change
It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that
the Board of Directors change the name of the Disadvantage Business
Enterprise (DBE) Committee to the Civil Rights Committee which is more
inclusive and comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the
motion to move this item to the
full Board at the February 19th,
2013 Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Director Solano asked if the name change will affect the committee’s role
and how it can be more inclusive. Staff stated that the Civil Rights Division
addresses complaints from the customer as they deal with all aspects of
Title VI. Director Solano asked if there could be some language in the rules
that include the public participation and allows public to speak and let the
Board know how Civil Rights are affecting them. General Manager (GM) Phil
Washington stated that there are a number of public interfaces with the Civil
Right division. The FTA requires RTD to go out and have public hearings
when there are fare or inner service changes. He also stated that the
committee meets bi-monthly and representatives from disadvantaged

6.D

Director Lasater stated that DBE is very obvious to the business community
and asked if the name change would mask the purpose, especially for new
comers to the area that want to find out how to interact with RTD and Civil
Right might be interpreted to do with anything but businesses. Staff stated
that all the SBO/DBE programs are housed under the Civil Right Division
because they look at the entire scope of Title VI. GM Phil Washington
stated that the elements of Civil Rights are prominently posted on the
website and the public can see each of the programs under that Division;
also, all publications that go out of the public show that the DBE falls under
Civil Rights. This is consistent with industry practices to name this
particular office Civil Rights as oppose to DBE Office.
Director Hoy asked how this change will affect the way we deal with DBE
businesses. GM Phil Washington stated that it does not change anything
that is being done. They will continue the compliance piece and this just
makes it more inclusive. Director Hoy stated that he understood that we are
putting more tasks under Civil Rights but we are not losing any of the
programs. GM Phil Washington reminded the Board that the Civil Rights
Division was created over 3 years ago and they are not changing anything in
the department. This is the RTD Board changing the name of the Board’s
Committee. The Civil Rights department has been in place, and the name
change has no impact on the department’s role and responsibilities.
Director Solano asked how the name change will affect the disadvantaged
business committee. Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she has been part
of the committee in the past, and that there are other committees like the
Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) and all this does is change the name of the
committee to align it with the RTD department.

B. Recommended Actions

• Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal
Policy Statement as well as accept these modifications for 2014.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the February 19th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Solano seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter explained that the proposed modifications to
the fiscal policy are brought to the Board throughout the year.
In addition each year staff presents the proposed policy
statement for review by the Board. Terry also explained that
staff uses this as the first step in developing our Strategic
Budget Plan. He said at this point staff has brought forward
minor modifications that are highlighted in red on the
document that was provided to the Board.
Director Sisk asked for an explanation as to the basis for
reducing the fund balance from 3 months to 2 months on the
fund balance policies. Terry Howerter stated that this will be

Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 12, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.E

for the FasTracks fund balance only. He explained that we
wanted to take the additional month and move those funds
into our savings account for future projects on the FasTracks
side.

General Manager Washington stated that this item was part of
a larger item, the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA). The FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) was brought to the Board in
December of 2012 and the Board approved the action.

• Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the issuance of RTD Taxable
Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District
Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.
Motion:

Director James made the motion
to move this item to the full Board
at the February 19th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter said that as the Board may recall, staff
presented refinancing of three RTD debt issues in order to
lower interest rates and reduce payments to provide additional

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 12, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley added that the reason it was changed from 3
months to 2 is that staff and the Board felt there was
adequate fund balance for 2 months due to our progress on
the Eagle P3 project and the I-225 line. Terry Howerter said
that was correct. He also said that the new services and
infrastructure we have in place further supports the reduction.

6.E

Brenden Morgan stated that this is the first of three
refinancing opportunities that will be presented to the Board.
These refinancing opportunities include Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds, Series 2004A and 2005A. The Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds from 2004 have $5.750 million outstanding and 2005
have $98.865 outstanding. Brenden explained that the
refinancing would result in a savings of approximately $24.2
million or 3.06% of the principal of refunded bonds. He
explained that the Bond Resolution requires a minimum
savings of 2% which allows some flexibility in regards to
changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds
are sold.
Brenden highlighted three key items that were important to
note: (1) this transaction will reduce interest expense to RTD
over the life of these Bonds; (2) this transaction will not
extend the maturity of these bonds; (3) this transaction will
reduce the outstanding debt.
Brenden Morgan explained that the debt will be reduced by a
function of a common debt service reserve that the 2004 and
2005 Bonds share. This reserve is approximately $17 million.
He stated that when we issued Bonds in 2012 we did so
successfully and proved that we no longer need a debt service
reserve for these Revenue Bonds. The $17 million will be
used to pay down the current outstanding debt.
Brenden Morgan stated that Terry Howerter has taken the
preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding bonds by preparing documents that are available for
review in the Board Office in substantially final form.
Brenden shared that RTD has been receiving the advice of First
Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, and
Sherman & Howard L.L.C., as Bond Council. The Bonds will
be underwritten by a team including Goldman Sachs, Loop
Capital, Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo.
Director Lubow noted that one of the underwriters was
Goldman Sachs and she knows that they were under Federal

team from First Southwest Company, our independent
financial advisors, are present to answer any questions.

investigation. She asked what due diligence is completed
when we are dealing with investment companies. Marla Lien
stated that in terms of financial due diligence a company being
under investigation would not necessarily effect the due
diligence. She explained that in terms of legal due diligence,
on any federal project we have to look to see if someone is
debarred or suspended and Goldman Sachs is not. Marla Lien
explained that the Board has never adopted any policy that
says an accused company not found guilty should be
precluded from doing business with RTD. An entity as large
and diverse as Goldman Sachs the Board certainly never said
that allegations made against one arm of the company would
preclude us from doing business with another. She said that
the Board would need to approve a policy not required by
state or federal law stating that if charges are brought against
an entity that would prevent them from doing business with
RTD.
Terry Howerter stated that Goldman Sachs is part of the
underwriting pool. He said that they have been involved with
several of our deals in the past and are a great asset when it
comes to working through our Preliminary Official Statement
(POS) and our offering documents. He believes that Goldman
Sachs is very knowledgeable of RTD as well as bringing
together this kind of an underwriting deal.
Director Lubow stated that she understands Goldman Sachs
was accused and not convicted but she believes it is important
to keep this in mind maybe not in an official capacity but in
our common sense due diligence.
Director Sisk expressed that initially he would say he totally
supports this action but he wanted Dee Wisor from Sherman &
Howard L.L.C. to explain the Negative Arbitrage and how it is
calculated. He also asked for the amount of the Negative
Arbitrage. Dee Wisor explained that the Negative Arbitrage is
really the fact that this is an advance refunding; that means
that we will be issuing these refunding bonds before the
redemption date of the refunded bonds. The refunding bond
proceeds will be invested in an escrow account of federal
securities until the redemption date. The investment rates
today are lower than the bond rates so there is a negative
spread until the redemption date. Brenden Morgan said the
amount will be approximately $3.6 million. He stated that the
savings outlined in the Board Report is the net amount.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter explained that this is another RTD debt issue
to be refinanced. This item was presented to the Board on
January 22, 2013. He stated that this refinancing is going to
be very beneficial in reducing the interest rates and that will
free up TABOR capacity.
Brenden Morgan stated that this is a very similar transaction to
the previous Recommended Action. He explained that Terry
Howerter has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the
issuance and sale of the bonds. Drafts of documents
referenced in the Bond Resolution are available for review in

Brenden Morgan shared that RTD has been receiving the

C. Updates

• General Manager Contract Review Summary
Terry Howerter informed the Board that this is the third and final review of
the contract that was put in place for the years 2010, 2011 and 2011. He
introduced Cheryl Wallace and Kathy Maher from RubinBrown. RubinBrown
was hired to conduct an Independent Accountant’s Report on the Cost of
the General Manager’s Contract that was reviewed with the Board. They
passed out a report on this review.
Director Menten requested that in the future all reports and information be
provided to the Board prior to the meeting. Terry Howerter explained that it
has always been the practice to have the documents presented at the
meeting and delivered by the auditors when they presented their report. He
stated that staff could have them included in the Board packet as long as
staff had audit sign off, etc.
Director Solano concurred with Director Menten that it would be helpful to
have this information in advance. He asked how the General Manager’s
contract compares to other General Managers in major metropolitan areas.
Director Solano requested copies of any analysis that was done to arrive at
the contract figures. Terry Howerter explained that we have attempted to
do those comparisons in the past but it is difficult to do due to size of the
organizations and other responsibilities.
Director Bagley thanked RubinBrown for their audit. He believes it
demonstrates what the Board thought the maximum amounts to be paid
were. It was determined by the Board and through negotiations and
discussions with the General Manager that the 5% salary increases were not
going to be made; that is why there is a significant difference in the
maximum versus paid compensation.

Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 12, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Director Bagley explained that in late 2009 into 2010 there was a significant
benchmarking analysis completed by the Board office with the assistance of
the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) figures throughout
the nation. He stated that we looked at approximately 25 to 30 different
agencies and we tried to calculate what would be the most appropriate
benchmarking agencies; there were 6 to 8 that we utilized to benchmark
against. Director Bagley said that based on the work we did our
compensation figures were mid-range. Director Bagley also pointed out that
RTD is very different from the other agencies we compared to because of
the significant capital programs we are undergoing. He believes that in
moving forward the salaries for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are relatively similar
to the past years.
Director Malpiede thanked Director Bagley for the overview. She expressed
that she was happy Director Solano would be part of the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee. She stated that the
Committee will be discussing the process in the upcoming meetings.

• Bus, Ticket Vending Machine, and Other 2013 Financing Update - No
Backup
Terry Howerter explained that staff just wanted to prepare the Board for
what to expect for the current year plans.
Brenden Morgan stated that this evening the Board was presented with two
of the three Bond Refunding opportunities that were discussed in the Risk
Allocation Matrix item presented on January 22, 2013. He said that over
the next 6-9 months, staff intends to make proposals for the following
financing transactions which are anticipated in the Strategic Budget Plan:
In March the Board will be presented with the third Bond Refunding
opportunity, 2005A FasTracks COP refunding which will result in a savings
of approximately $5.2 million. Staff will also bring forward a
recommendation on Bus and Ticket Vending Machine financing using
possibly Certificates of Participation or a Capital Lease.
In Quarter 3 staff will present a short term bridge financing in anticipation of
federal funds for approximately $280 million.
In the 4th Quarter provided that interest rates remain stable staff will bring
forward new FasTracks revenue bonds for the North Metro Rail Line of
approximately $100 million.
Terry Howerter added that all of these items are included in our financial
plans for the FasTracks and Base systems. The bus refinancing was

Director Sisk asked for further information on the Ticket Vending Machines
(TVMs). Terry Howerter stated that the TVMs are being replaced on the
Southwest corridor. He explained that the TVMs on this corridor have far
exceeded their useful life; these machines do not process debit or credit
cards, have old software, and are not networked into our system. Terry
Howerter said on the Southeast line the machines will be upgraded to allow
payment with a debit or credit card. This is timed to come into service
when RTD activates the West Line so that all of our TVMs are compliant and
have the same look and feel for our customers.

• Fourth Quarter 2012 Investment Report
Terry Howerter stated that staff would take questions. He said there is not
much to add as this is a pretty standard report.
There were no questions on this item.

• Fourth Quarter 2012 Internal Audit Report
Bill Holmes, Manager of Internal Audit, thanked the Board for allowing him
to answer any questions they might have.
Director Lubow noted that the problems experienced in Boulder with the
new Smart Card launch were not addressed in the audit. She asked if the
audit looked at those issues. Kevin Parker explained that the audit is a
multi-phased audit. The audit looks at the design requirements, the
software development, and the actual installation of the Smart Card system.
Kevin Parker said that Bruce Abel could provide further information about the
issues Director Lubow was referencing in Boulder.
General Manager Washington said that the Operations and Customer Service
Committee would discuss some of the challenges that we experienced with
the Smart Card roll-out. He said the scope of the audit did not include the
operational issues that will be covered by the operations staff.
Director Lasater noted that some of the exceptions still open date back quite
a while. He asked why these exceptions were still open. Bill Holmes
explained that most of these exceptions are primarily related to our new R12
Oracle system update. These exceptions will be resolved when the system

Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 12, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

discussed at the last FA&A meeting. He explained that we have an aging
bus fleet; based on the guidance for replacement of the fleet we will be
looking at replacement of 40 vehicles, articulated busses, MCI Open Road
Coaches and our Mall shuttles. He stated that these vehicles have reached
the end of their useful life based on FTA guidelines and our policies.

6.E

Director Hoy asked if we audit Capital Equipment that may have been retired
but not sold and still has a value. Bill Holmes said that a Field Asset Audit
was conducted in 2010 or 2011. At that time they evaluated our Capital
Equipment and our procedures for handling that equipment. He said this is
part of what the Internal Audit department does on a periodic basis but not
every year.
Director Menten noted that under the Employee Expenses Audit there was a
recommendation to close a problem area. She asked what the
recommendation was. Bill Holmes stated that the recommendation dealt
with the expense policy of RTD. He explained that during their review they
noticed an instance of an expense being incurred when several staff
members were present. This expense was not paid by the most senior staff
member, which is typically a standard practice. Our policy did not address
this so it was updated.
Director Menten asked what compensation 360 Media receives for being the
middle man with regards to our corporate passes. Kevin Parker said that he
did not have that information immediately available but staff could get it
from the signed contract. He explained that this relationship helps us reduce
the staffing the RTD needs.

• December 2012 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod reviewed the report that was included in the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet for February 12, 2013.
Director Lasater noted that he finds it odd that we are 131% upside down in
advertising revenue. He believes that December is traditionally a high
advertising month. Director Lasater also asked for the overall net result of
the contract. Doug MacLeod explained that we renegotiated our advertising
contract at the end of 2012 because the Light Rail advertising activity was
not as significant as the original contract called for. Scott Reed explained
that RTD did not lose money on the contract. The advertising contract did
bring in several million dollars of revenue. He said that he did not know the
exact number but could get that for the Board. Scott Reed stated that the
amount of display time was diluted due to the number of Light Rail vehicles

comes up this month. He stated that he and Kevin Parker would follow-up
to make sure the issues have been addressed; if not they will conduct
another audit. Scott Reed said that it is also important to look at what is
past due. It is possible to have exceptions that are still open but are on
schedule. There is really only an issue if something is listed as past due. Bill
Holmes shared that the Internal Audit department works very closely with
management on their resolutions to any items.

Director Solano noted that there is baseline budgeting and zero based
budgeting that can lead to significantly different budgets. He asked if we
had looked into zero based budgeting to see if there was a benefit. Jannette
Scarpino stated that currently RTD budgets on an incremental basis. She
said that RTD has used zero based budgeting in the past when the agency
was smaller and less complex. Jannette Scarpino explained that the
downside with zero based budgeting is that it is very time intensive; it
consumes a great deal of resources which the agency does not have.
Jannette Scarpino said that if she was to improve our budgeting
methodology she would move to more of a priority based budgeting. She
said that she would be able to discuss further our budgeting and other
budgeting methodologies offline.
Director Sisk asked if the Sales and Use Tax figures are subject to an audit
by the State of RTD. Doug MacLeod explained that on a regular basis the
Department of Revenue has an audit function. He stated that from our
perspective as the customer our auditors test on a receipts basis but we do
not get very much information from the Department of Revenue. He said
that is one of the initiatives that staff is working on.
Director Sisk noted that if the Department of Revenue numbers are incorrect
we are basing our assumptions on figures that may be erroneous. He said
that from personal experience in Boulder, they did find the Department of
Revenue numbers to be askew so he believes there needs to be a checks
and balances process in place. General Manager Washington stated that
staff fully agrees, which is why they included the reconciliation item in the
Risk Allocation Matrix. He said initially staff thought it would take some
legislative action to get this reconciliation but it now appears that it will not
be necessary. This is something that staff is actively working on with the
Department of Revenue.

B. Recommended Actions

• April 2013 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the April 2013 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost
increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for
private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Daly made the motion to
move this to the full Board at the
February 19, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that the April 2013 Service Changes were
included in the Board Packet along with a refresher of the
West Corridor Service Plan adopted by the Board on October
23, 2012. He also mentioned that several Directors have had
a one-on-one meeting with the staff to review the changes.
Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
stated that based on the limited nature of the proposed
changes, they did not have public hearings; however, they did
open this item for public comments. There are only two
substantial changes. Staff continues to do analysis and listen

6.F

Director Menten asked about the closing of the 29th and
Welton station. Jessie Carter stated that staff proposed an
evaluation period to determine if this closing would improve
the situation created when City of Denver changed the traffic
light timing. The light rail could end up dwelling at Park
Avenue for up to 7-8 minutes. Closing that station reduces
the amount of time the vehicles are on the single track
section. Bruce stated that the change was implemented in
January, and it seems to have been beneficial as feedback has
been positive. Jesse also commented that many of the
complaints are from people parking in the garage across from
the station, which is not a park-n-ride; it was provided for the
businesses in that area. Bruce stated that they intend to
extend the observation period to see if the outcome continues
to be beneficial. So far the closure seems to be working as
delays in the light rail have been reduced.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Amendment to MV Public Transportation ADA Contract ADA 17-DH-007 for
award of the Belmar, Green Mountain and Golden Call-n-Rides.
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute a contract amendment with MV Public Transportation for the
provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride
contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public
Transportation ADA contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9)
month period from April 2013 through December 2013. The cost for the
Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-nRide will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed
$234,214. The total not to exceed amount will be $710,806. These

to customers about what they would like to see changed.
Based on customer feedback there are several changes staff
would like to incorporate in the proposal. These include Route
45 in the Green Valley Ranch area; Route 72X out West;
Route 89 serving Stapleton; and Route 133. These changes
are slight and do not impact the cost.

6.F

amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated as “pass through”
expenses.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the
motion to move this to the full
Board at the February 19, 2013
Board meeting.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that when RTD went out to procure
paratransit services for ADA contracts, they added the option
for Call-n-Ride services. RTD was trying to generate
economies of scale from having the provider of paratransit
services also provide services for the Call-n-Ride if they were
in similar service areas. With the opening of the West
Corridor, staff is requesting to add three Call-n-Rides to the
contract of MV Public Transportation at the previously
negotiated rate.
Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, stated that they
are recommending this addition for MV Transit because it is a
very experienced transportation provider that currently
provides ADA services and 11 Call-n-Rides for RTD.
Director Lubow stated that MV Transit seems to be very
experienced and have provided a good service. She asked if
there is a process to determine if there might be other
providers that could be as good as MV at a lesser price. Bruce
Abel stated that when they sent out the initial RFP, it included
the option for Call-n-Ride. At that time, they did the price
comparison and selected from among the various proposals.
Additionally, when Call-n-Rides do not fall within an
appropriate geographic scope, they have gone out to shop for
Call-n-Ride providers. It was determined that when RTD
generates economies of scale, the cost will be lower when
going with the existing contractors because they have the
infrastructure, facilities and management team in place.

C. Updates
Bruce Abel stated that the first phase of the Smart Cards went live on
January 1st. This stage included several components: on the hardware side
it required installing the on-bus validators and light rail validators; IT
infrastructure including servers and garage equipment to allow buses to
communicate to the back-office; and issuance of card for the Business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass programs. Stage two,
which is the issuance of general fare media on Smart Cards, is targeted for
the fall of 2013.
They have worked on the development of software for the web portal for
users of the EcoPass programs to go online and monitor the status of their
account. IT has also worked on the generation of reports to gather the
information necessary to track the use of Smart Cards.
Bruce Abel explained that the biggest challenge was that we received the
cards late from the vendor which put staff behind on getting the cards
produced. This lead RTD to extend the 2012 pass deadline to January 31.
The cards must be coded to the proper fare depending on the program and
be customized with a photo as they are customer specific. Bruce stated
that customers had three options available for people to submit their photos.
If RTD had their digital photo on file, they could authorize RTD to use the
existing photo to create the card. Another option was for the company to
take the photos and submit them to RTD. Finally people could go and have
their passes produced at certain RTD sites such as Boulder Transit Center
and other RTD locations. Another challenge was people submitting their
photos on time or in an incorrect format. As of January 25 we have
produced every card for which the photo was received. With regard to the
complaints received by Director Lubow, these issues have been addressed.
Staff is monitoring the entire system and trying to respond to issues as
quickly as possible. They are verifying that the cards are tapping correctly
and are generating above 55,000 taps a day; they have a benchmark of

Packet Pg. 51

• Smart Card Project Status Update

6.F

70,000 when all the programs are up to speed, which means we are getting
close to the benchmark.

Director Sisk congratulated Bruce and the staff on the Smart Card program
as it has been very well received. He asked how do they communicate to
the users. He also asked if staff have considered extending the deadline to
January 31 for the college program to allow Boulder students to participate.
Bruce stated that they chose the Business Eco Pass, Neighborhood Eco Pass
and College Pass because these are targeted groups and each organization,
company, college, etc. have coordinators that work with RTD. In each case
they worked with the RTD marketing department in creating targeted
marketing materials on how to use the card for each group. With regard to
the College program, one of the reasons that ridership has been growing is
because schools come back online by mid-January. At this time most of the
colleges have distributed their cards; staff has not heard that there will be
any issues with the colleges meeting the January 31st deadline.
Director Daly stated that the 200 refusals out of 50,000 transactions
completed is impressive. He also asked how the operators are instructed to
handle a fail on a Smart Card. Bruce stated that if the failure is intended or
the card is hot listed (has been reported lost/stolen) the driver is advised to
refuse boarding and collect the card. On an unintentional red “invalid”, the
operator is advised to allow the person to board and ask them to contact
RTD’s customer service center to identify if it is a card or validator problem.
Staff has worked very hard to address all the drivers to ensure they know
the procedures. Supervisors have also done gate checks to reach each
driver. Since the checks were implemented they have seen a reduction on
the number of issues related to extending the 2012 deadline, failures, etc.
Director Hoy stated that it is important to understand that this is a giant beta
test for the rollout in August for people that have cards that pay for each
trip. The cards are pre-paid so if the tap is unsuccessful we are not losing
revenue. Therefore it is important that in August we have all issues resolved
so that when people tap their card they will get charged.
Bruce Abel stated that Gary Googins was not able to attend and that is why
he took the lead on the updates.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 12, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked if the other cards that we will be rolling out will have
photos as well. She is wondering if we have a lessons learned from this
process. Bruce Abel stated that the next phase is general populous such as
selling monthly passes on Smart Card or having store value cards; these
cards are not personalized. They have done lessons learned internally as
well as with the Xerox contractors.

6.F

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location

Director Hoy asked if this has to do with the stop requested announcement.
Eric stated that this is the equipment that will do the voice announcement.
Once the new system is installed on all the buses it will actually make an
announcement for the next stop.

D. Other Matters
Director Hoy asked if there had been any feedback on the new route 104X which
has been on the road for about a month. Bruce stated that it has been on the road
for 5 weeks so it is early in the process to have much feedback. Jessie Carter said
that currently the ridership is about 5-6 people per trip but we expect that to grow.

Director Daly stated that he attended the State Capitol where Directors Folska and
Tobiassen testified on the Parking Bill 13-027 in the Senate Transportation
Committee. This is the bill that the Board passed the consent to support. The bill
passed 5-0 and now moves onto the second reading in the Senate.
Director Daly thanked Paula and Barbara for giving up their Saturday and taking
care of everything associated with the teambuilding exercise. He thought they did
a great job with this event.

(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Eric Farrington, Project Manager for the CAD/AVL, stated that there is a
status report provided to the Board in the Operations and Customer Service
Agenda Packet from February 12, 2013. He said that since the report was
written there was a failure of the data radio cellular system operated by
Sprint. Sprint made the mistake of resetting all the cards to factory
settings. This means that staff has to go out and reprogram each card.
They are working on this and he will work with Sprint to ensure RTD is
compensated for the work required to correct the issue.

February Board Meeting Agenda Review
General Manager Washington introduced the February Board agenda. He indicated that the
past practice would be that he goes only over the items if there are any questions since
they have already passed committee. He pointed out under recommended action that they

complete that process this week. Director Daly noted that he had shared with the full
Board that Senate Bill 13-027 had passed the Senate Transportation Committee and will
go before the Senate for a vote.

Motion:

A motion was made by Director Hoy to move the
agenda forward to the February 19 Board meeting for
approval.

Unanimous Consent
Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following
additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity
generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line
(NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following
activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce
payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle
project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs
and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights
(TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining
portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to
72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the
low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the
completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability
of funding from previously-approved RAM items.
Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal Policy Statement
as well as accept these modifications for 2014.

of Directors approve the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost increase of

designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators
whose service is impacted by these changes.

Aconex Contract Extension
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of

years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for
Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date of the
contract to April 2017. Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013
Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of
Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities
by third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and
allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments
consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would
require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be
sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.
DBE Committee Name Change
It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that the
Board of Directors change the name of the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE)
Committee to the Civil Rights Committee which is more inclusive and
comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.

III.

Trip Reports
The committee discussed a suggestion made by Director Bagley for the Board to
provide a one-page abbreviated report on trips or conferences that they attend.
The purpose of these reports is to communicate the value of these conferences and
share information that may be beneficial to the full Board.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion that the Board
members provide a brief, one-page report on trips or
conferences that they attend which can be shared with
the full Board. The Executive committee will look to
create a simple outline for this report.
The motion was seconded by Director Daly.
The Motion PASSED unanimously.

Director Daly shared that he and Chair Anderson had attended the Jefferson
County Transportation Advisory Group (JEFFTAG) meeting. He reported that
Steve Ruddy with DRCOG had announced his retirement. He also reported that
this group (C-470 Coalition) is looking at the Western beltway and the
possibility of expanding it on the west side including adding an extra toll lane.
He wondered if RTD should have representation. Director Bagley informed him
that he is the representative for the C-470 coalition and indicated that Director
Daly could be the alternate.
Director Anderson added that the Jefferson County Parkway Public Highway
Authority Board (JPPHA) is also looking at part of the beltway around
Broomfield to C-470 and that CDOT is looking at the possibility of making this
one. All of this is under discussion.
Director Anderson read a request from Bill James related to doing the pledge of
allegiance only at Board meetings to engender the respect of the pledge.
Director Walker was asked to share his perspective. Director Walker stated that
the pledge of allegiance is important but there are other ways that we also
show respect to our country. He feels that once a month at the regular Board
meeting is sufficient and efficient. Director Solano was asked his opinion about
this as well and indicated he was OK with doing the pledge of allegiance at the
Board meetings. After some back and forth discussion about the motion and
where in the order of the meeting it should be, it was determined that this is at
the Chair of the Board’s discretion to make that call. No motion was required.
Teambuilding—Director Bagley indicated we need to discuss next steps and
what the next teambuilding might look like. Chair Anderson indicated we will
plan a relook at this after our return from the Legislative meeting in Washington
D.C.
Director Bagley spoke about the opportunity that a few Directors had last year
to attend a BRT conference in Vegas. He indicated that it might be beneficial to
do a field trip of other BRT properties especially for the people participating in
the NAMS. Several of the Committee members indicated this might be valuable
at some time and Director Daly shared from a BRT tour they had taken in Long
Beach CA. General Manager Washington pointed out that the challenge is
finding a property with BRT comparable to RTD. He also indicated that one of
the responsibilities of the consultant will be to lay out what the BRT look like so
it may be more prudent to wait until after this occurs to take any tour of BRT
properties.
Director Bagley thanked Director Walker for chairing of the Finance
Administration and Audit committee and for taking charge of the meeting. He
remarked on how Director Walker effectively used the tool of taking unrelated

items offline (parking lot) and this should be a tool that other Chairs use in the
facilitating of their meetings in order to stay on task.
Director Bagley recommended the Board considers an annual consolidated report
of meeting attendance. The committee discussed the difficulty of hearing
especially if a member calls into a meeting. Paula Perdue explained this has
been an ongoing issue that has a lot to do with the room itself, overhead
acoustics, power, wiring, etc. but that the Board office is looking for some
short-term solutions. One such solution they are exploring would cost in excess
of $40K and must become an approved capital project item.
The Committee discussed the need for a unified Board and better understanding
the mission of the Board.
Several comments were noted about the strategic planning advance and its
purpose to focus on the top strategic initiatives for this agency. Chair Anderson
shared that a conference call would be held with the facilitator to identify the
framework and purpose of the advance.
Director Daly complimented Director Solano for chairing of the Operations and
Customer Services Committee.
Director Walker asked if there is a way to provide a technical overview for the
new Directors (i.e. building a model of what goes into some of the decisions on
service planning, routes, etc. and share the “science” used to arrive at some of
the recommendations.) to better educate them on transit. He also asked how
can we better clarify the roles of Board and staff. He asked the Committee to
consider doing away with the communications reimbursement for internet in
light of the fact that the IPADs can offer alternatives.
General Manager Washington shared that Secretary of Transportation (Ray
LaHood) will be in Colorado on Monday at a conference.
General Manager Washington shared that they are working on the coordination
of calendars for the Legislative trip to Washington D.C. He strongly encouraged
Board members to take advantage of the many sessions offered in this
conference.
General Manager Washington commented that the Collective Bargaining efforts
are making progress.
General Manager Washington shared that he is being encouraged to put his
name in the hat for the Chair of APTA. The way the process works, if he
pursues and is chosen, he would serve first as vice-chair for the year 20132014 and become chair in 2014-2015. However, this discussion is very
preliminary but he does not want to make a decision without the support of the
Executive committee or the Board. Some of the committee members expressed
some concern over if this would distract from the RTD responsibilities. General
Manager Washington acknowledged this could be demanding but he felt he is
up for the job. He would not compromise the RTD agency but sees this as

providing high visibility for the RTD agency as well as the APTA transportation
industry itself. This could be a win-win and a chance to elevate RTD to another
level. Director Walker added that we have a very deep bench in the leadership
of RTD and this would reflect well on RTD as an agency of innovative ideas.
This would also provide additional networking opportunities with businesses,
industry leaders and others in transit.
Chair Anderson and Director Bagley provided their full support. Chair Anderson
reflected on the positive accolades for this agency-Number 1 transit agency,
national and international visibility, doing the only transit P3 in the country; all
of these collectively will benefit RTD and having the GM in this role will help
RTD to retain being the greatest transit agency in the country. All of the
Committee members supported the General Manager if this comes to be. Chair
Anderson will socialize this opportunity with the rest of the Board. General
Manager Washington will communicate to the APTA Leadership that he has the
support of the Executive Committee.

has been with RTD for 15 years. Alger was not present to receive his award from the
Board. The Board thanked Alger for his years of commitment and service.

Public Participation
Tom Grushka, Littleton, who identified himself as RTD watch, spoke to a couple of items
on the agenda from the Operations Committee. He stated that he did not feel the manager
had justified the spending for the Oracle hardware and software contract approval. He
also stated that the assistant general manager had not justified the expenditures for the
purchase of the mall shuttle buses. He asked to have this removed from the agenda and
put the purchase off.
Former Director Jack McCroskey provided salutations and indicated it was 30 years ago in
January 1983 that the appointed Board of Directors and the Elected Board took off. The
appointed Board had a brawl with the disabled community over wheelchair lifts on busses.
The first act of the elected Board was to put wheelchair lifts on 99 buses.

Chair's Report
The newly installed Board Chair Anderson congratulated the nine Directors who had been
re-elected or elected. She noted that the five new members had undergone a rigorous
orientation process. She is pleased with the diversity on the Board which represents the
makeup of our District. She had watched the celebration of the Martin Luther King
Anniversary and also the second inauguration of our President Obama. She was
impressed with the significance of this event and Obama’s words that all people need to
be treated with respect and dignity. She had appointed Directors Deadwyler and Malpiede
as co-chairs of the Civil Rights Committee with hopes that they can help elevate civil
rights not only at RTD but also in this metropolitan region. She had also appointed
Director Tobiassen to this committee because of his passion to help the disabled. She is
looking forward to the Board teambuilding session and she is impressed with the civility of
the Board in their interface with the community, staff, stakeholders and each other. She
hopes that we will continue to treat others with respect and dignity.

General Manager's Report






General Manager Washington indicated that he and a couple of his senior leadership
members participated in the Transit Research Board conference January 15-17. He
indicated this was a prestigious group of academians and scientists with over
11,700 in participation. They were interested in RTD and he and his team were
able to share.
General Manager Washington participated in the “Planting the Seed Conference”
which took place at Montbello High School. This event was in conjunction with the
Martin Luther King celebration and creating sustainable communities.
General Manager Washington thanked the Board for their approval of the RAM
matrix which provided eight initiatives that staff will pursue for funding sources for
FasTracks. He introduced a new initiative to the Board members for the North
Metro initiative which offered three financial market opportunities in the next 6-8
months:
o Refinancing three RTD debt issues as lower than current rates to reduce
payments, improve cash flows and provide additional capacity under TABOR
o Issuing the bridge financing debt for the Eagle project to bridge the Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) at a lower interest rate than assumed,
saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR
o Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd quarter, 2013 to finance remaining
portion of the DUS to 72nd segment
General Manager Washington staff will be bringing this item before the Board in
February and ask permission to do an RFP. Questions from Board members
included:
 Is this amount over and above the projected $277M from the initial 8
initiatives on the RAM? General Manager Washington responded yes.

When does construction start? Prior to the release of the RFP.
The CFO had referenced 3 debts-what is included? Issuance of new debt,
finish up of final design and construct to 72nd Avenue. CFO Howerter
indicated this was a good plan. This will be a request to refinance; it will
free up TABOR capacity and this can be done smoothly.
General Manager Washington added that the DUS to 72nd leg is the most
expensive and difficult to construct. We will save money in the long run.
Director Bagley inquired about the refinancing and difference in basic interest
rates. CFO Howerter responded that the 2006 FasTracks refinancing would
result in approximately $70M of interest savings. He anticipates refunding of
these bond issues of $236M;$99M and $37M.
Director Lasater asked about the cost and requested a cost per mile
comparative analysis with the East, West and SW corridor lines.
Director James asked what was the percent of the overall debt. CFO
Howerter indicated about 10%. He also asked what was the difference with
this line. General Manager Washington indicated we have benefited from
the lessons learned that we had done. This line will be a design-build-build.
Rick Clarke added that when working with multiple jurisdictions, it becomes
challenging to work out the technical changes and community issues.
Director Folska complimented the staff on working with the TRB and asked
if the extra cost to go to 72nd has to do with dealing with more existing
infrastructure. General Manager Washington indicated this is a big part of it
especially when you think of something like utility relocations, but there are
just a number of technical challenges.
Director Hoy asked about the potential for accelerating and the response
from the stakeholders such as Denver and Adams Counties. General
Manager Washington indicated they are aware of this and are supportive.
RTD will be asking them to sign off before the release of the RFP. We need
to finalize the IGA’s and hope they will be supportive.
Director Lubow thanked the staff for their creative ideas and movement for
up north.
Tobiassen also thanked staff for the out of the box thinking and asked if
having the RFP on the street for 30 days is sufficient. General Manager
Washington indicated a draft RFP will be out this summer.
Director Walker asked if there is a window where construction could start
and stop. General Manager Washington indicated we will not piecemill this
solution.
Director Folska inquired about the interplay between the Northwest Mobility
Study and the North Metro Initiative. General Manager Washington
indicated there is not much interplay.

Purchase of Up to 34 Mall Shuttle Buses

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of

19FK001 with DesignLine USA for the purchase of up to 34, 45-foot mall shuttle buses to
replace the existing TransTeq mall buses at a price not to exceed $24,147,350.
Chair Anderson asked for a motion to approve item C, Purchase of up to 34 mall shuttle
buses that had been pulled from the unanimous consent.
Motion:

Motion:

Director James made the motion to approve the
purchase of up to 34 mall shuttle buses.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.
Director Menten asked to postpone this action
until November after New Jersey has had a
chance to test their similar product and allow
more time for Board review.
Director Solano seconded this motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten passed out handouts from research she had done on
the design-line bus. Her research indicated concerns with quality,
financial stability of the vendor and the fact that two other transit
agencies had a bad experience with this vendor. She also raised

issues pertaining to why DreamLine was selected over a Colorado
company.
Director Lubow expressed concern and asked if staff was aware of
these legal and technical issues with DreamLine and the product.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations and Dean
Shaklee, superintendent of maintenance, responded to these
questions and allegations. RTD is very aware of these issues and the
problem has been correctly. We have currently had 2 prototype
design- line vehicles on the mall and have experienced no problems.
In fact, this vehicle has proven more reliable than other prototypes.
RTD has done our due diligence on this product. The type of product
being used in New Jersey is an over-the-road model and is different
from the mall shuttle model that we are purchasing. AGM Abel also
indicated that when we had issued RFP for the busses, our finance
department had reviewed the financial records of the vendor. RTD
has had a positive experience with the vendor on the two prototypes
in use and has noticed a decrease in cost per mile. We have
negotiated several modifications to the buses and the vendor has
been responsive.
Director Solano inquired about the battery fires and how does this
differ. Dean Shaklee indicated this is the same type battery just as
what is used in a number of different devices and applications. The
issue of fire was in the overcharging of the batteries. Dean also
noted that the transit manufacturer for our current buses is no longer
in business and the propulsion system is obsolete. The current buses
are over 12 years, have exceeded their useful life and parts are not
available. The RTD maintenance shop is performing their own
maintenance and has “created” parts on which to operate. Very soon
they will be unable to do this. Bruce Abel indicated that before the
complete purchase would be made, after the initial bus, it will be run
through strenuous testing at the Altunna plant. Dean Shaklee
indicated that the Altunna testing is required by the FTA.
Director Lubow stated there are several red flags about this company.
They have a pretty bad track record and she does not feel RTD did
due diligence in not sharing this information with them. Bruce Abel
indicated that much of this had already been discussed prior to the
new Board members coming on board and apologized for not
providing this information.
Director Lasater echoed the concern that this information was not
shared and asked when did TransTech (maker of current buses) go

down. Dean Shaklee responded about 18 months ago. RTD acquired
all the inventory that we could.
Director Solano wanted to know how extensive was our inventory
and did we have enough inventory to maintain the buses. Dean
Shaklee responded not really and we are already out of some parts.
Bruce Abel re-stated these vehicles have exceeded the recommended
state of good repair and we need to plan accordingly.
Director Folska inquired if the bidder from outside of US met
requirements for Buy America. She also asked if we execute a
contract, how long before the vehicle will be on the street. Dean
Shaklee responded the vehicle would go through the Altunna testing
in May or June and delivery could be late this year or early next year.
Director Lubow stressed a potential liability with this new bus and
asked if it was possible to order only a few. AGM Abel indicated the
cost was determined by the CPI index and an increase in the CPI will
drive an increase in the cost.

FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors reappoint six members of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) to an additional three-year term and appoint one
new member to the Committee to the remainder of a three-year term to fill a vacancy.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve the
FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee Appointments.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Scott Reed spoke to the diversity of this Committee.
He indicated there were 17 members and that 14 of the
15 districts are represented.
Director Folska stated she appreciates the work of this
committee and understand that their efforts only apply
to FasTracks.
Director Lubow stated that the appointees all seem to
have wonderful qualifications with advanced degrees.
She asked if we look at the socioeconomic diversity for
the committee as she does not think the CAC members
are representative of the ridership. Director Solano
added there should be a look at the blue collar workers.
Director Bagley shared that he and Sherman Hamilton
were a part of the selection committee. They had 60
applicants that had been narrowed down to 9
candidates. Two of them were a no-show. All of them
had significant presence in the community, did an
outstanding job, and were from high level functioning
groups.

Subject:

Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix
Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

Van

Assistant

Date: January 31, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff
to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and
to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro
Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower
interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity
under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.
BACKGROUND
RTD staff has developed a RAM that identifies specific cost saving/revenue enhancing opportunities
that, if enacted, would result in additional near-term funding for the FasTracks program. For each of
these opportunities, staff has identified the associated level of risk to the District and presented this risk
assessment to the RTD Board of Directors.
In December, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors approved the first eight recommended opportunities
identified as part of the RAM and confirmed the following goals for use of these funds:


Completion of US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project;



Construction of NMRL to at least 72nd Avenue;



Any remaining funds above the $300 million goal could leverage potential grants or private sector
contributions for FasTracks partially-funded projects (at the RTD Board’s discretion).

Packet Pg. 77

12.A

DISCUSSION
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the following additional RAM items for RTD Board information:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment.

By approving this action, the RTD Board of Directors confirms their intent to move forward with these
RAM items. Each of these RAM items will be presented as a separate action to the RTD Board of
Directors at future meetings, as required by Bond Counsel.
Staff also recommends that the RTD Board use the financing capacity generated by these RAM items to
extend the NMRL from the National Western Stock Show (NWSS) to 72nd Avenue, which is estimated to
cost between $200 - $220 million (year of expenditure dollars). Approval of this action will allow RTD to
initiate procurement (Request for Proposals) for the NMRL to 72nd Avenue within the next 10 months.
RTD staff has assigned a risk level of “low” to these additional RAM items because they allow RTD to
take advantage of historically low interest rates to build more of the FasTracks program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of these additional RAM items will have a positive financial impact to the FasTracks capital
program by refinancing existing debt issues.
ALTERNATIVES
RTD staff identified the following alternatives for RTD Board consideration.
1.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct
staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM)
items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the
NMRL to 72nd Avenue.
Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:


Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash
flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing debt to bridge the FFGA for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously
assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under TABOR;



Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to
72nd Avenue segment;



Initiating procurement (Request for Proposals) for construction of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the
next ten months.

Packet Pg. 78

12.A

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that
financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This
action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items for other projects.

2.
Alternative #2. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors does not direct staff to move forward with implementation of these new RAM items. This
alternative is not recommended because it would not allow RTD to take advantage of historically low
interest rates that would result in additional funding for the FasTracks program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Proposed 2013
Statement

and

2014

Fiscal

Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal Policy Statement as well as accept these modifications
for 2014.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement are brought to the Board for approval during the
year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy Statement for the
following fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step in development of the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy Statement was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2012 for the 2013 fiscal year. The approved policy modifications for 2013 were primarily to
define the FasTracks Fund Balance Policy to maintain three months of operating expenses excluding
depreciation for FasTracks operations. This modification was approved to be consistent with the Base
System Fund Balance Policy which follows GFOA recommended best practices to provide stability of
service levels during economic downturns or other unforeseen financial events. The 2013 Fiscal Policy
Statement modifications specifically addressed the operating fund balance needs of the FasTracks
program because the opening of the first FasTracks corridor for revenue service will occur in 2013.
DISCUSSION
Board approval is requested in order to update the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2013 to include the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and to use this updated Fiscal Policy Statement in the
development of the 2014 Strategic Budget Plan and 2014 Requested Budget.
Recommended changes to the Fiscal Policy Statement are shown in the accompanying marked-up
document with changes indicated in red.
The proposed changes to the Fund Balance Policies section are requested in order to align fiscal policies
with the establishment of the FISA beginning in 2013 as approved by the Board of Directors in
December 2012. This Fund Balance Policy modification will add a separate fund, referred to as FISA, to
track funds that become available from the sources identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). The
FISA was established to identify and appropriate funding for FasTracks projects that are currently
unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA fund must be approved by the Board of Directors.
The proposed changes to the Debt Policies section are requested to reflect the most recent bond rating
agency credit ratings that were completed with the December 2012 bond issuance.

Packet Pg. 80

12.B

The proposed change to the Budget Policies which removes the reference to excluding depreciation from
the budget, reflects the revised methodology to roll forward budgeted fund balances for consistent
comparison to actual results.
All other policies remain unchanged from the previous Board approved 2013 policies.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Changing the policy as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2013 Budget. Items identified
in the RAM that will provide funding for the FISA will primarily begin in 2014. As opportunities arise in
2013 to contribute funds to the FISA, the proposed 2013 Amended Budget will be adjusted accordingly.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports this
alternative because the changes address the Fund Policy needs of the FISA and RAM as well as
provides current information regarding credit ratings and budgeting methods.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff has reviewed the RTD Fiscal Policy
Statement and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board.
3. Do not adopt the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not
recommended because the District’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current
language and would not best facilitate the needs of the District’s financial operations and tracking
of the FISA.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
2013-20143 PROPOSED FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. The Board of Directors will review potential fare increases annually at the time of the
development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As part of this process, staff will
review potential fare increases to establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general public;
and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies should take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. One-time
revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure the
continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board will
support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state financial
resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that would limit or
diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will make an
ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure consistency with
the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
1

Packet Pg. 82

12.B.a

attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two objectives

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)



2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier to
use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and minimizes
future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and thereby
reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls using
the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been approved by
the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including
projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs,
and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to be
included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited to the
effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); and
 consequences of not funding
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective February 19, 2013

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for the
capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the cost
estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to the Board
for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance with
the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital
and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature or
to meet unexpected increases in costs. This unrestricted fund balance will be
comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three
months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For FasTracks,
the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
twothree months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD will
consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance replenishment. For
example, RTD may define the revenue sources that would typically be looked to for
replenishment of fund balance to include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses.
Year-end surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated fund
balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and occur only
in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With Board approval,
these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need for shortterm borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating. The source
of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
3

Packet Pg. 84

12.B.a

3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at each
year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to unanticipated
events.

5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. RTD will maintain all revenues in excess of expenditures for Denver Union Station in a
reserve for future development of Denver Union Station as a rapid transit hub, as
specified in the intergovernmental agreement as amended on April 20, 2004.
7. The Board shall establish threetwo reserves for future construction under the FasTracks
plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30 million
each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the FasTracks
construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings opportunities that might
arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (nonFasTracks) base system capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project goals identified
in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other sources approved by the
Board.
 All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve
for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund
the (non-FasTracks) Bbase Ssystem expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds or Certificates of Participation
(COPs) shall be financed for a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the asset.

3. Before bonded long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. Bond financing or COPs will not be issued to support current operating expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's bond ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level in
light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive lower
interest rates and lower bond or certificate insurance premiums than would be possible
with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

5. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond coverage ratio for the
Bbase Ssystem (annual non-FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual sales and
use tax debt service for senior non-FasTracks debt) of four times for debt backed by the
0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond
coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual
FasTracks sales and use tax debt service) of two times for debt backed by the 0.4%
FasTracks sales and use tax.
6. RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (all annual revenues
remaining after operating and maintenance expenses, net of passthrough grants, to
annual debt service requirements net of excess appropriations required for variable rate
debt) of 1.2 times total debt.

BUDGET POLICIES
1. RTD shall comply with all requirements of the Colorado Local Government Budget Law.
2. The budget will be prepared on a program/project basis.

RTD's performance on the adopted performance indicators.
11. A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is
greater than or equal to expenditures will be prepared.
12. Budgetary procedures that fund current expenditures at the expense of future needs,
such as postponing preventive maintenance expenditures or replacement of equipment,
will be avoided.
13. RTD will provide conservative revenue estimates that take into consideration recent
experience and reflect reasonable future growth.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 6, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

April 2013 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of construction of the West Light Rail Line and Board adoption of the West Corridor
Service Plan, significant changes in bus and light service are slated to begin April 28, 2013. Attachment
C of this report is a copy of the Board Report containing the West Corridor Service Plan as adopted by
the Board of Directors on October 23, 2012.
Additional routine service changes not associated with or included in the West Corridor Service Plan are
necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate level of service
according to customer demand. For this year we will continue to focus on adjusting services in response
to the January 2012 service revisions and changes in ridership and operational performance.
The proposed April 2013 Service Changes contained herein reflect the continued budgetary challenges
faced by RTD. The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
•
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
•
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
•
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
•
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services
•
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin
•
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Given the limited nature of the proposed service changes, the E-Alert system was employed to alert
customers of schedule changes to affected services. A summary of customer comments from the
Service Change website is contained in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are proposed to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent changes proposed to the service
changes initially proposed to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of January 2013 service
changes:

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

ACTION X

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.
The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

12.C.b

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan Limited: schedule changes to coordinate with Route 30Ltd
Route 49 – North Lowell: proposed new route was deleted from the proposal
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown: replaces the Route 49 proposal providing a connection to
the West Line at Sheridan Station
Route 51 – Sheridan Crosstown: coordinated with the Route 50
Route76 – Wadsworth Crosstown: proposed service increase between Hampden
/Wadsworth and Old Town Arvada park-n-Rides.
Route 76Ltd – Wadsworth Limited: proposed new route was deleted from proposal

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

12.C.b

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

Subject:

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

ACTION X

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.

Attachment: Attachment C (1494 : April 2013 Service Changes Final)

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

Packet Pg. 101

12.C.c

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule

Attachment: Attachment C (1494 : April 2013 Service Changes Final)

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

Attachment: Attachment C (1494 : April 2013 Service Changes Final)

Route AF – Downtown Denver / Denver International Airport: early morning trips added
between Federal Center via Downtown Denver when W-Line not in service
Applewood call-n-Ride: proposal canceled, replaced by continuation of Routes 20 and 32

Golden call-n-Ride: scheduled times for Jefferson County social services facilities added
Wide Acres call-n-Ride: proposal deleted
C Line: additional service to start from Evans Station rather than 10th & Osage Station

Jefferson County Department of Human Services stated that the call-n-Ride will be
inadequate to access their campus. Two customers also spoke in favor of retaining Route
100X as a one-seat ride to Civic Center Station.
Individuals covered a number of issues: Discontinuance of Route 9 between Wadsworth
and Federal was opposed due to the poor sidewalks leading to light rail stations, with a
circulator route for those neighborhoods proposed as an alternative; objections to the slow
speed of the 16th Street Mall Ride; concern about possible travel times on the proposed
Route AF. Non-service issues raised included a suggestion that an intense safety program
be adopted along the line. One speaker objected to call-n-Ride vans operating in the
vicinity of Garrison Station as a betrayal of RTD’s commitment not to operate bus service
on Garrison Street. RTD Director Matt Cohen heard the testimony, along with six RTD
staff members.

Jeffco Government Center
Monday, April 16, 2012
The goal of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X drew the most interest
from the 26 members of the public attending the Golden meeting. Participants felt that
the proposed alternatives were too slow and worried that adding a Regional Route KC
from the Ken Caryl area would divide ridership up, rather than attracting customers. Two
speakers, including Tim Young (Jefferson County Human Services Manager for Child
Services), expressed concern about the proposed Golden call-n-Ride’s ability to handle the
family traffic on the mile stretch between their buildings and the light rail terminal.
(Service is presently provided by Route 17.)

Written testimony prepared for this meeting and submitted in lieu of making statements
included support for the idea of extending Route 76Ltd from West Colfax to Olde Town
Arvada; a proposal to replace Route 17 in the Jeffco Government Center with a fixed
route, rather than a call-n-Ride; adding a deviation to Route 49 to serve Regis University’s
campus.

Individual concerns were voiced, including the needs of Wheat Ridge High School students
on Route 32 in the segment proposed to be replaced by a call-n-Ride; concern was also
expressed by a satisfied user of the Dry Creek call-n-Ride who did not feel that call-n-Ride
service areas as large as proposed in the West Corridor plan were workable. Five staff
participated in the meeting.
Hadley Branch – Denver Public Library
Saturday, April 21, 2012
Diverse comments were offered by the eight members of the public who attended the
meeting. One person was critical of the Union Station alignment, versus going into the
central Downtown loop. Another had questions about where the new line would go in
Downtown. Others opposed removing Route 14 west of Wadsworth, but asked that it be
scheduled for favorable connections with Route 76; supported restoring Route 100 service
on Sundays; opposed discontinuing Route 17 service on West 44th Avenue at the Colorado
Railroad Museum; expressed concern about replacing Route 17 at the Human Services
building with the Golden call-n-Ride; supported 7-day a week operation of the Golden calln-Ride. Three RTD staff members and one City and County of Denver planner heard the
testimony and answered questions.
Blair-Caldwell Library – Five Points
Saturday, April 21, 2012
The most commonly expressed concern among the 14 members of the public at this
meeting regarded the call-n-Ride service proposed to replace Route 17 for Jeffco Human
Services buildings and in Applewood replacing segments of Routes 20, 28, and 32. In
brief, the concern regarding the former is that the special needs of Human Services clients
could not be met and for the latter that capacity would be insufficient. A written proposal
was presented describing a merger of segments of Routes 20 and 28 to continue serving
NREL. Two speakers also objected to the lack of rail service between Five Points and the
West Line/Union Station and favored a shuttle route of some type.

Thursday, April 19, 2012
Retaining through service to Civic Center Station on Routes 100X and 116X was the top
concern among the 32 members of the public who attended the Bear Valley meeting.
Similar concerns were raised on behalf of Route 2X service in the Green Mountain area.
The route alternatives in the service proposal were opposed, but suggestions were made
by customers for other alternatives. The majority favored – if the Express routes were not
retained as they are – adding a stop on the proposed Regional Route KC at the unofficial
park-n-Ride at C-470/Quincy. The proposed discontinuance of Route 21 in the area to be
served by the Green Mountain call-n-Ride was also a concern of many, especially in regard
to service for Green Mountain High School.

Individual statements were made in support of retaining Route 9 east to Sheridan
Boulevard instead of introducing the new Route 49; in support of the Route 16 service
change proposal if the first weekday morning trip remains in the current time frame; in
favor of signaling changes on Welton Street to cure schedule adherence problems; in favor
of moving the proposed B-C fare zone boundary west one station in order to lower fares at
Oak Station; opposed removing Route 3 from Green Mountain; opposed the proposed

Wednesday, April 25, 2012
The most urgently expressed interest in the noon meeting in Downtown Denver was in
support of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X between western
Lakewood and Ken Caryl points and Civic Center Station. Six of the 26 members of the
public attending named this as their concern. Alternatives were offered by some,
including adding a stop at Federal Center Station or adding an unofficial Park-n-Ride at the
C-470/Quincy interchange to the proposed Route KC. Individuals raised issues regarding
the loss of Route 2X service to Morrison that can be used for hiking into concerts at Red
Rocks Amphitheater, Route 21 travel needs of Green Mountain High School students, a
potential shortage of space on Route 16 if customers do not switch to Light Rail,
replacement of Route 17 service with call-n-Ride, the double transfer required to get
between the new W-Line and the Southeast F/H-Lines0, and a lack of capacity for
wheelchair customers running into other customers on the ramp at Littleton/Downtown
Station. Ten RTD staff members attended the meeting.
Conifer Library, Conifer
Wednesday, April 25, 2012
Support for the proposed West Corridor service plan as related to Routes CV/CS/CX
serving the Conifer area was the theme of much of the Conifer meeting. One speaker
spoke in support of retaining Route 6X. Other issues were raised by individuals, including
requests for improvements in specific connections, interest in information about the plans
for Pine Junction Park-n-Ride, and requests to go back to using glass in shelters. Twenty
members of the public, plus RTD Board Director Bruce Daly, were in attendance. Four
RTD staff members participated in the meeting.
Evergreen Library, Evergreen
Saturday, April 28, 2012
The major interest of the 23 attendees was in supporting the proposed retention of
through Regional Routes EV/ES/EX service into Civic Center Station. Two attendees
spoke in support of retaining Route AF service at the Federal Center Station. Individual
comments included: anxiety about security for passengers with luggage at Union Station;
a request to add a round trip to Denver from Evergreen on Saturdays and Sundays; a
request to run the Evergreen call-n-Ride till 9:00 p.m.; a request to extend skyRide to
Evergreen; noted a need for information on how to get to the Performing Arts complex
from the West Line.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Taxable Sales Tax Revenue
Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the first of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in the
RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISCUSSION:
RTD issued its $116 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2004A (the “2004 Bonds”) in 2004 for
the purpose of financing a portion of the southeast light rail corridor. At present, $5.750 million par
amount of the 2004 Bonds remain outstanding.
RTD issued its $100 million Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2005A (the “2005 Bonds”) in
2005 for the purpose of refunding the 2000A and 2002B bonds then outstanding. At present, $98.865
million par amount of the 2005 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2004 and 2005 Bonds on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings
of approximately $24.2 million (3.06% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum savings of 2% which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold.
The 2004 Bonds are callable November 1, 2013 at par and the 2005 Bonds are callable November 1,
2015 at par.Pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance
refunded (refunding bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding
bonds)) once, and (b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of
outstanding bonds) without limit. The 2005 bonds were advance refunding bonds so the 2013
refunding bonds would not qualify for tax exemption and would be issued with a taxable status.

Packet Pg. 120

12.D

While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2004 and 2005 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent an increase in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time due to a reduction in time proceeds
of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2004 and 2005 Bonds. Despite the cost
associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2004 and 2005
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity
for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a
preliminary official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase
agreement and the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the
Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in
connection with the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Goldman Sachs, Loop Capital, Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the District.

individual Refunding Bond will be issued for more than one maturity bearing interest at the same

The principal, Redemption Price of, and final interest payment on

Payment of interest on any Refunding Bond, other than the payment on the Registered Coupons

Paying Agent, on or before each interest payment date (or, if such interest payment date is not a
business day, on or before the next succeeding business day), to the registered owner thereof at
the address shown on the registration records kept by the Bond Registrar on the Record Date; but
any such interest not so timely paid or duly provided for shall cease to be payable to the person
who is the registered owner thereof at the close of business on the Record Date and shall be

Refunding Bonds of the same maturity of any authorized denominations and, except as set forth
in this section, upon the terms and conditions otherwise provided in Article III and Article IV of
the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, as amended.

At the time of initial delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the

Registered Coupons evidencing additional interest on all or any portion of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be in fully registered form (i.e., registered as to payment of the
supplemental interest) provided that no Registered Coupon shall be issued for more than one due
date. The Registered Coupons shall be dated as of the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be numbered in such a manner as the District shall determine.
Each Registered Coupon shall entitle the registered owner thereof to receive payment of a
portion of the interest payable with respect to the Refunding Bonds as described herein. The
Registered Coupons may be owned, transferred and presented for payment separately from the
Refunding Bonds. References in this Resolution to the Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
include the Registered Coupons where the context so requires. Except as specifically provided
herein or in the Registered Coupons, no provision of this Resolution relating to the Refunding
Bonds shall be deemed to affect the rights of the owners of Registered Coupons to receive
payments as provided herein.

maturity date and bearing interest at the same interest rate. So long as any Refunding Bond or
Registered Coupon is registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor,
the Securities Depository shall disburse any payments received, through Participants or
otherwise, to the Beneficial Owners. None of the District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar or the
Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or obligation for the payment to any Participant, any
Beneficial Owner or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons are registered) of the principal of, interest on or any
premium due in connection with the redemption of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be initially issued so that a single Refunding Bond shall evidence the obligation of the
District to pay all principal due on each of the maturity dates for which the Refunding Bonds
bear the same interest rate, and the Registered Coupons initially shall be evidenced by one
Registered Coupon for each payment date for which a Registered Coupon becomes due, as set
forth in the Sale Certificate. Each such Refunding Bond or Registered Coupon shall be
registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. Except as hereinafter
provided, all of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons shall continue to be registered in
the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. To the extent typewritten
Refunding Bonds, rather than printed Refunding Bonds, are to be issued, such modifications to
the form of the Refunding Bond as may be necessary or desirable in such case are hereby
authorized and approved. There shall be no substantive change to the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Refunding Bond, except as otherwise authorized by the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution.
The District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar and the Paying Agent shall have no
responsibility or obligation with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Securities
Depository or a nominee therefor or any Participant with respect to any ownership interest in the
Refunding Bonds or the Registered Coupons or the delivery to any Participant, Beneficial Owner
or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any Refunding Bonds are
registered) of any notice with respect to the Refunding Bonds, including any notice of
redemption.
The District may remove the Securities Depository and the Securities Depository
may resign by giving sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other of such removal or resignation.
Additionally, the Securities Depository shall be removed sixty (60) days after receipt by the
District of written notice from the Securities Depository to the effect that the Securities
Depository has received written notice from Participants having interests, as shown in the
records of the Securities Depository, in an aggregate principal amount of not less than 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Refunding Bonds to the effect that the
Securities Depository is unable or unwilling to discharge its responsibilities or a continuation of
the requirement that all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds be registered in the name of the
Securities Depository or a nominee therefor is not in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners.
Upon the removal or resignation of the Securities Depository, the Securities Depository shall
take such action as may be necessary to assure the orderly transfer of the computerized bookentry system with respect to the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons to a successor
securities depository or if no successor securities depository is appointed as herein provided, the
transfer of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons in certificate form to the Beneficial
Owners or their designees. Upon the giving of notice by the District of the removal of the
Securities Depository, the giving of notice by the Securities Depository of its resignation or the

receipt by the District of notice with respect to the written notice of Participants referred to
herein, the District may, within sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice, appoint a
successor securities depository upon such terms and conditions as the District shall impose. Any
such successor securities depository shall at all times be a registered clearing agency under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and
in good standing thereunder. If the District fails to appoint a successor securities depository
within such time period, the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor, but
may be registered in whatever name or names registered owners transferring or exchanging
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons shall designate.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution
to the contrary, so long as any Refunding Bond is registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee for the Securities Depository, all payments with respect to principal of, interest on and
any premium due in connection with the redemption of such Refunding Bond and all notices
with respect to such Refunding Bond shall be made and given, respectively, in the manner
provided in the Letter of Representations.
11.
The creation, perfection, enforcement, and priority of the pledge of
revenues to secure or pay the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons as provided herein
shall be governed by Section 11-57-208 of the Supplemental Act and the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution. The revenues pledged for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and the
Registered Coupons, as received by or otherwise credited to the District, shall immediately be
subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery, filing, or further act. The lien of
such pledge on the revenues pledged for payment of the Refunding Bonds and the Registered
Coupons and the obligation to perform the contractual provisions made herein and in the Sales
Tax Revenue Bond Resolution shall have priority over any or all other obligations and liabilities
of the District, except for the Senior Bonds, which shall have a lien on such revenues on a parity
with the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons, and except as otherwise provided herein.
The lien of such pledge shall be valid, binding, and enforceable as against all persons having
claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the District irrespective of whether such
persons have notice of such liens.
203. Requirements of a Surety Bond or Reserve Fund Insurance Policy. If it is
determined pursuant to Section 201 hereof that a surety bond or reserve fund insurance policy will
be deposited in the Reserve Fund for all or any portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement relating to
the Bonds and the Prior Parity Bonds, the General Manager or Chief Financial Officer may
independently determine the terms of any agreement with the provider of such surety bond or
reserve fund insurance policy as necessary to satisfy such provider’s commitment requirements
to issue its surety bond or policy.

outstanding under the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, and, in case less than all of the series
of bonds would be affected thereby, with such consent of at least two-thirds in principal amount
of the bonds of each series so affected then outstanding under the Sales Tax Revenue Bond
Resolution, and, in case such modification or amendment would change the terms of any sinking
fund installment, with such consent of at least two-thirds in principal amount of the bonds of the
particular series and maturity entitled to such sinking fund installment then outstanding;
provided, however, that, if such modification or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so
long as any bonds of any specified like series and maturity remain outstanding under the Sales
Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, the consent of the holders of such bonds shall not be required
and such bonds shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of the calculation of
outstanding bonds. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of
redemption or maturity of the principal of any outstanding bond or of any installment of interest
thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or redemption price thereof or in the rate of
interest thereon without the consent of the holder of such bond, or shall reduce the percentages or
otherwise affect the classes of bonds the consent of the holders of which is required to effect any
such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of
the Trustee or of any Paying Agent without its written assent thereto. The Registered Owner of

The bonds are issuable in the form of fully registered bonds without coupons in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiples of $5,000. This bond is transferable as

that purpose at the above-mentioned office of the Trustee, by the Registered Owner hereof in
person, or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this bond together with a written
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by the Registered Owner or his
duly authorized attorney, and thereupon a new registered bond or bonds, and in the same
aggregate principal amount bearing the same interest rate, shall be issued to the transferee in
exchange therefor as provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, and upon payment of
the charges therein prescribed. The Registered Owner of any bond or bonds may surrender the
same (together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by
the Registered Owner or his or her duly authorized attorney), at the above-mentioned office of
the Trustee, in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered bonds bearing the
same interest rate, of any of the authorized denominations, in the manner, subject to the
conditions and upon the payment of the charges provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond
Resolution. The District, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the person in
whose name this bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of receiving
payment of, or on account of, the principal or redemption price hereof and interest due hereon
and for all other purposes.
The bonds of the issue of which this bond is one are payable upon redemption at
the above-mentioned office of the Paying Agent. The Trustee shall mail, by registered or first
class, postage prepaid mail, a copy of any notice of redemption, postage prepaid, not less than
25 days before the redemption date, to the Registered Owners of any bonds or portions of bonds
which are to be redeemed, at their last addresses, appearing upon the registry books, but failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
bonds. If notice of redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid, the bonds or portions thereof

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series
2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the second of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in
the RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $600 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2006A (the “2006
Bonds”) in October 2006 for the purpose of financing a portion of the costs of the FasTracks projects. In
2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725 million of the 2006 Bonds to
capture $11.373 million in present value savings (3.122% of principal of refunded bonds). At present,
$235.735 million par amount of the 2006 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2006 Bonds on a non-callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of
approximately $63.8 million (9.03% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold. The 2006 Bonds are callable November 1, 2016 at par. Pursuant
to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance refunded (refunding
bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding bonds)) once, and
(b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of outstanding bonds)
without limit.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2006 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in interest rates,

Packet Pg. 208

12.E

the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time proceeds of the
refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2006 Bonds. Despite the cost associated with
the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2006 Bonds exceeds the typical
threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and commenced
documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest
expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary official
statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and the
Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to authorize
the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance
of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, George K. Baum and Loop Capital.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 6, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 6, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Amendment to MV Public Transportation ADA
Contract ADA 17-DH-007 for award of the
Belmar, Green Mountain and Golden Call-nRides.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract amendment with MV Public
Transportation for the provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride
contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public Transportation ADA
contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9) month period from April 2013 through December
2013. The cost for the Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-nRide will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to
exceed amount will be $710,806. These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated
as “pass through” expenses.
BACKGROUND
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, RTD also operates “Call-n-Ride” service in various
locations throughout the District. Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand
responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in
a defined service area that requires that the passenger telephone the service provider to arrange for
pick-up. In addition to having a Call-n-Ride vehicle in a service area, Call-n-Rides can also operate as
Flex Routes. A Flex Route is an established route that has assigned stops and times just like a
regular route.
With the opening of the West Line on April 28, 2013, Call-n-Ride service has been planned to serve
areas along the corridor and to provide feeder service to West Rail Line stations. The Belmar Call-n-Ride
will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be bounded on the
north by 13th Avenue, Wadsworth Blvd. on the east, Kipling Street on the west and Morrison Road on
the south. The Belmar Call-n-Ride will also operate a Flex Route on Garrison Street during peak hours
and will serve the Garrison Station. The Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday,
5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be 6th Avenue on the north, Kipling Blvd. on
the east, Union Blvd to Alameda Pkwy on the west and Morrision Road on the south. Two Flex Routes
have been established: one will cover parts of the discontinued Route 2X and will operate into the
Federal Center. A second Flex Route will cover discontinued parts of the Route 14 between Kipling and
the Federal Center Station. The Golden Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am-8:00pm and
Saturday 8:00am-11:00pm. The base service area will cover most of the City of Golden. A Flex Route
will operate in Golden serving the Jefferson County Government Center/Golden Station, Human
Services, Colorado School of Mines, 10th & Washington and Golden High School. Other RTD services in
the areas consist of fixed route, Access-a-Ride and the new light rail.
DISCUSSION
MV Transportation currently operates Access-a-Ride services and eleven (11) other Call-n-Rides that
serve the southern and western areas of the RTD District under their existing ADA contract. MV

Packet Pg. 230

12.F

Transportation is an experienced provider in Call-n-Ride service, and in opening new services it is
imperative that our customers receive the best service possible. With the opening of the light rail,
customers will be learning a new system and these Call-n-Rides will provide an integral part of their
commute. Having an experienced Call-n-Ride provider on opening day is crucial. MV has the
additional resources to handle issues that come up with opening new services. MV Transportation
operates all the Call-n-Rides on the southeast and southwest light rail lines. Maintaining the same
contractor to operate all the Call-n-Rides in the south and west areas, allows for better transfers and
coordination among the Call-n-Rides.
Assigning the West Line Call-n-Rides to MV Transportation is in RTD’s best interest as 1) they are an
experienced Call-n-Ride provider, 2) the continued provision of these services allows for the efficient
utilization of vehicles, including spares, and allows for dependable service delivery, and 3) the provision
of these Call-n-Ride services through the existing ADA contract will enable the RTD to keep the cost at
$41.96 per revenue service hour.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the West Line Call-n-Rides services are included in the adopted 2013 RTD
budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years. The
City of Golden did receive a CMAQ grant for the Golden Call-n-Ride service. The grant funds will be
used to offset the costs of the Golden Call-n-Ride service.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to MV Transportation under their ADA contract. This is recommended
as it is in the best interest of our customer and the best use of vehicle resources.
2)
Award the contract to another ADA service provider through an existing ADA contract at
existing rates. This is not recommended as the customer would ultimately suffer because
there is no other contractor with the Call-n-Ride experience that MV Transportation offers.

Manager

Date:

Subject:

Contract Award to HNTB Corporation for
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)

Van

Meter,

Assistant

Date: January 31, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to approve a thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB
Corporation to serve as the consultant for the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) for an amount
not to exceed $2,022,091. It is further recommended that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract, staff
time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These funds will be replenished in the
2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
BACKGROUND
One year ago, when the RTD Board was considering seeking a tax increase from District voters to
accelerate the completion of the FasTracks program, it became clear that, even with additional
revenue, the completion date for the Northwest Rail would be well into the future. To address
stakeholder concerns, RTD proposed a hybrid option that would provide early implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) improvements that could address mobility needs since the completion of the rail
would be delayed.
Since the Board opted not to pursue an election, the Northwest area stakeholders have requested
that RTD evaluate a range of mobility options in the in the Northwest Area. The NAMS is RTD’s
response to that request. Specifically, the study will focus on the following elements:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
Funding for this study was established in November 2012, when the Board authorized the sale of the
air rights at Civic Center Station, and stipulated that a portion of the proceeds be used to pay for the
study.
DISCUSSION
RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) in December 2012 for consultant assist ance for this study.
A committee, comprised of representatives from RTD staff, CDOT staff and three representatives
from the local jurisdictions, reviewed proposals submitted by consultant teams in a qualifications based selection process. The evaluation considered each team’s technical proposal in the areas of

Packet Pg. 232

13.G

Key Personnel Qualifications, Project Understanding and Approach, Team Qualifications, DBE
Commitment, Schedule, and Innovation. The five proposing teams were led by the following
companies: CH2M Hill, HDR, HNTB Corporation, IBI Group, and Steer Davies Gleave. The selection
committee short-listed three teams for interviews and is now recommending that the team led by
HNTB Corporation be approved by the Board. Staff is requesting that the Board app rove this
recommendation and authorize the General Manager to negotiate a contract not to exceed
$2,022,091. Upon successful negotiations, the study will begin immediately and is expected to be
completed by early 2014.
As noted above, the study will have five key components:
1. Evaluate overall mobility options in the Northwest Area;
2. Determine how the remaining FasTracks US 36 BRT commitment will be allocated to the corridor and
determine what remaining BRT elements are needed;
3. Evaluate the feasibility and determine the cost associated with constructing the Northwest Rail Line
in segments;
4. Evaluate the possibility for extending the North Metro Rail Line to Longmont;
5. Conduct a high-level feasibility analysis of the reverse commute issues on the I-25 Downtown
Express lanes.
The NAMS was assigned a 22% Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal. HNTB has committed to
meeting this goal and conducted its own Business Outreach Open House to generate interest in teaming
opportunities for this project. Of the nine DBE firms selected for this team, four are new partners with
HNTB.
The final product of this study will be a prioritized list of improvements for the Northwest area of the
district that has the overall support of RTD, CDOT and our project stakeholders. For each improvement
on this list, the consultant team will develop base year capital and operations and maintenance (O&M)
cost estimates and conduct fatal flaw analyses of technical, financial and environmental issues related to
the improvements.
The data gathered/developed for this study will be essential in informing future RTD decisions related to
the timing for the completion of the FasTracks program that will be grounded in corridor-wide consensus
among study stakeholders. This information will help RTD evaluate future federal grant funding
opportunities, and will provide the private sector with helpful information for determining the feasibility
of future unsolicited proposals or public/private partnerships.
Once a prioritized list of improvements is developed as part of this study, including base year capital and
O&M cost estimates, RTD will then conduct financial analyses [as part of the next Annual Program
Evaluation (APE), not as part of this study], which will reflect various implementation schedules for
completing the remaining FasTracks projects (assuming no additional sales and use tax election).
Specific timing for completion of the remaining FasTracks projects will be determined by the RTD Board
of Directors through the APE process and will be presented for public comment during RTD Board
meetings in late 2013/early 2014, and through the SB 208 submittal due to DRCOG in early 2014.
It should be noted that adding or removing projects from the 2004 FasTracks program could require
approval by residents through a district-wide election, and RTD cannot include improvements that are
not part of the FasTracks program in the SB 208 report to be submitted in early 2014. However if, as
part of this study, RTD and our stakeholders gain consensus that providing cost effective mobility

Packet Pg. 233

13.G

improvements in the Northwest area would require a change to the original FasTracks plan, then RTD
staff will present the proposed change in scope to the RTD Board. If the RTD Board approves the
proposed change, then they would have the option to include the scope change in a future election, if
the RTD Board decides to pursue an election at some time in the future. RTD can also consider
submitting any new projects, not part of FasTracks, to DRCOG for inclusion in the longer-term 2040
DRCOG Metro Vision Plan, to be funded outside of FasTracks revenues.
Before any specific project can be advanced into the construction stage, additional environmental
and engineering design work (both of which will require public input) will be required.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this study is provided through the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station. The air rights
sale was completed too late for the sale proceeds and project costs to be included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, so the project funding will be provided through a transfer from the Transit Development Reserve
until the sale proceeds can be recognized in the 2013 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve a thirteen -month
professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the consultant for the
NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and it is further recommended that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the
consultant contract, staff time and specialized on-call modeling support for the NAMS. These
funds will be replenished in the 2013 Amended Budget with proceeds of the sale of the air rights
at Civic Center Station.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve a
thirteen-month professional services contract award to HNTB Corporation to serve as the
consultant for the NAMS for an amount not to exceed $2,022,091; and do not authorize the
transfer of $2.5 million from the Transit Development Reserve to fund the consultant contract
and staff time for the NAMS from funds that would be in the 2013 Amended Budget with
proceeds of the sale of the air rights at Civic Center Station.
This alternative is not
recommended because it would delay completion of this important study.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 31, 2013

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 30, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Aconex Contract Extension

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option years on the contract with Aconex, in the
total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management Software as a Service, extending the end date
of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted
Budget, and future year funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.
BACKGROUND
In April 2010, the RTD Board approved the selection of Aconex to provide an online construction and
document management system for the FasTracks Program. The approved contract was for a three year
term with four one year contract options. Aconex was selected because of its ability to easily set up
web based projects, its search capabilities and its ability to cut down on Document Control staffing
needs, all provided at a reasonable cost to the District.
DISCUSSION
Since the implementation of Aconex in 2010, RTD has been using the system on 20 projects for
FasTracks and Capital Programs. Aconex is used on these projects to manage all construction and
project documentation that is submitted from the contractor, stakeholders or RTD staff. This includes
items such as design drawings, contractor submittals, intergovernmental agreements, and required
reporting for the Federal Transit Administration and other federal agencies. RTD currently has over one
million documents stored in Aconex, and over three thousand RTD staff members, contractors and
stakeholders are using the system. In September 2011, RTD was awarded the Best Team Award from
Constructech Magazine for our use of Aconex on our FasTracks projects.
If RTD were to choose not to exercise the option years on the Aconex contract, RTD would be forced to
stand up an alternative document control system for the FasTracks program. This would require system
evaluation, implementation, configuration, testing, training, and migration of all existing documents to
the new system, which would result in considerable cost and disruption to the major construction
projects which are in progress.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost to RTD to exercise all four option years at this time is $480,000, or $120,000 per year
for four years. If RTD were to exercise each individual option year, the total cost of the contract options
would be $600,000, or $150,000 per year. Therefore, RTD would save $120,000 by exercising all four
option years at once.
Funding for this contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget. Future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to exercise the four option
years on the contract with Aconex, in the total amount of $480,000, for Construction Management
Software as a Service, extending the end date of the contract to April 2017. Funding for this
contract in 2013 is included in the 2013 Adopted Budget, and future year funding will be
appropriated on an annual basis.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Exercise the Aconex contract option years on a year by
year basis. This is not recommended because RTD will save $120,000 by exercising all four oneyear options at the same time.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not exercise any of the contract option years for
Aconex and re-solicit for a new construction and document management system. This is not
recommended due to the level of effort, cost, and disruption to ongoing RTD projects required to
implement a new system.

Board Meeting Date: February 19, 2013

Subject:

Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors support Senate
Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at or near Regional
Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators
to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter
into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require
Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private
operation under the amended legislation.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has a limited set of circumstances where it can charge patrons for parking—parking over
24 hours, parking for someone who resides outside the RTD taxing district, and reserved parking spaces
(up to 15 percent of the total number of available spaces). RTD parking facilities are broadly defined by
statute to include facilities owned, leased, or used by RTD. Some municipalities and private developers
have requested RTD’s cooperation in providing opportunities for construction of public pay parking
structures at or near mass transit stations. This could include all RTD patrons, not just those parking for
more than 24 hours or out of district riders.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s restrictions on charging for parking are adding to the challenges of implementing Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) and more specifically of developing parking structures. The language of Senate Bill
13-027 changes the current legislation to allow third parties (local jurisdictions or developers) to be able
to charge for parking for purposes of providing a revenue source for funding parking structures. RTD
would not receive the revenue from the parking fees.
There are several benefits of this bill. Local jurisdictions could facilitate better land use if third parties
construct a structure, rather than RTD building a surface parking lot. Transit patrons and other members
of the public could have more available parking spaces with this private or city involvement as uses
would not have to be clearly segregated. Finally, this bill will allow RTD to manage its resources more
efficiently if we are not expending funds for surface or structured parking.
At the present time, the current situations where the results of passage of this bill may be applicable
include the Boulder Transit Village, Olde Town Arvada TOD Pilot Project (Gold Line), the Westminster
Station (Northwest electrified segment), and the Iliff Station (I-225).
Boulder has requested that RTD enter into an IGA committing that RTD would not allow conversion of
an existing facility in the City to private operation and charges without Boulder’s concurrence. Boulder
would have a 30-day review for any proposals. RTD has two facilities that would be affected by the
proposed IGA, the Table Mesa park-n-Ride and the Tantra Drive park-n-Ride.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 250

13.I

RTD could realize savings from not needing to construct a parking lot or structure. The third parties
will be constructing the parking structures and collecting the revenues generated to offset the cost of
construction.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that
the Board of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by
third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s
lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with Board of
Directors’ intent. In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the
City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned
park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This action is not recommended because local jurisdictions
desire the ability to make good land use decisions for their communities and facilitate transit oriented
development, and this bill allows RTD the ability to manage its resources more efficiently.

DBE Committee Name Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that the Board of Directors
change the name of the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) Committee to the Civil Rights
Committee which is more inclusive and comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.
BACKGROUND
The DBE Committee is currently a standing committee, and a quorum is reached with five board
members present. The DBE Committee meets every other month to discuss the policies, procedures and
implementation of RTD’s Small and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Programs that provide outside
contracting and subcontracting opportunities for small, minority and women owned businesses. The
committee reviews the procedures of the Small Business Office (SBO), the diversity of participation on
RTD Base System and major capital projects such as FasTracks, small business advocacy, compliance
monitoring and the overall efforts of the SBO to assist the growth and development of small and
disadvantaged businesses through the implementation of various technical assistance initiatives. The
committee supports the outreach efforts of the SBO by attending community, organization and
association meetings when required. Designated members attend the quarterly Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise Advisory Committee and provide information on how to do business with RTD to the
community at-large and our Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) stakeholders and other community
partners throughout the metropolitan Denver area.
DISCUSSION
The scope of the DBE Committee has expanded beyond merely receiving reports regarding the Small
Business Office (SBO) and third party business related activities. Currently, the DBE Committee
receives reports from and provides advice on the Title VI Program, Equal Employment Opportunity
(EEO) Program, Workforce Initiative Program (WIN) and all Diversity related matters associated with
RTD’s overall Civil Rights responsibilities. The revised name better describes the role and
responsibilities of the Committee and is comprehensive enough to include future related
responsibilities that may fall under the responsibility of “Civil Rights”. Every other month, meetings
will be helpful to the Board of Directors as they make decisions for the benefit of the agency and the
public we serve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Executive Committee’s Recommended Action to change the name of the DBE
Committee to the Civil Rights Committee.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and continue with the DBE Committee as it now
stands.
