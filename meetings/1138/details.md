- Tom Grushka, RTDWatch, expressed his concerns about riders with disabilities.  He stated that in 2004 RTD had promised an increase in bus service and he wonders when they will get the service as promised.

## X. Chair's Report

- Chair Anderson announced that Director Angelina Rivera-Malpiede has been invited by the United States Department of Transportation and the American Public Transportation Association to participate in a series of conversations to discuss barriers and opportunities for elevating the importance of transportation in the Hispanic community, potential opportunities and strategies for engaging Hispanic leaders, and insights about Hispanic involvement and interests in local transportation initiatives.

Director Rivera-Malpiede joins a group of fourteen distinguished Hispanic leaders from around the country in this discussion that will likely shape national transportation policy as it relates to the Hispanic community.  The conversation series is titled, Transportation and the Hispanic Community, Challenges and Opportunities.

- Chair Anderson reported that on February 15, she and Directors Hoy, Bagley, Walker and Solano attended the Metro North Chamber Gala event.

- Chair Anderson shared that on February 19, the Board had a teambuilding session at Unser Racing.  All of the Board members were invited to attend and the Board had done its due diligence in checking with the facilities to see if everyone could participate.  They had shared they have had a number of teambuilding events for corporations and that as a “team”, there would be a role for everyone.  Some of the Directors chose not to participate.  In the future, we will look at exercises where there is a specific role for everyone.  However, the Board is focused on utilizing the talents of all its members to move this organization ahead and to set policy for the agency as we focus on the difficult transit decisions ahead.

- The joint Board-staff strategic planning advance will be on March 2.  Chair Anderson encouraged everyone to complete the survey monkey they had received from the facilitator.

- The North Metro Line tour will be February 26 starting at 2:00 p.m.

Chair Anderson requested General Manager Washington to provide his report.

## XI. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington shared that this agency’s number 1 priority is safety.  He updated the Board on the issue that had happened that morning around 6:18 a.m. where a bus driver entered northbound on southbound I-25.  He indicated they had been investigating this issue.  Some of the confusion had to do with detour signage around the 19 street entrance indicating the HOV lane was closed.  They have performed their usual process of testing the operating and putting the driver out of service until this investigation is complete.  The training department will continue to re-emphasize safety first.

- General Manager Washington indicated RTD had been invited to a groundbreaking of the University Station Apartment on February 26.

- General Manager Washington indicated the I-225 groundbreaking will be March 1 at the site of the future Aurora Station north of Centerpoint and Sable.  Many dignitaries are expected to be there including a special invitation that he had extended to the highest ranking Major General in this area who was involved in the Veterans Hospital.  The I-225 opening will be a gateway for Veterans across several states who will utilize the Veteran’s Hospital.

- General Manager Washington indicated that he had sent an email response to the editor of the Denver Post addressing specifically the question from the editorial in the Denver Post on 2/18/13 raising the question “how well are they doing at meeting the needs of disabled customers they're elected to serve?  General Manager Washington provided these few examples:

o        RTD was the first major transit agency in the nation to offer wheelchair lifts on 100 percent of its bus fleet, well ahead of the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA).

o        RTD pioneered the access-a-Cab program for the metro area, greatly expanding the on-demand service available to the disability community.

o        The Denver area is ranked as one of the nation’s most accessible metro areas for persons with disabilities, due in large part to RTD’s transit services.

o        The Denver Post just ran a story last month noting how RTD’s contractor for the East Rail Line serving DIA had solicited and listened to recommendations from an individual with disabilities who had asked for modifications to the wheelchair passenger area on the rail vehicles being built for that line.  Under RTD’s direction, those modifications are being made.

o        RTD’s rail fleet is fully equipped with automatic stop announcement systems, and the full bus fleet will have that installation completed later this year.

o        RTD carried over 700,000 passengers last year aboard our access-a-Ride service, which is provided for persons with disabilities too severe to use our regular lift-equipped service.

o        The access-a-Ride service has an on-time performance rate of 96 percent, significantly exceeding the national average, and at least equal to RTD’s stellar on-time performance record for our light rail system.

o        In compliance with ADA regulations, there wasn’t a single access-a-Ride trip denial in 2012.

o        RTD works with the disability community in a number of different ways.  Several RTD staff members participate on the DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, which also includes individuals with disabilities and staff members from several cities and disability advocacy groups.  The goal of the task force is to identify and work to remove barriers for Access-a-Ride passengers so that they feel comfortable using RTD fixed-route services.

o        The RTD Bus Operator Training Department schedules regular outings for bus operator trainees at places like Craig Hospital, a local MS Center, and the Colorado Center for the Blind.  The training staff also works with local high schools and individuals that need one-on-one training on boarding and riding RTD buses.  Disability awareness training is part of the on-going bus operator training at RTD and our private contractors and is a topic of RTD refresher training and private contractor monthly operator safety meetings.

o        RTD has an active ADA Customer Service panel that includes disabled fixed-route and Access-a-Ride passengers that meets on a regular basis to address ADA-related issues.

o        RTD has an active ADA Committee comprised of RTD staff members from a wide range of RTD departments that meets as needed to address ADA-related issues.

o        RTD has consistently received awards and accolades from the disabled community regarding our services and programs.

- General Manager Washington indicated they are still performing the West Corridor integrated testing.  They are expecting on March 1 to turn this over to operations.  People will see more trains going up and down that corridor as part of this process.  He has asked the West Corridor PI team to come to the next FasTracks Monitoring Committee to brief on the status.

## XII. Unanimous Consent

Vote on

### A. Approval of Additional Risk Allocation Matrix Items to Fund North Metro to 72nd

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors direct staff to move forward with implementation of the following additional Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) items and to use the financing capacity generated by these items to accelerate construction of the North Metro Rail Line (NMRL) from Denver Union Station (DUS) to 72nd Avenue.

Specifically, it is recommended that staff move forward with the following activities:

- Refinancing three RTD debt issues at lower than current rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR;

- Issuing debt to bridge the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) for the Eagle project at a lower interest rate than previously assumed, saving interest costs and preserving additional capacity under Colorado’s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR);

- Issuing sales tax revenue bonds in 3rd Quarter, 2013 to finance remaining portion of the DUS to 72nd Avenue segment;

- Initiating procurement for construction (Request for Proposals) of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue in the next ten months.

Approval of the opportunities listed above will allow RTD to take advantage of the low interest rates that financial markets are currently offering to accelerate the completion of the NMRL to 72nd Avenue. This action will not impact the availability of funding from previously-approved RAM items.

### B. Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract amendment with MV Public Transportation for the provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public Transportation ADA contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9) month period from April 2013 through December 2013.  The cost for the Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to exceed amount will be $710,806.  These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated as “pass through” expenses.

## XIII. Recommended Action

- Item C which was moved to recommended action became item G, April 2013 Service Changes.

### G. April 2013 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:                 Director Hoy made the motion to approve the April 2013    Service Changes.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Director Menten shared that she has received several

complaints from her constituents.  She will be voting no while she has a chance to explore these concerns.

Director Folska commented that we really need to understand how many of the people will be stranded without access to the feeder bus service.

Director Daly commented that the April 2013 Service Changes that they are being asked to approve is different from the West corridor plan that was approved in October.  Most of the changes on this April report are seasonal in nature.

Director Menten indicated these changes create quality of life issues especially for the senior citizens.  They estimate it will add about 175 hours to their travel to work.

GM Washington reminded the Board that the West corridor plan has already been approved.  We do these changes about 3 times a year and there will be opportunity to adjust or change if needed.  Director Bagley reiterated these were minor changes and do not affect the West Corridor.

Director Deadwyler shared from her own personal experience and stated they will be an opportunity to meet with the community and staff if changes are needed.  She did so and they made a change to one of her routes.  The process does work. Director Rivera-Malpiede agreed this is a fluid process and it is important to get with staff and your community to discuss the needs.

### J. Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors support Senate Bill 13-027, concerning the provision of parking facilities by third parties at or near Regional Transportation District mass transit stations, and allow RTD’s lobbyists and staff to work with legislators to make any amendments consistent with the Board of Directors’ intent.  In addition, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder (Boulder) that would require Boulder’s concurrence before any existing RTD owned park-n-Ride could be sold or leased for private operation under the amended legislation.

Chair Anderson called for a motion to approve Item J, Senate Bill 13-027 Board Action

Motion:              Director Daly made the motion to approve item J, Senate Bill 13-027 Board action.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              General Counsel Marla Lien was asked to explain the City of Boulder issues and concerns.  Marla Lien stated that Boulder was concerned about its existing Park-n-Rides.  The City wanted an IGA stating that RTD would not convert existing Park-n-Rides to pay parking without Boulder’s agreement and RTD has agreed to this.

Director Menten commented that she had heard from a number of people in Aurora that they had voted down this initiative on the ballot and they  perceive it is a back door effort to get this approved.

Director Lubow asked about an amendment and Marla Lien responded the amendment was about the intent which is part of the bill.  There has been some discussion but no new amendment has been introduced.

Director Lubow expressed she would feel better if there were some elements of guarantee.  Legal Counsel Lien stated there are no guarantees.

Director Deadwyler expressed her concerns that there need to be some form of guidelines.  She would not be voting for the charging of fees.

Director Folska indicated she had testified on this issue last week.  When she looks at the initiatives under the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) which was recently approved, one of the opportunities is for a monetization of our parking fees.  All this bill does is open up that opportunity but it does not mean necessarily that we will charge.

Director Daly provided an update that the bill was laid over in the Senate to a future date.

Director Lasater commented that the Board should consider immediately an ad hoc committee to put forward some foundational dialogue around this bill.  We need to be proactive rather than reactive.  He also shared that someone had asked the question, “Is RTD an elected body?  If so, they should take care of their own directives on this issue.

Director Sisk stated we should be explicit in our relationships with the respective municipalities.  Parking for customers at a reasonable price does not drive customers out.  RTD need to work with its fellow constituents on this issue.

Director Walker indicated he will support this bill as it allows staff and lobbyists to help shape this bill.

Director Folska made reference to “free rider effect” and noted that some people who are parking free are actually passing the cost to others.  We need to be innovative in regard to our practice and that this is consistent with the Eagle P-3 process of putting user fees where they belong.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated she agreed with the need for an ad-hoc committee and if that is done she would like to see representation from our most vulnerable communities.

Director James stated that he sees this as movement of controls-these are small movements but allows freedom for municipalities and private companies to manage parking more cost effectively.

Director Bagley asked if there was an IGA with Boulder.  Marla Lien indicated the IGA was a separate document.  Bagley stated this is his point that any local government can establish a subsidiary agreement if merited.

General Manager Washington reflected that today approximately 13% of the RTD ridership actually park.  The majority of them use the feeder service.

Chair Anderson indicated she will support this as another tool in our toolbox to work with our partners.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 14 in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Menten, Daly, Hoy, James, Lubow, Rivera-Malpiede,  Folska, Lasater, Sisk, Tobiassen, Solano and Walker) and 1 opposed (Deadwyler).

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

### K. DBE Committee Name Change

It is recommended by the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Committee that the Board of Directors change the name of the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) Committee to the Civil Rights Committee which is more inclusive and comprehensive in scope and responsibilities.

Chair Anderson asked for a motion to approve item K, DBE Committee Name Change

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to approve DBE Committee name change.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Vote on

Motion:              The motion passed with 13 in favor (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Deadwyler, Hoy, James, Lubow, Menten, Rivera-Malpiede, Folska, Sisk, Tobiassen and Walker).  Director Lasater had left the room and Director Solano abstained.

Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

## XV. New Business

Director Folska reflected on the commitment of the people.  She stated that she is aware how hard staff works to provide service to people of disability.  She believes however, that the Board and leadership should participate in a sensitivity leadership training.  She referenced an email that she had received from someone in Director Menten’s district and asked Director Lubow to read the email aloud.

Director Deadwyler commented about the article in the editorial and the comments that were made at the Board meeting earlier on exclusion of the disabled to the teambuilding session.  She commented that the articles failed to note that she participated in the event and that she is also disabled.  However, she prefers not to go around highlighting this fact but to focus on what she can do and how she can contribute as a member of the team.  Teambuilding requires different folks to play different roles.  Just as the body has many members, they each play integral roles (i.e. toe,  eye, ear, feet).  If the news is to be reported, it should be reported correctly.  Coming to this teambuilding session was an option.  She has been asking for a teambuilding session for over 2 years and she was happy to participate.  The purpose of the teambuilding session was to improve relationships between the Board members so that they can focus on working together to move the RTD business forward.  It was not personal nor was it intended to be personal.  As a matter of fact, the Board office had done due diligence in working with Unser to make sure everyone could participate.  At the event itself, they had randomly assigned positions and had called on Claudia to be the team captain who focuses on strategy.  She had elected not to be present.

Director Folska stated she found Director Deadwyler’s remarks encouraging and that she made a valid point.  She indicated there are visible and hidden disabilities and that her disability is visible.  She was offended by this teambuilding session just as the Chair might be if they had selected to do rock climbing because of her age.

Director Lubow commented she  is looking forward to the next teambuilding session.

Director Sisk requested if the Executive Session could be removed from the agenda if one is not scheduled.  Paula Perdue reminded him this serves as a placeholder as defined in the Board Bylaws.

## XVII. Adjourn
