Consulting Services-Geographical Information Systems
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to award
a contract amendment to initiate the second-year option with Idea Integration
incrementally increasing the limit to $891,600 to extend the contract for Consulting
Services and part-time GIS programming services-Geographical Information Systems
(16DK006). This contract was originally awarded in 2006 to Idea integration through
the competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial year plus two one-year
options to renew based on positive performance by the vendor. The second one year
option is to begin on September 1, 2008 and remain in effect for one year until August
31, 2009. The annual limit is not to exceed $308,480.

Directors provide direction to the General Manager to submit the Gold Line Corridor,
East Corridor and the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility projects for approval to enter
into FTA’s New Starts program by September 5, 2008. Submitting these applications
will not preclude the RTD Board of Directors from making any future decisions
concerning the implementation of the overall FasTracks program.

D.

2009 Fare Policy Public Input Process
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that RTD staff be
directed to solicit public input regarding staff recommended changes to RTD fare policy.
The recommended changes would increase cash fares for local, express, regional and
skyRide service by approximately 14 percent and would also include corresponding
increases in other multi-ride tickets and passes. Following consideration of public input,
staff is further directed to present a final recommendation to the RTD Board not later
than the regularly scheduled Board meeting in October.
