#### 1. Option to Purchase Real Property at 2907-2915 Welton Street

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary for the grant of an option, and for the sale of the real property located at 2907-2915 Welton Street, Denver Colorado (the “Property”), including execution of any deeds and other property conveyance documents.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20th Board Meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development, stated that staff had discussed this item in detail with the Board at the November 1, 2016, committee meeting.  She noted that Director Francone’s questions about maintenance was addressed in the new Board Report under Financial Impact and the questions about ground leasing by Directors Sisk and Deadwyler are covered in the attached memo.  She added that staff is attempting to balance two policy goals, including RTD’s policy for fiscal sustainability.  She commented that the City and County of Denver supports this project and has offered RTD substantial gap financing to support a development on the 29th and Welton site.  In order to exercise the option and complete the purchase, the following conditions must be met:

Successful procurement of a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium project according to the terms agreed upon by RTD and the city.  The selected developer will need to reach an agreement on business terms with the city.The selected developer will need to secure the financing necessary to complete the project.

Director Francone asked why the City and County of Denver has the right to assign the option to the selected developer.

Kate Iverson stated that since the City and County of Denver will be paying RTD fair market value for the land, the agreement staff has negotiated stated that the City will discuss with the developer the amount of subsidy that may be needed.  She noted that staff anticipates that the City will lead the Request for Proposal (RFP) and procurement processes.

Director Francone commented that the property should be sold directly to the City and County of Denver so that the city can do what they want with the property.

Committee Chair James stated the transaction is organized so that the title would pass through the City and County of Denver.

Director Lubow asked about the letter from Mayor Hancock, and what exactly was meant by the substantial gap financing.

Kate Iverson said staff’s initial analysis shows that number could vary, but it could be in the range of $2 to $3 million.

Director Menten remarked that she is in favor of selling the property, but she does not like the limit of only being able to sell it to the City of Denver.  She said it should be sold on the open market to the highest bidder.

Director Sisk asked staff to include bullet points at the Board Meeting to define what is being discussed here.

Committee Chair James stated that staff is asking the Board to approve the execution of an option, and, under certain conditions, complete a sale transaction.

Chair Tobiassen noted one issue is gentrification in neighborhoods where RTD has invested in infrastructure.  He said this is a good opportunity, and the City of Denver has come up with an option to keep people in their neighborhoods.

Director Solano commented that the Board needs to find a way to slow down gentrification.  He noted he will support this item if the City of Denver has approved this plan.

Director Deadwyler stated she has mixed feelings on this item, but she agrees that people who live in this neighborhood need to be able to buy in this neighborhood.  She remarked that even though this is labeled as affordable housing, it is still expensive.  She added that RTD should keep the property to use it for a continuous revenue stream instead of selling it for a one-time payment.

Director Anderson commented that this is a very small piece of property and the report last month was very informative.  She added that the City of Denver has worked in this area for a long time to provide more affordable housing options and she is happy to partner with them.

Director Folska asked if the units will be owner occupied.

Kate Iverson explained that the intent for the units is that they will be owner occupied, with an estimated 52 units.

Director Folska inquired as to what percentage of the units would be classified as affordable.

Kate Iverson said staff could determine a number and define a percentage of units within the resolution that would be labeled affordable.

Director Deadwyler stated that most likely the affordable housing units would only be 10% of the total units.  She commented if there will be 52 units, as staff has previously estimated, only 5 of those would be available as affordable housing units.

Director Hoy noted that the Board’s goal should be to sell the property and use those funds to move people from point A to point B.

Committee Chair James asked staff to speak with the City and County of Denver to specify the commitment of affordable housing units.

Director Lubow remarked that one of the reasons the Board is discussing this is to improve the areas where RTD has installed transit.  She said a big component of this plan is to offer affordable housing and, if the affordable units are minimal in comparison to the overall number, that would not suffice.

Director Bagley explained that staff is discussing getting an appraisal for this property.  He said if the Board constraints the property to 50% affordable housing, the property value will drop significantly.  He added that the land size is only 19,000 square feet, which is quite small.

Director Walker stated he is in favor of letting the City and County of Denver determine the numbers and market for affordable housing.

Director Anderson indicated she would be voting yes for this item.

Director Deadwyler stated she would be voting no for this item.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. 2016 - 024 : Parking Guiding Principles

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached parking guiding principles resolution to provide policy direction to RTD staff on parking related issues moving forward.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016, Board Meeting.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Communities, commented that this item was discussed at length with the Board last month.  He noted the Resolution was the same as the one presented in November and asked if there were any questions.

Committee Chair James noted there were no questions and asked for a vote.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Platte Division Zoning and Land Value

Bill Sirois stated that staff was asked to look at the value of the Platte property in relation to the City and County of Denver’s rezoning.  On September 19, 2016, the Denver City Council adopted the 38th and Blake Station Area Height Amendments.  The amendments allow for greater minimum and maximum height at several properties northeast of 31st Street.  The area was rezoned from light industrial use to a form-based code base height of 8 stories to an incentive height of 12 stories.  He noted that based on comparable property values, Platte Division’s value for sale or ground-lease could range from $82 million to $132 million.  He added that selling or ground-leasing RTD’s property would require replacing the bus-maintenance and operations services, and replacement costs would be between $80 to $120 million, excluding land costs.

Director Bagley said he wanted the Board to be aware of what is happening around this property, but he does not think RTD needs to pursue any additional actions.

#### 2. 16th Street Mall

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, reminded the Board that staff provided an update during the November 1, 2016, meeting and indicated that the technical working group did not come up with a consensus on the transit way design.  He stated that RTD’s focus remains on the transit way surface, not the full mall reconfiguration and added that RTD’s priority is to maintain the 16th Street Mall Shuttle Operations, as well as safety for our passengers.

Director Francone asked what the split was between the surface area for the totality of the mall.

Bill Van Meter indicated 25% to 30% is transit way and the rest is pedestrian.

Director Lubow stated that the transit way needs to be analyzed, not the entire configuration of the mall.

General Manager Genova commented that there is only so much funding available that RTD would be able to commit to.  He added that the conceptual cost estimates for a major reconfiguration would be very expensive.

Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, said RTD has $10 million from one grant, and $5 million from another, and that would be all that RTD could contribute towards a reconstruction effort.  She added that the technical working group could not reach a consensus and it is in RTD’s interest to get through the environmental process in order to move forward.

Director Solano commented that staff discussed issues raised by the historical society a year ago.  He asked if they could deter RTD’s plans for the mall.

Susan Wood stated that the historical society is very vocal.  They have a large presence, but they are only one voice.  She stated that RTD must go through a cultural resources process, and they could impact us by slowing that process down.

Director Walker said 80% of RTD’s customers use the sidewalks in order to get to the bus.  He remarked that we need to look at this as a partnership with the City and County of Denver.

Chair Tobiassen asked if the $700,000 study would make the project ready to go.

Bill Van Meter said that it would get us all the way through some design work, but it would not include the final design.  He noted that the final design would be eligible for federal grant reimbursement.

Chair Tobiassen remarked that our federal lobbyists said that there is a possibility that the new presidential administration will make a large infrastructure push.  He stated that it would be beneficial to RTD if the project were ready to go.

Director Menten commented that RTD is spending a lot of money for such a small stretch of road.

### D. Other Matters

Director Menten inquired about the status of the garage on Ringsby that is planned to be torn down.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that as of now, the building will be repurposed for facilities maintenance.

Committee Chair James said this will be his last opportunity to chair this committee and he has been honored to lead the committee.  He stated that this committee has always partnered with FasTracks and that next year the two will be consolidated to Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 9:15 p.m.
