Re:

June Board Update

The General Assembly concluded its work on May 9th. The Governor is on the 30-day clock to
sign or veto all legislation passed during the 2018 legislative session. SB18-001 will be signed
this Thursday, May 31st in Loveland at 10:50 am.
BBMK tracked many bills of interest to the District throughout the legislative session but in the
waning days both SB18-204 and HB18-1401 concerning RTD’s fare programs were
defeated. The low-income fare program will likely continue to be of interest to legislators in the
2019 legislative session, and BBMK will continue to work with legislators to educate them on
our efforts regarding these important issues.
BBMK will monitor all the upcoming interim committee meetings. TLRC will convene on
August 20th, 9:00 am in Room 271 and again on September 28th, 9:00 am in Room 271. BBMK
will forward the agenda for these meetings once they are posted. Another interim committee of
interest, which BBMK will keep the Board updated on, is the Alternative to the Gallagher
Amendment Interim Study Committee.
BBMK is monitoring two transportation ballot initiatives filed by the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce and the Independence Institute. Each initiative must submit 98,492 signatures by
August 6th at 3:00 pm to move forward.
•

Chamber Ballot Initiative- #18 Increase State Sales Tax to Fund Transportation
(statutory) – seeks to increase state sales tax to for 20 years beginning in 2018 from 2.9%
to 3.52% and to credit 35% of the net revenue to the highway users tax fund and the
remaining 30% of net revenue to the multimodal transportation options fund, and other
transportation funding.

•

Independence Institute Ballot Initiative- #167 Authorize Bonds for Transportation
Projects (statutory) – seeks to create a “Fix Our Damn Roads” Act that requires the
Department of Transportation to issue revenue anticipation notes in a maximum amount
of $3.5 billion dollars with a maximum repayment cost of $5.2 billion and requires the
department to use the proceeds for specific transportation projects.

Federal Update

Congress Considers FY 2019 Transportation Appropriations
The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have begun consideration of FY 2019
appropriations to fund transportation programs and the Department of Transportation (US DOT)
for the fiscal year beginning on October 1.
The House Appropriations Committee approved the House’s FY 2019 Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development (THUD) appropriations bill last week. While it is unclear when the House will
consider the THUD bill on the Floor, the full House is expected to begin Floor consideration of FY
2019 appropriations legislation with three relatively non-controversial bills (Energy-Water,
Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs) when House Members return the
week of June 4, after their Memorial Day recess.
On the Senate side, the Senate Appropriations THUD Subcommittee has held hearings to examine
the President’s FY 2019 Budget Request and various Federal transportation programs, and the
Committee is expected to consider its own FY 2019 transportation spending bill during the week of
June 4.
House Spending Bill Includes Significant Increases for Infrastructure
The House THUD bill includes an increase in funding of about $10 billion, relative to FY 2017, for
a wide range of transportation and infrastructure programs, similar to the increase included in FY
2018.


Transit Formula Funding: The House also provides $800 million above FAST Act
authorized levels for Federal Transit Administration (FTA) formula programs. This
includes: $300 million for competitive bus grants; $50 million for competitive low- and noemission bus grants; $50 million for Section 5311 rural formula grants; $200 million for

47 Offices in 20 Countries
Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP is part of the international legal practice Squire Patton Boggs, which operates worldwide through a number of separate
legal entities.



TIGER/BUILD Grant Funding: The House also provides $750 million for the
TIGER/BUILD grant program, a significant decrease from the $1.5 billion provided in FY
2018, yet well above the $500 million usually provided for TIGER in prior year spending
bills.



CIG Funding: The House THUD bill provides $2.61 billion for the Capital Investment
Grant (CIG) program, an increase above the $2.3 billion FAST Act-authorized level.

US DOT Continues to Publish Grant NOFOs as Congress Presses the Agency to Release
Transportation Funding
US DOT continues to publish notices of funding opportunity (NOFOs) for transportation grant
programs, recently publishing a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) planning grant NOFO which
follows the recent NOFOs for the TIGER/BUILD grant program and the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program.
Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) recently released NOFOs for its FY 2018 Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP)
and Intercity Bus Security Grant Program (IBSGP). These grants provide funding to public
transportation providers for security enhancements to protect critical transportation infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Congress continues to press US DOT during Congressional hearings to release
transportation-related funding through the CIG grant program and other discretionary grant
programs. The House Appropriations Committee also included in its FY 2019 spending bill several
deadlines for releasing NOFOs, when applications must be due, and when awards must be
announced for discretionary grant programs.
Chairman Shuster to Develop Infrastructure Proposal Before Year’s End
House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) is retiring
at the end of this year, but he is planning to release an infrastructure proposal this summer before he
retires. What exactly the infrastructure proposal will look like is unclear, and it could be an
infrastructure bill or a framework of infrastructure principles and priorities; this could be a bipartisan
proposal, as Chairman Shuster has been working on it with the Ranking Democrat of the T&I
Committee, Peter DeFazio (D-OR).
The T&I Committee has been soliciting policy ideas and priorities from Committee members and
will likely release the infrastructure proposal in the coming months. Representative Sam Graves (RMO), Chairman of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee who is seeking the T&I Committee
Chairmanship when Chairman Shuster retires, recently said the Committee will focus on the
proposal after the August recess. Importantly, the proposal will reportedly include principles or
policy ideas that are outside of the T&I Committee’s jurisdiction, most notably a revenue solution
for Federal surface transportation programs, such as a Federal gas tax increase that is the jurisdiction
of the Ways and Means Committee.

Section 5337 state of good repair formula grants; $50 million for Section 5304(d) highdensity formula grants; and $150 million for Section 5338 urbanized area formula grants.

1.C.3.a

Chairman Shuster, who was unable to secure House GOP support for major changes to air traffic
control in his Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, may be looking for a legacy bill
before his retirement. An infrastructure bill that calls for a significant Federal gas tax increase could
solve a significant and longstanding but politically difficult revenue problem – one which the
outgoing Chairman of the transportation committee is well-situated to address.
Stakeholders Awaiting US DOT Guidance on RRIF Loan Cohorts
Attachment: Federal Update 5 29 2018 (3487 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

RTD was successful in securing language in the FY 2018 transportation spending bill requiring US
DOT to define loan cohorts as a single fiscal year and then begin refunding loan subsidies (called
credit risk premiums or CRPs) to borrowers in each loan cohort for which all debts have been
satisfied. US DOT was required to issue such guidance defining loan cohorts – the first step in the
credit risk premium refund process – within 120 days of the March 23, 2018, spending bill.
However, the guidance has not yet been released.
While the RRIF loan secured by the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) has been
repaid in full, there are a few remaining hurdles to repayment of the nearly $29 million CRP on the
loan, chiefly that the other loan in what will likely be a FY 2010 cohort is still in repayment. Squire
Patton Boggs continues to work with US DOT and the Senate Transportation/HUD
Appropriations Subcommittee to address these hurdles and secure repayment of the DUSPA CRP
as soon as possible, consistent with current law.
