## V. Public Participation

- Cesar Gebert spoke about the dynamics of people living in poverty.  He stated 68% of people living in poverty cannot use the transit system; 80% of women are in poverty because they had to leave an abusive relationship; they do not have the money to take bus and light rail back and forth.  RTD needs to consider a pilot on income based fares.

- Kevin Kelly, Glendale, spoke about affordable income based bus passes.  He shared that He works with affordable housing and many of the residents miss job opportunities because they cannot afford bus or LRT passes.

- Andrea Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, advocate for affordable transportation, shared a story she has heard from homeless families at the Gathering Place and Praxis.   She has heard about young homeless children who could not pay their fares and have gotten tickets.  She plans to bring some of these kids to the Board meeting next month where we can hear from them directly.

- Brian Moss, Westwood Highlands Neighborhood, spoke for the people struggling to recreate their lives from tragedy or loss of hope.  They have a peer program to create a positive life experience so these residents can move forward.  There is a high reliance on public transit to get around town or to seek employment.  This has a great impact on the community and creates concerns about safety.

- Julie Bennett from the Delores Project shared that she lives in a homeless shelter. She is awaiting housing.  However, once she is in her home, this will cause a transportation issue as currently the shelter provides them with passes to get from point to point.  Once n her own space, she will have to figure out how to come up with bus fare from her meager allowance.  She knows of stories where people have walked 7-20 miles to get to the Gathering Place.

- David Rothenberg lives near Garrison Station.  He reported graffiti along the line in at least 18 different parts.  He has reported this issue to the City of Lakewood and RTD.  He has taken pictures, talked to security and even call the RTD TIC line, all without prevail. They were promised that graffiti would be removed within 24 hours.  Some of this graffiti has been around for a year.

- Debra Burns shared she lives in housing provided by the shelter.  33% of her income is spent for housing. She cannot afford the transportation costs to get to supervision, doctor visits, dentist, schools, etc. The Healthcare Act does not include the cost of transportation.

- Miriam Alvarez from the Westwood area is looking for more affordable transportation rates. She stated that she has heard that RTD wants to increase fares.  This would not be good for her community where she lives.  She has 4 kids, 2 in high school and 2 in elementary.  She already spends lots on transportation to provide better educational opportunities for her children. With the cost of transportation, she may be better off saving for a car to drive.
