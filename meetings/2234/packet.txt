6.A

Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the January 20, 2015 Board
Meeting.

Discussion:

Nadine Lee, US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project Manager,
stated that this action relates to the nomenclature for each
boarding area as well as two potential name changes along the
US 36 BRT Line. She said that the first component requests
that boarding areas be referred to as “stations”. This follows
RTD’s naming philosophy of all other high capacity corridors
while “stops” are typically used along services like local bus
routes. She noted that the second part requesting renaming
two stations is to provide clarity. There is a Westminster
station planned along the Northwest Rail Line so changing the
current US 36 • Westminster Center station to US 36 •
Sheridan station prevents confusion. Additionally, there are
several Park-n-Rides along Table Mesa. Renaming this station
to include US 36 clarifies that this is the BRT station.
Nadine Lee explained that this recommendation was being
brought to the Board now so that they could proceed with
sign fabrication, providing enough lead time for the fabrication
to be done by opening day. She noted that this action has no
financial impact; the project budget already includes funding to
fabricate the signs. The only impact would be if signs had to
be re-printed at a later date.
Nadine Lee stated that staff has presented this to stakeholders
and received a general consensus and support for the
proposal.
Committee Chair Hoy noted that he confirmed with the City of
Westminster that they were supportive of the renaming of
their station.
Chair Sisk thanked Nadine Lee, Rick Clarke, Assistant General
Manager of Capital Programs, and Chris Quinn, Planning
Project Manager, for their efforts in working with the
stakeholders to form a consensus. He reiterated how
important it is for RTD to continue to build trust with our
stakeholders on all our projects.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

C. Updates
Nadine Lee reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that is
available in the January 6, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet. She also provided a US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Reference
Guide. She explained that the reference guide provides important
background information on the project as well as highlighting some major
features. Nadine Lee offered to meet with any Board member that would
like to review the project in greater detail.
Nadine Lee outlined the notable US 36 BRT/Express Lanes Progress as
follows:
 Phase I (Federal Blvd to 88th Street)
o Over 86% complete
o 6 bridges complete
o Eastbound mainline paving and slip ramps complete
o Eastbound Broomfield platform complete
 Phase II (88th Street to Table Mesa)
o Over 44% complete
 Programmatic BRT Activities
o Branding identity complete – Flatiron Flyer
o Issued Notice to Proceed for opening day vehicle procurement
Committee Chair Hoy commented that the Board should be very pleased that
Nadine Lee is working on this project. He said she does such an amazing
job though her enthusiasm and dedication to working with the stakeholders.
He thanked her for all her hard work.
Chair Sisk extended his appreciation to the entire project team. He shared
that he just attended a US 36 Commuting Solutions breakfast at which
General Manager Washington gave a very informative presentation. He said
that people are very excited about what is happening; the thought of having
US 36 BRT in operation this year is pretty amazing.
Chair Sisk indicated that he is often asked when there will be a switch from
HOV2+ to HOV3+. He recognizes this is a CDOT question but hopes it

can be something RTD begins to educate the stakeholders about with
CDOT’s assistance. Nadine Lee stated that the change will happen by 2017
at the latest but she did not have an exact date.

Director Bagley pointed out that the intersection at US 36 and McCaslin
Boulevard will be a diverging diamond interchange. This type of interchange
is different than any other interchange in the RTD system as well as the first
of its kind in the region. He thinks it might be worthwhile for the Board to
have another presentation about how the interchange works. Nadine Lee
shared that there is a fact sheet that was prepared by CDOT as well as a
video. She said she will get the Board some additional information.
General Manager Washington stated that a Request for Qualifications (RFQ)
has been issued for custom buses that better meet the criteria for true BRT
(i.e. low floor, two doors, quick loading, etc.); RTD received five proposals
that are currently in the review process. He said that staff would keep the
Board updated on the process and if any Requests for Proposals (RFPs) are
issued.
General Manager Washington commented that another important piece of
the project is the education and outreach that CDOT will be doing in
conjunction with RTD. He said the Board would begin to see these activities
in the coming months.
General Manager Washington noted that the last piece staff was working on
was the Grand Opening of the BRT with CDOT. He explained that RTD will
have the buses in October, 2015, but Phase II of the managed lanes will not
yet be complete. He shared that he recognizes that CDOT wants to have a
Grand Opening but it does not make sense for RTD to be running the BRT
buses for two or three months and then have the Grand Opening. He
recognized that it will be important for RTD to coordinate this with CDOT
and the contractor.

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 6, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Sisk inquired if the canopies at the stations would have real time
information. Nadine Lee said that each station has a programmable display
that will have the schedule information on opening day. General Manager
Washington explained that the infrastructure at the stations will be in place
for real time information as soon as the technology becomes available.

B. Recommended Actions

• Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at Yale Station
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384
square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County
of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or
$18.79 per square foot.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property. Susan
Altes pointed out that the property in discussion is a remnant

Director Folska noted that the land was acquired through
eminent domain. She wondered if RTD needed to give the
right of refusal to the previous owner. Susan Altes replied
that was not part of the eminent domain law.
Director Hoy said that the $26,000 proceeds from the sale
would be shared with the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT). He asked if RTD’s $13,000 proceeds
could be allocated, for example, to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) or if the funds had to be allocated
somewhere specific. Phil Washington, General Manager noted
that the funds would probably have to go back to the general
fund since they originally were a Federal grant for the T-Rex
project. Marla Lien, General Counsel, added that some
amount of the proceeds would have to be set off against a
future grant. Susan Altes said that RTD would have to check
with the Colorado Division of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) since they managed the T-Rex project.
Director Bagley asked why the land was not included in the
original T-Rex design. Rick Clarke explained that the land was
not usable but RTD had to buy the property as a whole. He
noted that it is not uncommon to have small areas that end up
unusable during these types of projects. Director Bagley
clarified that when the Yale Park-n-Ride was designed it was
known that this part of the property would not be usable.
Rick Clarke agreed and added that RTD was very lucky that
someone was interested in the property.
Director Walker pointed out that this was a lot line adjustment.
Committee Chair James asked what the buyer intends to do
with the property. Susan Altes replied that they plan to use
this area as the property’s entrance.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 6, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

of the Yale Park-n-Ride. The property sits west of the Park-nRide wall. The property boundary was uneven but the wall
was built straight. The owner of the land west to the property
intends on building a 66 unit affordable housing building. The
property was appraised in November, 2014 at $18.79 per
square foot. No other parties have shown interest in acquiring
the land.

C. Updates

• Local Government Update - CRL Associates
Roger Sherman from CRL Associates congratulated Directors Archuleta and
Francone on their installation to the RTD Board of Directors. He also
congratulated the newly elected Executive Committee.
Roger Sherman noted that December is a quiet month in the local
governments. He said that the Denver Metro Mayor Caucus will have their
retreat on Saturday, January 10, in Boulder. CRL Associates will attend the
first half as the caucus does business behind closed doors during the second
half.
Roger Sherman announced that his team is working on setting one on one
meetings with the two new Adams County Commissioners and two new
mayors: Clint Folsom, Superior, and Laura Christman, Cherry Hills Village. He
added that the Metro Area County Commissioners meeting is on January 23.

Director Menten asked for more details on the Metro Area County
Commissioners meeting. Roger Sherman replied that it will be held on
January 23. He will communicate further details with the Board as they
become available.

• State Legislative Update

Sherry Ellebracht pointed out that the Brandeberry~McKenna team will
focus their efforts during the beginning of the session on setting meetings
between the Directors and the Legislative leadership as well as new
legislators. She said that currently there are no bills of great importance for
RTD.
Committee Chair Folska pointed out that some bills, like red light cameras
and sources of funding, have unintended impacts on RTD operations. She
asked if there was a way for RTD to participate in education and support of
bills that may have an unintended impact on RTD. Committee Chair Folska
acknowledged that identifying these types of bills could be tough. Sherry
Ellebracht replied that all bills that may have any impact on RTD are
monitored closely. If a bill may have a fiscal impact, RTD replies to the
legislature and/or committees via email. She added that staff could keep the
Board updated on these types of communications.
Phil Washington, General Manager, pointed out that Shailen Bhatt will be
installed in February as the new Executive Director for the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT). Staff will invite Mr. Bhatt to meet
the Board and to continue working closely with RTD.
Committee Chair Folska said that Jackie Millet, Chair of the Denver Regional
Council of Governments, mentioned a tour done a few years ago with the
RTD Directors and the CDOT Commissioners. Jackie Millet suggested this
as an event to welcome Mr. Bhatt.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Senior Policy Analyst at Squire Patton Boggs, said that during the
end of the 2014 session Congress passed all appropriation bills except for
Homeland Security. He noted that the New Starts was funded $2 billion
more than last year, assuring that RTD’s FasTrack will get the recommended
funding level of $150 million for fiscal year 2015 for the Eagle P3 Full
Funding Grant Agreement.

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, presented the State
Legislative Update on behalf of Brandeberry~McKenna, who were preparing
for the beginning of the Legislature the next day, Wednesday, January 7.
She noted that the Brandeberry~McKenna team will have a more complete
report during the February committee meeting.

6.C

Mike Dino shared that the Transportation Investment Generating Economic
Recovery (TIGER) Discretionary Grant program took a hit of $1 million. He
pointed out that this would make successful TIGER grants harder as the pot
continues to dwindle. Transportation is still part of the TIGER grants.

Mike Dino said that that new congress session started today. The
transportation funding debate will soon be addressed. The Senate
Commerce Committee leadership has noted that it is flexible and willing to
look at all options. Chairman Shuster of Congress’ Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee said that they will not look at any further taxes,
but instead look into repatriating corporation money and oil and gas
explorations off shore. The White House has said they will go along a
bipartisan tax increase. The White House favors a corporate tax reform to
fund transportation.
Mike Dino added that RTD has submitted the fiscal year 2016 request for
Eagle P3 of $167 million for the upcoming appropriation’s bill. This breaks
down to $150 million for 2016 and 17 million for shortfalls in 2012 and
2013.
RTD has made a grant request of $900,000 for the Workforce Initiative Now
(WIN) program.
Director Bagley inquired regarding the Southeast corridor as it was not
mentioned in the update. Mike Dino replied that the project is not in the
queue yet. Squire Patton Boggs is working with the Federal Transportation
Administration to formally propose this project.

D. Other Matters
Phil Washington, General Manager, announced Terry Emmons as the new Assistant
General Manager for Rail Operations. He said that Terry Emmons has been with
RTD for 27 years. His first 13 years were in bus operations and the last 14 in rail
operations. In the last year Terry Emmons served as the liaison between Rail
Operations and Capital Programs. He is a graduate of RTD’s Leadership Academy
and the first MAX program.
Committee Chair Folska congratulated Terry Emmons on his new position.

B. Recommended Actions
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with IBI Group (IBI)
as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL)
Systems (Contract 18DH016). This contract amendment is for the seventh
year, which is an additional option year of the contract. The scope and fee
are renegotiated annually. The seventh-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of
$2,600,000 for a total contract value to date of $14,622,000.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer (CFO),
introduced Eric Farrington, Information Technology (IT)
Program Manager and Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for IT.
Eric Farrington presented the Recommended Action to the
Directors. He explained that although the implementation for
the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work
remains. The addition of Real-time Passenger Information
(RTPI) to passengers is a significant piece of the seventh year
amendment. This item will require the assistance in staffing
and expertise from IBI.
Director Folska recalled the update Nadine Lee, Project
Manager for US36, gave during the FasTracks Monitoring
Committee meeting on January 6, 2015. She said that Nadine
Lee mentioned adding RTPI to the stations along the Flatiron
Flyer. Director Folska wondered if these two RTPI items were.
Eric Farrington answered that they are the same item. He said
the technology will help inform where a bus is and predict
arrival. Director Folska hopes that low vision and no vision
constituents will be able to access the RTPI. Eric Farrington
replied that his team has a meeting scheduled for the next
week to explore those options.

• Radio-CAD/AVL Owner’s Representative Contract Seventh-Year Amendment

6.D

Director Bagley asked about the final contract amount for
2014. Eric Farrington said that the number was near $2.6
million but did not have the exact number available. Director
Bagley requested staff provide that amount prior to the Board
meeting.
Director Francone inquired regarding the system’s consistency
with the Disaster Recovery plan approved by the Board of
Directors on December 16, 2014. Eric Farrington said that
some of the approved amount for Disaster Recovery was used
for Disaster Recovery implementation through IBI. Director
Francone stressed the importance of the CAD/AVL system
communicating with the Disaster Recovery system. Eric
Farrington replied that the CAD/AVL system was the first leg
of the Disaster Recovery system.
Director Deadwyler noted that she gets calls from constituents
when buses or trains are missing because there is no current
communication to let the public know this information. She
wondered how this system will communicate with the
community and when it would go live. Eric Farrington replied
that currently customers can call Customer Care to get real
time information on buses and light rails. The program in
development for next year is working on bus location and
predicted arrival that the customers could obtain themselves.
He explained that the program’s foundation is being laid this
year and a mobile application would probably be available in
2016. He added that this information would be available at
the train stations by the end of the year or January/February
2016 at the latest.
Director Deadwyler expressed her hope that this type of
communication would be available to those with sight
impairments. Eric Farrington reiterated that staff has a
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley asked if staff expected the work in the
contract to be completed in 2015. Eric Farrington said that
staff expects everything on the primary contract will be
completed. He noted that there will be some contract
amendments that would be more long term, such as the
execution of the RTPI data. Eric Farrington added that he
expects staff to have enough experience on how the system
works that he does not anticipate needing IBI after this
contract. He does expect smaller contracts with other
vendors.

6.D

Chair Sisk stressed the importance of the mobile application.
He wanted to confirm his understanding that the mobile
application is not possible at this time. Eric Farrington
explained that in order to make the RTPI public there needs to
be a foundation layer developed. This is what the team is
currently working on. He added that there will be a
presentation to RTD’s Senior Leadership Team (SLT) later in
January, 2015. After that presentation, there will be an
update to the Board of Directors. Chair Sisk noted that other
cities have similar mobile applications available. He stressed
the importance of aggressively working towards the mobile
application as it will be instrumental in keeping the
constituents informed. Eric Farrington replied that staff wants
to make sure that the public RTPI will be accurate. He added
that the only thing worse than no information is bad
information.
Director Lasater expressed his discontentment with this
contract. According to his conversation with staff, the
contract breaks down to a fee of $135-$140 per hour based
on a scenario of 9 people working on the project full time.
Director Lasater said he understands General Manager Phil
Washington’s credo of not hiring staff who will need to be let
go. However, he added that seven years is a long term
project. He noted that instead of contracting RTD should be
training its own staff to do this job internally, making the
project cheaper. He said that this project was unfortunately
approved before he was elected as a Director.
Director Folska noted that the Customer Care Center has
always been helpful and accurate. She added that sporadically
there is audible RTPI on light rail platforms. She expressed
how helpful the audible RTPI is to her.
Committee Chair Walker noted that he used to consult in prior
years. He said that the consultant is not paid the full amount
of the hourly fee. He added the cost of an employee goes
beyond a salary; it includes benefits, office space, and other
expenses.

meeting scheduled in the coming week to explore accessibility
options. Director Deadwyler clarified that currently it is up to
the constituent to call Customer Care to find out information
about the buses as opposed to information being pushed out
to the constituent. Eric Farrington affirmed the statement.

C. Updates
Rael & Letson Consultants
Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, explained that the Board is updated annually on
the pension plans. Currently, there are 3 retirement plans: 2 for salaried
employees and 1 for represented employees. One of the salaried employee
plans is a contribution plan; the other is a benefits plan. For both salaried
plans, the Board approves the annual contribution in November of the prior
year. For the represented plan, the Collective Bargaining Agreement
determines the contribution. All plans require reviews by actuaries.
Doug MacLeod introduced Terry Bright, Actuary with Rael & Letson. Terry
Bright explained that the review is for the fund status as of January 1, 2014
because the audited financials are received 4 to 6 months after year end.
Once received, a presentation is given to the plan’s Board of Trustees, then
the RTD Board of Directors. Doug MacLeod clarified that the plan’s Board of
Trustees meets quarterly. He also noted that this presentation is for the
plan of those employees hired before 2008.
Terry Bright presented the RTD Salaried Employee’s Defined Benefit Pension
Plan presentation included in the Financial Administration & Audit Committee
meeting packet for January 13, 2015. The presentation covered the
January 1, 2014 valuation highlights, the long-term funding, the GASB 67
(financial accounting for the Plan) and next steps. He highlighted that the
total participant count decreased by 12. He also noted that the plan is
projected to reach 100% funding in 2031 if all actuarial assumptions are
met each year.
Director Folska asked Terry Bright if he was able to predict how many
members the fund would have in 2032. He said that he did not have that
number at hand but could make it available. He noted that the difference
between active participants was 408 in 2013 and 382 in 2014 due to an
increase in retirement numbers. He added that these figures were included
in the presentation.

• Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan Update - Doug MacLeod,

6.D

Director Lubow asked for the reasoning behind the $3.1 million cap which
was established with the purpose of achieving 100% funding in 20 years.
Terry Bright replied that the 20 year amortization was done to match closely
with the life of the plan in terms of the employment life of those enrolled.
Doug MacLeod added that the $3.1 million figure was based on 9% of
salary contributions at the time that the recommendation was made to
switch from a percentage of salaries to a fixed contribution. The $3.1
million was the dollar amount being contributed at the time of the transition
so that was the figured used so there was no adverse effect to the budget.
The goal of moving to a fixed contribution was so that the plan would be
fully funded and not affected by people dropping out. Director Lubow
wondered if it was correct to say that there will be enough to pay as
employees retire. Terry Bright said that the plan has no liquidity issues.
Director Lubow had further questions that she noted she would take to staff
offline.
Director Menten said that when she met with former CFO Terry Howerter in
December, RTD was expected to change to a new accounting standard in
2014. She noted from the presentation that this seemed to not be the case.
Doug MacLeod said that the goal was to adopt the new accounting standard
in 2014 but the work involved pushed the adoption until 2015. Director
Menten wished that RTD would have done the steps to move to the new
standards in 2014 for transparency.
Director Menten asked what percentage of employees opts for the lump sum
instead of the annuity. Terry Bright said that the actuarial assumption is
25%. Director Menten said that according to her calculations it seems like
the additional costs of a lump sum could reach up to 44%. She asked if she
was right in her calculations. Terry Bright replied that he was not sure
which figures she was using, but that he would be happy to do some
calculations. He stated that annuities are a better payout. He noted that in
the RTD plan the lump sum has a high interest rate of 7.5%. Director
Menten asked if the lump sum has always been an option or if it was
recently added. Terry Bright said that it has always been an option. Its
interest rates were adjusted in 2014. Director Menten said that she had
further questions that she would take offline.
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler noted the statement under the second bullet of the
presentation on page 2 stating “The recommended contribution is projected
to decrease from $5.7 million in the 2015 Fiscal Year”. She wondered what
the expected decrease was. Terry Bright said that there is no minimum or
maximum expected on this actuarial calculation. He explained that the
Board approval caps at $3.1 million, the amount used for budgetary
purposes. Director Deadwyler asked if he could predict a percentage. Terry
Bright said that he could not.

6.D

Director Tobiassen explained that the Governance Board of the salaried plan
consists of mostly employees and it also includes Director Lubow and
himself. The meetings are quarterly. He said that he considers the fund to
be conservatively managed with very reasonable investment goals. The
fund is well diversified. He said that he would be happy to talk to any of the
Board members with further questions on the fund.

MacLeod, Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company
Doug MacLeod introduced Leslie Thompson, Actuary with Gabriel Roeder
Smith & Company. She covered the presentation RTD/ATU 1001 Pension
Plan as included in the Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting
packet for January 13, 2015. The presentation included plan valuation
highlights, history of the funded ratio, listing of scheduled contribution
amounts, long-term funding-reforms to improve the plan, and a summary.
Leslie Thompson emphasized that the plan was projected to be depleted in
2032. Due to the favorable market results in 2013, the depletion date is
now projected to 2036.
Director Tobiassen asked about other retirement benefit options available to
represented employees. He also wondered if RTD represented employees
qualify for Social Security. Leslie Thompson replied that all RTD employees
are on Social Security. Doug MacLeod said that RTD provides a voluntary
457 plan. RTD does not provide a match for the voluntary plan. He pointed
out that represented employees could also use private tools.
Director Lubow noted that the negotiated contract requirements do not
correlate with the fund needs. She asked if it is the actuary’s job to tell
their clients if there is a problem. Leslie Thompson replied that it is part of
her job. She referred Director Lubow to past reports where she noted the
problem.
Director Lubow wondered why, in general, pension funds are no longer able
to pay out the contracted amounts. Leslie Thompson said that she could
not comment on the more public cases, like Detroit and California, because
she has not worked on their plans. She said that based on her research and
the plans she works with the main cause is underfunding. She highlighted
that the problem may seem sudden, but in general it takes quite a while to
build up. The pension plan is not the main reason for entities to go
bankrupt, but they do become a problem overtime if not funded
appropriately.
Director Menten asked Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications acting for Phil Washington, General Manager, if it would be
possible to ask the Union to go back to the table on the CBA in order to
address this issue soon. Scott Reed replied that he could not speak on

Director Anderson noted that RTD’s contribution to the Union Retirement
Fund with Social Security included is an extremely high amount of money.
She said that she hopes that the Union Pension Board can work something
out and that RTD would be able to help in some way. She added that RTD
looks pretty maxed out at the moment. She pointed out that the economy is
good right now so this may be the time to resolve this. Director Anderson
acknowledged that this may be something for someone smarter than her to
figure out.

• November 2014 Monthly Financials Status Report - Doug MacLeod
Doug MacLeod, Acting CFO, presented the November 2014 Monthly
Financial Status as included in the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee meeting packet for January 13, 2015.
Director Bagley reminded the Directors that these statements show the
relationship between where we are and where the budget is. He said that
this is a key issue when it comes to the Fare Study. He noted that RTD has
to be very careful to achieve at least revenue neutrality or better with the
new fares. He challenged the Board to think through this matter as they
study the financial statements.
Committee Chair Walker thanked Doug MacLeod for his work. Committee
Chair Walker noted that it will be interesting to see what falling gas prices
will do to ridership.

B. Recommended Actions

• City of Boulder Hop Cost Share Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement
with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of
Boulder, the University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and
residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for an
amount not to exceed $1,459,687.00.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mike Gil, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, noted that Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager
of Bus Operations, was out of town on a peer review so he
would be filling in. He introduced Brian Matthews, Manager of
Special Services, to review the action.
Brian Matthews explained that this is really a housekeeping
item that is brought to the Board every year. This is an
agreement that RTD has had with the City of Boulder (Boulder)
for numerous years to operate the HOP. He believes it is really
a win-win for RTD and Boulder as this service carries a
tremendous amount of people.
Director Bagley pointed out that this agreement would be for a
not to exceed amount of about $1.46 million. He asked if
Packet Pg. 29

Director Lasater was absent and Director Deadwyler left early.

6.E

Director Folska asked what Boulder pays as part of the
agreement. She also wondered if any other entities
contributed to funding. Brian Matthews said that RTD only
contributes support to a portion of the HOP service; the total
budget for the portion that RTD supports is $2.5 million. The
City of Boulder is the only other contributor at about $1
million.
Director James inquired as to Boulder’s motivation for
supporting RTD in a greater way than other cities in the Metro
area. Brian Matthews explained that the City of Boulder
actually started this service. He said that the HOP has a very
high ridership level, and carrying passengers is RTD’s goal so it
makes sense to partner with Boulder.
Director Hoy commented that there are over 50K students at
the University of Colorado. These students all pay a bus fare
whether they use the bus or not so he thinks this is a good
service to support.
Director Folska wondered if the HOP is a free service or if
there is a fare charged. Brian Matthews stated that the HOP
charges a fare and is based on RTD’s fare structure. Mike Gil
noted that they also take and issue RTD transfers so it is a
very seamless service.

Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements
are for calendar year 2015 and for amounts not to exceed $353,990.00 for
Boulder County, $348,398.00 for Adams County and $107,948.00 for
Jefferson County.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Mike Gil stated that this is another cost share agreement for
services that have been operating since 1991 and 1993.
Brian Matthews explained that the services are provided by
two non-profits, Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’
Resource Center. These companies provide services that
would otherwise be provided by Access-a-Ride. He believes
this is another win-win cost share because without these nonprofits RTD would have a significant increase in the request
for Access-a-Ride service.
Director Folska said that she wanted to ensure the new
Directors had a good understanding of RTD’s paratransit
service. RTD is required to provide Access-a-Ride service
within a ¾ of a mile radius of RTD’s fixed route service to all
people within the District who qualify. Director Folska pointed
out that the cost to RTD for each Access-a-Ride trip is roughly
$57 per trip and for Access-a-Cab it is $12. She noted the
significant cost savings in RTD’s subsidy per passenger
boarding through this program with subsidies of approximately
$2.01 to $4.63. She believes that when you think about
providing accessible transportation for people in rural
communities this agreement is a big win.
Director Bagley asked for information on the 2014 not to
exceed amount as compared to the actual cost prior to the
Board Meeting. He also asked for the actual subsidy per
passenger boarding, not just RTD’s contribution. He believes
that is critical information for the Board to put this
recommendation into perspective when comparing it to RTD
services, especially the Call-n-Ride that typically boards more
passengers per hour. Brian Matthews stated he would work
on providing the information.
Director Francone inquired if there were any performance
statistics available for Via Mobility and Seniors’ Resource

• Denver Regional Council of Governments Vanpool Cost Share Agreement
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support
and expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver
metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and shall be in
an amount not to exceed $760,000.00.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brian Matthews indicated that this is another housekeeping
item. RTD has been in a relationship with the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG) for numerous years
supporting the Way to Go vanpool program (vanpool). He said
when this program first began there were a total of 13 vans;
now it is operating with 105 vans in the area. He explained
that this is really just a car share type program. Brian
Matthews stated that the program was very successful in
taking people off the roads. He noted that DRCOG contributes
about $360K annually in addition to providing a staff person
dedicated to managing the program and all the marketing
efforts.
Director Folska asked several questions regarding the service:
1. Do the users of the vanpool pay a fee? Brian Matthews
explained that they do pay a fee. This fee varies

Center. Brian Matthews said he did have the information
available and would send it to her. Director Folska expressed
that she is interested in the information as well and asked that
it be sent to all Directors.

depending on various factors like the length of the trip but
it is in-line with a Regional bus pass.
2. What is the dollar amount? Brian Matthews stated that the
cost is typically around $100 per month.
3. Is this a door-to-door service? Brian Matthews said that
the pick-up and drop-off structure is decided by each
vanpool.
4. Are the drivers RTD employees? Brian Matthews shared
that each van is assigned to one of the riders of the
vanpool who becomes the established driver. The drivers
are given an incentive of being able to use the van for
personal business up to a certain number of miles per
month.
5. How many vans are wheelchair accessible? Brian
Matthews said he would get back to Director Folska with
an exact number but he believed there were two.
6. What is the process for signing up for a vanpool? Brian
Matthews shared there was a DRCOG website where
people could sign up, an employee of DRCOG goes to large
employment centers to recruit vanpool participants, and
the TMOs in the Denver Metro area are offered an
incentive for each vanpool they form.
7. Is there a link from RTD’s website to the DRCOG vanpool
page? Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of
Communications, said there was.
Director Anderson commented that the North Area
Transportation Alliance has set up a very good process for
encouraging vanpooling along the I-25 corridor during
construction. She believes this is a very great program and
noted that DRCOG has been operating it for over 30 years.
Director Walker shared that he knows several people who
have participated in a vanpool over the years and really
enjoyed it. He noted they only had good things to say about
the program.

C. Updates

• A-Line Cost Share

Director Menten wondered if there has been an increase in ridership form the
West corridor since the AF service was discontinued with the opening of the
West Line. Shelley Cook indicated that there has been an increase in
ridership from the Golden and Lakewood areas.
Shelley Cook thanked the Board and staff at RTD for their support of this
partnership.

• Cost Shares
Brian Matthews stated that this was an update regarding the following cost
share agreements that RTD entered into for 2015:
1. Littleton Shopping Cart - $29,375. This service was originated to serve
portions of certain routes previously served by RTD in Littleton
2. Focus Points Family Resource Center - $50676. This is an agreement
with FPFRC, a local non-profit, to provide a new community based
service as an alternative to the discontinued Route 47
3. Longmont Coordination of Services – $10,600. This is to support a
grant obtained by Via Mobility to coordinate services provided by Via
Mobility and RTD in the City of Longmont.
Director Hoy wondered why RTD does not deploy a coordination of services
program in other areas we offer service. Brian Matthews explained that
there have been many challenges with this program. He stated that
currently this is not a model that can be replicated.
Director Francone inquired as to the ridership numbers of the Route 47 when
it was discontinued in 2004. Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning
and Scheduling, said that it was about 7 passenger boardings per hour,
which is very low for an urban area. Director Francone noted that the
passenger boardings per hour are now at 3. She wonders if this cost share
makes sense to continue since it has such low ridership. She thinks this is
something to consider next year.

Brian Matthews explained that this was an update on another housekeeping
item. He believes this is another win-win for RTD. He shared that when the
AS was discontinued between the Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and
Denver International Airport, the City of Arvada and Ride Provide, headed by
Executive Director Shelley Cook, developed a business plan to implement
scheduled shuttle van service. He said that RTD has committed to support
this service through 2016 when the Gold Line is running.

6.E

• Proposed May 2015 Service Change

Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, pointed
out that there were three notable recommendations within the service
changes as follows:
1. Cancellation of the Route DD along Colorado Boulevard due to low
ridership.
2. Reduction in frequency on the West Line to a peak period frequency of
7.5 minutes as well as the addition of a third car to the busiest West
Line peak period trips.
3. Reintroduction of service along Morrison Road between Alameda Avenue
and Sheridan Boulevard in the Westwood neighborhood.
Jessie Carter commented that the remainder of the recommendations were
typical adjustments for school letting out for the summer as well as service
improvements. He said the base system financial impact contained in this
proposal is estimated to be about $637K annualized with an estimated
$2,405 savings attributable to FasTracks.
Jessie Carter shared that there are 5 public hearings. There is one
scheduled in Broomfield, one in Lakewood, one in West Denver and two at
the Blake Administration Building.
Director Menten inquired if we really need to add a third car to the West
Line. Jessie Carter explained that with the current practice of doing
turnarounds using a holster, the additional train is necessary. If service is
delayed for any reason it diminishes reliability of the turnaround and then
cascades through the entire Light Rail system. Director Menten indicated
she would contact Jessie Carter offline for further information.
Director Folska asked for clarification if the operating costs for the West Line
come from the FasTracks budget; it was her understanding that now that it
was in operations it was budgeted through base systems. Jessie Carter
stated that all FasTracks corridors will come from the FasTracks operating
budget, not base systems.

• Fare Task Force Update
Lacy Bell, Planning Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point Presentation
with the Board that is available in the January 13, 2015 Operations and
Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. She indicated that staff had
just completed the public outreach process on the fare structure. They were
presented with a pay per boarding and a pay for time option with four types
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mike Gil reminded the Board that there was no action required for the May
Service Changes at this time. Staff is briefing the Board before the proposal
is taken to the public for comment.

6.E

Lacy Bell explained that based on public feedback regarding the difficulty in
evaluating the fare structure without fare levels, staff has modified the
project schedule. She said that the Board decision on fare structure will be
combined with pricing levels; the Board will be asked to approve a fare
structure and levels for public hearings in March, with final approval of the
structure and levels in May.
Director Folska reminded the Board and staff that when a Request for
Proposal was issued for the fare study, one of the really important items to
consider was the cost of parking. She said that so far she has not heard
any discussion about parking in the equation, which she finds very troubling
and concerning. Lacy Bell recognized that paying for parking increases a
rider’s overall transportation costs. She said that while this has not been
included directly in the revenue model it is something staff has asked CH2M
Hill to take into account. Director Folska stated that she is not concerned
about people having to pay for parking in our parking structures; she is
concerned about the transit dependent, economically challenged people who
are subsidizing the high cost of parking for people who can afford to drive.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, said that he
understood her concern and would make sure it was conveyed to CH2M Hill.
Director Hoy asked for clarification on the timeline for Board approval. He
also wondered when the new fare would be implemented. Lacy Bell said
that the Board would be presented with another update in February showing
some price modeling. In March staff will ask the Board for approval to take
a proposed fare structure and levels out for public comment and final
approval will be requested in May. She stated that the goal for
implementation is January 2016 to coincide with the opening of the new rail
lines.
Director Walker noted that staff was considering installing a ticket printing
device in our vehicles similar to those used by TriMet. He wondered how
those devices were working. Lacy Bell stated that while staff needed to get
more specific details, overall TriMet has been very happy with the printers.
Director Walker inquired if staff had been provided with any kind of structure
from the public as to what they would like to see in an income based fare.
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 13, 2015 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

of service (local, regional, rail and airport). She said some things they heard
from the public were:
1. Keep monthly and other pass programs
2. Expand Smart Card program
3. Desire for a low-income pass
4. Why are fares necessary if the public already pays for RTD with taxes
5. Desire for a day pass
6. Difficult to evaluate fare structures without knowing pricing

6.E

Lacy Bell said she had not been given a definition or detailed description of
what that would be.
Committee Chair Lubow asked if a peer analysis of other low income
programs would be part of the study. Lacy Bell stated that staff had
received a draft memo from CH2M Hill of this analysis that they were in the
process of reviewing. She said she would provide it to the Board once
staff’s review was complete.

Director Bagley said that he would like to provide a brief update on the activities of
the Denver Union Station Project Authority Board (DUSPA). He shared that for
those Directors who were unaware, he is the RTD Board of Director representative
on the DUSPA Board and Director James is his alternate. He stated that the level
of activity for the DUSPA Board has been greatly reduced now that Denver Union
Station (DUS) is approximately 99.9% complete. He noted that there are some
issues related to cell phone service availability in the bus box that RTD staff is
addressing in conjunction with Verizon Wireless. Director Bagley informed the
Board that RTD is taking over many of the financial accounting and reporting
requirements related to the RIFF and TIFIA loans. He shared that it appears as that
many as 10 years could be shaved off those payments. Director Bagley noted that
there are some questions about the estimates of future development around DUS,
partly because of what is happening with the price of oil and future employment
outlooks, but it is too early to speculate.
Director James invited everyone to attend the annual Transportation Solutions Road
Ahead event. It will be held on April 2, 2015, at Infinity Park in Glendale.

January Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk reviewed the January Board Meeting Agenda. He noted the unanimous agenda
was pretty straightforward and reviewed some of the items on the recommended action.
Chair Sisk discussed some of the questions or concerns expressed on the radio-CAD/AVL
Owner’s Representative Contract Amendment. Director Tobiassen shared he is working on
putting a tour of the radio shop and IT together and would let the Board members know
when it is scheduled. Director Bagley inquired as to the purpose of the tour. Director
Tobiassen responded it is to give interested people a full scope of the work and the people
who work in the shop. This could aid in their decision making. He is a proponent of
keeping people informed.
Chair Sisk inquired about the SMART card real time applications and when they would be
ready. He spoke of the importance of the “next bus application.” General Manager
Washington indicated it is important to get the basic foundation in place first. The
CAD/AVL provides that foundation before the applications can be available. He anticipates
we are 12-15 months away from getting real time applications. He also emphasized that
what RTD is providing is the foundation and the format from which others can build the
applications. The applications may not necessarily come from RTD. Director Hoy asked if
it is possible for the transit industry as a group to have consistent applications. General
Manager Washington commented that it is and cited the work going on at LA. Director
Tobiassen commented that one of the things the industry is working toward are standards
that will allow for this type of consistency. Director James elaborated on the question and

asked if there are best practice standards that have uniformity. General Manager
Washington replied that APTA is working on some nationwide standards now.

Pertaining to item F, DRCOG Vanpool, Director Hoy inquired if we know the cost of
passenger in our investment in DRCOG. What is the bang for the buck? Director
Tobiassen responded we currently get this data in our service plan. The vanpool service is
one of the most cost effective services. Chair Sisk asked about the vanpool option for the
replacement of the DD route that had been discontinued. Some conversation ensured
around this option. Director Menten inquired about how much we put into the guarantee
ride component of this service. She also reflected on the promotion and noted that in
some areas, the promotion was not good or relevant and she thinks we can make better
use of the signage. Director Walker pointed out this is a CDOT tool and for various
reasons, their preference is to use signage for unusual conditions such as weather or
traffic rather than to use it for more static data. Director Folska indicated how excited she
is about vanpool and asked if it is a possibility to use for access-a-cab/access-a-ride type
services with an app in conjunction.
Paula Perdue reminded the committee that we will receive a report out from Rubin Brown
on the GM 2014 Cost Contract at the January 20 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve the January
Board meeting Agenda for the January 20, 2015 Board

Other Matters


Director Bagley passed out two documents on issues that he wanted to discuss.
Copies of those documents are included in the minutes file located in the Board office.
1. Fare Study—Director Bagley proposed having a methodology to tape the Fare Study
public hearings for viewing on PBS Channel 8 or streaming on the world wide web.
The purpose would be to become more transparent, and provide increased public
access and public involvement.
2. RTD Committee and Board meetings—Director Bagley also proposed similar
technology for video streaming or live taping of Board meetings. Reasons quoted
included transparency, accountability, disclosure, reduction in improper activity,
enhanced record of all public meetings, reduction of requirement for typed and
transcribed meeting and a better understanding of the issues being debated by a
wider range of the public. Paula Perdue clarified that under Open meetings and
Open Records Act, there is still a requirement for minutes to be taken, recorded and
made available to the public.
The Committee discussed these proposals with general consensus that video
recording of the meetings is a good idea. Director Menten suggested investigating

using college interns as a cost effective means of performing the video recording
and associated work with making these available on the world wide web or Channel
8. Chair Sisk requested the General Manager to have his staff explore this request
and provide options and costs relative to implementation. Director Tobiassen
recommended that an ad hoc technology committee be established which will
consist of two Board members and staff to further analyze these options. General
Manager Washington will report back to the Executive Committee on his findings.
General Manager Washington shared that he had attended the TRB Annual Conference
and he had spoken on a panel with USDOT Secretary Foxx on workforce development.
He shared there were approximately 12,000 participants at this event. Several staff
members of RTD are actively involved on this committee: AGM Rick Clarke and Marla
Lien. AGM Bruce Abel participated in a Peer Review last week which is the reason he
was also absent from the Committee meeting.
Chair Sisk indicated that he wholeheartedly supports General Manager Washington in
accepting these speaking engagements. He thinks this enhances RTD as well as the
development of the General Manager.
General Manager Washington shared that the APTA webinar for “Stand Up for
Transportation” will be held on January 23. This webinar is available for all members
of APTA. So far, they have 25 cities who have committee to this national call for
action. The purpose of the webinar will be to share objectives, logistics, and resource
tool kit. Director Hoy inquired if TMO’s could be involved in this webinar. General
Manager Washington responded yes.

Special Recognitions


Youth Art Program
Chair Sisk indicated that we had some special guests in the audience that we wanted
to acknowledge. We wanted to recognize the Aurora and Cherry Creek Public schools
and the grand prize winners of the “I HEART MY RTD” pilot program. He then turned
it over to Steve Reilly, Marketing Manager, to do the introductions. Steve shared this
has been a wonderful opportunity to partner with the school systems and to help
educate them on the public transit system. In the process, we have built some
wonderful relationships that we hope to leverage for other community outreach
opportunities. He then introduced Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account
Executive, who was the coordinator and interface with the schools.
Georgann shared what an honor and pleasure it has been to work with the Aurora and
Cherry Creek School systems and the students. We had over 2400 students who
participated, about 16 schools and over 45,000 people who voted on line. Georgann
explained the process for selection including the Advisory committee and thanked
everyone for their help. She specifically thanked the marketing, graphics, Web group
and event manager who formed the backbone of the support as well as Lamar
Advertising who performed the wrap on the bus and RTD’s body shop who rigged the
unveiling. Special acknowledgement was given to graphic designer Joan Garcia who
worked with the students on their art to make it “bus wrap ready”. She thanked
Director Claudia Folska for the vision and Paula Perdue for the planning coordination.
She thanked the schools, educators and coordinators who worked with her to make it

Director Folska presented the winning students and schools with a framed copy of the
art.


Retiring Board Members
Chair Sisk recognized the two retiring Board members, Director Daly and Director
Rivera-Malpiede. He read the proclamation aloud honoring them for their services. A
copy of the proclamation is available in the Board office. Each of them were given a
departing gift from the Board.
General Manager Washington presented each with a plaque for their services to RTD.
He gave them a coin which he stated “This is his personal coin that you cannot
purchase, you must earn. It represents loyalty, integrity, discipline, and leadership.”
Director Daly commented what an honor it has been serving as Director for the last 8
years. He has worked with some spectacular people. He thanked staff for their work
and commitment to this agency. He stated one of his highlights was when we
selected General Manager Washington for the position. He has the utmost respect for
General Manager Washington, the direction he has provided to this agency and his
leadership.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she too is humbled to have been able to serve
with some fantastic people and staff. She shared one of her greatest moment was
participating in the selection of the GM and serving as Secretary when the FFGA was
received. General Manager Washington has truly moved this agency forward and we
are renowned for many successes including the PP3, the WIN program and the
redevelopment of the multi-modal Denver Union Station. She stands on the shoulders
of other Board members who have come before her but we could not have been
successful without the great staff.
Both Directors received a standing ovation.

Dr. Michael Cummings, Denver, shared that he teaches politics and public policy. He is
currently working with and writing a book on youth in politics. He is happy to see RTD
join the worldwide youth movement by engaging the youth through this art contest.
What he see is engaging, inspiring and empowering. He noted the 2014 Nobel Peace
Prize given to Malala Yousafzay, a young girl who had the courage to stand up against
the Taliban who quoted “what was lost was not my life but fear.” We have to reach
beyond the fear to do the extraordinaire. This is a fantastic thing that RTD has done
and he recognized Director Folska for her vision for this program. He stated, it was
unfortunate that she could not actually see it. He will mention her in his book.
Dre Chiriboga-Flor, Denver, indicated she was representing 9-5 in advocating for
affordable options during our fare input process. She related a story of a woman with
3 children who had been unemployed but recently got a job. This women would have
to walk 3 miles each way to get her children to and from school. She encouraged
affordable options for more people.
Irene Rodriguez, using an interpreter, shared that she uses the bus and sometimes have
to walk 20 minutes to get her son to the doctor. Her son uses the bus also.
Sometimes when she is at the Doctor, she does not always get out early enough to
catch the bus and the bus pass time expires. She would like more consideration in the
fare options.
Guadalupe Pastelin, Denver, thanked RTD for working for a bus in Westwood. She has
3 daughters and sometimes when weighing her options, it is better to drive than ride
the bus. She is looking for more regional economical options.
Zoë Williams, 9-5, shared that many of their members are participating in the fare task
study. The focus on simplifying the fare structure is good but there needs to be more
discussion around affordability. She encourages looking at ridership. There is a study
that shows when the cost of ridership decreases, ridership increases dramatically. Our
community is the life line of RTD. There is a need for affordable access to schools,
doctor visits, grocery, etc.
Scott Kerr, Denver, stated that lower income pay more for transportation
proportionately than higher income. He finds it incredible that they have been speaking
on this issue for over a year with little to no change. We need to look for a creative
solution where the poor will not have to pay more than others who can better afford.
We need to work with 9-5 to ensure public transportation remains public.
Doug Gragg, Denver, offered an observation. He visited the Jefferson County
Detention Center via light rail. He noticed that Jefferson County gives them a pass
which does not pay the full cost of the fare. He knows this is not an RTD issue but he
still wanted to comment on this. He recognized Jannette Scarpino for how well she
presents information and thanked Scott Reed for his service. He also stated we have
wonderful security guards working at Denver Union Station.

Carolyn Ruiz, Arvada, spoke about the disparity of the fare for access-a-ride versus
access-a-cab. She commented that she had gotten stranded and someone from RTD
had taken her home.
Susan Gangler, Aurora, shared that she had been blind for the last 2-3 years. She
takes the light rail southeast to Union Station where she catches the bus to Boulder to
see her son. She shared this is about her freedom and independence. She is
concerned about safety from the LRT platform to the bus pavilion concourse. She
asked if RTD would put some tactile strips from the track leading to the Chestnut
Pavilion door.

Chair Sisk – Highlights and Year in review
2014 was such an eventful year that could not have been successful without Board and
staff cooperation. What is happening as a result of RTD and FasTracks is really a
spectacular thing. He hopes that everyone will take the time to think about how we can
be more kind and gentle in terms of how we treat one another. Chair Sisk acknowledged
that one of the true blessings for him this year has been his association with the other
Directors and staff.

General Manager Washington reported on a light rail accident that resulted in a fatality.
We have had our full safety and security team onsite and RTD is coopering fully with
the police. His heart goes to the family of the victim as well as the RTD LRT operator.
We have reported this to the NTSB.
The RTD-DIA dispute has been resolved in RTD’s favor. The issue had to do with cost
responsibility within a certain area; the normal arrangement is Denver for the station
and RTD for the tracks. The arbitration decision was appealed by DIA. The latest
ruling upheld the arbitrator’s decision and RTD pays $7.8M. It is important to note
that during this dispute, the work continued and the relationship between RTD and DIA
remains positive.
General Manager Washington acknowledged Terry Howerter, CFO, and stated this was
his last Board meeting as he will be retiring this year. Terry has been a tremendous
asset to this agency. He has made great contributions to the complex RTD finances.
Chair Sisk expressed thanks to Marla Lien and the legal team for their representation
during the RTD-DIA arbitration dispute.

Election of 2015 Board Officers
Chair Sisk noted that the election of officers as stated in the Board Bylaws, is the
first Tuesday of the year. Paula Perdue had provided each Board member with a
copy of the process that we will follow in the nomination and election of officers
per our Bylaws and Robert’s Parliamentary procedures. He also noted that the
nomination with a second was a procedural change the Board had implemented
some time ago and while not required per Robert’s Rule, has become a precedent
for this Board. Voting will be by secret ballot. He indicated that because we will
start with the first position of nominating a chair, he will requiesce the meeting to
Director Larry Hoy, First Vice Chair and Chair Pro Tem to officiate over the election
for the Board Chair.
Chair Pro Tem Hoy reiterated the process we will follow and asked for head nods
from the members in agreement. Seeing no change, the election process for Chair
of the Board began.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the nomination of current Chair Sisk for the
position of Chair of the Board. He stated Chair Sisk has done an
outstanding job in this position in 2014. He reflected on his level of
professionalism and as former Mayor of Louisville.
Director James seconded the motion.
Director Lubow made the nomination of Director Claudia Folska for
Chair of the Board. She noted many of Director Folska’s
accomplishments while overcoming obstacles as a visually impaired
person. She noted Director Folska’s academic achievement-two
PHD’s as well as initiating fundraising for Pakistan water wells and
later starting an “I-Cycle” bike event in the US. All of this
demonstrated the determination and resilience of Director Folska and
her ability to lead. Director Folska has a vision for FasTracks to be
fully completed in 20/20.
Director Solano seconded the nomination.

Station Naming Plan for U.S. 36 Bus Rapid
Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station Naming Plan, codifying final name and
nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

BACKGROUND
This action meets the 2015 RTD General Manager goals of Advancing/Completing FasTracks and
Improving Service Delivery. In advance of the opening of the U.S. 36 BRT, staff recommends the
following modifications to the existing naming and nomenclature of the corridor stops, consistent with
the RTD Board Station Naming Policy (attached). Establishing the names will allow the project team to
move forward with the sign fabrication and installation to coincide with the completion of the station
work in fall 2015. There are two components to this staff recommendation: first, to change the
nomenclature for the boarding areas and second, a change to the names for two stop locations in the
corridor. The U.S. 36 BRT Station Naming Plan was discussed with the U.S. 36 stakeholder group on
November 25, 2014, and there was general consensus and support from the stakeholders for the
recommendations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename BRT stops “stations”
Staff recommends referring to the BRT passenger boarding areas “stations” to remain consistent with
RTD practice on other rapid transit lines, which happen to currently be rail technology.
Station names are recognized destinations for RTD patrons. This enables travelers to easily identify
station locations and destinations, and to efficiently complete trips. RTD’s standard naming protocol
defines the name of a station, Park-n-Ride (PnR) or transfer center based on its geographic location.
Along U.S. 36, these names have historically been based either on the nearest major road such as
Church Ranch Boulevard, Flatiron Crossing Drive/96th Street, McCaslin Boulevard and Table Mesa Drive,
or on locations such as Broomfield and Westminster Center. These names have been used on plans, fact
sheets and the RTD web site.
In the past year, the stations along the U.S. 36 highway have had “U.S. 36” added to their names: U.S.
36•Westminster Center, U.S. 36•Church Ranch, U.S. 36•Broomfield, U.S. 36•Flatiron and U.S.
36•McCaslin.

Packet Pg. 66

12.A

Staff is recommending name changes for two of the U.S. 36 stations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename Table Mesa Station to U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station
Staff recommends renaming the Table Mesa Station to the U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station for both clarity
and consistency with the standard naming protocols. There are several PnR’s along Table Mesa. The one
associated with the U.S. 36 BRT should be denoted as such by following the same naming convention
as the other BRT stations in the corridor by having U.S. 36 as part of the name.
Staff Recommendation: Rename U.S. 36•Westminster to U.S. 36•Sheridan Station
Staff recommends renaming the U.S. 36•Westminster Center Station to the U.S. 36•Sheridan Station.
When stations and transit centers have the same or similar names it can be confusing. For instance, the
new station for the Northwest Rail Line is under construction and will be called the Westminster Station.
Having a Westminster Station and a Westminster Center Station will lead to additional confusion. By
renaming the Westminster Center Station as the “U.S. 36•Sheridan” Station, it will be named based on
its geographical location. It is easily recognizable and makes sense to the customer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has already established a project budget in the FasTracks program to place new signage at the
stations for the implementation of the new BRT service. Any changes to the station naming will be
incorporated into this effort. It is expected that these all of the recommended changes can be done
within the established budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station
Naming Plan, codifying final name and nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, leave the names as is. This is not recommended as
the Table Mesa station name would not be consistent with the other BRT station names in the
corridor. Also, it would not address the issue of multiple stations in Westminster. Additionally, if the
passenger boarding areas are continued to be called “stops,” it would not be consistent with the RTD
practice of calling passenger boarding areas “stations” for RTD’s rapid transit lines.

Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at
Yale Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell
approximately 1,384 square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of
Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
BACKGROUND:
This action meets the 2015 General Manager goal of Fiscal Sustainability. The property was acquired in
December 2003 as part of the T-REX project and consisted of 46,255 square feet of vacant land at
5281 E. Yale Circle and a two level 12,600 square foot office building located on 16,614 square feet.
An eminent domain process resulting in a Certificate of Ascertainment and Report of Commissioners
issued after a three day Commission Hearing to determine value of the property acquired from Walter A.
Koebel in RTD v. Walter A. Koelbel, et al Case No. 01-CV-2025, District Court, City and County of
Denver resulted in RTD’s ownership of the property. The vacant land was determined to have a value of
$18.00 per square foot. The property was used for the development of the Yale Station and associated
park-n-Ride.
In 2011, Koelbel and Company, Mile High Development and the Urban Land Conservancy with support
from RTD developed a Transit-Oriented Master Plan for the Yale Station area including parcels of land
owned by each of the aforementioned parties.
DISCUSSION:
The Urban Land Conservancy and Yale Station Workforce Housing LLC, a joint venture of Koelbel and
Company and Mile High Development desire to acquire approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
from RTD to support their development of the Yale Station Family Apartments consisting of 66
affordable, income-restricted housing units in a four story multi-family building. Yale Station Family
Apartments will be constructed immediately west of the existing Yale Station park and ride on land
purchased from the Urban Land Conservancy through the Denver TOD Fund. Yale Station Family
Apartments will reserve 3 three-bedroom units, 18 two-bedroom units, and 45 one-bedroom units for
families earning 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of the area median income (AMI).
RTD’s sale of this small piece of undeveloped property supports the development and demonstrates
RTD’s support and cooperation in the development of transit oriented development and affordable
housing. In addition to receipt of revenue from the sale of the property, RTD has the benefit of
increased ridership at this location.
The property was appraised by Barrett D. Johnson, MAI, SRA and Brad A. Weiman, MAI, FRICS of
Integra Realty Resources in Denver in November of 2014. The property appraised at $18.79 per square
foot.

Packet Pg. 71

12.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD will receive purchase price at closing, however, the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT related to acquisition of property required for the T-REX Project provided that the cost of
acquiring property would be shared on a 50/50 basis and the disposition of any property would be
shared on the same basis.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the recommended action.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing,
LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to sell 1,384 square feet of real property.

City of Boulder Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at
Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for
an amount not to exceed $1,459,687.00.
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not
to exceed $1,459,687.00 in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will
confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service
through 3rd Quarter in 2014 resulted in 28.7 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP
passenger trip of $1.66. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2012 ranged
from an average of 34.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per
hour for suburban local service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service so

2.

that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and
businesses in the City of Boulder.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

Contract Seventh-Year Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to amend the
contract with IBI Group (IBI) as the Owner’s Representative to Support Replacement of RTD’s Radio and
Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Systems (Contract 18DH016).
This contract amendment is for the seventh year, which is an additional option year of the contract. The
scope and fee are renegotiated annually. The seventh-year fee is not-to-exceed a limit of $2,600,000
for a total contract value to date of $14,622,000.
BACKGROUND
RTD has replaced our radio and CAD/AVL system, which was originally implemented in 1993 and was
past the last years of the industry’s common 15-year service life. The project is expected to complete
System Acceptance Testing in the second quarter of 2015. There are many remaining efforts required
as a foundation for the extended operations and maintenance of the systems, processes and
infrastructure. Changes to the system are needed to improve functionality and adapt the system to
address Smart Media Technology (SMT) changes required by the new fare policy. The INIT system
provides the driver interface and onboard computer for the SMT system. Having a single interface saves
RTD money by eliminating cost and maintenance of duplicative hardware. Additionally, the extension of
this CAD/AVL system to provide Real-time Passenger Information (RTPI) to RTD’s Traveler Information
Systems (TIS) is an extremely complex and challenging task requiring experience and expertise that IBI
Group provides.
RTD requires extension of the services of an Owner’s Representative (OR) for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project to provide highly technical, managerial, business services to support the agency
through the final stage of the project, planning for moving into operations, implementation of required
changes and design and implementation of RTPI. The OR will provide unique technical skills unavailable
internally to RTD.
RTD issued Contract No. 18DH016 to obtain an Owner’s Representative for the Radio-CAD/AVL
Replacement Project. IBI was selected in 2009 by competitive procurement to be RTD’s Owner’s
Representative for the Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project. The contract requires eight (8) percent
Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) participation. IBI is currently exceeding their goal.
This is a complex and dynamic project. IBI has successfully completed the work anticipated for the
earlier years and it is in RTD’s interest to authorize a contract amendment for the seventh year of the
contract to continue needed support.

13.D

This is the start of an optional seventh year of a Board-approved contract. Due to the complexity and
changing conditions of the project, each year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated
annually.
Although implementation for the CAD/AVL project is winding down, significant work remains to
complete system acceptance testing, review and finalize as-built documentation, complete planning to
move into operations and maintenance of the system, implement and test system changes such as the
SMT interface adjustments for the new fare policy. Additionally, providing real-time information to
passengers is a complex and challenging next phase for the CAD/AVL project.
The anticipated seventh-year activities are:
 Final system acceptance testing, which will extend into the second quarter of 2015
 Detailed review of project record documents
 Implementation of pending INIT contract amendments, addressing elements such as the interface
changes with SMT required for changes to fare policy
 Radio system capacity expansion for improved FasTracks and mountain coverage
 Integration and testing of subsequent phases of Smart Media Technology
 Developing scope of work for hardware replacement on Access-a-Ride buses
 Analyzing RTPI prediction accuracy and providing recommendations
 Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuation of Operations Plan (CoOP) update and implementation
 Requirements development for RTPI foundation for light rail
 Requirements development for RTPI delivery to General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)-RealTime (RT), Passenger Information Displays (PIDs), RTD website and interactive voice response
(IVR) systems
 General Intelligent Transportation System / CAD / Communications consultancy demands in
support of RTD operations and FasTrack activities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost to the District for amending the Owner’s Representative contract with IBI Group for the
seventh year is a not-to-exceed cost of $2,600,000. Funding has been included in the 2009-2015
Finance and Administration Department’s Information Technology Division capital and operating budget.
The contract values for the first six years is cumulatively $12,022,000 and with this 7th year addition
total award is $14,622,000.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the request for the Radio-CAD/AVL Replacement Project Owner’s Representative
contract amendment which will reduce risk and allow current RTD employees to continue
focusing on operating and improving the system. This is the staff recommended action.
2. Attempt to accomplish the project with in-house staff. RTD staff does not have the necessary
skills or available resources to undertake this project.
If the IBI agreement is not approved and these resources are not available, the project would proceed
with a combination of Work Order contractors and RTD staff. It is likely that Alternative 2 will incur
additional cost for another vendor’s learning curve.

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

5311 Cost Share Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2015 and for amounts
not to exceed $353,990.00 for Boulder County, $348,398.00 for Adams County and $107,948.00 for
Jefferson County.
BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). Since
1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of
transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal
grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided financial
assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since
1993.
DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $353,990.00 in 2015. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $348,398.00 in 2015.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $107,948.00. in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the
year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the
funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.
If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will
confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311 service in 2014
(current numbers available) resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.7 to 2.5 passengers
per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $2.01 to
approximately $4.63 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride
monthly performance averaged 4.4 passengers per hour in 2012 while RTD Access-a-Ride service
performs at approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per
passenger boarding of $15.88 in 2012 while Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per
passenger trip of approximately $49.80 in 2012.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Denver Regional Council of
Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

Governments

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support and
expansion of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is
for calendar year 2015 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $760,000.00.
BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.
DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.
RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans in service has grown
from 11 to 105 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies currently operating vanpool services in other
metropolitan areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool

program. VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an
average of 5.9 riders per van and the fleet is at 80% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2014 resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $2.36. For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2012
ranged from an average of $2.88 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $6.61
subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.22 subsidy per passenger for
regional service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2015 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.
