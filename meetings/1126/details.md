## IV. Board Team Building

Board Teambuilding Discussion

Chair Anderson shared that she would like a Board teambuilding event to help the new Board members and current Board members to bond.  We are looking at the possibility of doing an event at Unser Racing.  She would like it to occur before the joint Board and Staff Strategic Planning Retreat on March 2, 2013.  She asked members of the Executive Committee to comment and a possible date for this event.  The members of the Committee were in favor of pursuing this as a teambuilding activity.  Paula Perdue will work the details including looking for a possible facilitator for this event.  The focus will be on trying to make sure there will be enough activities that those who may chose not to drive can still be included in the process.  Paula will poll the Board for either February 9 or 23.  The 9th is preferable.

## V. RTD Parking Legislation

Marla Lien, General Counsel, and Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations, joined the committee for this discussion. Marla Lien explained the challenges of why a change in this legislation is desired by RTD and that the Board will need to take an official position for this bill.  This will be brought before the government relations committee as an action item in February 2013.

## VI. Other Matters

Director Bagley requested a clarification on when staff was planning the series of charrettes and if the timing would conflict with the Board planned teambuilding session.  Acting General Manager Genova confirmed with Scott Reed that no dates have been set for these charrettes.
