### B. Review and Approve General Manager's End of Year Assessment

(Note: The committee proceeded out of order to discuss Agenda Item D, regarding benchmarking, while waiting for additional members to arrive.)

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the committee members had any comments about the General Manager’s second-half self-evaluation. She noted the General Manager’s ratings on his core and task goals and asked the committee members, having reviewed his final summary, whether they had any questions about or disagreement with his ratings.

Director Williams asked whether at any time the General Manager has been asked what his shortcomings were.

Chair Hoy said he had not been asked but said that Director Williams could ask him.

Ms. McManus noted that General Manager Genova would attend the following committee meeting.

Chair Hoy said the process was intended to evaluate whether the General Manager had carried out what the Board asked him to do.

Director Williams said she thought the committee might want to ask.

Chair Hoy stated the focus of the committee was whether the General Manager performed how the Board asked him to.

Committee Chair Francone said the process included defined goals and tasks and the General Manager was evaluated as determined by the evaluation document. She said the committee could change the General Manager’s tasks goals but not the core goals unless changes were made to the job description.

Ms. McManus reminded the committee that they could not change any of the goals for the current evaluation. She stated that the core goals were static and the task goals were based on what the Board decided at the retreat.

Committee Chair Francone said that the committee can change the General Manager’s goals in March for the following year and that the Board does not want to have a moving target for the General Manager.

Director Williams said that, as someone who evaluates people and is evaluated by a Board of Directors, there were simple things that could be discussed between the committee and the employees. She said she was fine with the process and felt that compensating the General Manager was appropriate.

Committee Chair Francone asked for some clarification to see what Director Williams wanted to get from this.

Director Anderson said that Director Williams made a good point. She stated that the requirements for the General Manager’s performance review were foisted upon the Board by the state legislature because they felt a previous General Manager received an outrageous salary and because an audit found that the Board was not carrying out its oversight responsibilities correctly. She felt that the review had become unwieldy because no one was really comfortable with the process, but she said that it was a clear way to determine compensation for the General manager. She said that sometime in the future the Board should look at a different process that meant more to the organization.

Director Williams compared the General Manager’s position to that of the head coach of the Denver Broncos, Vance Joseph. She said that Mr. Joseph had goals and tasks that he had met and exceeded, but there were questions about whether his organization could perform. She said she was not saying that the General Manager had done a bad job but that, as an agency that has had uncomfortable times, she did not see the overall review of the agency reflected in the process.

Ms. McManus said that the committee would meet with General Manager Genova at the next meeting and that the committee’s process was more streamlined than before. She said that, because of the comments and feelings of committee, in next week’s meeting the committee could give the General Manager the ability to speak to his strengths and weaknesses. She said the Chair of the Board and the Committee Chair spoke with General Manager Genova the previous year about matters not included in the performance review, which was not shared, but she said such conversations would be incorporated going forward. She said she was open to suggestions on how to make things better.

Director Williams asked for confirmation that the General Manager felt he had achieved the first goal.

Chair Hoy said the General Manager had achieved the goal set for him and did it well.

Committee Chair Francone said he had achieved the goal plus one additional criterion.

Ms. McManus said that the General Manager would have had to have met over 90% of performance measures to have exceeded expectations and over 80% to have achieved his goal.

Director Anderson asked what had changed on the General Manager’s self-assessment.

Ms. McManus gave an overview of the itemized changes.

Chair Hoy added that the goal referred to the delivery of transit services, in addition to the special services the General Manager stated that he had successfully deployed.

Ms. McManus said that General Manager Genova had clearly not met 90% of performance measures but that the General Manager said he exceeded expectation based on the special services criterion.

Director Anderson said that 2017 had been an extremely tough year to maintain employees to serve the agency’s customers. She stated she did not know where the agency stood with the percentage of performance measures achieved.

Ms. McManus said the agency was at 87.8%.

Director Anderson said that the General Manager had almost achieved the goal of 90% and had done some other things as well. She stated that some of the other pressures on RTD to perform services in an ad hoc manner could make up for the little extra he did not quite achieve. She stated that it had been a tough year in terms of recruiting and maintaining bus operators and people who deal directly with the public.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether Director Anderson was suggesting that the General Manager exceeded expectations based on the other services provided.

Director Anderson said that, based on the circumstances, he came very close to achieving 90% of performance measures as well as achieving the special services criterion.

Director Walker felt that, considering the number of events, the General Manager exceeded expectations. He said the staff had shown how deftly it could handle what was tossed at them, with a few hiccups. He said the General Manager had exceeded based on the service delivered during a trying time. He stated that the lack of employees was not just a problem for RTD and that it was a challenging time for everyone.

Director Sisk said that one shining star was how the agency handled the Women’s March, for which the agency received a lot of praise. He said that one event put him over.

Director Williams said that the General Manager had achieved his goals.

Chair Hoy felt the General Manager exceeded expectations, based on the special service delivery. He stated that the General Manager was judged by the people he surrounded himself with and that he was lucky to have Gina Callahan, Assistant Deputy General Manager of Bus Operations, because she could pull the off impossible. He said there were glitches but what the agency did was phenomenal.

Director Broom felt the General Manager exceeded expectations.

Committee Chair Francone said she was leaning toward exceeded expectations but asked whether the change of service to the R and W Lines equated to a significant reduction of service standards.

Director Walker said no, the service was on time over 80% of the time and that was the standard. He stated that, in order to meet those standards, sometimes service had to be adjusted.

Chair Hoy agreed that standards were different from service levels.

Director Williams said the committee was judging the General Manager on nebulous categories.

Director Williams said that she could not give the General Manager a pass on presenting a plan not to reduce service standards.

Chair Hoy said that the results were there but suggested the wording of the criterion stating that the General Manager “presents a plan” was not accurate.

Director Williams said that the criterion was not worded well.

Chair Hoy responded that the General Manager was not being reviewed only on his presentation of a plan, because otherwise he could merely present a plan and go on vacation and the committee could give him marks.

Director Williams asked if there were a criterion that said the General Manager “fails to present a plan to maintain existing service levels”. She said she had not seen such a plan nor did the General Manager present a plan to her. She said that the General Manager had not exceeded expectations as a result.

Director Walker said that he did not interpret the criterion as meaning that the General Manager presented a tangible product. Rather, he stated that the plan was shown by way of the service changes made three times a year. He said changes such as those to the R Line and W Line were meant to free up operators to go to other areas where they were needed. He reiterated that the plan was not document, but rather, every four months the Board received a new plan that maintained service adequate for the public demand.

Director Williams said that “adequate” was the key word.

Ms. McManus pointed out that the General Manager had included a bullet point in his self-assessment regarding service levels as described in the run boards.

Director Williams asked what General Manager Genova had done to exceed expectations.

Ms. McManus clarified that the bullet point was in the “achieved goals” criteria.

Committee Chair Francone said that, in order for the General Manager to have exceeded expectations, he would have to have outstanding and noteworthy special event services. She asked whether Director Williams still found the General Manager to have achieved his goals, and Director Williams said yes. Committee Chair Francone said she felt the General Manager had exceeded expectations.

Ms. McManus asked for conformation of the vote, and Committee Chair Francone confirmed that six voted that the General Manager exceeded expectations, and one said he did not.

Committee Chair Francone moved on to Core Goal #2, regarding strong and ethical leadership, and Core Goal #3, regarding strong financial management. She said the committee agreed during the General Manager’s mid-year review meeting that he had exceeded expectations on those goals. She asked if the committee felt anything had changed.

Regarding Core Goal #3, Director Williams said that General Manager Genova was a great overseer.

Director Lubow noted that there was a booming economy, yet there was financial stress in the agency. She said that was not the fault of the General Manager, but the buck should stop with him and the agency’s situation must have something to do with how the agency was handling its money.

Director Williams reiterated her earlier comparison to the state of the Denver Broncos. She said the coach may have met his goals, but the team was in trouble.

Director Anderson said the issue of sales tax was very elastic, whether the economy was good or not. She said she would not agree with Director Lubow’s interpretation. She said the Board had been given a long-term plan for the future based on conservative means, which she felt was good because a public agency should be conservative because of future uncertainty. She said she thought staff had done an excellent job in planning and that it was fault of the taxpayers, not the agency, that there was not enough money in the plan. She said the agency had a solid plan for future and that the plan would change if the economy got better if there were changes in the Denver metro area. She said that one could not blame the General Manager for what was going on.

Director Lubow stated that management issues had placed the agency into its position. She said that operations and maintenance costs were higher than the anyone expected and that the agency overextended mortgage-wise. She said she knew why the decisions were made and the Board also contributed to those decisions.

Committee Chair Francone said she did not disagree but said that, under General Manager Genova’s leadership, the agency has moved from over-borrowing to a more conservative approach with active budget management. She said that her original assessment was that the General Manager had exceeded expectations and asked for other comments.

Chair Hoy said that he would stay with committee’s previous decision.

Committee Chair Francone summarized that the committee did not change from the previous vote of exceeds expectations, with Director Lubow’s comments included in the discussion. Committee Chair Francone proceeded to Core Goal #4, regarding equal opportunity employment, affirmative action, and small business enterprises (SBEs) and disadvantaged business enterprises (DBEs). She said the General Manager had exceeded expectations during his mid-year review and asked if the committee felt there were any changes.

Chair Hoy and Director Anderson said their assessment had not changed.

Ms. McManus noted that, as an opportunity for improvement, the committee had previously identified the criterion stating that the agency had been lauded for the SBE, DBE, and Workplace Initiative Now (WIN) programs. She asked if the committee had been made aware of any recognition the agency had received for those programs.

Committee Chair Francone and Chair Hoy said they were not aware of any such recognition.

Director Sisk noted that it could be more difficult to receive recognition for civil rights programs going forward when the agency moved from construction to operations and maintenance. He suggested that the goal should be adjusted toward maintenance.

Committee Chair Francone said that the WIN program had not completely changed but had started moving toward RTD-centric efforts by training bus drivers and diesel mechanics and working with colleges. She said that the committee voted unanimously that the General Manager exceeded expectations. For Core Goal #5, regarding effective communication, Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager exceeded expectations during his mid-year assessment.

Director Williams noted that the General Manager had never proactively met with her, though she had initiated meetings with him three times.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether Director Williams felt the General Manager had met his goal.

Director Williams asked whether the General Manager had met with other Directors and said that she would rate him as having achieved the goal.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the General Manager needed improvement.

Director Williams said he needed improvement on that criterion but had achieved the goal as a whole. She said she did not receive information on pertinent issues in her district.

Chair Hoy clarified the verbiage of the goal and said that the General Manager was required to update the agency on what was going on. He said that he would soon be able to view the General Manager’s calendar in order to see what he was doing and that General Manager Genova was increasing his prominence nationally.

Ms. McManus noted that the General Manager submitted reports on his activity, listed by district, on a weekly basis and said that he had an open door policy.

Director Anderson thought it was great that the General Manager met with Director Williams each of the times she called him. She said she recognized that General Manager had a lot on his plate, and, as one of 15 Directors, she tried to minimize her need to speak to him because the agency also has responsive staff members. She said she asked the General Manager to speak at one of her meetings in Arvada and he did, because he would do what the Directors asked of him. She said he did not call Board Members directly and ask to meet with them because of protocols stating the Chair was the Board’s liaison with General Manager’s office. She said she found General Manager Genova to be very responsive. He added that she called him once this year because there was a real issue in Arvada, and she felt confident she could get anything she needed from members of staff.

Director Williams stated that one of the criteria said that the General Manager “meets periodically to confirm and address priorities”.

Director Broom said that he had met with General Manager Genova to discuss some general questions of no real concern.

Director Lubow said that she met with the General Manager after his office approached her. She stated that the General Manager did a great job with public information but said that there had been fiascos with the commuter rail lines. She said the public was frustrated with RTD and that it would have been better for RTD to be more proactive, not reactive, to newspaper articles. She reported that people were saying that they did not understand what was happening and that RTD was losing touch of its message.

Director Walker noted that, as with other categories, the goal did not mean that the General Manager was solely responsible for achieving the criteria, but rather that his employees contributed as well. He said that, if not the General Manager himself, someone from agency had reached out to people with concerns.

Committee Chair Francone summarized that six Directors voted that the General Manager had exceeded expectations and that Director Williams felt he had achieved his goal. She then spoke to Task Goal #1, regarding fiscal sustainability. She said both the committee and the General Manager felt during the mid-year assessment that he had achieved this goal.

Director Anderson agreed.

Committee Chair Francone asked for additional comments, and no one disagreed with the committee’s previous vote. Regarding Task Goal #2, regarding workforce and human capital, she said that the committee had voted that he achieved the goal. She asked if there were any changes, and no one offered commentary. She stated that, per the committee’s previous vote, the General Manager had exceeded expectations on Task Goal #3, regarding State of Good Repair (SOGR).

Director Anderson said she would not change the assessment and that RTD was a leader nationwide.

Committee Chair Francone asked if anyone disagreed and, hearing no additional discussion, stated that the committee voted unanimously that the exceeded expectations.

Ms. McManus noted that General Manager Genova had completed the criterion stating that he “maintains assets at a zero backlog or any asset that is in backlog is scheduled for replacement in the SBP”. She asked whether the committee should indicate on his evaluation form that the General Manager had completed that criterion.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee would agree to check off that box.

Ms. McManus said the committee would need to make overall decisions about what to do that day in order to move forward.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the General Manager should receive discretionary performance payout based on the evaluation that was completed, on his own self-assessment, and on survey results.

Director Williams asked who would want to speak to the media to tell them the General Manager had received an increase.

Committee Chair Francone said she did not speak to press. She asked which members of the committee felt that the General Manager should receive a discretionary performance payout.

Director Lubow stated that the General Manager received $10,000 automatically.

Committee Chair Francone said that was not the discussion before the committee.

Director Walker said he was comfortable giving the General Manager a discretionary performance payout.

Director Sisk also said he was comfortable with a discretionary performance payout, but not a 10% payout.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee could discuss numbers.

Director Williams said she felt the General Manager should not receive a discretionary performance payout.

Chair Hoy and Director Broom agreed that he should receive a payout.

Director Anderson said she felt the General Manager should receive pay increase because the previous two years had been tough ones. She stated that it was still unknown when the G Line would open but General Manager Genova had been in front of the effort, working to get the job done. She said that she did not know whether he should receive 5% or 10%.

Committee Chair Francone asked what amount she felt was appropriate.

Director Anderson said that the General Manager did not receive a discretionary performance payout the last year, even though he performed well. She said that giving General Manager Genova a performance payout would show confidence in him and his staff and make an impression on the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

Director Lubow said that Director Anderson had made an interesting point about the positive impact on the CPUC but felt it would be destructive to ignore the generalized feeling that there had been a problem with the agency. She said that General Manager Genova had done as much as possible but thought that the public would not be happy with an amount more than the $10,000 that the General Manager’s contract would give him.

Committee Chair Francone said that she spent hours reviewing the performance review process and that it was not perfect, though she said it had eliminated some of the subjectivity the committee had seen. She said she did not disagree with Director Lubow’s comments that agency has had problems, but she felt that the General Manager had been out front on issues such as the A Line, the G Line, and the drafting error in Senate Bill 17-267 (SB267). She stated that the committee had already set the standard for the General Manager’s evaluation and that she felt he was deserving of a discretionary performance payment. She said the question was how much. She noted that the $10,000 amount that he automatically received every year was based on a contractual agreement the Board made with him. She said that she was inclined to suggest a discretionary performance payout between 1-3%.

Chair Hoy asked what the highest payout could be.

Director Sisk answered 25%.

Chair Hoy said that he would not suggest that amount but noted there were places where a person could receive 25% or 50% bonuses.

Director Williams said that, because of RTD’s financial status and status as public agency, she did not feel the General Manager should receive any more money because of the agency’s fiduciary obligation not to give out unnecessary money.

Director Walker said he was contemplating a 3-5% payout. He said everyone has seen what the General Manager and his staff had been doing. He said there were problems with agency, such as with the University of Colorado A Line and the B and G Lines, but he said those problems were not the General Manager’s or the agency’s doing. He stated that the performance of the A and B Lines had been great, with an on-time performance (OTP) in the 90’s, and that he had done a great job helping persuade the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to move off of its position on the crossing gates. He noted that RTD was the first to do that type of project, and he said that the General Manager’s standing in the industry and his role with the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) showed how well he was considered y others He said the agency had problems but endorsed a 5% performance payout.

Director Sisk said he thought that $6,000-7,500, between a 3-4% increase, would be an acceptable number. He said that he, as a member of the Board, had an obligation to uphold the contract the Board had agreed to. He spoke about the agency’s fiduciary obligations and asked whether the Directors should not be going on trips. He noted that was one of the reasons he had not taken any trips that year.

Chair Hoy said he would support a 4% performance payout.

Director Broom supported a 7.5% performance payout, 5% of which he said was combat pay. He said everything that had happened had been tough but that the important message to General Manager Genova was how much the Board valued him. He noted that General Manager Genova would probably be in high demand and could be gone next month if he felt he was not appreciated at RTD. He asked who the agency would find to replace him and whether the General Manager could be replaced for less money. Everyone recognizes there are things that need to be addressed. At same token, he’s taken on a tough job of addressing these things.

Committee Chair Francone said the committee had not agreed on a percentage.

Chair Hoy said his 4% figure was note arbitrary and represented a performance payout of a little over $10,000.

Director Anderson said she could agree to 4-5%.

Chair Hoy said he could agree to 5%

Committee Chair Francone said she could not agree to much more than 3%.

Motion:               Chair Hoy made the motion to grant General Manager Genova a discretionary performance payout of 4%.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 5 in favor (Anderson, Broom, Hoy, Sisk, Walker) and 2 opposed (Francone, Williams).

### C. Review Survey Results

Committee Chair Francone asked whether anyone had any questions about the survey.

Director Williams asked how many people responded.

Committee Chair Francone said thirteen had completed the survey.

Ms. McManus said she had met with Dennis Yaklich, Market Research Manager, who had taken over responsibility for the survey. She said that the original survey did not give the overall picture for the General Manager and that she worked with Mr. Yaklich to arrange the information so that everything would be up front and easily understandable. She said she would present samples first to Committee Chair Francone and Chair Hoy and later to the whole committee.

Director Sisk said that one of the respondents to the survey asked why RTD employed twice as many staff as operators.

Ms. McManus said she did not think that was a true statement and that RTD was top-heavy on operators.

Chair Hoy said that there were roughly 3,000 operators, along with additional contractors, and that there were around 800 salaried administrative employees.

Director Sisk said the ratio of operators to administrative employees was four to one.

Chair Hoy, commenting about future changes to the performance review, said he could not know or guess how the General Manager related to other Directors or senior members of management.

### D. Benchmarking

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, suggested going out of order to the benchmarking item while the committee waited for Directors Broom and Williams to arrive.

Committee Chair Francone said that Ms. McManus would be passing out benchmarking data of general managers (GMs) of other transit agencies, which the committee was statutorily required to review.

Ms. McManus said that staff had tried to expand the amount of information contained in the benchmarking data. She said that it would be great for the same transit agencies to participate every year and that, even after submitting open records requests, the Board Office had not received information from certain agencies. She said the chart outlined various data points of other transit agency GMs, including their agencies’ service areas, ridership, and service population, and showed a breakdown of their compensation. She noted that only three agencies had responded the previous year and that the Board Office had begun its data collection earlier this year.

Committee Chair Francone stated that comparing agencies’ benchmarking data can be difficult because of the variables, such as the agencies’ size, service area, the number of fleet vehicles. She asked whether the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) had been a good resource for data.

Ms. McManus said APTA was not helpful and that the most recent GM compensation data posted on their website was from 2012.

Chair Hoy said he was familiar with one of the transit agencies on the chart and noted that it was small, with only 50 buses in its fleet.

Ms. McManus noted the larger agencies on the chart and mentioned that staff had tried to get info from Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART). She said it could be difficult to obtain data from some agencies without an open records request and noted that some agencies were not eligible to release data due to negotiations. She said that the chart detailed GMs of transit agencies that were different in terms of size, responsibility, land area, and other factors.

Committee Chair Francone said that the review of the benchmarking data was requirement that came out of an audit a few years earlier and noted that RTD was required to look at data from other transit agencies in order to evaluate the General Manager’s discretionary performance payout and his performance. She said the review was not meant to be a mandate for his payout. She said that the committee previously determined that DART was closest to comparable to RTD but noted that the agency’s service area was only 700 square miles. She contrasted DART to the Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA), which covered 1,500 square miles and serviced 4 million people. She stated there was no apples-to-apples comparison agency wide and that the benchmarking chart was an overview of what GMs from different agencies receive for salary and other compensation, which would give data to the Board for the purposes of determining the discretionary performance payout.

Director Sisk said that the committee was not comparing agencies and noted that the Ann Arbor Area Transportation Authority (AAATA) serviced an area half the size of Boulder. He stated that the committee performed a wage survey analysis of GMs two years earlier, which he felt was more persuasive than the benchmarking data. He noted that the information for the General Manager of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Phil Washington, was not included in the analysis, nor was the cost of living standard for each area.

Director Walker said that GMs have varying responsibilities

Director Anderson said she felt it would be better to benchmark among the top paid executives in the Denver metro area or to compare public and private industry salaries.

Committee Chair Francone said she did not know whether the statutory requirements mandated that the transit agency data be used for benchmarking.

Ms. McManus said she would look at the verbiage and that she had provided similar information to former Director Bagley.

Director Anderson said that DART was an interesting point of comparison, because the agency transit facilities were closest to RTD’s and the agencies service areas were similar.

Ms. McManus said that staff had tried to obtain information on the GM of DART, Gary Thomas, but was not able to do so.

Director Williams said she had overheard that this benchmarking process was done two years earlier to determine the General Manager’s salary.

Ms. McManus said that benchmarking was undertaken annually.

Director Williams asked whether it would be simpler to look at what has changed rather than recreating the wheel each year.

Ms. McManus said that she did not have the previous benchmarking data because it was not left for her by her predecessor.

Director Williams said that people had decided two years earlier how much General Manager Genova should be paid. She again asked why the committee would not just say whether the General Manager or the agency itself has gotten better or worse.

Chair Hoy said that doing so would presume that the committee was correct two years ago. He said the benchmarking was valuable because the committee could review where the agency should be as compared with where it was two years earlier.

Director Williams said that one would have to assume that the Directors at the time, half of whom were still on the Board, made valid judgments and that it did not make sense to second-guess their decisions.

Director Sisk said the committee did a lot of benchmarking and noted that the Ft. Collins city manager earned a salary of $300,000. He said the committee was satisfied in terms of the General Manager’s salary and noted that former General Manager Phil Washington had a higher salary than General Manager Genova. He said that RTD had approached DART Executive Director Gary Thomas when searching for a General Manager but could not come close to matching his salary of $435,000. He noted that several Directors had felt that Mr. Washington was overpaid.

Chair Hoy stated that half of the GMs in the benchmarking data earned a salary of $275,000 or below and the other half earned more. To Director Anderson’s comment, Chair Hoy said that the general manager of a company with a budget similar in size RTD’s could be used for comparison.

### E. Questions

There were no additional questions.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Francone adjourned the meeting at 5:35 p.m.
