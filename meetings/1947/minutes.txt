C. Updates

• Second Quarter 2014 Investment Report
Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting, introduced Brenden
Morgan, Manager for Debt and Investments. Brenden Morgan presented the
Second Quarter 2014 Investment Report starting on page 4 of the Financial
Administration & Audit/Civil Rights/Operations & Customer Service
Committee Meetings packet for August 12, 2014. Brenden Morgan noted
that all investment are meeting and/or exceeding benchmarks.
There were no questions or comments on this update.

• June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod presented the June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report
starting on page 9 of the Financial Administration & Audit/Civil
Rights/Operations & Customer Service Committee Meetings packet for
August 12, 2014. He noted that RTD will be losing the Vendor Allowance
in July, 2014 as the State decided to implement a moratorium back in
October, 2009. The moratorium is included in RTD’s forecast and budget.
Director Bagley noted the importance of having both the actual and
budgeted figures on the report. He also said that sales and use tax revenue,
fare revenue, and ridership are all down through the first half of 2014 when
compared to the budget. He encouraged the Directors to be conscious of
these figures. He also considers it prudent for staff to discuss this further.
Director Hoy said he was trying to understand the relationship between fare
revenue and sales and use tax revenue in both 2013 and 2014. He noted

that fares are not contributing as much to the revenue stream as they were
in 2013. Doug MacLeod affirmed Director Hoy’s observations. He said the
sales and use tax revenue was made up on a higher percentage of the
revenue this year. Director Hoy said this information offered a different
perspective.

D. Other Matters
