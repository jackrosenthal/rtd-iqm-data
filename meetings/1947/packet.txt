Subject:

Second Quarter 2014 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expansion accelerated (4.0 percent) during the second quarter of 2014. The
unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 6.1% but still remains elevated and general
inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
second quarter noting that this level will continue to be appropriate “for a considerable time after the
asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2
percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.025%
0.010%

0.022%

0.070%

0.156%
0.122%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the Second quarter of 2014 was 0.20% which
would produce annualized earnings of $378,470. The current return for the month of June was 0.10%.

(4) Reduction is primarily due to payments made on year-end accrual of expenses
(5) Primarily includes unearned revenue from Eco and College pass sales
(6) Increase is due to an additional $80 million draw on the FasTracks TIFIA loan
(7) The deficit will be replenished in July with draws from debt proceeds (see #1)
(8) Increase is due to the FasTracks changes to the Rubber Tire allocation, two months operating costs reserve policy and the delay of the SW Rail relocation costs
(9) Increase is due to the full year budgeted increase to fund balances per the 2014 Amended Budget
