#### 2. June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod presented the June 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report starting on page 9 of the Financial Administration & Audit/Civil Rights/Operations & Customer Service Committee Meetings packet for August 12, 2014.  He noted that RTD will be losing the Vendor Allowance in July, 2014 as the State decided to implement a moratorium back in October, 2009.  The moratorium is included in  RTD’s forecast and budget.

Director Bagley noted the importance of having both the actual and budgeted figures on the report.  He also said that sales and use tax revenue, fare revenue, and ridership are all down through the first half of 2014 when compared to the budget.  He encouraged the Directors to be conscious of these figures.  He also considers it prudent for staff to discuss this further.

Director Hoy said he was trying to understand the relationship between fare revenue and sales and use tax revenue in both 2013 and 2014.  He noted that fares are not contributing as much to the revenue stream as they were in 2013.  Doug MacLeod affirmed Director Hoy’s observations.  He said the sales and use tax revenue was made up on a higher percentage of the revenue this year.  Director Hoy said this information offered a different perspective.
