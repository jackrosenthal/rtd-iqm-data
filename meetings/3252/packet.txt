BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021

2022 Legislative Program

Board Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2022 Legislative Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) does not currently have a Legislative Program. As part of the
2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff is initiating a process to develop and implement an annual Legislative
Program. It is common practice for public transportation agencies to develop a Legislative Program that
is adopted by its board of directors annually and that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue
goals related to legislative and policy matters. Additionally, a Legislative Program serves as a living
document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board adopted
policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and
federal elected officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the
District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals. Equally
important is building trust through partnership that fits within the framework of RTD’s financial forecast.
The 2022 Legislative Program, included as an attachment to this Board report, outlines priority actions
on a variety of issues that staff believes are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
If approved, the 2022 Legislative Program will be implemented beginning January 1, 2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Board approval of the 2022 Legislative Program does not have any immediate financial impact.

Attachment A

2022 Legislative Program

To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2022 legislative
session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with a myriad of stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner with
the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly delegation,
and local elected officials to advocate for policies approved by the Board.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), and other stakeholder
organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and seek support for legislative
positions approved by the Board. Lastly, tactics included in the Legislative Program will be guided and
informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Board-approved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan –
Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, Financial Success.
TACTICAL PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2022 Legislative
Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative matters are likely to arise that
warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented to the
Board as part of a Board committee agenda. If time does not allow for an item to be agendized for a
committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the legislation in question.

forward, a more comprehensive overview of communications activities will be included in the monthly
Board Briefing Document.
•

Naming Rights Program
As part of the Corporate Naming Rights program, staff is conducting an updated valuation of RTD’s
stations and major rail lines to solicit parties interested in a naming rights partnership. A main focus
at this time is the competitive process to secure a new naming rights sponsor for the A Line. The
University of Colorado A Line, the name for the commuter rail line that travels between Denver Union
Station and Denver International Airport since 2016, is under a corporate naming agreement that
expires in May 2022.

•

15/15L Bus Shelter Improvement Project
Staff is promoting the improvements on the 15/15L route along Colfax Avenue. To enhance the
customer experience on this busy corridor, RTD is upgrading 15L stops between Broadway and the R
Line Colfax Station in Aurora with new shelters, enhanced lighting and security cameras. The new
shelters were designed in-house by Ignacio Correa-Ortiz, who is an architect in the Capital Programs
Department.

•

Take a Trip Ridership Campaign
The new ridership campaign “Take a Trip” was launched on September 22, 2021. The campaign
focuses on gaining more trips by encouraging customers to use RTD services for social activities,
essential trips and popular destinations, and reminding the public of the community benefits and

Packet Pg. 9

1.C.2

value of transit. Customer feedback indicates that these are the likely reasons people are/will use
transit at this time, given the continuing high level of telework in the region. The various ads are
designed with a tone of lightness, humor, poignancy, whimsiness and edginess to give people a
break from the seriousness of the pandemic. The campaign will adjust messaging to reflect the
dynamic changes as the region continues to recover.

•

Board Member Telephone Town Hall Meetings
The annual series of Board member telephone town hall meetings will begin October 13 and go
through November 3, 2021. This is an opportunity for Board members to connect with their
constituents, answer questions and receive immediate feedback through live electronic polling. The

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Government Relations Report

Committee Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has a Government Relations Program facilitated and overseen
by the agency’s Government Relations Officer. Part of the role of the Government Relations Officer is to
coordinate and develop strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve
as a point of contact for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Below are the notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the last
Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on August 10, 2021. This report
was prepared on September 21, 2021 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Committee
meeting.
Federal
Since the last Government Relations report, the U.S. Senate passed the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act (IIJA) by a vote of 69-30. This package was closely negotiated between the White House, and
bipartisan group of Senators. The bill, if approved by the House and signed by the President, would
increase transit funding by 63% above current levels. The programs that administer the federal transit
funding are largely the same as the current surface transportation authorization bill – the Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. A notable exception is the increase in funding for
passenger rail which saw a 561% increase above current levels. Currently the IIJA is scheduled for a
vote in the House of Representatives on September 27, 2021. The outcome of those negotiations will
be updated verbally.
Last on federal matters, RTD is tracking the federal appropriations process. The end of the Federal Fiscal
Year is September 30, 2021. Congress is likely to approve a shorter Continuing Resolution to keep the
Federal Government operating that will extend into December. RTD will continue to work with its federal
delegation in the House and Senate to ensure funding to facilitate the return of RTD’s Credit Risk
Premium is included in the final FY22 Appropriations Bill.
State

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.3

At the state level, RTD is closely tracking the work being done by the Sales and Use Tax Simplification
Task Force, the Legislative Oversight Committee on Tax Policy, and the Transportation Legislation
Review Committee. One highlight from the Legislative Oversight Committee on Tax Policy, the
Committee approved the drafting of a bill to update Colorado’s current business tax deduction for mass
transit and rider share expenses. This legislation could offer a helpful incentive to support and encourage
use of public transportation when commuting for work.
Lastly, at the state level, RTD is monitoring the discussion on Colorado Department of Transportation’s
Rules Governing Statewide Transportation Planning Process and Transportation Planning Regions (Rule).
The Rule aims to establish pollution reduction targets over time through 2050. The Rule prescribes that
if reduction targets are not met, funding would need to be shifted to support mitigation measures.
Among the mitigation measures in the draft Rule, transit resources in a manner that can displace VMT is
listed. DRCOG has held several discussions with its board of directors on this topic as well as the Metro
Mayors Caucus and other transportation stakeholder organizations. RTD is monitoring the discussions
closely and working to determine how the agency can support the effort and be a partner in achieving
regional air quality improvement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Longmont Transit Facility

Committee Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to grant the General Manager and CEO or her designee the authority to
negotiate and execute all documents and funding transfers necessary for the design, construction, and
maintenance of a new bus transfer facility and Park-n-Ride (Transit Facility) near the future terminus of
the B Line in the City of Longmont (City).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Transit-Oriented Development Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the State Highway 119 Bus Rapid Transit project, RTD is working to develop redesigned bus
services between Boulder and Longmont (the City). In addition, as a part of the FasTracks Program, RTD
has plans to extend the existing B Line commuter rail into downtown Longmont. RTD and the City have
identified the 1st Avenue and Main Street location as the site of the Transit Facility to support bus and
eventual commuter rail services.
In 2011, the Board of Directors approved the reservation of $17 million in FasTracks funds for the costs
associated with the creation of the Transit Facility and related infrastructure. In June 2012, Longmont
City Council adopted the 1st and Main Transit and Revitalization Plan, which lays out the vision and plan
to implement a new transit station in Longmont, including potential for transit-oriented development
(TOD) opportunities. The City then engaged the services of a consultant to prepare a 1st and Main
Transit Oriented Development Strategies Report that evaluates the potential for TOD in the area,
provides conceptual plans for station design and corresponding preliminary costs, and recommends
alternative public financing strategies to implement the plan. A final version of this report was completed
in August 2017 with regular input from RTD Planning staff.
In a 2017 Memorandum of Understanding, RTD and the City jointly agreed that an infrastructure master
plan (IMP) would meet mutual goals of refining street, parking, and transit improvements and identifying
associated infrastructure costs in order to establish assumptions for completing the Transit Facility and
the related infrastructure (together, the Project). The IMP is substantially complete and is expected to be
finalized shortly. The IMP estimates the total cost of the Project at approximately $30 million, which
includes property acquisition, design, and construction of the Project.

Packet Pg. 14

2.B.1

Among other agreements, the Project will require one or more Intergovernmental Agreements), which are
expected to include the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

A reimbursement or payment process for eligible Project costs
A timeline for Project implementation
A Project design and construction approval process
Allocation of costs between the parties
Other necessary actions or responsibilities of the parties

In addition, RTD and the City will work together to draft an operations and maintenance (O&M)
agreement for the Project. The O&M agreement will detail each party’s responsibility for operating and
maintaining the transit improvements, public spaces, right-of-way, parking, and other improvements.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and CEO or her designee the authority to negotiate and
execute all documents and funding transfers necessary for the design, construction, and maintenance of
a new Transit Facility near the future terminus of the B Line in the City.
The execution of any Project agreements would only be authorized if the following conditions are met:
1. The Project must meet RTD engineering requirements for safety, security and transit operations,
as determined by RTD.
2. The Project must include a minimum of 200 parking spaces for RTD users and a minimum of 10
bus gates, or such other number of gates acceptable to RTD.
3. The City will acquire all real property required for the Project.
4. The City is expected to fund acquisition and RTD is expected to fund Project design and
construction. At its sole discretion, RTD may fund a portion of the acquisition.
5. RTD will not allocate any funds to the Project beyond the $17 million reserved by the Board of
Directors in 2011 without further Board approval.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this Project, which the Board of Directors authorized in 2011, is captured in the FY2021
Amended Budget. As such, no additional funding is needed.

Contract Awards for Architectural and Engineering
Services

Committee Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
October 5, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to negotiate and execute all
necessary documents to award separate contracts to Short Elliott Hendrickson, Inc. and HDR
Engineering, Inc. for architectural and engineering services for a total value not to exceed $5 million for a
duration of three years, with two one-year options to be exercised at the agency’s sole discretion.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Mechanical, electrical, architectural, structural, roofing, civil, landscaping, design and engineering
services are being procured to supplement internal architectural and engineering capacity. Some
examples of the work that may be awarded under these contracts are roof repairs, fleet electrification
related infrastructure modifications, bus washes, pits, lifts, hoists, crane installations, air conditioning,
and boiler replacements. These projects are included and have been approved in the Mid-Term Financial
Plan.
The Brooks Act (Public Law 92-582) applies to this solicitation and requires that the acquisition of
architectural and engineering services be based on demonstrated competence, capability, and
qualifications at fair and reasonable prices, rather than solely on price competition.
DISCUSSION
A request for proposals was publicly advertised on August 12, 2021. Five proposals were received on
September 16, 2021. The technical evaluation committee met on September 27, 2021 for the purpose
of rating the proposals and determined that two proposers, Short Elliott Hendrickson, Inc. and HDR
Engineering, Inc., were the most qualified consultant teams. Leveraging two contracts will better support
future work needs.
A Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) goal of 20% was set for this contract. Both Short Elliott
Hendrickson, Inc. and HDR Engineering, Inc. have committed to 20% DBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact will not exceed $5 million.
