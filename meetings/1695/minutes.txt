cameras for all thirty vehicles at a cost not to exceed $6,575 per vehicle. The total
not to exceed cost for all thirty-two busses and security cameras $1,943,040.
It is the recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase
the contract with the current 4-Car Platform Extensions-Phase II Contractor,
Krische Construction, in an amount not to exceed $150,000 for a total contract
value of $2,526,876.04 to complete conduit and power supply installation for the
Smart Card Readers at Invesco Station.
MOTION:

Director Cohen made the motion to move
these two action items to the September
21, 2010 Board agenda.

SECOND:

Director Malpiede seconded the motion.

VOTE ON
MOTION:

The motion passed Unanimously.

Discussion:
On the purchase of the thirty-two cutaway buses, Director Cohen noted that the
cost of the security cameras appear relatively high. AGM Bruce Abel agreed that
there appears to be a disparity in this cost and they anticipate it will come down.
Director Christopher queried if given the economy, has staff given any reconsideration to our rolling stock. Bruce Abel responded yes.
Director Martinez asked if any call-n-ride might be on the bubble for service cuts.
Bruce Abel responded he could only speak to the proposed 2011 which does not
indicate any. They would look to the Board for guidelines.
Director Busck indicated that the call-n-ride services need to be evaluated to see if
we can better utilize the money on fixed route service. He would like to see an
analysis if it is cost effective.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors approve moving the proposed January 2011 Service Charges
(Attachment A) on the public review and comment.
MOTION:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to
move the proposed January 2011 service
changes to the September 21, 2010 full
Board agenda.

SECOND:

Director Cohen seconded the motion.

VOTE ON
MOTION:

The motion passed unanimously.

Discussion:
AGM Bruce Abel indicated they tried to take a surgical approach taking into
considerations the standards and feedback from Board members. Board members in
general expressed their appreciation of this approach.
Director Pulliam expressed a concern for the proposal to eliminate service at Coal
Creek. He shared a letter from the alternative service agreeing to a 12% reduction
in their subsidy while they focus on trying to build ridership. He asked staff to take
this under advisement and work with the alternative carrier. Several other Directors
expressed concern for total elimination of service. Director Martinez stated it has
been his experience that it is very difficult to bring service back once it has been
eliminated.
Director Brohl has several questions around the change based on her mantra to not
foreclose transit. Jesse Carter responded to her questions on the route 0 and route
79.
Director O’Boyle requested a meeting to better understand the 16 Street Mall traffic
patterns. Staff will follow-up.
Director Tobiassen shared feedback from his fare public hearing where constituents
expressed concerns on the 120 bus.
II.

RTD Rail Operations – Update & Overview
Austin Jenkins, newly hired AGM for rail operations, presented a PowerPoint
presentation on his observations of the RTD rail system. Bill Bell and Phil Eberl,
managers, assisted in the presentation. In general, he was very complimentary of
the staff, their ingenuity and ability to provide a quality system that is growing and
will put RTD in the top tier in North America.
He provided a few challenges, primarily expanding an aging system, keeping the
system safe and in state of good repair and attracting and maintaining a skilled
workforce. He also provided the results from a study by LTK that indicated areas
that RTD should address:
 Staffing levels in light of system growth
 succession planning
 rules and procedure revision
 implementation of a scheduled carbody and truck overhaul program
 provision of required resources.
For a copy of the presentation, please refer to the Operations minutes located in the
Board office.
Discussion:
Director Tobiassen referenced the State of Florida who had been experiencing
lightening hits and asked how was the RTD system. Austin Jenkins responded the
new looked good and our ultimate goal is not to run the old cars as much.
However, due to the automatic passenger count and the ads on the old ones this
could impact change out. Bill Bell indicated the old stations did not have lightening
arrestors but the new ones do. Director Tobiassen wanted to know the plan for the
old substations. Austin indicated he will get back to him.

Director Malpiede inquired about the staffing and succession plan. Austin Jenkins
indicated it is not a mature plan yet.
Director Bagley requested follow-up on a timeline (window) when the four car
platforms would be available and full operational for the SW line.
He also requested information on when the SW avoidance line would be established
and operational. Dave Genova will provide an update.
III.

Southeast Corridor TVM Upgrade – Bankcard Payment Acceptance
AGM Bruce Abel and John Stark, project manager, presented this item. Bruce Abel
stated what they were looking for from the Board was some indication of whether
to include the projected $360K retrofit in the 2011 budget and where the sources
of funds would come from.
After some discussion, there was general consensus not to include in the 2011
budget but to have staff provide some additional analysis to include program paying
for costs possibilities (i.e. transaction fee to pay for capital costs), savings on
maintenance cost if eliminate cash, simplifying payment options to one or two,
utilizing emerging technologies, and offering protection of the system against
breakdown (system redundancy).
Director Bagley requested information on how much and a possible timeline to do
SW. Staff will prepare a memo for SW, Central and CPV.
