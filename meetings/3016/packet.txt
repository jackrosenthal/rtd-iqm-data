BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

N Line Bus and Rail Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A. This
will result in a net neutral base system cost, and an estimated N Line Commuter rail service cost of
$27.4 million annualized; and further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments, as necessary, for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming
North Metro rail line also known as the N Line will represent significant milestones in achieving improved
connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan (North Metro)
contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network capable of connecting the
commuter rail service to RTD’s greater network of services. Recommendations in this proposal were
developed using a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions; service area demographics; transit
market research; route performance and analysis; and stakeholder input.
The N Line service area borders I-25 on the west, I-76 on the east, E-470 in the north, and Denver
Union Station in the south. Northglenn, Thornton, and Commerce City are the primary cities in the study
area with parts of Federal Heights included as well. The service area also includes some unincorporated
areas in Denver and Adams Counties.
The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line between Denver Union Station (DUS) and 162nd
Avenue in Adams County. As part of Phase one of the North Metro Corridor, the N Line will operate on a
13-mile segment between DUS and 124th Avenue Station at Eastlake. This segment, with six stations, is
expected to open in 2020 with presently available funding. The remaining planned section from 124th
Avenue Station to 162nd Avenue will have two stations and will be built and operated as Phase two of
the North Metro Corridor though it is currently unfunded.
DISCUSSION
The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan aims to build a network with bus and rail services that are well
connected and easy to use. To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of
limited operating resources, it is important that the proposed service change adhere to the RTD Service
Standards and be consistent with RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit network.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Providing good connections to the N Line Commuter Rail stations utilizing the service currently in the
area, required extending nearby route services into the new stations, resulting in the need for additional
resources. This is due to the amount of added distance to serve the stations in the corridor. However,
the increased resource expenditure does not result in a higher level of service frequency, though it is
hoped that higher levels of ridership will increase the warrants for additional service in the future.
Additionally, the cost impacts of the proposal are offset by savings found in the previous B and G Line
Bus and Rail Service Plan in terms of vehicle requirements (bus) and service hours.
It is important to note the reasoning behind the approach to this service plan as stated in the North
Metro Corridor Final Bus Operations Service Plan:
Route Design Strategies
For optimum performance of a transit network accompanied by best resource utilization, a clear
vision for the entire network is as essential as it is imperative for individual routes to attract
ridership. The following strategies have been used as guiding principles to inform
recommendations for study area bus routes. This framework is expected to result in routes with
both improved operating efficiency and customer attractiveness.
Route Streamlining
The N Line service plan aims to eliminate deviations unless they add value for significant numbers
of riders by serving major destinations, transit hubs, and rail stations falling within the corridor.
Additionally, the proposed recommendations look at streamlining bus transit to increase efficiency
and productivity, while facilitating network integration with the N Line.
Stop Consolidation
A balance between efficient stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit and reducing
unnecessary delay leads to improvements in transit service effectiveness. Even though stop
consolidation is not proposed in Phase I of the North Metro Corridor project, it is recommended
that RTD continue this program throughout the bus network.
Route Segmentation
In some cases, certain routes perform much better in specific segments. This trend may be a
result of a very long route serving large geographic areas, parts of which may not be as well
suited for transit. In such cases, separating the route into two distinct routes not only improves
adherence to set schedules, but improves efficiency. In the North Metro Corridor, Route 92 is an
example of a route with relatively low ridership from Washington Street/88th Avenue to Summit
Grove Parkway, and higher ridership for rest of the route. This service is a candidate for route
segmentation.
Low Performing Service Replacement
In areas where a route or route segment performs poorly and has limited scope of improvement in
performance, alternatives to fixed route service are considered. These alternative mobility options
include Flex Rides, special shuttles, service routes (tailored for specific trip making, e.g. seniors),

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

or commute oriented programs (e.g. station vans, car/bike sharing). These options maintain
service coverage as well as reduce RTD’s net subsidy.
Rail Service
Per most recent simulation from LTK consultants (June 2019), operating plan consists of a 20minute peak and 30-minute off-peak headway. This includes the same vehicles, schedule margin,
station dwell times, minimum turn times at terminals, and three added signal restrictions. In
addition, the A Line has priority in the Denver Union Station (DUS) throat and a southbound N
Line train may experience delays, due to a westbound A Line train operating behind schedule.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public meetings and a number of
comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website, along with letters received are
summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the N
Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/Brighton: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
Route 128 –Broomfield/Wagon Rd: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is estimated to be net neutral. The
operating and maintenance costs of the N Line is $27.4 million and to be paid from the FasTracks
budget.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed N Line bus and rail service changes
has found no disparate impact or disproportionate burden.

Notes & Public Comments

-

Where will the 93L start and stop?
What is the logic of making the 12 go to 112th as opposed to Wagon Rd?
The 41L will compete with the N Line, which is confusing. Weren’t you getting rid
of the R already because of that conflict?
Can we move Mountview stop to connect to the 32?
Would love a way to connect from Brighton to main systems on the weekend.
Is the 39L going away?
What is the 120L time span?
Are we on track for Q1 2020?
Will train frequency be shortened to 15 minutes in the future?
When will route schedules be published?
In regards to routes you’re not currently changing, what will be the impacts to
frequency after the N Line opens?
Will 122X change if the N Line takes ridership away?
Does the 120L run on weekends?
Will 120L run though Brighton PnR on weekends?
Where will the 120L start and stop?
What is the access to the 104th Station?
Studies show that parking does not increase ridership, and lots of people would rather
take the bus because it is cheaper than the train.
RTD should do a better job of reaching out to less-engaged communities.
We need to have more people at these meetings; do bus riders know about these
meetings?
What is the parking situation at the 124th Station?
How much do special events impact schedules to serve customers after standard
hours?
Is the Rockies bus still running?
How would we know if there’s special service for a large event? I don’t see it on the
RTD app.
We need a phone number where you can call to get information, or we need the
special service notifications more visible on the app.
Route 62 is the only route that has special service listed online.
Are the rails grounded?
So this isn’t considered light rail?
What is the seat configuration of the N Line?
Do the N Line cars have steep steps like the light rail or level boarding?
Will any more buses be going to Eastlake Station?

What is the timeline for stations even further to the north?
Will there be bus stops at Melody, Grant and Huron on 112th and 104th?
Sometimes private money pushes out public money. We need more citizens involved.
Can we increase parking at Wagon Road?
If ridership increases, will you have more cars instead of the married pairs?
What kind of train is pictured on the last slide of the presentation?
What is the purpose of the 145X?
Could an earlier connection be made to the 145X or could it be rerouted down Bridge
St?

There’s no mention of change to the 39L, please make that more clear.
Did you get rid of route 17 to Red Rocks, or is it now the 125?
When will the parking spaces be open at Thornton PnR?
Are any parking expansions planned for other stations along I-25?
Was the Riverside Cemetery entrance issue resolved with the N Line?
Are there tentative dates or milestones available to the public?
Do we have a risk registry?
What happens when you extend north of 124th? Will the N Line be shut down during
construction?
Why is the proposed schedule for route 92 shorter than it is now?
Please explain the 92 & 93L frequency.
When will the Commerce City station be open?
Will FlexRide be available at any stations?
Does the RTD provide special service for soccer games?

Will these trains have the same PIDS systems as the A Line?
When will phase 2 begin?
Bus to bus transfers are a harder sell than bus to rail. Why not connect 114 to
Eastlake?
80/80L is only 6 miles long. Lots of development west of the western terminal. Would
be very cheap to extend the route further west.
Why is 520 the way that it is?
Could 48 frequency be increased in the peaks?

BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Board Chair & Director,
District C

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct Final
Report and Revised Code of Conduct

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Chair of the RTD Board of Directors presents to the Operations and Customer Service Committee a
motion to approve the final report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct (Ad Hoc Committee)
and the revised RTD Code of Conduct (Code), attached.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manger’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership
Task Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The Code was first approved by the Board in 2016, at a time when large transit agencies across the
country were adopting similar codes. Over time, staff recognized that revisions to the Code were needed
and presented those revisions to the Board for approval, following considerable debate, in April 2020.
The Ad Hoc Committee, composed of RTD staff and key stakeholders from the community, was formed
shortly after and was charged with ensuring that the Code would:
• Continue to work toward preserving the safety, cleanliness, and accessibility of RTD’s system;
• Be enforced fairly, consistently, and equitably; and
• Address public safety needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed each rule and provision of the Code at length. The Committee members were
asked to cite their specific questions and concerns regarding the Code and suggest realistic changes to
address those concerns. The suggested changes were vetted by the Committee and incorporated into
the attached version of the Code, which must be readopted by the Board before going into effect.
ALTERNATIVES
1) To approve the final report and Code.
2) To amend the final report, the Code, or both.
3) To postpone action on the adoption of the final report and Code.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the adoption of the final report or the Code.

RTD Code of Conduct
for Persons on RTD Vehicles, Facilities or Property
December 20, 2016
Revised July XX, 2020
1. Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering transportation safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and costeffective transportation throughout the District to all constituents. RTD strives to ensure that everyone is
treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for the safety, convenience,
and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules
prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles
(including RTD buses, access-a-Ride vehicles, call-n-Ride vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail
vehicles), facilities (including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and
fountains, and administrative, operational, and maintenance facilities), or property. Prior to
enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited
by this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement
ranging from a verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5:
“Enforcement”). Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (see Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”).
2. Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016 by RTD’s Board of Directors and
thereafter amended on July XX, 2020.
3. Prohibited Conduct:
A person (including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to
companies, clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from
committing, attempting to commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit,
the following acts on any RTD vehicle, at any RTD facility, or on RTD property unless otherwise specified
in this Section:

Fares / Locations
1. Being within any RTD fare paid zone without prior payment of the proper fare.
2. Riding an RTD vehicle without proper fare or complying with RTD fare payment
management systems (including but not limited to failure to obtain and keep evidence
of payment such as transfers and tickets, validate a mobile ticket, and failure to tap
smart card media in accordance with RTD procedures).
3. Failing to possess or to purchase upon request fare of transportation when at an RTD
transportation facility or station or failure to validate a mobile ticket prior to boarding an

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive, RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
• Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service
Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of Civil
Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.
5. Enforcement:
RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
in the administration of this Code of Conduct.
If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by a disability, RTD
personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
Enforcement will be conducted in a fair and reasonable manner. A person who engages in any of the
above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility,
or property by a law enforcement officer, an RTD Transit Security Officer, an RTD Bus/Light
Rail/Commuter Rail Line Supervisor, or other authorized RTD personnel. Such personnel are
authorized to issue an order to the person to exit RTD property for up to the remainder of the service
day.
Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to
do so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.

September 2020 Service Change Update

Information

DISCUSSION
This is, in part, an effort to inform the Board of Directors of staff’s intent to implement incremental
changes to service, as a part of the September 2020 operator vote, which is required in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement. The CBA identifies three periods each year (January, May and September) where
the employer agrees to provide operators the opportunity to vote different work schedules.
As reported by various departments within the District, we are still heavily impacted by policies relating
to COVID-19. Our current social distancing policies limiting capacity on transit vehicles make the return
to “normal” service levels more than difficult at this time. More to the point, ridership remains at a third
of former levels, largely affected by reduced commuter activity and low employment center occupancy.
However, in accord with our Collective Bargaining Agreement, we must give our transit operators the
opportunity to vote new work schedules. At the same time, staff will make incremental changes to our
services in an effort to increase on-time performance; implement the long-awaited N Line service plan;
and make room for the return of school service. The following are the key changes staff will make in the
September Operator Vote:
•
•
•

Introduction of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan under COVID-19 protocols, which
provide Saturday Levels of service for both bus and rail. N Line rail will operate on a
30-minute all-day frequency
Minor schedule adjustments to increase on-time performance on the following services:
15, 21, 30, 31, 83, 204, 326, NB, H, R and W Lines
Return of school tripper service operated via Special Service Order, to maximize
flexibility, as school districts complete their plans for the upcoming school year

These changes will be produced using our normal processes to ensure that information will be posted to
our customers both online and in print. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of
these changes, and propose adjustments and service alternatives, as appropriate, in future service
change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service, when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

Service Performance 2019

DISCUSSION
RTD’s Mission is "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." This has led to
developing a family of services to match different travel markets. RTD Service Standards & Policies are
used to establish performance requirements for each class of service and identify shortcomings and
successes. The attached report highlights routes that are underperforming due to subsidy per boarding or
boardings per hour so that we can assess the necessary adjustments to improve sustainability.

Service Performance 2019
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network to
accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus improving
performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures

the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy

The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).

Overview

1.C.2.a

Definitions
• Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
• Vehicle (Train) Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
• Fare Revenues: A new revenue allocation model was implemented in 2017. Revenue allocation is based on
cash fare equivalents, fare zones, rider surveys and total fare revenue. The average fare for local bus service
is calculated as a basis, then local cash fare equivalents are calculated by fare zone. These average fares are
then applied to boardings by route, class and zone.
• Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets, excluding interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
• Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10% of
routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the
acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of
service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming
the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence
intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the
current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Up through 2017 RTD determined bus service (not rail) boarding counts from farebox
data. In 2018 RTD changed to using Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) to determine boardings. For the
year 2018 bus boardings were 13% higher using APCs instead of the farebox. This adjust must be made when
comparing ridership before and after 2018. Also, in 2018 the new fare revenue allocation model was
implemented.

Comparison by Class of Service

Bus boardings and service hours reasonably match each other as shares among the service classes. Rail and
Mall services carry many riders relative to the resources they require, while FlexRide and Access-a-Ride are the
opposite. The Subsidy per Boarding (cost-effectiveness) and Boardings per Hour (productivity) charts also
reflect these balances, though rail has a lower cost-effectiveness and higher productivity than bus services.

It is useful to compare all of the classes of service together to help judge the equitable distribution of services
throughout the District. One size does not fit all, so there are a variety of services classes to meet a variety of
market needs, each with its own performance expectation or standard. Customer market share by class of
service is depicted in the Boardings chart and resource allocation is depicted in the Vehicle Hours chart. Since
a boarding may be a transfer and over 50% of all customer trips include at least one transfer, there is overlap
among the classes which is not captured in the chart. Often a customer’s trip could not be completed without
the connectivity that RTD purposefully designs into its networked family of services. The map illustrates RTD
services by service class and the underlying density warrants for service coverage.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of June, 2020 listed in route number order.

Route 27 East Yale Ave – This service has been modified to increase its efficiency. The new Route 27 – East
Yale service now operates between University Hills and Ulster - Tufts. The former Route 27 west of
Englewood Station to Wadsworth and Hampden is now a western extension of the Route 35. The former
routing east of Colorado Boulevard is now an extension of the Route 46.
Route 31L North Federal Limited - This route has been discontinued with the implementation of the G Line bus
and rail service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy continue to perform below standards, likely due
to changing demographics east of the CBD. With the move of the VA Hospital, this service continues to
perform below standards.
Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was replaced in August 2019 with the new Platte Valley FlexRide service.
Route 53 North Sheridan - New service implemented with the G Line Rail and Bus Service plan, replacing the
former routing of the Route 51 north of US 36.
Route 55 – New service implemented with the G Line Rail and Bus Service plan; discontinued with the May
2020 Service Change due to low ridership performance.
Route 55L – Service replaced in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan with portions of the Route 55 and the new
commuter rail access to the downtown.
Route 67 Ridge Road – This service meets the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. It was recommended for discontinuance in 2012, but it was retained due to the absence of
alternative services in the SW Jeffco area.
Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — This route was discontinued with the implementation of the G Line bus
and rail service plan.
Route 80L West 80th Limited – Significantly under performing in both ridership and subsidy standards, this
route has been merged with Route 80 in the G Line bus and rail service Plan.
Route 104X Commerce City Denver - Serving a relatively small commuter market, this service saw a decline in
ridership and an increase in operating cost which has pushed its subsidy per boarding below 10% standard
although it meets the productivity standard.
Route 112 West 112th Avenue – Currently this route exceeds the 10% boarding per hour standard, but falls
slightly short of the 10% standard for subsidy per boarding. Route restructure in May 2018 made to improve

the efficiency of the route. This service is proposed to be modified in the upcoming N Line Bus and Rail Service
Plan.
Route 116X South Simms – This service meets productivity standard, but has performed below the subsidy
standard since the introduction of the W Line light rail service. A slight reduction in operating cost shows
decrease in subsidy per boarding for 2018. Further service modifications were approved for the May 2020
Service change.

Route 128 Broomfield/Wagon Road - Route falls short on both subsidy and boardings standards. Route
restructure occurred in May 2018 to improve overall efficiency. Further adjustments are proposed in the N
Line Bus and Rail Service Plan.
Route 131 Iliff – Current service falls below the subsidy per boarding standard for Urban Locals. However, the
boardings per hour performance has improved over 2018 figures.
Route 139 Quincy – Meets productivity standard, but is just below the 10% subsidy standard. Will be
monitored.
Route 145X Brighton/Denver Airport - This service continues to fall below the subsidy standard, but meets
productivity standard.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — A service reduction was made in August 2018 to improve productivity. There was a
slight increase in productivity, but a large increase in operational costs has worsened the subsidy per boarding
and it does not yet meet standards. A service reduction was proposed for the May 2020 service change, but
was modified after the public input process.
Route 169L Buckley/Tower DIA Limited – Due to the length of this service and surrounding land use, it falls
short of the subsidy standard, but significantly exceeds the productivity standard. The route was truncated at
Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run in 2018 , in an effort to increase effectiveness and come into compliance with the
CBA.
Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield – January 2019, route was extended to serve the Kestrel Development, which
should increase ridership. This service will be reviewed for further service modifications.
Route 236 Boulder Junction/US 36 & Table Mesa - Service was introduced in January 2017. This service was
eliminated with the January 2020 service change, due to continued poor ridership performance.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved
somewhat. It remains below subsidy and productivity standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and rail
service plan. The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe and

the Route 410 in Parker. Service meets productivity standards, but falls slightly below the subsidy standard.
Will be monitored.
Route CV Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver – This route is below subsidy standard, but above ridership standard.
Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018. Additional, service adjustments were adopted in the May
2020 service change proposal.

Route R/RC/RX Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased modestly,
but it still does not meet service standards. Two midday trips were discontinued January 2019, due to low
ridership and to improve subsidy performance. Further changes will be made to these services with the N line
Bus and Rail Service Plan slated for 2020.
Interlocken FlexRide – Low performance has been impacted by employee/employer occupancy and fuel
pricing.
Lone Tree FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. Both ridership and
productivity improved slightly from 2016. However, the City has their own Lone Tree Link service since 2015,
which competes for ridership between the Lincoln rail station and several large employers. With the opening
of SERE in 2019, the Link service was reduced and the FlexRide will be reevaluated.
Louisville FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. RTD is working with City
on marketing service and adding a shopping trip to help ridership.
Platte Valley FlexRide - New service replacing former Route 33 – Platte Valley.
Wagon Rd FlexRide – New service introduced in November of 2019, ridership has grown to 2.5 boardings per
hour in April-May 2020.
A Line – This service is within the overall rail ridership standard, but falls slightly short of the subsidy per
boarding standard. The service will be monitored and evaluated for service adjustments.
G Line – Service introduced in April 2019 though the bus feeder network was not implemented until August of
2019. Ridership and subsidy levels fall short of the overall rail standard. The service will be monitored and
evaluated for service adjustments.
R Line – Continues to falls short of the ridership standard, with additional service added to Saturday due to
FTA contractual requirements associated with the Southeast Rail Extension project. Modifications of the
service were proposed and adopted in the May 2020 service change.

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• Strong support for service to social equity populations
• Limited support for achieving a low cost (to RTD) per boarding metric
• TWG and AC strongly supported high frequency service to areas with
transit-supportive land uses over spreading service throughout the
District
• All groups favored the idea of a regional transit backbone provided
by RTD and exploring local community partnerships to operate/pay
for local service
• Board of Directors is not yet well aligned around the other near-term
service investment philosophies

• Service provided south of Lincoln is more than warranted
• Rail capacity provided along R line is more than required – two-car trains
required because of SCADA software limitations
• Desire to break trains in low-demand periods to better match service to demand
• Five independent train lines merging at I-25/Broadway results in 20 train
trips/hour – high risk of train delays in this segment
• Ridership drop-offs in fringe periods
• Reported train congestion at RidgeGate in peak periods (12 train trips/hour)
• Need for longer overnight maintenance window

BACKGROUND
This is an update on the General Manager’s Core Goal #2: Address Transit Equity:
• Create a Plan to Strengthen Relationship with Disability Community.
RTD staff met and discussed different ways to improve our relationship with the disability community
through our existing ADA committees. A proposed plan was created and submitted by the initial
deadline of May 15, 2020.

Attachment: ADA Committees At RTD (4256 : Update on GM Core Goal #2: Address Transit Equity)

FROM:

Within the past few years, RTD has increased efforts in our communication and engagement with the
disabled community by establishing a new Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD)
and restructuring our existing ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC).
The 13-member ACPD committee explores ways to improve RTD services for people with disabilities.
It focuses on ADA-related issues with regards to fixed-route bus services, rail services, employment
and communications at RTD.








ACPD members are selected through an application process. Members are assigned 1, 2 and
3-year terms to create staggered terms and create continuity as members reach the end of their
terms. Each member may apply for a second 3-year term after a one-year hiatus. No person
shall serve more than two terms.
ACPD members elect a chairperson and a co-chair from among its members. The chairs will
each serve a two-year term.
ACPD is an advisory group; therefore, its decisions will take the form of recommendations to
a Steering Committee comprised of RTD AGMs or Senior Managers.
The purpose of the ADA Steering Committee is to provide and support a multi-directional
communication channel for RTD senior leadership to identify, discuss, direct, and
communicate RTD responses to ADA-related concerns.
ACPD meetings are held on a quarterly basis.

Although, ACPD has been operating successfully within the last couple of years, the following are
some alternative improvements that we are considering implementing that we think can enhance the
efficiency of ACPD and bring about positive changes:


Propose that ACPD meet every other month



Propose that an RTD Board member appointed by the Board Chair be added to the
ACPD Steering Committee as a member and bring forward a periodic update to the
Board during the Civil Rights Committee update meetings.



Propose that ACPD provides a copy of the meeting minutes to the RTD Board

It should be noted that ACPD and RTD staff work to ensure a successful division of labor between
ACPD and APAC so that the two advisory committees are not giving advice on the same topic. To
promote communication between the two advisory committees, RTD makes every effort to make
committee appointments such that one member is serving simultaneously on both ACPD and APAC.
APAC is also comprised of 13-members and it is geared towards promoting an effective, efficient, and
customer-responsive paratransit services at RTD. APAC members consult with RTD staff on issues,
trends, needs, policies, and resources pertaining to Access-a-Ride services throughout the district and
offer a unique perspective with the goal of continuously improving those services.

APAC members are also selected through an application process. Members were initially assigned 1, 2 and 3-year
terms to create staggered terms and create continuity as members reach the end of their terms. Each member may
apply for a second 3-year term after a
one-year hiatus. No person may serve more than two terms.
APAC meetings are conducted by a third-party facilitator
This is an advisory group; therefore, its decisions will take the form of recommendations to the RTD staff
APAC meetings are held every other month
APAC provides a copy of their meeting minutes to the RTD Board
APAC provides periodic report to the RTD Board of Directors

APAC provides valuable input on paratransit-related matters, including improved vehicle design for a new fleet purchase.
Both APAC and ACPD committees include community members with disabilities, advocates for the disabled, travel
trainers, and representative organizations.
Although, APAC went through a major restructuring about 4 years ago, we think that there is an opportunity to recommend
some new changes that would essentially enhance the efficiency of APAC:





Propose that APAC adopts a Steering Committee made up of at least 5 RTD Senior Managers or AGMs

Propose that an RTD Board member appointed by the Board Chair be added to the Steering Committee
member of APAC and bring forward a periodic update to the Board in the Operations & Customer Service
Committee, it's sponsor
Propose that APAC adopts the same format that ACPD uses to make recommendations or bring concerns to RTD’s
attention

Handout (a) – RTD TAM Plan Elements

1. INVENTORY

Revenue vehicles

These are the assets classes needing to be addressed in the agency TAM Plan
and is the foundation to robust Asset Management System (AMS).

Infrastructure
Facilities
Equipment
Systems

An inventory answers these basic questions:
• What assets do we own? – Unique Identifier
• How old are our assets – In Service Date
• How long should our assets last? – Estimated Useful Life
• What is it going to cost to replace? – Estimated Replacement Cost

What condition are the assets
in?

Condition assessment is a broad term used by the FTA, as a result, the
condition assessments are prescriptive based on the asset type. Types of
Condition Assessments include:
• Physical Condition
• Performance
• Age

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and processes do we
use to prioritize funding around
those assets described in our
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD executes a process which prepares and updates a sixyear Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP) including projected capital construction
and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund
the capital and operating programs. Part of process includes prioritizing the
projects into three funding categories:
• Compliance
• Renewal
• Enhancement
The Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the primary source for the Renewal
category. The AMP is a list of asset renewals generated by the inventory data
and prioritized by the Asset Management Working Group (AMWG).

4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or output of
those decision support tools and
processes?

The output of the annual Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP) process is two
primary lists of projects: Capital Projects & Capital Maintenance Projects. Each
of these lists is subdivided into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal,
and Enhancement.
The AMP is a list of asset renewals generated by the inventory data and
prioritized by the Asset Management Working Group (AMWG). The GM/CEO is
the Accountable Executive (AE) and must approve the prioritized list of
investments.

2. CONDITION ASSESSMENT

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding principles
for asset management efforts at
our agency?

The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it
is therefore forward-looking in nature and represents our vision and shared
commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management
System applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and
long-term plans for assets to achieve our agency purpose of moving people.

Packet Pg. 171

1.D.2.a

Handout (a) – RTD TAM Plan Elements

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How are we going to execute
the TAM plan at our agency?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework on which to build its Asset
Management System. An established standard auditable by an outside party
creates transparency and trust with the riding public, taxpayers, and governing
bodies.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities:
• Those ongoing asset management activities that RTD performs as part
of ‘business as usual’, and
• Those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification.
TAM activities are a subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources do we need to
execute TAM plan activities at
our agency?

Resources from across the agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management
activities, including the Board, CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Bus Operations, Rail operations, Capital
Programs, Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General
Counsel.
The AMD acts as the asset management subject matter experts that serve an
enabling function to the agency.

9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the agency doing to
ensure that the TAM plan
delivers the intended results?

There are two primary areas of the Evaluation Plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO
55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans
produced by the Agency. RTD intends to regularly review its asset
management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic Asset
Management Plan.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for
ISO 55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit,
through the following measures and sequence:

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - June 2020 (4257 : Service Availability June 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.86% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (May) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

June 2020 – 7.61 hours
June 2019 – 190.12 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1551.60 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2255.04 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in June were bus bridges and the COVID-19
pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.86% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:

2020 Operating Expense Adjustments
The district-wide operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment is
$733.2 million, which reflects a $6.6 million decrease from the 2020 Adopted Budget. This consists of
both increases and decreases to operating expenses as well as year-to-date budget transfers. These
changes result in a decrease of $10.3 million on the Base System, an increase of $1.2 million in
FasTracks Project, and an increase of $2.5 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $10.3 million net decrease for the Base System, budget reductions consist of previously approved
transfers to adjust budget line items and project budgets, intentional reductions by departments in
various line items, expense carryforward reductions, offset by necessary amended budget increases.
• Major reductions to the amended budget consist of $8.0 million in vacancy savings and furloughs
for represented and non-represented employees, $7.5 million in paratransit transportation and
fuel, $1.6 million in other outside services/projects, $1.5 million in Bus operator and overtime
wages, $1.4 million in contract maintenance, $1.3 million in purchased transportation contracts
and diesel fuel purchases, $0.7 million in security services, $0.6 million in software acquisition,
$0.5 million in special projects and public events, $0.5 million in self-insured claims, $0.4 million
in professional development funds and training, $0.4 million in management services, $0.3 million
in low value tools and equipment, $0.2 million in traction power, $0.2 million in oil, diesel
exhaust fluid and gasoline, $0.2 million in repair parts, and $0.2 million in travel.
• These reductions are offset by major increases of $6.2 million for lump sum contribution to the

budgeted appropriately in the adopted budget), $2.5 million in materials and supplies, $1.1 million
in contract maintenance, $0.7 million in management services, $0.5 million in LRT operator

In June of this year, staff presented to the Board projected cash flow scenarios for 2020. The Board
approved the worst case scenario to form the basis of the 2020 Amended Budget, which calls for
additional budget reductions above those that were initially submitted by departments. These initial
budget reductions were reviewed by the Board in May and are shown in the attached Exhibits A, B, and
C. The worst case cash flow scenario requires additional budget reductions of $7.425 million in order to
add a minimum $25.0 million to the unrestricted year-end fund balance at year-end 2020. Subsequent
reductions total $10.5 million, made up of:
Paratransit transportation*
Paratransit gasoline
Southwest Plaza Driver Relief Station (capital)
Self-insured claims
Launch marketing expenses
Total

$6.3 million
$1.3 million
$2.2 million
$0.5 million
$0.2 million
$10.5 million

*savings available due to reduced demand
The incremental budget reduction of $3.1 million plus updated forecast of grant revenue and other
income allow $34.7 million to be added to the unrestricted year-end fund balance, an increase of $9.6
million over the target $25.0 million.
Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will decline slightly by $74,000 from the Adopted
Budget. Debt principal payments will not change. On FasTracks, interest expense is will decline $1.3
million from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not change. These reductions in
interest expense are the result of two refinancings in late 2019 and early 2020. Interest can no longer
be capitalized during construction per a FASB rule. No new financing will be issued during the remainder
of 2020 for either Base System or FasTracks.

Packet Pg. 192

2.B.1

2020 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $98.5 million, consisting of $39.3
million for Base System and $59.2 million for FasTracks (Project). The combined increase over the 2020
Adopted Budget new capital is $58.8 million. These changes result from program changes that have
occurred since the 2020 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes for Base System result in a net increase of $0.5 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. Adjustments to new capital funding since the 2020 Adopted Budget include funding
for charging infrastructure for electric buses, roof replacement at Platte Division, rail replacement at
Central Corridor, Access-a-Ride cut-away buses, 40-ft. transit buses, account-based fare collection
system, Oracle ERP upgrade, rail substation PLC upgrade, and TVM replacements. Please see
Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
New capital changes for FasTracks result in a net increase of $58.3 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. This results from updated project schedules for current projects that changed the
projected expenditures in 2020 and changes in cost estimates (East Line, Gold Line, North Metro).
Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2020 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/19 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2020 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/19 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2019.
Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $450.5 million, a decrease of $123.2 million from
the 2020 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2019 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved project
transfers, project scope changes, deferrals to 2020, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward
amount, the Base System portion is $109.9 million and the FasTracks portion is $340.5 million. For
Base, major capital carryforward projects are the purchase of 40-ft. transit buses, purchase of LRVs,
16th Street Mall Paver Repair, Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project, Central Corridor rail replacement,
CAD/AVL ratio systems software, and Welton Street blank-out screens. For FasTracks, major capital
carryforward projects are North Metro, and close-out for East Corridor, SERE, Gold Line, R Line, and
DUS oversight. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $10.5 million on a combined basis from the
2020 Adopted Budget.

Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $163.8 million from the 2020 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School May 2020 forecast. The 2020 Amended Budget
incorporates the pessimistic forecast that represents a 24.0% decrease from 2019 sales/use tax
revenue. The 2020 Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds September 2019 baseline forecast which
called for a 2.0% increase over the then projected 2019 level. While it is customary to use the
baseline forecast in our budgets, it is believed the pessimistic forecast is appropriate in current
economic and pandemic conditions.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, federal grants, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to
increase $242.3 million from the amount in the 2020 Adopted Budget. On the Base System,
grant revenue is projected to increase $146.5 million from CARES Act funding, increase in 5339
Bus funding, offset by decreases in 5307 capital maintenance grants, 5337 fixed guideway
SOGR grants, FASTER grants, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants. For FasTracks, grants are
budgeted to increase $95.8 million from CARES Act funding, an increase in New Starts, offset by
a lower carryforward amount.
o Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to decrease $37.8 million
due to reductions in project contributions on the Eagle project, offset by increases in thirdparty betterments on North Metro.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to decline in the 2020 Amended Budget for both Base System and
FasTracks. Fare revenue will decline because of pandemic service levels in March/April and
suspension of fares, and uncertainty about when ridership will resume in full in 2020. Fare
revenue is projected to fall to $93.8 million in the 2020 Amended Budget from $158.1 million
projected in the 2020 Adopted Budget, which is a decline of $64.3 million or 40.7%. Of revised
fare revenue, $65.7 million is attributed to the Base System and $28.1 million is attributed to
FasTracks (Operations).
Investment income is budgeted to decline by half from the 2020 Adopted Budget due to the
recent rapid decline in interest rates.
Other income is budgeted to remain unchanged from the 2020 Adopted Budget.

The revenue reduction to RTD from fare losses and the metro area’s decline in sales and use taxes
during pandemic stay-at-home orders are substantial. Much of the 2020 gap will be filled by emergency
appropriations from the U.S. Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act passed earlier this spring. RTD is entitled to $232 million of CARES Act funding for 2020
on a reimbursement basis, intended to cover revenue losses and extra operating costs attributed to
keeping the system safe during the pandemic. Budget reductions in both operating and capital
expenditures have been made to meet the balanced budget mandate, assuming all $232 million in
federal funding is used.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $38.0 million from the
Adopted Budget to $55.5 million reflecting the funding sources and uses described above, amended
budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, and increases to reserves per fund balance policy.

Packet Pg. 194

2.B.1

FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $0.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
its purpose is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the FasTracks schedule without
requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The
FasTracks Internal Savings Account reserve fund is budgeted at $119.6 million, an increase of $16.1
million over the 2020 Adopted Budget from project underruns on FasTracks projects.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2020 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2020 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

longstanding, extending into 2021 and beyond. As a result, General Manager Paul Ballard has convened
the COVID Fiscal Response Task Force and charged that group with developing budget measures to
address these fiscal challenges.
In order to assure our ability to continue serving our riders and the region in the midst of significantly
reduced revenues, it’s critical that the board and agency leadership proceed with care and forethought,
operating from values and principles to appropriately guide decisions to come.
POLICY BASIS
RTD’s mission is to “Meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the district.”
Per the Board Governance Manual, “The Board’s role is a policy making governance board and sets the
strategic direction for the agency.” The Board appreciates staff’s efforts, and strategic and policy
guidance serves to support those efforts.
DISCUSSION
Discussions of the need for principles to guide the agency as it responds to declining revenues have
occurred during the Board workshop of June 4, 2020; in conjunction with a motion made in the June 9,
2020 Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee meeting; and at the Board meeting of June 16, 2020.

Packet Pg. 229

2.B.3

These discussions led to a Board request that a set of COVID budget reduction guiding principles be
brought forward for approval through the Finance, Administration & Audit committee to the Board of
Directors.
After consultation with staff and Board members, several individual Directors support the adoption of the
attached COVID Budget Response Principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt principles to support and guide staff development of budget responses to COVID-related
revenue shortfalls.
2. Do not adopt principles.

RTD COVID Budget Response Principles

Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe:
We will strive to keep our communities connected and our riders, employees and region
healthy and safe.
Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be creative:
We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align
with our mission. Accordingly, service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating
reductions in overhead, breaking down silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative
approaches to service delivery.
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit during the pandemic:
We will strive to maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most
depend upon our services to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.
We will support and value all of our employees.
We acknowledge our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the public
and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage categories, because a humane work environment is
valued by RTD.
Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and expertise:
We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to decision-making for the COVID period,
while planning for the mid-term financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through the Re-Imagine project,
the accountability committee, and stakeholders.
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input:
We will take active measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of CARES
Act money as well as in the decision-making process for measures we adopt to respond to
ongoing COVID financial impacts.

(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

July 8, 2020

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: July 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of June 30, 2020, 9,831 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 6,084 have been
approved, 3,013 have been denied, 729 are pending and the remaining 5 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,013 denied, 1,665 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 461 were denied because their address was out of
District, 65 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 52 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 608 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 162 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
729 pending applications, 680 lack an uploaded photo and 49 are pending for eligibility determination by
a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE.
We saw a significant drop in applications when the social distancing measures related to the COVID-19
pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59% from an
average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 90 through the end of May.
New enrollment dropped again in June but went back to 95 in the last week of June, ahead of RTD
resuming fare collection. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we are seeing a higher percentage of
applicants who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs, or shortly
thereafter.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through May 2020, we issued 480 LiVE MyRide cards
that were used for 11,400 trips. 1,750 mobile app users bought 26,000 mobile 3-hour passes and day
passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 98,000 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many individual
riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to each client
depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

•
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility

requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare
collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19

situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program. Production of the videos will start on July 8.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the
discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.

Execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker (the title will be “outreach
coordinator”). Denver Human Services will start the hiring process.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.
Finalize questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program. We will ask for information about demographics and income level, application
experience, fare products, and suggestions for improvement.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.
