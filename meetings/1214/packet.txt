RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required. For information only.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole while also
continuing to review the impacts of the implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service and the
associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the West
Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate
level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer response to
the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

August 8, 2013
Route 0 - Broadway
Weekday running times adjustments, annualized cost increase is estimated to be $62,000

Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Changes are proposed for weekdays in the Central Platte Valley segment of the route. The 4:50
a.m. trip from 9th/Clermont would be extended to the Rockmont Loop, improving connections to
Union Station via the Millennium Bridge. The 5:39 a.m. trip from Elitch’s would instead start
from the Rockmont Loop at 5:36 a.m. The 5:51 a.m. trip from Rockmont would instead start
from Elitch’s at 5:54 a.m. In the evening, the trip from the Aquarium at 6:34 p.m. would no
longer stop at Elitch’s, as alternate trips are now available. Cost estimated to be $3,500
annualized.
Route 16 – West Colfax
Proposed minor schedule adjustments. Downtown turnaround rerouted to facilitate use of
articulated buses: eastbound from Colfax via Grant Street, 13th Avenue, Bannock Street,
West 11th Avenue to terminal. No change in westbound route. No cost impacts
anticipated.
Route 16Ltd - West Colfax
Proposed minor schedule adjustments involving the Downtown turnaround rerouted to
facilitate use of city transit buses: eastbound from Colfax via Court Place, Broadway, and
16th Avenue into Civic Center Station. No change in westbound route. No cost impacts
anticipated.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
This proposal is for minor schedule adjustments related to relocating the terminal loop at

August 8, 2013

Route 52 – West 52nd Avenue
Realign from current route at West 50th Avenue and Zuni Street via Zuni Street, West 46th
Avenue on to current route at West 46th Avenue and Pecos Street. New alignment brings
service directly to a recently enlarged senior housing development and reduces duplication
with Route 6. Current alignment serves stops for 93 weekday boardings, 60 Saturday
boardings, and 30 Sunday & holiday boardings, of which approximately one-third are
transfers with Route 6, which instead would be available at the intersection of West 46th
Avenue and Pecos Street. All of the affected passengers would remain within walking
distance of Local Routes 6, 44 or 52. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 54 – Montbello Industrial Park
Discontinue 9:05am trip (0 passengers) and 2:05pm trip (1 passenger).
Annualized cost savings are estimated to be $10,000.
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road
Add Sunday/holiday service east of Arapahoe Station to Arapahoe Crossing Shopping
Center. Sunday service hours to match Saturday service on this segment 7:00am to
9:00pm. Cost estimated to be $35,300 annualized.
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
Reduce frequency from every 30 to every 60 minutes, and operate with small cut-a-way
style vehicle. Service frequency matches overall demand, will reduce neighborhood
impacts in Stapleton. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Wadsworth Express (see also South Simms Package)
Due to changes in parallel Route 116X, and to mesh with earlier departure times on Rte 100X, it
is proposed to move the 6:10 p.m. departure from Civic Center Station to 5:40 p.m. Minor
adjustments in morning departure times are expected.
Route 105 – Havana Street
Improve weekday midday frequency to a consistent 15 minute frequency. Current
frequency is 15/15/30, leading to overcrowding and schedule adherence problems on trips
following the 30 minute gap. Cost estimated $62,000
Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Schedule adjustments, no cost impacts anticipated.
Route 135 – Smoky Hill Road
Schedule adjustments, no cost impacts anticipated.
Route 139 – Quincy Avenue

1.C.1.a

Attachment A
August 8, 2013

Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this fall. Minor
schedule adjustments will be made for this change. In addition, the first eastbound Route CS trip
is proposed to operate five minutes earlier than at present. Cost estimated to be $8,200
annualized.
Routes ES and EV – Evergreen/Denver
It is proposed to set the departure time of Routes ES and EV seven to eight minutes earlier on the
first three trips from Evergreen Park-n-Ride to Civic Center Station. No cost impact anticipated.
Route HX – 28th Street/ Civic Center
Add one AM peak trip and one PM peak trip to alleviate overloads; adjust running times
between 19th St/Wynkoop and Civic Center Station in both directions Cost estimated to be
$31,700 annualized.
Route JUMP – Boulder/ Lafayette via Arapahoe
Due to completion of the Arapahoe Road construction, Long-JUMP trips will now serve the
new on-street stops at Boulder Technical Education Center (Arapahoe/63rd) instead of
accessing the stop inside the Boulder Valley School District property. Route patterns and
related trip times will be adjusted to reflect this change. No cost impact is anticipated.
Route P – Parker/Denver
Add southbound trip from Civic Center Station at 3:15pm, relieving overloads on the
current first afternoon trip at 3:45pm. Also, move 4:20pm southbound trip to 4:30pm, for
improved load distribution with 4:45pm trip. Cost estimated to be $23,500 annualized.
Route YL – Lyons/Longmont:
The Route YL is a Boulder County sponsored CMAQ grant funded service that was
implemented in January 2012. Ridership on this service has leveled off at
10 boardings
per day, which is far below the RTD Service Standard for its service type. It is proposed to
discontinue this service. No cost savings would be realized by the RTD, due to the grant
funding of this service.
D-Line Light Rail
This proposal recommends the permanent closure of the currently temporarily closed station on
the Welton Street segment of the Central Corridor. Since January of 2013 stops on the D-Line
service at the 29th & Welton Station have been temporarily discontinued; as part of the effort to
improve schedule adherence on this segment of the Light Rail network. As previously stated in
the January 2013 Board Report, delayed trains affect our customers’ connections with bus
Routes 12 and 43, as well as some transfers for Routes 28 and 38. Additionally, train delays
from this area cascade throughout the system affecting on-time performance on the system as a

W-Line Light Rail
Schedule for weekdays and weekends will have slight adjustments, based on operating
experience. No cost impact anticipated.
Ranches package
Route 77 would have minor schedule adjustments.
Route 401 would have minor schedule adjustments. The 8:18 p.m. westbound and 8:42 p.m.
eastbound trips are proposed to be discontinued, due to low ridership [4 passengers total] (-1
weekday hour).
Route 402Ltd would have minor schedule adjustments. (+2.5 weekday hours if no saved bus in
Route 403)
Route 403 is proposed to be removed from the Dutch Creek deviation. It would continue to
serve Highland Heritage Regional Park from University/Lincoln. It is proposed to discontinue trips
from Littleton/Mineral Station at 8:44 a.m. and from Lincoln Station at 8:52 a.m. due to low
ridership [11 passengers total] (-1.5 weekday hours for trips cut, additional savings from
removing deviation). No cost impact anticipated.
South Simms – Alameda Parkway package
Route 21 is proposed to be returned to its former alignment from West Jewell Ave. via West Yale
Ave., Bear Creek Blvd., and Alameda Parkway and return. Service levels will remain unchanged.
Route 100X (see listing under Service Reductions).
Route 116Ltd is proposed to be rescheduled to increase its span of service, covering times not
covered by Route 116X, as well as retaining the most utilized trips in both morning and afternoon
peaks. Proposed arrivals at Federal Center Station are at 5:48, 7:18 and 8:48 a.m. Proposed
departures from Federal Center Station are at 2:55, 4:25, 5:45 and 7:10 p.m.
Route 116X is proposed to have an additional trip added in each direction, with some trips
rescheduled. Arrivals at Civic Center Station would be at 6:34, 7:14, 7:44 and 8:23 a.m.
Departures – subject to adjustments for gate availability – would be at 3:35 p.m., 4:40 p.m.,
5:25 p.m., and 6:10 p.m. No cost impact anticipated.
Call-n-Ride
Belleview Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion Mitigation Air
Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the Denver South Transportation
Management Association. The Call-n-Ride serves the Denver Technological Center out of
the Belleview Station. In the pm period the Call-n-Ride has been operating a flex route
south of Belleview Ave. Because of the low ridership of the flex route, it is recommended
to discontinue the flex route and have the Call-n-Ride serve our customers by demand
only. No cost impacts are anticipated with this proposal.

whole. Efforts to address the current problem, which stems from the downtown Denver signal
cycle timing change, include the City of Denver’s implementation of traffic signal priority
measures at the intersection of Park Avenue and Welton. The signal improvements and the
elimination of stopping at the 29th Welton Station resulted in a reduction in train delays from
34% of trips on the Welton segment to 17% along the single track section along Welton. Please
see map for more information. No operational cost impacts are anticipated.

Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in December 2003 and the South
Thornton/Northglenn Call-n-Ride began operating in August 2007. These Call-n-Rides are
divided by 112th Avenue. Customers routinely transfer between the two Call-n-Rides at
112th Avenue. This proposal calls for a change that will allow customers to book a trip in
either service area without a transfer. Customers will call the Call-n-Ride that their trip
begins in and will be able to travel to the other Call-n-Ride area without a transfer. No cost
impacts are anticipated with this proposal.

Golden Call-n-Ride began operation in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line Light
Rail under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by
the City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates
one vehicle as a Flex Route and one vehicle as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride. Ridership has
been rising since opening to over 9 boardings per hour. This proposal calls for an
additional 12 hours of Call-n-Ride service be added to the service. Cost impacts are
estimated to be $150,009 (including fuel) annualized.

A Look Ahead: May 2014 – Union Station Opening
With the opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse routes currently serving the Market
Street Station and surrounding area will be redirected to access the new facility. With this
change our customers will be accommodated by the 16th Street Mall Ride and 18th and
19th Street Circulator at Union Station. Services impacted by this change include Routes:
0, 6, 15Ltd, 31X, 40X, 55X, 72X, 80X, 86X, 104X, 120X, BF, BMX, BV, BX, L, LNX,
LSX, LX, S and AF. Additionally, changes are expected on Routes HX and 122X; though
these services terminate at Civic Center Station, expected growth in passenger demand
will require adjustments to the service levels of these routes. Minor schedule adjustments
will be made in nearby Routes: 10*, 28, 32, and 44* (Routes marked with an asterisk
change in January 2014)

Purpose and Methodology
•

At RTD the Customer Satisfaction research is used to:
•
Provide key information on who our customers are and how they use the service
•
What aspects of the service have the greatest influence on customers’ overall perceptions and how well RTD
performs on those factors
•
Compare service types or service areas
•
Monitor the success of improvement efforts
•
Prioritize projects

•

The survey was conducted using a methodology developed to deliver accurate and representative results.
•
RTD invited a random sample of 6,805 customers who are certified to use paratransit services to participate in
the survey, which represents approximately 50% of the active user database.
•

By the time that the survey closed, 1,441 passengers had completed at least part of the survey (response rate
of 21%).

•

The survey could be completed using one of three avenues, according to the customers’ needs. Most
passengers completed the survey in paper-and-pencil format (1,404 participants), but a small number of
participants completed the survey either via a toll free telephone survey (20 participants) or an accessible web
survey meeting the latest accessibility standards (17 participants). Surveys were also available in Spanish, in
the multiple formats, upon request.

•

The excellent response rate provides for a +/- 2.5% margin of error on results reflecting the paratransit
customer base as a whole.

fare you provide” do not vary significantly across income categories.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd Quarter 2013

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2013
for the fixed-route services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable
Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Veolia
Transportation continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and postaccident investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to
emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic
campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. Both of the two passenger
accidents during the 2nd quarter were classified as non-preventable. First Transit
and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct proactive retraining to increase
operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles. Increased passenger awareness training continues to
be a primary focus for all contractors in this area.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive
Maintenance Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. The
contractor organizations place a high emphasis on completing preventive
maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operations are diligent
about completing these inspections on time.

Regional Transportation District



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Longmont met the target of 88.0% Local On-Time Service in the 2nd
quarter. RTD is working with the private contractors to use the OTP report to
identify and campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The contractors
also report that they continue to experience route delays due to construction and
detours. Increased passenger loads and associated boarding delays also contribute
to running behind schedule. The contractors continue to address on-time
performance issues with operators, but always tie safety to the discussion. It’s
better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles
Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors
continue to improve in this area by completing preventive maintenance inspections
on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing
additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining
the buses in their fleets.

Access-a-Ride 2nd Quarter Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership decreased by 4% through the 2nd quarter of 2013 compared to the same period
of 2012. Productivity decreased from 1.27 to 1.23 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 18%. Overall program ridership decreased by only 1%. The
increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to provide
increased service without an increase in resources.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased slightly (approximately 1%) during the
second quarter of 2012. Access-a-Ride is approximately 7% under budgeted revenue hours through the
second quarter of 2013.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the second quarter of 2013 improved as compared to the same period in
2012. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue
meeting and exceeding this standard of performance.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the 2nd quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in
2012. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

2nd Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers conduct fare inspection on-board
buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to
issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, Security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of April, May, and June. These tables list
the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion rate, the
number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers. Arrests
include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is
an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the
authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus
routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program (Phase 1) continues to effectively gather rider taps for bus and train EcoPass
and CollegePass riders. As expected, during the month of August, 2013, taps increased to 999K as
students began returning to school. The Smartcard Customer Service Center, (operated under an RTD
contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.) continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue replacement
cards and answer riders’ questions as they arise.
Site surveys have been completed to determine the feasibility of installing three additional platform
validators at the Colfax at Auraria station and two validators at the 30th and Downing station. In
response to customer comments, other validator locations are being reviewed and work will progress
before the end of the year.
An update to the Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped their SmartCard
prior to boarding has been delivered and the upgrade to the handheld devices has been completed.
Training for Fare Inspectors is completed and the Fare Inspectors continue to operate in an “educate &
inform” mode and the SMT Program Team is working closely with Marketing and RTD Security to
determine the appropriate strategy to educate our riders.
As part of the Phase 2 SmartCard (MyRide – Stored Value) deployment, detailed testing plans have been
developed to fully test the Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals that were delivered to RTD in May.
The scheduled testing in July was delayed. The testing has not been rescheduled due to lingering
concerns regarding Phase 1. While planning for Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing and the schedule
continues to be evaluated to ensure adequate timing for a successful Phase 2 launch, the focus for the
remainder of 2013 will be on these Phase 1 concerns. Phase 1 concerns being addressed include:
 Improvements and repairs to current web functionality. Functionality will improve College Transit
Coordinator adoption of the site and allow for a smoother renewal period for EcoPass customers.
 Repairs to current administrative point of sale functionality
 Repair of approximately 385 broken and defective onboard stanchions (validator mounting
brackets). Work began in late August and is expected to take approximately 10 weeks.
 ADA compliance improvements on existing platform validators
The information outlined below contains the current status of SMT Program activities:

Conducted the site surveys with a representative from RTD’s

Statement of Work is in development that outlines the PV
activities. Work will progress before the end of the year.
A list of sites that are currently configured with cellular
modems has been provided to the Network Team, as well as
those containing both cellular and network connectivity.
Evaluations are under way regarding the cost and timing of
networking all platform validators
We have received feedback from the ADA community that
they would like the platform validators to be upgraded in the
following areas:
Spoken word
Braille stickers
LTK has been engaged to research and document the
requirements for these ADA topics. Xerox is currently
evaluating the proposed changes for the Braille stickers.

repairs
1 HSMR still shows as being on v10 and has not checked
into the network since 2012. This is the HSMR currently
used in Valence.
During the HSMR Testing event, both the User Manual and
the Training Documentation were updated and improved by
the “hands-on” use of the devices. A SmartCard FAQ
document as well as a copy of the training presentation were
provided to each Fare Inspector and incorporated into new
employee training.
Fare Inspector Training was completed the week of August
5th. 80+ Fare Inspectors attended.

The Marketing Web Portal review has been completed. A
matrix that outlines the specific requirements is completed
and will be used by the SMT Program Team and Marketing to
document the adequate level of detail for Xerox programmers
to modify the web site.
Work continues to assist colleges with their bulk
upload/suspend/deactivate activities in preparation for the
start of the school year. Xerox completed the change of the
expiration date on the contracts on the cards prior to the
August 1st deadline.

The Marketing Strategy in the near term will focus on the reeducation of the general public concerning “tapping”
practices when boarding RTD transportation.
Members of the SMT Program Team met with
representatives of the Denver Mayor’s Office and the City &
County of Denver to discuss the strategy and technical
requirements of creating a smart card system that would
provide students with the ability to use one card to gain
access to RTD transportation, Denver recreational centers,
libraries, and their schools. A pilot for this will not occur
until 2014.

Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project
Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project replaces a 1993-era radio and dispatch system. With a
regulatory radio licensing change, the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) required that RTD’s old
radio frequency spectrum be replaced by the end of 2013. Because the legacy CAD/AVL system was so
tightly integrated with the radio system, it was also necessary to replace the CAD/AVL system.
RTD joined the state-wide public safety radio network; is using new frequencies for channels; reduced
capital and operational expenses; and improved coverage over an RTD owned and operated system.
Innovations in Transportation (INIT) was selected as the CAD/AVL vendor, Motorola is the radio vendor
and Sprint provides cellular data service. Now that installations are completed and the legacy system is
being decommissioned, RTD will soon meet its FCC obligations.
As the project nears completion, all onboard equipment has been installed; as well as the radio-only
deployment for Light Rail, Transit Police, Paratransit and non-revenue vehicles. Also other completed
actions include capacity improvements to 6 radio tower sites, fiber and microwave networking and
console installation. The Paratransit vehicles were upgraded to the new cellular data radios for the
Access-a-Ride dispatch software. The Bus Dispatch Operations Control Center was remodeled and all
central technology upgraded.
The programmatic testing and acceptance process included: Factory Acceptance Testing, Factory
System Integration Testing, Onsite Pre-revenue Onboard and System Integration Testing and Radio
system testing. These tests are all successfully completed. Mini-fleet testing is underway and should be
finished in October. Final System Acceptance Testing will start after successful conclusion of mini-fleet
testing that covers a minimum of 60 days of system “burn in” to identify any potential issues or
malfunctions. Training of Operators, Dispatchers, Street Supervisors, System Administrators and
Maintainers is complete. An Operating and Maintenance Plan was developed and implemented.
Following is a capsulated summary of current and upcoming activities.
