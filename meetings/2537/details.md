#### 1. Districtwide Passenger Origin & Destination (O&D) Survey 2015

Lee Cryer, Planning Project Manager, and Ravi Palakurthy, Transportation Planner, presented the findings of the 2015 District Passenger Origin and Destination (O& D) Survey.

Lee Cryer stated there were two separate surveys used in the study.  The On-Off GPS survey captured boarding and alighting pairs that provided accurate recordings of all trips made through transit.  The On-Board survey captured information such as origin, boarding, alighting, destination, mode of access/egress, transfers and fare media.  Both surveys were conducted Monday – Friday during the Spring and Fall of 2015, however the MallRide and MetroRide were not surveyed.

Lee Cryer commented that passengers who participated in the On-Off Survey received bar code cards upon boarding rail and then returned them to staff when they reached their final destination.  Approximately 20% of passengers were randomly selected; and a total of 62,000 cards were collected.  The On-Board Survey was administered by staff through personal interviews on rail and bus via tablets and some interviews were coordinated over the phone.  The On-Board survey focused on trip details and personal and household demographics.  A total of 34,800 interviews were conducted (23,045 for bus and 11,802 for light rail).  Both the On-Off and On-Board surveys were provided in English and Spanish.

Director Bagley asked the FasTracks Committee to highlight two things they have learned from this data and how RTD will utilize this data in the future.

Lee Cryer indicated that staff was cleaning up the data and they have not had the opportunity to delve into the study results or share it broadly throughout the district yet.  Two years after the Eagle project is open, staff will complete a similar survey to see how passengers travel patterns have changed as a result of that major investment.

Director Folska requested the top three findings and the long term implications of the survey.  She asked who conducted the survey, the final cost of the survey, and why the committee did not get the results for over a year.

Lee Cryer said the study was conducted by the ETC Institute, of Kansas City and the final cost of the project was $1.4 million.  He noted that the survey information was collected in 2015 with the analysis completed in 2016.

Director Folska stated that the survey seems similar to studies conducted by Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) and suggested that RTD utilize local universities and business instead of going out of state as it would be more cost effective.

General Manager Genova stated that this presentation is a mere snapshot of the information that was collected and he was particularly interested in the increase of people that use pre-paid media.  He added that the data collected will be utilized by staff in many different ways.

Director Lubow asked how the survey was set up.  She said it was her understanding that the federal government conducts similar surveys before and after projects.

Lee Cryer stated that by understanding the exact route origins, destinations and trip patterns, RTD will be able to isolate the impacts of the West corridor.  He added that this survey will allow RTD to gain the same information for all passengers throughout the district.

Lee Cryer added that RTD now has a robust subset of data that gives staff information on how people are making their trips.  This information was gathered for the entire district because it will allow RTD to improve the pattern model when forecasting.

Director Walker thanked the survey team and said there was a lot of information captured.  He suggested that this information be shared with developers, city partners, and stakeholders; as this type of information is viable to cities when planning their Capital Improvements.  He asked if other jurisdictions were contacted regarding this survey and how it can be used to improve their transit situation.

Lee Cryer said DRCOG will use this data to supplement the household travel surveys and commercial vehicle survey. Also, the City and County of Denver is completing a citywide transit plan and they are asking for this data to assist with their study.  In addition, staff will make sure to inform other municipalities that this data is available for their use.

Director Anderson asked if DRCOG collects similar information.

Lee Cryer remarked that DRCOG’s survey is only done every 10 to 12 years and it is on a broader spectrum in that it does not have the level of detail regarding bus ridership as our study does.

Director Francone asked to schedule a time to review the report in more detail with staff and requested that staff add a map overlay outlining the different RTD districts.

Director Menten requested a detailed copy of the RTD survey results and a copy of the last DRCOG household survey.

Director Sisk thanked staff for the survey presentation.  He agreed with Director Folska about the poor timing of the survey, but he stated that this survey is a great tool to use in our marketing efforts to increase ridership.

Director James stated that if the SmartCard had the tap-off component, RTD could collect GPS data similar to the information collected in the study, at a fraction of the cost.

Chair Tobiassien thanked staff for the great information.

Committee Chair Hoy explained that DRCOG conducts studies that enable us to forecast our future rail lines.  The DRCOG survey is region wide but it does not have all of the detail that we need.  DRCOG’s survey results are dated, but the information that we have collected through this survey is data that we can use today to work collectively with our partners and stakeholders.

Lee Cryer remarked that DRCOG does transit surveys but they are region wide and over 90% of their surveys are based around how people travel by auto; so they have relatively small subsets.

Director Lubow stated that the survey is a treasure of information and it would be great to present the results to our stakeholders, but she would like more information on travel patterns.

Director Folska asked if survey facilitators received permission to interview minors for the study.  Ravi Palakurthy noted that minors were interviewed if they had a parent or guardian with them.

Director Folska suggested that the FasTracks Monitoring Committee reach out to Professor Andrew Goetz at the University of Denver to assess the survey results.

### D. Other Matters

Director Anderson apologized on the behalf of Shelley Cook regarding the 9 News story about the discontinuance of the A-line Shuttle from Arvada to Denver International Airport.  Shelley asked Director Anderson to relay her thanks to the RTD Board for their supportive efforts throughout the years.

Director Bagley stated that his dentist attended the American Dental Association conference in Denver last month and noted that there were no complaints about the rail service to and from the airport from anyone attending the conference.

Director James reiterated Director Anderson’s admiration for Shelley Cook, stating that he had worked with her before.  He said the Arvada A-Line Shuttle is a great example of how the private sector, non-profits and governments can work collectively with RTD.

Director Francone asked to recognize Doug Monroe for a very nice letter he wrote to a constituent about the cancellation of the 116.  She stated that the customer was still not happy, but they were satisfied that Doug reached out to them with sincerity.

Committee Chair Hoy reminded the Board that there will not be any meetings on Tuesday, November 6th or Tuesday, November 22nd.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 6:40 p.m.
