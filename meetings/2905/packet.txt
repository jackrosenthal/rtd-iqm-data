Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 13
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 13 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $978,957.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula and modification to the graphics, radio
wiring and emergency exit door to the original price quotes results in a per bus unit cost of $75,555 for
a FlexRide bus and $73,926 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace
eleven - 2011/2012 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the FlexRide service and provide two
expansion buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2011 and 2012 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 8 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in
service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 13 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $978,966.55. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

Subject:

Purchase Forty-six (46) 40 foot Low Floor
Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the purchase of forty six (46) new 40 foot
transit buses from Gillig, LLC and associated spare components, and extended warranties for a total
price not to exceed $22,527,120 with an option to purchase up to 264 additional 40 foot buses over a
five year period.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 5000 series Gillig 40 foot transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years
or 500,000 miles. The buses are 14 years old and have on average over 600,000 miles of stop and go
transit service. They have become unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service.
A Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on May 20, 2019 for the procurement of new 40 foot transit
buses. Proposals were received on August 13, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from three companies: Gillig, New Flyer and Nova. The proposers submitted
their cost per bus as follows:
Nova Bus
New Flyer
Gillig
$458,924.00 $479,900.00 $462,252.00
The proposals were rated according to costs as well as independent evaluation by members of RTD Bus
Maintenance staff on the ability of the proposers to comply with RTD’s technical specification
requirements, their estimated lifecycle costs and their qualifications. Although Gillig was not the lowest
cost per bus, staff members unanimously rated Gillig the highest in meeting RTD’s technical
specification requirements, lifecycle costs and qualifications, and subsequently Gillig received the highest
overall rating. Gillig has proven experience and qualification in manufacturing of transit buses, being one
of the oldest and most financially stable manufacturers in North America. Gillig also has a history of
meeting delivery schedule requirements.
The 40 foot low floor buses are similar to that which is currently utilized at RTD, with a proven seating
layout that is approved by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) to maximize wheelchair

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

passenger space. The buses are equipped with clean diesel engines meeting the latest EPA requirements.
Overall, the estimated lifetime of each bus will reduce emissions by over 100 tons of greenhouse gases,
6.5 tons of Nitrous Oxides (NOx) and 0.25 tons of Particulate Matter as compared to the engines in the
current 2005 buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The proposed contract is for the purchase of forty six (46) 40 foot transit buses, associated spare
components, and selected extended warranties not to exceed $22,527,120. Funding for this contract is
approved and available in the District’s 2019 Adopted Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 264 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly. Additional future bus purchases from these options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required bid
submittal documents, notice of this approval is provided to vehicle purchasers in the form of a certificate
attesting to this submittal and FTA approval.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to enter into the agreement with Gillig, LLC for the purchase of
forty six (46) 40’ transit buses and various spare components and extended warranties. This is
the recommended alternative.
2. Purchase buses from another manufacturer. This may result in a slightly lower initial capital
purchase price but will result in additional operational costs for spare parts, add complexity to the
fleet thereby reducing efficiency, as well as delay delivery of the buses. This is not
recommended.
3. Do not proceed with the purchase of new 40’ transit buses. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the
project. This will also increase ongoing maintenance costs and affect fleet reliability.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2019. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the
citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals (82.9%) in the second quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 84.5% was below goal of 86.0%. For 2019, the goal of 86.0% reflects passenger OTP,
which is consistent with fixed route. The deficiency is caused by a combination of not being able to
maintain adequate staffing levels, a high rate of operators on FMLA, and the increasing number of trips
requested during peak travel hours along with software limitations of current software to smooth the
demand.
Goal 5.3 – Improve ADA Courtesy
Average ADA complaints per boarding of 0.002 was higher than goal of 0.001. Staffing challenges
are leading to a higher number of complaints.
Goal 6.2 – Increase in Ridership
Year-to-date ridership for 2019 was down 3.5% from 2018. The decline was centered in bus service
and mirrors the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Year-to-date fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 5.4% and 4.0%, respectively, over the
same time last year but are currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 14.2% and 13.6%. These
goals for 2019 are annual measures and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to attrition,
retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy. Bus operator vacancies
are improved over first quarter and year-end 2018. Bus mechanic vacancies have grown mostly in the
body shop which offset improvements in general repair.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2019

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions currently
operated by First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce City
and Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District. The
performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2019 key performance
measures through the 2nd quarter 2019. In the areas where our contract partners fell slightly short of
their individual goals, they implemented both procedural and staff changes which should result in
continuous improvement throughout the remainder of 2019. The following is a more detailed discussion
of fixed route contractor performance through the 2nd Quarter of 2019.


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000
miles through the 2nd quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet goal (2.11) but are addressing
identified trends through enhanced training and safety pep-rallies. As a result of these efforts,
First Transit Denver is already seeing an improvement in the beginning of Q3. First Transit and
Transdev continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations
for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at
monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities
and on the street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 2nd quarter. Of the 9 passenger accidents that occurred during the 2nd quarter, only
one was classified as non-preventable. Transdev did not meet the goal but improved to 0.19
Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles compared to 0.31 during the 1st quarter. All of the bus
operators involved in passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for
addressing passenger safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger
safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per
100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 2nd quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.

Packet Pg. 19

1.C.2



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service through the 2nd
quarter. First Transit Commerce City (85.4%) did not meet the goal due in part to unexpected
detours and traffic. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators
with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly
basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to
discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 86% on-time performance. Running time
issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles between Lost Service
Maintenance Road Calls through the 2nd quarter. First Transit Longmont did not meet the goal
during the 2nd quarter. Deficiencies were identified in First Transit Longmont’s Preventive
Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality Control (QC) practices. Revised procedures have been
implemented to address these issues. A new Maintenance Manager was also hired at the
Longmont facility. Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor the contractor operations to
ensure this goal is being addressed by completing preventive maintenance inspections on-time,
working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for
mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of .0004 Complaints per
Boarding in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool
to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above
regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors
also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
2nd Quarter Summary 2019

RouteMatch Mobile Application Option

Daisy Wall and Mike Holcomb, RouteMatch Community Engagement and IT Developer,
showed APAC the On-Demand mobile application both on screen and using a screen reader.
They demonstrated how a trip would be booked and a few features.
The On-Demand application allows for integration of other types of trips (e.g., taxi, rideshare), as well as RTD trip negotiation and immediate incorporation of the trip into the RTD
system.
RouteMatch is working with two expert/consulting organizations to complete an accessibility
audit (DC in Phoenix, and Georgia Tech Center for Inclusive Design Innovation). They will
identify areas that need to be addressed to improve accessibility.
This application is currently being used in Seattle and Toronto, and RouteMatch is working
to improve the application further to be compliant with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
(WCAG) 2.0 AA, as well as looking to incorporate as many improvements as possible to
comply with the WCAG 2.1 amendment without creating significant time delays.

Update: RTD Rapid Transit Plans

Rapid Transit is a dedicated fixed guideway/lane for transit. It may dedicate an existing travel
lane to buses all day, or only in peak periods, or a lane maybe added and dedicated to buses
(although there are few places where this growth is possible). RTD has not made decisions
about any additional Rapid Transit corridors yet. They are currently conducting a feasibility
study.
Bill Sirois and Michael Washington, RTD, provided an overview of the status of the Rapid
Transit feasibility study. The study started looking at any area where bus rapid transit would
make sense, then conducted several evaluation stages to narrow down the list – eliminating
less feasible options and increasing the data gathered on options remaining.
Currently, they are conducting the tier four evaluation on eight remaining options: Colorado
Boulevard; Federal; Speer/Parker Road; 38th; South Broadway; Alameda; North I-25; and
Havana. Tier four evaluation, among other elements, is considering which corridor will most
successfully meet Federal funding criteria. This tier will result in three-four options for further
data gathering and analysis.
The tier four evaluation results will also feed into RTD’s Transportation Transformation (T2)
planning process. The T2 process is looking at how to optimize service now, and where to

prioritize resources for 2050 (this is the first long-term planning since FasTracks; it is a 2year process).

Other Updates


Update: Review changes to the Access-a-Ride survey
Based on Access-a-Ride feedback there were a few changes made to the survey. The
questions are being finalized and sent to the consultant (BBC Research) who will start
conducting the survey outreach next week.



Status Report: CCDC paratransit Issues mailed and RTD response
CCDC sent a letter to RTD articulating seven concerns, several of them paratransit
related. RTD drafted and mailed a response. In the future, RTD have Access-a-Ride
concerns go through the APAC discussions.



Update on ACPD
May’s ACPD meeting included:
o Awards for eight ADA heroes. One was for an Access-a-Ride receptionist:
Abby De Herrera.
o Specifications for parking areas. Reviewed preliminary data on a third handicap
placard (purple) for people of short stature or wheelchair that cannot reach
the standard parking meter. This is not federally recognized so there are some
places that will not take it.
o Improvements for enforcement handicap placards on private property.
Enforcement is weaker on private property; local law enforcement is less likely
to intercede.
o Safety issues on bus route #20. This route has many medical facilities,
therefore there are more riders with wheelchairs, crutches, etc. Suggestion
was talk with route drivers on how to improve safety.
o Pedestrian lights at civic center are not being observed.
o City and County of Denver’s 16th mall project. The environmental impact study
is nearing completion. Concerns were raised about the project’s proposed
removal of curbs. ACPD will send a letter of concerns and interests to Denver
public works (decisions makers).
o Next meeting is the 3rd Thursday (August 15th?), at Blake street RTD offices.

Special Services 2nd Quarter Report

RTD’s FlexRide services are currently operated by Via Mobility, MV Transit and the Seniors’ Resource
Center. With FlexRide bus divisions located in Boulder, Denver and Evergreen, our contract partners
provide FlexRide services to 21 distinct service areas throughout the RTD District. The performance for
Via Mobility, MV Transit, and the Senior’s Resource Center is measured on Ridership, Customer
Contacts, Preventable Vehicle Accidents and Productivity (boardings per service hour).
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
Via Mobility, MV Transit and Senior’s Resource Center as a group, reduced Customer Contacts and
remained consistent with the same period in 2018 for Preventable Vehicle Accidents. Our contract
partners did experience a decrease in ridership, but remained productive in many of the FlexRide
services. FlexRide staff continue to monitor low performing FlexRide services to help increase ridership
and productivity. The following is a more detailed discussion of the FlexRide contractor performance
through the 2nd quarter of 2019.
Ridership
Total FlexRide ridership for 2019 was less than the prior year. Boardings in 2018 were 236,819 and
2019 were 223,716. Low fuel prices contributed to the decrease in ridership, which gives customers a
low-cost alternative to using the FlexRide service. Seasonal variations in ridership associated with the
end of the 2019 school year also impacted ridership in many of the FlexRide service areas. This
included Brighton, Evergreen, Federal Heights, Longmont and Parker FlexRides. Arapahoe, Dry Creek
and South Jefferson County FlexRide services did experience modest ridership growth when comparing
2019 YTD to 2018 ridership.
Customer Contacts
FlexRide experienced a decrease in overall customer contacts through the 2nd quarter 2019 compared to
2018.
Customer contacts are reviewed on a daily basis. Those contacts that are considered operator related
(within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement. Starting in the 2nd Quarter of
2018, customer contacts were further monitored for an “at fault” and “not at fault” classification, based
on the investigation and review of the contact.

1.C.4

During 2018, driver turnover was higher in the first part of the year in comparison to 2019 and may be
the contributing factor to lower customer contacts.
The number of all other customer comments received regarding FlexRide service (requests for new
service or a change in service which can include boundary changes, service day and hours, web site
issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
2nd Quarter 2019: 201
2nd Quarter 2018: 199
Preventable Accidents
The preventable accident rate through the 2nd quarter 2019 remained at the same level as the same
period in 2018 with 13 preventable accidents. Contractors have continued to retrain operators identified
as being involved in accidents and have increased the number of “ride-alongs” performed by operations
specialists and training staff.
2nd Quarter 2019: 13
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.912
2nd Quarter 2018: 13
Preventable Vehicle Accidents: 1.912
Productivity
A number of FlexRide areas continued to remain productive. Most of these serve business parks that
connect with the light rail (Arapahoe, Meridian, North Inverness and South Inverness) or communities
where residents utilize the service (Golden and Superior). Staff continue to monitor FlexRides with low
productivity and work with the local municipalities and RTD Marketing to identify strategies for
improving ridership. The attached 2019 Special Services 2nd Quarter Report provides the productivity
numbers for each of the FlexRides and some other special services for which RTD provides cost-share
funding. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service is 3.0 boardings per hour.

Customer Comment Analysis - 2nd Quarter
2019

Customer comments through the 2nd Quarter of 2019 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2018. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 2nd Quarter of 2019 was 8,017. The total number for the same period in
2018 was 9,623. Specific customer comment categories showing improvement in 2019 include “Bus
Did Not Show,” “Bus Early,” “Bus Late,” “Discrimination,” “Improper Procedure/Operator,” “Incorrect
Information” and “Passed up Passenger at Stop.” The customer comment categories of “Careless
Driving/Operator,” “Discourtesy/Operator,” and “Fare Dispute” showed increases over 2018. RTD and
the private contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action as
needed to address deficiencies and improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 2nd Quarter of 2019. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2018.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:









Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.




Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings

Packet Pg. 37

1.C.5









wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator
wages effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in
applicants and employee retention. With the increases in headcount, additional strategies are
being implemented to help reduce the amount of dropped service and the associated comments.
Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.

Historically, and in 2019, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 57.7% compared to the
same period in 2018. RTD and the private contractors are showing strong improvement regarding
operator headcount. Continuing efforts to reduce operator vacancies will help ensure that service is
provided per published schedules. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 4.02 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 9.50 comments per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 15.1% compared to the same
period in 2018. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 38

1.C.5

YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.80 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 4.47 comments per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 11.7% compared to the same
period in 2018. Improvements to staffing levels have resulted in improvements in this category.
Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including
construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays. Running time issues are continually reviewed by RTD
Service Planning and Scheduling. As a result, a significant number of service changes were made in May
to improve on-time performance and service reliability. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is
6.74 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 7.64 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 4.5% compared to
the same period in 2018. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.85
comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 3.68 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 15.7% compared to the
same period in 2018. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed proper
procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or
explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating area,
addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 8.93 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 7.72 comments per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 20.8% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.23 comments per day. The comparable number for
2018 was 0.29 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 3.5% compared to the same
period in 2018. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.98 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 0.94 comments per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 18.7%
compared to the same period in 2018. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2019 is 5.66 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 6.96 comments per day.

Packet Pg. 39

1.C.5

Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 4.5% compared to the
same period in 2018. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, Operations
Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide
operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns.
Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact on this
category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and Trainers,
and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.35 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 0.36 comments per day.
Passed up Passenger at Stop – 2nd Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 16.0%
compared to the same period in 2018. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (99 of the total 1764 = 5.61%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 9.75 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 11.60 comments per day.

Re:

Service Availability – August 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.62% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in August 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflects a fairly
consistent number compared the same month (August) last year. Service delivery overall has
improved steadily since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





August 2019 – 163.56 hours
August 2018 – 163.00 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,567.77 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 9,155.01 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in August were special events (such as: Rolling
Stones Concert, CU Fall Semester start, August service change combined with school trippers,
Colorado Bicycle Classic, Rockies home games, Broncos pre-season home games, the Rocky
Mountain Showdown and unplanned bus bridges).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.62% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,721 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 21,278 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:

Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Second Quarter ~ April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement
Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain-clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain-clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

Re:

Service Performance 2018

Attached is the annual report on RTD service performance by route and service class.
The report evaluates the two primary measures of cost-effectiveness and productivity
to illustrate how each route meets RTD Service Policies and Standards. In particular
it highlights which routes are performing well and which are not and need attention.
The service development staff uses this report to help plan for proposed service
changes each year, along with other more detailed information. As always, staff is
available to discuss this report with Board members and others.

Service Performance 2018
Networked Family of Services

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to
help make judgments about performance. Each
rectangle labeled by service type represents the domain
for routes that meet or exceed the 10%
minimum/maximum performance requirements for that
service class. So this is a case where it’s bad to be
“outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective—maximize ridership within
the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy
per
boarding.
Efficiency—productivity
or

Same boardings,

comparative analysis of all classes of services,
illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
Better

Same subsidy,

Boardings per Vehicle Hour or Productivity

Higher

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak
periods and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly
exceeds the minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line
at 25 boardings per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute
frequency, and the green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see
RTD’s Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).
NOTE
In 2017 the new fare revenue allocation model was implemented. Also all bus and rail ridership boardings
are now obtained from our automatic passenger counters (APCs). Thus, relative to years earlier, bus
boardings are about 8% higher in general than before.

Overview
RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service
development and performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or
demand? Should service be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s
general approach is as follows. Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the
services together in a network to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-ofservice with demand, thus improving performance and sustainability.

1.C.10.b

Definitions
 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Vehicle (Train) Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: A new revenue allocation model was implemented in 2017. Revenue allocation is based
on cash fare equivalents, fare zones, rider surveys and total fare revenue. The average fare for local bus
service is calculated as a basis, then local cash fare equivalents are calculated by fare zone. These
average fares are then applied to boardings by route, class and zone.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus
depreciation on all RTD assets, excluding interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost
allocation model allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting
line items are assigned to the most relevant variable.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10%
of routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate
the acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each
class of service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted
data, assuming the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard
deviation and confidence intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average.
The following table gives the current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Bus boardings and service hours reasonably match each other as shares among the service classes. Rail
and Mall services carry many riders relative to the resources they require, while Call-n-Ride and Access-aRide are the opposite. The Subsidy per Boarding (cost-effectiveness) and Boardings per Hour (productivity)
charts also reflect these balances, though rail has a lower cost-effectiveness and higher productivity than
bus services.

Comparison by Class of Service
It is useful to compare all of the classes of service together to help judge the equitable distribution of
services throughout the District. One size does not fit all, so there are a variety of services classes to meet
a variety of market needs, each with its own performance expectation or standard. Customer market share
by class of service is depicted in the Boardings chart and resource allocation is depicted in the Vehicle
Hours chart. Since a boarding may be a transfer and over 50% of all customer trips include at least one
transfer, there is overlap among the classes which is not captured in the chart. Often a customer’s trip
could not be completed without the connectivity that RTD purposefully designs into its networked family
of services. The map illustrates RTD services by service class and the underlying density warrants for
service coverage.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of August, 2019 listed in route number order.
Route 1 Alameda Ave – This service meets the 10% subsidy standard, but is slightly short of the 10%
productivity standard. The continued slide in ridership performance is related to both changes in ridership
and a slight increase in hours for CBA compliance and service performance.

Route 27 East Yale Ave - In an effort to increase productivity on the Route 27, it was split in to two
separate route services. In August of 2018, the new Route 26 - West Yale Avenue service began operating
between Southwest Plaza and Englewood Station. The new Route 27 – East Yale service now operates
between University Hills and Ulster - Tufts.
Route 28 28th Ave - Service east of the CBD continues to fall below the service standard, likely due to
changing demographics. Previous plans to consolidate the eastern segment of the Route 28 with the Route
43 (proposed in the A Line and R Line Bus and Rail Service Plans) failed adoption in 2016.
Route 31L North Federal Limited - This route has been discontinued with the implementation of the G
Line bus and rail service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy continue to perform below standards, likely
due to changing demographics east of the CBD. With the move of the VA Hospital, this service continues
to perform below standards.
Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was replaced in August 2019 with the new Platte Valley FlexRide
service.
Route 39L North Colorado Limited – Route exceeds the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the
10% subsidy standard. This route is planned to be restructured in the North Metro Bus and Rail service
plan.
Route 46 South Dahlia Street – Meets the 10% subsidy standard, but slightly below the productivity
standard. This service was reduced in 2017 and truncated in 2018 to increase productivity.
Route 67 Ridge Road – This service meets the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. It was recommended for discontinuance in 2012, but it was retained due to the absence of
alternative services in the SW Jeffco area.
Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — This route was discontinued with the implementation of the G Line
bus and rail service plan.
Route 80L West 80th Limited – Significantly under performing in both ridership and subsidy standards, this
route has been merged with Route 80 in the G – Line bus and rail service Plan.
Route 85 Chatfield Avenue — This route was discontinued in August 2018.

Attachment: Performance 2018 Complete (3924 : Service Performance 2018)

Route 3L East Alameda Limited - This service performs well above the 10% productivity standard, but
falls just below the 10% subsidy standard as a result of its peak only operation. Two pm peak trips were
consolidated in 2018 to increase cost effectiveness.

1.C.10.b

Regional Transportation District
Route 87L South Wadsworth Limited - The route currently exceeds the 10% boardings per hour standard,
though below the subsidy per boarding standard. We will continue to monitor its performance for further
action.
Route 89 Stapleton/Anschutz Campus – This service was discontinued in January 2018.

Route 104X Commerce City Denver - Serving a relatively small commuter market this service saw a
decline in ridership and an increase in operating cost which has pushed its subsidy per boarding below
10% standard although it meets the productivity standard. However, this route will likely be positively
impacted by the North Metro Bus and Rail service plan.
Route 112 West 112th Avenue – Currently this route exceeds the 10% boarding per hour standard, but
falls slightly short of the 10% standard for subsidy per boarding. Route restructure in May 2018 made to
improve the efficiency of the route. Overall boardings per hour increased in 2018 over 2017.
Route 116X South Simms – This service meets productivity standard, but has performed below the
subsidy standard since the introduction of the W Line light rail service. A slight reduction in operating cost
shows decrease in subsidy per boarding for 2018.
Route 128 Broomfield/Wagon Road - Route falls short on both subsidy and boardings standards. Route
restructure occurred in May 2018 to improve overall efficiency. Further adjustments are possible.
Route 131 Iliff – Current falls below both standards. Will be monitored.
Route 139 Quincy – Meets productivity standard, but is just below the 10% subsidy standard. Will be
monitored.
Route 145X Brighton/Denver Airport - This service continues to fall below the subsidy standard, but meets
productivity standard. This service is proposed to be restructured in the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — This route was newly implemented in April 2016, formed from former
segments of Routes 10, 130 and 169. A service reduction was made in August 2018 to improve
productivity. There was a slight increase in productivity, but a large increase in operational costs has
worsened the subsidy per boarding and it does not yet meet standards.
Route 169L Buckley/Tower DIA Limited – Due to the length of this service and surrounding land use, it
falls short of the subsidy standard, but significantly exceeds the productivity standard. The route was
truncated at Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run in 2018 in an effort to increase effectiveness and come in to
compliance with the CBA. 2018 performance is seeing increases in performance in both subsidy and
boarding per hour.
Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield – January 2019, route was extended to serve the Kestrel Development,
which should increase ridership.
Route 236 Boulder Junction/US 36 & Table Mesa - Service was introduced in January 2017. Current
ridership remains low and is being considered for restructure.

1.C.10.b

Regional Transportation District

Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved
somewhat. It remains below subsidy and productivity standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and
rail service plan. The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe
and the Route 410 in Parker. Service meets productivity standars, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. Will be monitored.

Route EV Evergreen/Aspen Park/Denver – This route is below subsidy and just above ridership standards
and will be monitored. Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018.
Route J Longmont/Gunbarrel Boulder — This route is below subsidy standard. We will continue to monitor
before taking further action.
LD/LX Longmont/Denver - Performance of this service is down slightly from the former Route L service it
replaced. Current proposals would adjust service levels on the Route LD to better match ridership
productivity and improve subsidy performance.
Route R/RC/RX Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased
modestly, but it still does not meet service standards. Two midday trips were discontinued January 2019,
due to low ridership and to improve subsidy performance.
Lone Tree FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. Both ridership and
productivity improved slightly from 2016. However, the City has their own Lone Tree Link service since
2015, which competes for ridership between the Lincoln rail station and several large employers. Services
will be reevaluated with the opening of SERE in 2019, when the Link will be discontinued.
*Louisville FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. RTD is working
with City on marketing service and adding a shopping trip to help ridership.
*Thornton FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is below subsidy standards. RTD will continue marketing
with assistance from the municipalities and North TMO.
B Line – Though ridership on the B Line had improved in 2018 operations cost increases pushed the
subsidy per boarding figures below the 10% standard. More recently, the introduction of the G Line service
has had an effect on the ridership on the B Line, which we will continue to monitor.
R Line – The R Line was implemented in February of 2017. Weekend service was reduced in 2018 to
better match ridership demands. The SERE Service plan returned the weekend service levels in 2019.
Current data shows an increase in ridership to 48 boardings per hour weekday, 36.6 brdgs/hr. Saturday
and 45 brdgs/hr Sunday.
