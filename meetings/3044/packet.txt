BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Subject:

Adoption of the Pension Plan Contribution

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2021 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2021 contribution of 7% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2020 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2021 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.6 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.6 million is made beginning in 2021, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $6.1 million in 2032.
Due to financial constraints RTD is currently experiencing, RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is
recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1 million in 2021 and beyond, the
Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2043. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7%
per year.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019. However, due to
budgetary constraints, we are recommending a contribution rate of 7% in 2021.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Below is a summary of the current and recommended DB Plan and DC Plan funding scenarios:

Long-Term Funding
§ The Board’s funding policy (since 2016) remains the same – the contribution is
determined as an amount to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on the
recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer

§ Last meeting (in March), based on January 1, 2019 actuarial valuation results and an
estimated 2019 net investment return of 16.5%, the Plan was projected to reach 100%
funding in 2034 with a $6.1M contribution each year beginning in 2020, if all
assumptions were met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0%

Ø The Plan was projected to achieve 100% funding (in 2031) if the recommended contribution
was contributed beginning in 2021

§ What changed since last year?
Ø The actual net investment return for 2019 was 16.5% based on the 12/31/2019 Plan audit
Ø The Plan experienced an asset loss of $0.8M (6.4% net return on the Actuarial Value of
Assets vs. 7.0% assumption) and a liability loss of $2.3M during 2019

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Reflecting January 1, 2020 valuation results, the Plan is projected to reach 100%
funding in 2035 with a $6.1M contribution each year if all actuarial assumptions are
met in the future, including a net investment return of 7.0% per year beginning in 2020

§ What happened since the final January 1, 2020 valuation results were issued?
Ø The preliminary YTD investment return through September 2020 is -3.0%, net of investment
expenses, per the investment consultant (vs. the 7.0% assumption)

Long-Term Funding (Continued)
§ Reflecting January 1, 2020 valuation results, a $6.1M contribution in 2020, a -3.0%
preliminary net return on assets in 2020, and assuming all actuarial assumptions are
realized, including a 7.0% net investment return per year beginning in 2021:

Ø If future contributions are equal to $6.1M, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in
2043 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2043
q The recommended contribution ranges from $8.6M in 2021 up to $49.2M in 2031 and
decreases down to $3.3M in 2043

Ø If the recommended contribution is made beginning in 2021, the Plan is expected to achieve
100% funding in 2031 (end of the 11-year amortization period) and the recommended
amount is projected to drop below $6.1M in 2032
q The recommended contribution ranges from $8.6M in 2021 up to $9.8M in 2026 and
decreases down to $1.0M in 2032

§ Due to the Plan’s maturity, future investment returns have a significant impact on
projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised of the impact of the Plan’s
investment performance on future costs

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Adoption of the 2021 Benefit Plan

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2021 Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his/her designee to
enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6: Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2021 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 1 through
November 14, 2020.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2021 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2021 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2021 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
four, 2021, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as follows:
•

Cigna participants will pay 80% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 10% over the employee premium calculation for 2020.

Medical
• Kaiser HDHP
o No plan changes – 3.8% increase in premium
• Kaiser DHMO
o No plan changes – 3.8% increase in premium
• Cigna HDHP
o No plan changes – 28% increase in premium
• Cigna PPO
o No plan changes – 28.3% increase in premium

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.2

Dental
• The annual premium decreased by 10.2%.
• No change to the Exclusive Panel Option (EPO) Dental Plan and the annual premium decreased by
22.8%.
Due to the decrease in premium and our budget situation, we are recommending that the percent of
premium paid by RTD decrease from 75% to 70% in 2021.
Life & Disability
• Unum is under a rate guarantee – no changes in premium or plan design
Vision/Business Travel Accident
• Superior Vision is under a rate guarantee – no changes in rate or plan design, however the
employee contributions were smoothed resulting in a $3,276 reduction in employer contribution.
• Business Travel Insurance is budgeted/paid on a three-year basis, 2021 is year three of the most
recent contract.
The 2019-2021 rate is $1,900 total for three years, this premium is
approximately $100.00 less than the premium for 2016-2018.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2021 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be 3.1% above the 2020 projected
benefit costs. However, this is based on headcount as of September 30, 2020. In addition, we don’t
know how many employees may switch from Cigna to Kaiser based on the employee contribution
increase in cost for Cigna.

The 2021 estimate of the Salaried Employee Health and Welfare Benefits is $11,864,237. This is an
increase of $359,116.
For 2021, these benefit costs are already assumed in the draft 2021 budget presented to the Board on
October 13, 2020.
Note: RTD contributions on self-funded plans are based on actual claims. The number above is based on
2020 estimated claims and current enrolled employees.
**2021 PCOR Fees have not been announced by the IRS, estimate a 3% Increase over 2020.

Board of Directors

Requested
by:

Shontel Lewis, Director, District B

Date:

October 14, 2020

Subject:

Approval of Free Rides for Election Day

Date: October 14, 2020

Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Lewis, Tisdale and Walker that the Board approve the suspension of fare
collection and the provision of free rides for RTD patrons on all of its scheduled services for the period
from 12:00 A.M. MST until 11:59 P.M. MST on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #5: Effective Communications & Community Outreach
Task Goal #1: Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration
BACKGROUND
Public transportation agencies across many cities are encouraging participation in the November
elections by offering the benefit of free rides to all patrons on election day. Additionally, companies like
Uber and Lyft, partner agencies of ours, offer similar benefits to patrons on election day.
The RTD Board of Directors, a nonpartisan board, should join other transportation agencies by offering
free rides to all patrons on its scheduled services throughout the Regional Transportation District on
election day 2020.
DISCUSSION
The RTD Board of Directors is recommending that we offer this benefit for the date of November 3rd,
2020 to provide increased voter participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impaction is expected to be between $85,000 and $118,000. The Board and staff will
explore partnerships with individuals, companies, agencies and governments, including exploration of
novel social media funding mechanisms, in order to identify funding for this community benefit and
endeavor.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To adopt the proposal.
2. To reject the proposal.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

RTD sales and use taxes totaled $659.4 million in 2019. These revenues are collected primarily within
seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver,
Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County. RTD has participated in the strong
economic growth experienced in the Denver Metro region, and Colorado retail sales estimates have
outperformed national retail sales over the past five years. The economy and revenues were strong
in January and February 2020, but turned negative in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
pandemic will leave a negative imprint upon the economy for several years. While RTD revenue
returns to growth in Q3 2020, the losses incurred during the first and second quarters of 2020
persist until 2022.
The model, which was developed to forecast short-term, medium-term, and long-term RTD sales
and use tax revenue, fundamentally examines the relationships between U.S. and Colorado
economic growth, and between Colorado and the district. It also accounts for economic and
demographic (e.g., population age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•
•
•

•
•

•

The COVID-19 pandemic created a sharp and profound negative impact upon the economy.
GDP in Q2 2020 decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 31.4% (9% year-overyear), and is projected to increase nearly 24% (4.5% year-over-year) in Q3 2020.
Despite the recession and record losses in employment and wage and salary income,
personal income posted strong gains in 2020 due to a record increase in government
transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment benefits, household stimulus checks).
The increase in personal income and the lack of spending on services shifted personal
consumption to goods, which softened the recession’s impact on taxable goods in Colorado.
Nationally, 22.2 million jobs were lost in March and April, presenting a post-Great
Depression record 14.5% loss of employment; however, 11.4 million jobs were added back
from May through September.
Consumer and business sentiment both dropped significantly since the onset of the
pandemic on the U.S. economy, but confidence has rebounded as the economy reopened.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•

•

RTD sales and use tax revenue increased 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2019; however, the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy (specifically, retail sales), causes a projected
reduction in revenue by 5.8% in 2020 before growing 5.5% in 2021 (but growing from a
smaller revenue base).
The outlook for Colorado economic indicators improved since May—personal income is
projected to increase 4.4% in 2020 as government payments to households offset wage and
salary losses; personal income is projected to increase a modest 0.5% in 2021 as government
stimulus recedes prior to the rebound in employment and wages.
Employment is projected to decrease 4.4% in 2020, but increase 1.6% in 2021; and retail
sales will decrease 0.1% in 2020 but grow 4% in 2021.

Executive Summary

•

•

•

•

•

•

•
•

The Governor’s Executive Order that extended the retail sales tax filing deadline and waived
penalties caused a delay in the RTD’s sales and use tax collections early in the pandemic.
This presented a more negative decline in RTD revenue than actually occurred, which carried
forward in the first pandemic forecast for RTD.
The BRD incorporated new data on revenue, delayed payments, and economic conditions
through the summer and provided updated, improved revenue forecasts to RTD.
Despite strong January and February RTD revenue growth, revenue declined in March, and is
projected to remain below peak beyond the short-term forecast (2021), regaining revenue
above the prior peak in 2022.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2020 of $621 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $602.8 million
on the low side and $638.5 million for the upper bound. The 2020 forecast puts RTD revenue
at the lowest level since 2017.
The mean forecast for 2021 is $655 million, bound by a lower bound of $595.2 million and
an upper bound of $713.4 million.
For 2020, the 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive the state and district forecasts
are from Moody’s Analytics. While the macro forecasts for GDP, employment, and retail
sales still illustrate a recession, the indicators were sharply higher for 2020 compared with
the May 2020 projections. Colorado employment, personal income, and retail sales were
also revised higher for 2020.
Model estimates for 2019 were quite accurate. Annual revenues for 2019 came in 0.4%
below the March 2019 forecast (which were based on data through year-end 2018), and
compared to the September forecast, revenues came in above expectations by 1.1%.
While a standard recession suggests less household spending power, and therefore, lower
sales tax revenues, the government response to this pandemic reversed the usual paradigm.
This direct transfer resulted in sharply higher household income and spending than the
model had predicted. Thus, sales tax revenue outperformed expectations.
Revenue since July 2019 may have been impacted by the change to destination sales taxes,
which took effect in July 2019.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 75
times and below the actual revenue 82 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.2%, with a 3.6% standard deviation.

The impact of COVID-19 on the retail and restaurant industries, employment, income, and
tourism weighs heavily on retail sales activity.
The past two post-recession recovery periods lasted 4.5 years and 4.75 years, before RTD
revenues returned to their previous revenue peaks. However, RTD will likely surpass the
prior revenue peak in 2 years from the current recession.
While year-over-year revenue growth is projected to return in Q1 2021, it is projected that
RTD revenue will not fully recover until 2022.
Modeling three economic scenarios helps accommodate for the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 29.1%
between 2019 and 2026, reaching $851.2 million by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario under which the national economy experiences a faster rebound
yields cumulative revenues 2.3% higher than the baseline scenario over the seven year
horizon, though, the 2026 total is 2.7% above the baseline forecast, illustrating the value of a
faster recovery.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative 7-year forecast 4.1% below the baseline scenario.
The paradox of the 7-year forecast producing similar 2026 revenues points to the very shortrun nature of the current Moody’s alternative scenarios.
Reflecting on the forecast prior to the pandemic, the medium-term forecasts have proven to
have a small margin of error over time. Five years out, the 2014 forecast for 2019 was high
by 2.1%. The 2015 forecast for 2019 was high by 4.4%, the 2016 forecast for 2019 was low
by 2.3%, the 2017 forecast for 2019 was low by 1.7%, and the 2018 forecast for 2019 was
high by 1.4%.
Until the COVID-19 pandemic, the annual March medium-term forecasts have produced
results where actual RTD revenue has fallen within the upper and lower confidence bounds
100% of the time. The volatility caused by the sharp decline and rebound in 2020 revenue
caused the May forecast to fall outside bounds of the forecast that was produced in 2020.

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After estimated revenue growth of 5% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal
dollars), nominal revenue projections for the next three decades average 4% (2021–2030),
3.4% (2031–2040), and 2.4% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.3% (2021–2050).
Long-term revisions are due, in part, to lower expectations in the short-term forecast, as
well as revisions to the long-term population forecasts.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration in order to forecast sales and use tax revenues,
and to identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration in order to better
understand the existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the
three sets of projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data is available through July 2020. State retail sales and state taxable sales are
available through June 2020. Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue from
medical and retail marijuana sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary
to accommodate the gap year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by
Senate Bill 17-267. As such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues
excluding retail marijuana taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales excluding
marijuana sales. However, the forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of
RTD retail marijuana revenues. This construction was necessary to produce a series without the
discontinuity over the period from July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue
forecasts.

Models for the Three Forecast Horizon s
Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2020), medium term (2026), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model that was originally developed by members of the BRD team for the Office of State
Planning and Budgeting.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2020), medium term (2026), and long term (2050).

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two
terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.
A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-

Key Econometric Concepts

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables, but only 3 of these were found to have statistically
significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the other key
variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such
as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:

contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Figure 1

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and therefore RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s
forecasts of national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term
Colorado Economy Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national
variables for the long-term forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for
converting forecasts of real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.

Linkages between National, State, and District Economic Variables

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The Input Data—Sources and Description

National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.

Figure 2: U.S. and Colorado Retail Sales

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the

This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag. The data source is the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Because the survey only asks for total
wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the month, we cannot see an alternative
method for obtaining monthly data by county. This survey solicits information from the
employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence, so some wages leak out of the
Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of Colorado are sourced from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics,
www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax

composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures going to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of goods
and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI component that
fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail sales. This variable
is included in the current specification of some equations in the forecasting model. The CPI
is also used to convert between nominal and real values of personal income and retail sales.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
Forecasts of district taxable sales are driven by equations that relate this variable to
Colorado retail trade (taxable and nontaxable). This, in turn, is linked to U.S. retail sales.

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term
Short-Term Forecasts
Summary: RTD combined sales and use tax revenue grew at a 5.1% compound annual growth rate
over the last five years (2014-2019). In 2019 alone, the 4% growth increased sales and use taxes to
$659.4 million. However, revenue is projected to decline 5.8% in 2020, but grow 5.5% in 2021 due to
the COVID-19-induced recession and the forthcoming recovery.
All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in September 2020, with much of the data current through June 2020. State retail sales
and taxable sales data are current through June 2020, and RTD revenue data are current through
July 2020. All reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity reflect the deteriorating economy in 2020 from
the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate is projected to average 7.3% in 2020 and remain
elevated in 2021. Personal income is projected to grow primarily due to government transfer
receipts via unemployment, while retail sales are projected to decline for the year, and inflation
remains below 2%. Aside from long-run shifting demographics, employment declines in the shortrun due to the recession’s impact on the labor market.

rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2016 through 2019, district taxable sales grew by
3.4%, 6.5%, 4.2%, and 5.7%, respectively. Taxable sales are projected to fall 5.3% in 2020, but
increase 3.8% in 2021. Sales tax revenues are anticipated to decrease in stride, falling 5.1% for the
current year and increasing 3.7% in 2021. Note that the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less
marijuana revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the seven-county RTD district because retail
marijuana is no longer assessed the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for the state. However, retail marijuana
is taxed 1% for the special districts, leading to a difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado retail sales, reflecting the broader
geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019. The forecast calls for a
further 14.3% decline in use taxes in 2020, followed by 27.3% growth in 2021. The volatility of use
taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2021. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $602.8 million and
as high as $638.5 million for 2020. The 2020 lower and upper bounds range -2.9% to +2.8% relative
to the medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2021 with greater uncertainty. The 2021
upper- and lower-bound estimates are -9.1% and +8.9% different than the medium baseline
forecast, showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic
that revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

More detailed information on the forecasts is provided by the quarterly figures. Quarterly growth
was volatile in 2016, but proved much more stable in the years that followed (2017-2019). However,
volatility was unmatched in 2020. For the remainder of the short-term forecast (through 2021), yearover-year growth will range between –6.7% and 12.8%. The strongest decline was recorded in Q2
2020 (-12.1).

Year-over-Year Percent Changes
RTD Revenues

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Legislative Changes that Impact the Tax Base and the RTD Tax Rate
Legislative changes can affect RTD tax revenues by altering the effective rate of taxation (e.g.,
through changes in the vendor allowance) or by changing the tax base to which the tax rate applies
(e.g., by changing taxable versus exempted sales). The historical data on RTD taxable sales have been
computed to equal RTD sales tax revenues divided by the effective sales tax rate. Therefore, by
construction, the historical series on taxable sales captures any changes in the tax base as they have
affected RTD sales tax revenues. It is not necessary to adjust the model forecasts for differences
between district and Colorado exemptions that were in place prior to the forecast period. However,
model forecasts of taxable sales and sales tax revenues will not reflect future policy changes in RTD
exemptions. If the dollar impact of future policy changes on district taxable sales is known, then the
model forecasts can be adjusted to reflect these changes.
With this computation of taxable sales, RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted as an identity equal to
RTD taxable sales times the RTD effective tax rate. This identity can accommodate future policy
changes in the effective tax rate, such as the reinstatement of the vendor allowance that began in
July 2011. This approach also permits consideration of the impact of other future tax rate changes.
Beginning in 2014, there was another sales tax shift. Recreational marijuana was legalized under
Amendment 64, and select jurisdictions within Colorado began allowing retail marijuana sales on
January 1, 2014. As a result, RTD sales tax revenues from retail marijuana sales totaled $2.1 million
in 2014, compared to approximately $2.5 million RTD received from the sale of medical marijuana
over the same period. From 2014 through 2019, RTD collected $14.2 million in medical marijuana
taxes and $28.1 million in retail marijuana taxes, for a total of $42.2 million.
Senate Bill 17-267, which went into effect July 1, 2017, eliminated sales taxes to RTD from retail
marijuana. This omission was reversed for RTD effective July 1, 2018. Despite collecting some retail
marijuana revenue from July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018, the amount was well below the amount that
RTD would have collected. To account for this omission in the forecasted revenue, the BRD created a
RTD revenue series that forecasts marijuana beginning in July 1, 2017. Thus, the forecasted revenues
in this report include retail marijuana revenue. Marijuana revenue figures in Table 9 represent actual
collections.

In May 2013, Colorado HB 13-1272 was signed into law, which made the RTD tax base the same as
the state’s tax base beginning January 1, 2014.1 Bringing RTD’s tax base into parity impacts the
amount of use tax generated for RTD, from machinery and machine tools and food sold through
vending machines, and impacts sales taxes with the inclusion of cigarettes, candy and soda, and food
containers in RTD’s tax base. The effect of the base change is present in the revenues for the last
two years—evidenced in RTD revenues outperforming the state in revenue growth—but the
magnitude of the change cannot be isolated using aggregate revenue collections. For this March
2020 update, the impact of HB 13-1272 has not been explicitly estimated, but the impact is inherent
in the historical revenues, which begins to minimize the understatement of revenue given the short
history of the base change. State sales tax revenues grew 9.4% in calendar year 2014, 5.9% in 2015,
0.9% in 2016, 6.7% in 2017, 5.7% in 2018, and 6.1% in 2019; while RTD revenue sales tax collections
increased 9.5% in 2014, 5.8% in 2015, 3.8% in 2016, 6.3% in 2017, 4.2% in 2018, and 6.3% in 2019.
In May 2019, Colorado HB 19-1240 was signed into law, which made changes to the nexus
regulations for retailers. Particularly relevant to RTD, the law requires Colorado retailers to collect
local jurisdictional sales taxes, regardless if the retail has a physical presence in the jurisdiction. This
applies to retailers with $100,000 or more in retail sales. Also in May 2019, Colorado HB 19-1245
was signed into law, which increased the vendor fee to 4% (from 3.33%), and caps the vendor fee at
$1,000.
The Colorado Department of Revenue summarizes the destination sourcing as follows:2
Sales that were previously reported in one location may be reported in different locations in
2019 because the Colorado General Assembly adopted new sourcing rules in House Bill 191240. Prior to 2019, the location for which a return was filed by a retailer generally reflected
the location the retailer's business had in common with the delivery point. Beginning in June

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

During the lockdown, Governor Polis’s Executive Order extended the retail sales tax filing deadline
and waived penalties. This caused a delay in the RTD’s sales and use tax collections early in the
pandemic, but these delayed payments dissipated over time. By understating collected revenue, this
presented a more negative observed revenue situation for RTD that became the jumping off point
for the forecast. The BRD incorporated new data on revenue, delayed payments, and economic
conditions through the summer and provided updated, improved revenue forecasts to RTD.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2026. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the Baseline macroeconomic scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total
tax revenues are projected to grow by 29.1% between 2019 and 2026.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the national
economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 8.7% increase in tax revenues
from 2019 to 2022, and a 32.6% increase from 2019-2026. Under stronger economic conditions, this
scenario out-produces the baseline scenario for the first three years of the medium-term forecast, but
then more or less performs similar to the baseline scenario. In the second alternative, in which the
economy grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 1.9% decrease between 2019 and 2022, but a
26.2% increase between 2019 and 2026, with slower growth recorded in the first three years
followed by faster growth in the remainder of the forecast. While the alternative scenarios produce
similar revenue in 2026, the differences in the cumulative revenue from 2020 to 2026 illustrate the
impact of slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative
(2020-2026) revenue $121 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces
cumulative revenue $210 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a
reasonable degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as
plausible bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2026. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.

2019, most in-state retailers started filing returns based on the location in which the
purchaser received the goods; however, some small retailers filed returns for all sales based
on the retailer’s business location. Additional out-of-state retailers were also required to
collect and remit sales tax for goods delivered into Colorado based on the location in which
the purchaser received the goods. These changes may cause variations in the data reported
from previous years.

1.C.1.b

Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The Baseline RTD forecast is based on macroeconomic conditions described by Moody’s Analytics in
the “Baseline Forecast”. Moody’s Baseline Forecast is constructed with a 50% probability that the
U.S. economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform. This scenario
assumes that COVID-19 cases peaked nationally in July, the Fed commits to keeping interest rates
low into 2023, and another round of Federal stimulus that helps households (unemployment
benefits), as well as state and local government. Downside risks to this forecast include another
spike in COVID cases that lead to another round of temporary business closures, delayed or
suspended round of economic stimulus, a greater-than-expected impact from the cut in
unemployment benefits, and a greater-than-expected spike in business bankruptcies.
After a snapback in the GDP growth rate in Q3, a material rebound doesn’t happen until 2021. Real
GDP falls in 2020 (4.3%) and then grows in 2021 (3.5%). The unemployment rate averages 8.8% in
2020 before slowly improving through the medium term. Retail sales increase 1.1% nationally in
2020.

Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 4.4% in 2020. The average unemployment
rate in 2020 increases to 7.3%, and total employment falls 4.4%. Employment takes three years (in
2023) to recover to the prior peak. Retail sales decrease for two years as personal income and
employment fall. Retail sales are nearly flat in 2020 as the rise in personal income from government
stimuli offset the fall in wage and salary earnings through employment losses.

State and RTD taxable sales recorded strong growth in 2014, impacted in part by both retail
marijuana sales and HB 13-1272, as well as strong overall economic conditions in the state and the
district. For RTD, strong growth in 2014 taxable sales segued to slower but robust growth for the
next five years: 2015 (6.4%), 2016 (3.5%), 2017 (6.5%), 2018 (4.2%), and 2019 (5.7%).
Taxable sales are projected to decrease 4.6% in 2020, but return to strong growth for the remainder
of the forecast horizon. RTD taxable sales will average 5.1% growth from 2021 through 2026 after a
5.3% decline in 2020. RTD sales tax revenue follows a similar path as taxable sales.

Use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015; increased 7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018; and fell
16% in 2019. Use tax revenues are expected to fall 14.3% in 2020 before resuming growth in 2021.
Growth in use taxes are projected to increase 3.8% on average (simple average) in the medium-term
(2020–2026). With 90% of RTD tax revenues coming from sales tax, the yearly changes in total
revenues closely track those for sales tax revenues.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 29.1% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2019 to 2026. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound decrease of
-6.7% in RTD revenues for the 2019−2026 forecast period and a 62.7% increase in the high-range
forecast.

Optimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside – 10th Percentile” represents a more optimistic outcome
over the coming four years compared with the Baseline Forecast. In this scenario, there is a decrease
in COVID-19 cases in the short-term, there is another round of federal stimulus, consumer and
business optimism rises (partially on optimism about a vaccine), consumers return to retail and
travel sooner than expected, and the labor market improves.

Real GDP falls in 2020 (4%), but grows strongly in 2021 (6.1%) before moderating. The
unemployment rate remains high through 2021 before dropping below 5%. Retail sales increase a
modest 1.5% nationally in 2020, but rebound strongly in 2021.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $874.5 million in 2026, which is 2.7% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections through 2022, then rates that are more or less the same as the
baseline rates of growth for 2023–2026. Total revenues grow by 32.6% between 2019 and 2026.
Cumulative revenues from 2020-2026 are 2.3%, or $121 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside – 90th Percentile” is constructed with a 90% probability
that the U.S. economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This
protracted slump is caused by the lack of another round of federal stimulus, which causes another
spike in unemployment; as well as the COVID-19 pandemic lasting longer than generally expected,
with an increase in cases and some (but not widespread) nonessential business closures to fight the
spread of the virus. Consumer confidence and consumer spending both are negatively impacted by
an increase in infections and pessimistic outlooks for a vaccine. In this scenario, the economy reenters a recession in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Real GDP falls in 2020 (4.7%) and 2021 (1%). The unemployment rate remains high, increasing to
over 11% in 2021 before making gradual improvement. Retail sales growth remains slow through
2021 before posting a strong rebound.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
RTD revenues are disrupted in 2020 across all three scenarios due to the recession, but revenue
grows across all three scenarios in 2021. Revenue falls in the baseline scenario in 2020, but grows
29.1% to $851.2 million in the medium term (2019-2026). The pessimistic scenario presents slower
growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by faster growth, growing to $832.2 million by 2026,
netting 26.2% growth over the period. The optimistic scenario records growth that results in an
increase of 32.6% over the period, to $874.5 million, with outperforming growth among the
scenarios early in the forecast horizon.

The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. In fact, the difference
in total RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 5.1% in 2026, but the
cumulative revenue differences are 6.7% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues over the years
2019−2026. After 2020, revenues grow steadily during this period, achieving an overall increase of
29.1% between 2018 and 2026, to $851.2 million in 2026.

Long-Term Forecasts
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.
Forecast summary information is presented in both constant (real) and current (nominal) terms.
Quarterly Synopsis: Coming off a substantially lower base for 2020, the September 2020 long-term
forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 20 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in the final
decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are
projected to grow by 3.3% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is 1%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting

Percent Changes in Total RTD Revenues:
Summary of Three Scenarios

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.3 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:
•

•

•

•

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.

David E. Bloom, David Canning, Günther Fink, and Jocelyn E. Finlay, “Does age structure forecast economic growth?” International Journal
of Forecasting 23 (2007) 569–585, and Thomas Lindh and Bo Malmberg, “Demographically based global income forecasts up to the year
2050,” International Journal of Forecasting 23 (2007) 553–567, are two recent articles illustrating this approach.

model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2020–2026 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2019 are
historical observations, while data from 2020 to 2050 represent forecasts.
The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% to 43.5%, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output between now and 2030.
The prime population proportion then increases to 44% by 2050. Note: beginning in September
2018, this report began using the forecast from Moody’s Analytics. Prior reports used the forecast
from the U.S. Census Bureau, which were current as of 2014.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the next
three decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 23), producing some slowing in the
rate of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–
2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 24; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2026.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

Detailed year-to-year percentage changes in these four national economic variables are presented in
the following figure and also in tabular form in Appendix C.
Figure 5

The BRD’s projected rate of growth in real GDP from 2021–2030 and from 2031-2040 are slightly
below Moody’s growth during the two decades, and notably slower in the last 10 years (2041–2050).
Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 1.2% average growth and the Moody’s
model projects 2.2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below Moody’s for
the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Table 24 reports rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of
this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2019, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district (note: new Colorado and
district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2020).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

Figure 6

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast

period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the working population as it affects income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.
Figure 10

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounds for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth
(with the exception of RTD taxable sales in the final decade). The very low growth rates for RTD
taxable sales during the final decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in
Colorado, and especially in the district.

This long-term forecast ends in 2050. During this period, retail activity faces demographic drag in the
state. The long-term average real growth rate for RTD taxable sales is 1%, reflecting the slow longterm (30-year) growth.
Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 26, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 4% and 3.4%, respectively. The pattern
of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that of
retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast being the weakest
for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the next table and
figure.

Figure 12

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, use tax revenues are driven by Colorado taxable sales and the district oldage dependency ratio. Revenue forecasts in real and nominal terms over the next three decades are
summarized in the following tables and charts and in Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecast Evaluations and Data Revisions
Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through June 2020, allowing for error evaluation
through Q2 2020. The following tables compare the BRD forecasts to actual data. Tables 29 and 30
compare the forecast estimates for each period with the actual revenues. For the short-term
forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 75 times and below the actual
revenue 82 times, and a simple average of the error has been -0.2%, with a 3.6% standard deviation.
The forecast for Q2 2020 was below actual collections by $18.6 million (13.5%) compared to the
spring 2020 forecast. Each change in the base flows to the absolute forecast values. This was due to
a faster-than-expected improvement in some economic conditions, as well as an understanding of
delayed sales tax payments. Despite the recession and record losses in employment and wage and
salary income, personal income posted a record increase early in the recession due to a record
increase in government transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment benefits, household stimulus checks).
The increase in personal income and the lack of spending on services shifted personal consumption
to goods, which softened the recession’s impact on taxable goods, and ultimately, on RTD revenue.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive the state and district forecasts are from
Moody’s Analytics. Comparing the current Moody’s forecasts with those presented in the May 2020
update, forecasts for GDP and other economic variables were revised up sharply in the near term
and down in the medium term, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy.

Note: A positive number represents an upward revision to the forecast in the September update.

Forecasts for the Colorado economy are derived from the Colorado Economy Model that was
developed by BRD team members. This model integrates both national drivers and state economic
variables so that forecasts of the Colorado economy reflect some degree of independence from
national economic activity. Changes in Colorado economic metrics since the May update were mixed
in the medium term. Growth rates were generally revised up in the short term, but revised down
late in the forecast.

Changes in short-term market expectations, tax laws, and policy all can contribute to changes in
revenue forecasts. Forecasted revenues from 2010–2026 were revised higher from the May 2020
update to the September 2020 update.

Primary Differences in Long-Term Forecasts Compared with May 2020 Update
The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars ending in 2050 is 0.6 percentage points
lower than the May forecast; however, due to the sharply lower 2020 base, cumulative total
revenues are up 14.3%. The average 30-year growth forecast in real dollars ending in 2050 is 0.5
percentage points higher than the May forecast, but the cumulative growth rate is 15% above the
May forecast.

The following tables and figures show forecasted levels of RTD total revenues, summing base and
FasTracks components of sales and use taxes. High and low forecasts are given by the median
forecast plus or minus one forecast standard error, which defines an approximate 67% confidence
band for these interval forecasts. Since the BRD model is expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms,
the table below presents forecasts of inflation-adjusted revenues using 2010 as the base year.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the
price surveys.

Appendix B: A Qualitative Assessment of Colorado’s Economy

Summary: The U.S. and Colorado economies have experienced significant contractions through the
first half of 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Both the U.S. and Colorado observed record
declines in employment and increases in jobless claims; however, Colorado seems to be weathering
the downturn better than the nation. The economic standing of the Colorado economy pre-virus was
strong. State GDP grew 1% year-over-year in Q1 2020, decelerating from Q4 2019, when year-overyear GDP grew 3.4%. Since Q1 2015, GDP has grown at a 2.9% compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
in an era when Colorado experienced growing labor force participation, low unemployment, and mild
inflation. Other economic indicators at the state level were positive heading into 2020, including
growth in nonfarm employment, taxable retail sales, and income. Employment has rebounded since
the lows in April, with the U.S. recovering 48% of jobs lost and Colorado recovering 54.8% as of
August. Additionally, Colorado business leaders have improved expectations ahead of Q3 and Q4
2020, signalling a rebound from the significant contraction observed in Q2 due to COVID-19.
COVID-19
The United States had the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world as of
September 15, and the 8th-highest rate (per capita) of COVID-19 cases in the world. While Colorado
has the 21st-largest population in the United States, the state recorded the 30th-highest number of
cases, and the 41st-highest rate of cases as of September 15.

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

Confidence

Figure 37: Index of Consumer Confidence

The Leeds Business Confidence Index (LBCI), a forward-looking index of economic and industry
growth expectations, revealed that Colorado business leaders’ confidence improved ahead of Q3
2020 and Q4 2020 from the record low observed last quarter. An index reading above 50 indicates
positive expectations. Ahead of Q3 2020, the index increased to 44.3, and improved further ahead of
Q4. State expectations increased to 46.8, an 18-point increase from Q2 2020. Looking further ahead
to Q4 2020, state and national expectations were more optimistic, with both state and national
expectations rebounding above 50.

The Consumer Confidence report from the Conference Board shows a decline in Consumer
Confidence for August 2020 to a six-year low after increasing in June and falling in July. The
Mountain Region often exceeds the national index, though it dipped below the national reading in
June and July 2020, and is slightly above the national reading for August. The Mountain Region index
is far removed from its recent peak in September 2018.

Real GDP decreased at seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 31.4% nationally in Q2 2020,
marking a record decrease in GDP as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic become evident in
economic data. Personal consumption expenditures decreased 33.2%, resulting from a 1.7%
decrease in durable goods, a 15% decrease in nondurable goods, and a 41.8% decrease in services.
Gross private fixed investment fell 29.2%, government consumption rose 2.5%, and the trade deficit
improved. GDP is expected to rebound sharply in Q3 2020, with a range of estimates of 25% growth
(annualized).
In Q1 2020 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased 1% year-over-year but fell at an
annualized rate of 4.1% from Q4 2019 to Q1 2020. Nationally, Colorado ranked 7th in year-over-year
growth and 15th for quarter-over-quarter growth in Q1 2020 and fared better than the nation.

Jobless Claims
Initial jobless claims illustrate the immediate and profound impact of the pandemic on employment.
While initial filings in the United States are well below the record highs observed in March and April,
claims are still hovering around 1 million per week. The 884,000 initial jobless claims for the week
ending September 5 marked the 25th consecutive week for which initial claims have been above the
single worst week of the Great Recession. The average for the year leading up to the crisis was
217,000 per month.
Colorado recorded 46,536 initial claims over the seven weeks ending the week of September 5th; the
average over these seven weeks was 6,646, compared to an average of 1,900 per week in 2019. The
RTD district represents 56% of the state’s population and accounted for 56% of the state’s initial
jobless claims. Almost 54% of the initial claims since the beginning of March have been concentrated
in four industries: Accommodation and Food Services; Retail Trade; Health Care and Social
Assistance, and Administrative and Waste Services.

Employment and Wages
For the 12 months ending in February 2020, the United States added 194,000 jobs per month, on
average. In March, the U.S. lost 1.3 million jobs, followed by a record 20.8 million in April—the
largest one month decline since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting data in 1948.
Employment has since rebounded, increasing by 2.7 million jobs in May, 4.8 million in June, 1.7
million in July, and 1.4 million in August. While employment has rebounded, only 48% of the jobs
lost in March and April have been recovered and total employment is still down 6.8% year-over-year
in August.

majority of the employment rebound was observed in May and June (128,000 jobs), while 13,600

Leading up to the pandemic, historically low unemployment rates in Colorado, especially in the
Denver Metro area, led to a shortage of skilled workers. Colorado unemployment hit a record low of
2.5% in October 2019 and has experienced a relatively continuous downward trend since the end of
the recession. This decrease to a new record low occurred as both the labor force and employment
posted strong gains over the decade. The Boulder and Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSAs had record
low unemployment rates of 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, but have since increased to 9.5% and 11%
in July, respectively. Colorado’s unemployment rate increased to a record 12.2% in April 2020 and
rests at 6.7% in July, ranking the state with the 20th lowest unemployment rate in the nation.
Nationwide, the unemployment rate has declined to 8.4% in August 2020.
Industry employment gains in Colorado month-over-month in August 2020 were led by Government
(10,400), Leisure and Hospitality (10,000), and Education and Health Services (7,100). Industries still
demonstrated declines month-over-month: Construction; Other Services; and Financial Activities all
experienced job losses month-over-month in August. Employment in Colorado saw record declines
in April with the Leisure and Hospitality sector observing the largest month-over-month decline (148,900), followed by Education and Health Services (44,000), and Trade, Transportation, and

The most recent data from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show
that home prices in Colorado increased 3.7% year-over-year in Q2 2020 after increasing 4.4% in Q1,
signalling that the COVID-19 pandemic has had little effect on the housing market. Growth in
Colorado house prices was led by the Pueblo (8.5%), Colorado Springs (6.5%), and Grand Junction
(6.3%) MSAs. The Greeley (3.3%), Denver-Aurora-Lakewood (3.2%), Fort Collins (3.1%), and Boulder
(1.6%) MSAs followed. State-wide home price growth was 6.1% (CAGR) from Q2 2010 to Q2 2020.
Grand Junction (3.1%), Pueblo (4.8%), Colorado Springs (5.1%), and Boulder (6%) did not surpass the
10-year state-wide growth rate.

E-Commerce
Internet sales continue to outpace traditional brick-and-mortar sales. As technology advances
through tablets and mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and
access the nation’s e-commerce landscape. The stay-at-home orders exacerbated the already-rapid
shift to online purchases, with large retailers such as Neiman Marcus and Barneys New York recently
declaring bankruptcy while retailers such as Amazon reporting record sales.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales saw 31.8% quarter-over-quarter growth and
44.5% year-over-year growth in Q2 2020. The nation’s e-commerce market continues to experience
steady growth in its market share, making up 16.1% of total retail sales in Q2 2020, up from 10.8% in
Q2 2019.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

This scenario represents a 96% probability that the economy will perform better and a 4%
probability that it will perform worse. This protracted slump is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
lasting longer than generally expected, which results in more cases and deaths. In this scenario,
there is a delay in the development of a vaccine, confidence falls, spending stalls, and lacking
another stimulus, and the U.S. falls back into a recession.
Real GDP falls in 2020 (4.8%) and 2021 (2.6%). The unemployment rate remains at double-digit levels
for three years. Retail sales decrease 0.2% nationally in 2020 and 0.5% in 2021 before beginning to
rebound in 2021.
Total RTD revenue declines in 2020 and 2021. Revenue falls 6.5% in 2020, and 1.5% in 2021.
However, RTD revenue begins posting growth again in 2022, ranging between 1.3% and 7.5% in the
medium term horizon. Annual revenue does not surpass the prior peak until 2024.

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The team leveraged a U.S.
macroeconomic scenario titled, “Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96th Percentile.”

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Subject:

Review of the 2021 Fiscal Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020
Information

INFORMATION
The 2021 Fiscal Policy Statement will be recommended for approval by the Board of Directors in
November in conjunction with the 2021 Recommended Budget. Revisions have been made to the
2020 Fiscal Policy Statement and are presented here for discussion purposes.
The 2021 Fiscal Policy Statement supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6 – Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2019 for the 2020 fiscal year. Those changes were clarification in Revenue Policies,
addition of a policy reference in Expenditure Policy, wording substitution/clarification, and update
of rating agency credit ratings at that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2021, the following changes are proposed.
1. Changes to Revenue Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Revenue Policy #1.
2. Rewrite of the Expenditure Policies section as follows:
a. Change to Expenditure Policy #5 to indicate that the Safety Management System has
taken the place of a safety program and add reference to the policy. The statement that
RTD will invest in safety outreach programs and personnel to communicate safety issues
is deleted because it has been superseded by the SMS and no longer considered relevant.
b. Change to Expenditure Policy #6 to replace service changes “needed to respond to budget
shortfalls” with “matched to funding capacity” for clarification.
3. Rewrite of the Capital Improvement Policies section as follows:

Packet Pg. 103

1.C.2

a. Change to Capital Improvement Policy #1 to replace “on annual basis” with “as
determined by the Board but not less than every two years” for preparation of the MidTerm Financial Plan. The capital projects criteria is deleted and replaced with #2 and #3
which state that:
i. Capital investments should further RTD’s purpose of moving people, which is
achieved when investments are aimed at established agency metrics or key
performance indicators.
ii. The asset investment decision making process will be data driven in accordance
with the RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan.
The purpose of these changes is to indicate that the TAM is the basis for capital project
selection in the MTFP.
b. Prior Capital Improvement Policy #2 regarding basis for the capital program is deleted due
to a. above.
c. Prior Capital Improvement Policy #6 regarding facilities design is deleted due to its
irrelevance in a fiscal policy.
d. Wording clarification in Capital Improvement Policy #4 to give priority to existing,
“backlog, and deferred” assets before consideration of new assets.
e. Wording clarification in Capital Improvement Policy #7.
4. Changes to the Fund Balance Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Fund Balance Policy #1 and #2.
b. Prior Fund Balance Policy #6 regarding establishing a FasTracks construction reserve is
deleted due to its irrelevance.
5. Changes to Debt Policies section as follows:
a. Wording clarification in Debt Policy #5 and #6.
b. Update of Debt Policy #5 with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect.
6. Addition of new section entitled COVID-19 Response Policies as follows:
1. Guidance for Reductions:
• First consider reductions in administrative costs (overhead)
• Allowable to utilize reserves but limit use
• Allowable to utilize future FISA rubber tire service contributions
• Allowable to utilize future contributions from Credit Risk Premium (CRP) and project
savings to offset FasTracks shortfalls
• Should not utilize existing FISA balances, except for Board identified and approved
projects such as SH 119 BRT
• Do not reduce service levels below what is currently being offered
2. Guidance for Restoration:
• Restore reserves to three months if possible
• Do not utilize existing FISA balances
• Limit or eliminate use of future FISA rubber tire service contributions
• Restore deferred projects related to compliance or safety
• Restore service as ridership allows
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested may have a financial impact on the
2021 Recommended Budget, the details of which are to be determined.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time of
the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan. As part of this process, staff will review
potential fare adjustments to establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 addresses equity including social and geographical
2. Fare or other revenue streams and cost savings should aim to achieve financial levels
equivalent to inflationary adjustments in fare revenue established in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan.
3. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
4. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. One-time
revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
5. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the budget.
6. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure the
continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board will support
efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state financial resources
to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that would limit or diminish
revenue.
7. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment, and
will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to enhance cash
flow.
8. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year MidTerm Financial Plan period) and long-term (30-year Long Range Financial Plan period).
The purpose is to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax
forecasts using sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

effectiveness through ease of use and improved travel times.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable methods
of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will endeavor to maintain its assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs. See Asset Management Policy
RTD-AMD-PLY-0001.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss and
mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety management system (SMS) program will be maintained to minimize RTD's
exposure to liability and thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD. See SMS
Policy RTD-SFT-PLY-0004. RTD will invest in safety outreach programs and personnel
to communicate safety messages.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
matched to funding capacity using the system-wide and route-specific productivity
measures that have been approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. On an annual basisAs determined by the Board but not less than every two years, RTD
will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels, operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs. Capital projects to be included in the Mid-Term Financial
Plan will be evaluated using the following criteria:

total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;

source of funding;

operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the Mid-Term Financial Plan
period;

Attachment: 2021 Fiscal Policy Statement-markup (4361 : Review of the 2021 Fiscal Policy)

2. Capital investments should further RTD’s purpose of moving people, which is achieved
when investments are aimed at established agency metrics or key performance
indicators.
3. The asset investment decision making process will be data driven in accordance with the
RTD Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan.
4. Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog, and deferred assets before
consideration of new assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks Mid-Term Financial
Plan and/or Long Range Financial Plan (see #7 below).
2. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted Mid-Term Financial Plan as
the basis for the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
5. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the cost
estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to the Board
for reconsideration.
6. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance with
the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the Mid-Term Financial Plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues. to fund the FasTracks capital
and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES

Attachment: 2021 Fiscal Policy Statement-markup (4361 : Review of the 2021 Fiscal Policy)


benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited to
the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and ridership;

consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant criteria.

1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to provide
for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in
costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting
revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total fund balance at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding
depreciation among the following three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. For
FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should
3
Packet Pg. 108

1.C.2.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 29November 17, 201920

be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three months of FasTracks operating
expenses excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and
budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated fund
balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and occur only in
specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board approval, these funds
may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need for short-term borrowing,
and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating., and for other specific
purposes. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment
will take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or project
disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment of this fund will be
identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of non-Federal
revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each year
to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost
savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not be

posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2021 Requested Budget for public review by October
15, 2020 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements (CRS 29-1-101). The initial 2021 Requested
Budget is included in this document in order to comply with these requirements. A preliminary
Requested Budget is posted to the RTD website and hard copies are available in the Board Office for
public review.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Mission-Oriented Goal #3 - Strong Financial Management
Strategic Priority #6 – Move RTD Toward Stable Financial Situation
BACKGROUND
At this time, staff is presenting the first draft 2021 Requested Budget. Preliminary 2021 Requested
Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a final budget will be presented in November. The
2021 Recommended Budget will be presented at the November 10th Financial Administration and Audit
Committee meeting with staff requesting approval to move to the Board of Directors for ratification of
the 2021 Adopted Budget on November 17th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is facing and provide
opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the development of the 2021 annual budget.
Our previous communication included the abbreviated 2021-2022 Mid-Term Financial Plan, which forms
the basis for the 2021 budget, and which is scheduled to be approved by the Board on November 17th.
During development of the abbreviated 2021-2022 Mid-Term Financial Plan, staff presented a balanced
budget to the Board for 2021. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary proposed budget for the Base
System and FasTracks and will work to continue to bring this budget as close to the MTFP as possible.
Both the Base System and FasTracks preliminary budgets make up the 2021 Requested Budget
presented here.
The 2021 Requested Budget is compared to the 2020 Amended Budget below with change from period
to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached Exhibit I.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2021 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and uses. The
budget items will continue to be reviewed, and the final version incorporating any necessary adjustments
will be the 2021 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption in November. This Requested Budget
will be updated for items such as fare revenue estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital
expenditures for both new capital and capital carry forward amounts. Operating expenses will also be
revised for specific changes.
Based on guidance from the Mid-Term Financial Plan, the 2021 Requested Budget consists of the
following on a combined basis:
(1) Fare revenue:
a. Farebox revenue is forecasted based on the recommended service levels presented
by staff for 2021 and adopted by the Board. Planned service levels in 2021 will
be approximately 55% of pre-pandemic levels. That translates to projected fare
revenue in 2021 of $88.5 million, which is a decrease of $5.4 million from the
2020 Amended Budget. For Base System, fare revenue is forecast at $61.0
million, a decrease of $4.7 million from the 2020 budget amount. For FasTracks,
fare revenue is forecast at $27.5 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the 2020
budget.
b. Ridership is expected to continue to be diminished through much of 2021 due to
the effects of the pandemic.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, parking income,
rental income, and miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2020 Amended Budget
and adjusted for known items. It is budgeted to decline slightly in 2021. The
amount will change if more information becomes available for the 2021
Recommended Budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Per the CU-Leeds School of Business September medium/baseline forecast,
sales/use tax of $655.0 million is projected in 2021, which is an increase of 5.5%
or $34.0 million over $621.0 million projected for 2020. The medium/baseline
forecast is used in the 2021 budget.

Packet Pg. 118

1.C.3

b. This same CU-Leeds School medium/baseline projection for 2020 shows a 5.8%
decrease in sales/use tax from 2019 actuals.
c. The September CU-Leeds School low forecast for 2020 is $602.7 million compared
to the earlier May low forecast of $500.9 million used in the 2020 Amended
Budget. This is an increase of $101.8 million compared to the 2020 budget. The
medium/baseline forecast of $621.0 million for 2020 produces an increase of
$120.1 over the 2020 budget.
d. The forecast for 2021 of $655.0 million is $154.1 million higher than the 2020
Amended Budget.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $112.7 million (not including carryforward grant
funds), a decrease of $439.9 million from the 2020 Amended Budget. The
forecast assumes no additional CARES Act grant funding for 2021. The full
$112.7 million is estimated for the Base System, with no new grant funding for
FasTracks.
b. Large grants for the Base System include formula FTA bus and bus facilities funding
(5339), capital maintenance (5307), fixed guideway (5337), and state FASTER
grants. FasTracks has made final draws on the FFGA for the Eagle project and
Small Starts funding for SERE, although some carryforward amount may become
apparent for 2021.
c. Grant revenue is a preliminary estimate at this time and will be re-forecast in the
2021 Recommended Budget as new information becomes available and the project
carry forward budget is finalized.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income is budgeted at zero in 2021 for both Base System
and FasTracks. Some amount of investment income may be restored in the 2021
final budget when it is determined how much of the reserve balances can be
invested.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income is budgeted to decline slightly from the 2020 Amended
Budget.
b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI and includes a slightly
higher Build America Bonds subsidy due to a reduced sequestration rate (the
subsidy declines as the bonds are paid off).
c. The amount may change if more information becomes available for the 2021
Recommended Budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (excluding new expense projects and expense
project carryforward) of $620.2 million will be reduced in 2021 by $113.0 million
from the 2020 Amended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to
decrease $74.4 million and FasTracks Operations expenses are budgeted to
decrease $38.6 million. Both Base System and FasTracks operating expenses at
this time are in line with the Mid-Term Financial Plan but may change in the final
2021 budget if necessary.

Packet Pg. 119

1.C.3

b. No new expense projects are included in the 2021 Requested Budget per the MidTerm Financial Plan.
c. The expense projects carry forward (previously approved expense projects) is not
included in the 2021 Requested Budget; this will be identified and included in the
final 2021 budget.
d. The 2021 budget is reduced in the following areas: business travel, temporary
employees, professional dues, publications and subscriptions, employee referral and
signing bonus, professional development funds, Leadership Academy, MAX
program, no pay increases for salaried employees, tiered furloughs for salaried
employees, salary reductions for some salaried employees, no increase in
contribution to salaried defined benefit plan, reduced contribution to salaried
defined contribution plan, elimination of PTO and sick buy-backs, elimination of
overtime and extra shift pay, and reduction in personnel as appropriate to reduced
service levels.
e. These reductions are made in response to decreased revenue and reduced service
levels due to the pandemic.
f. Costs incurred by the Base System of operating the FasTracks services are
allocated from Base System to FasTracks based on resource drivers on a fullallocation basis, and Base System total expenses are reduced by the amount of the
allocation (a portion of overhead costs is also allocated for the commuter rail lines).
This a full allocation including administrative and support costs. The amount of the
allocation in 2021 is $31.0 million in YOE (year of expenditure) dollars.
g. FasTracks Operations also includes a $58.1 million estimated service payment to
Denver Transit Operators for Commuter Rail operations and maintenance that began
in 2016 and North Metro maintenance beginning in 2020. N Line rail car
maintenance is $4.0 million of the total in 2021. The expense is included in the
Rail Operations budget.
h. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.03/gallon. Gasoline is budgeted at an average cost of
$2.50/gallon, which is down from $2.90 in the 2020 budget.
i. All District rent and the $3.5 million contingency fund controlled by the General
Manager (reduced from $5.0 million in 2020) are included in non-departmental
expenses as well as various miscellaneous expenses.
j. Non-Departmental expenses also include represented pension plan contribution,
pandemic expenses, personnel separation expenses, and all District rents.
k. Certain items may materialize after the Mid-Term Financial Plan approval and after
this Requested Budget is presented. These items will be discussed and prioritized
with senior management and it will be determined if funds can be made available to
support these expenditures.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $87.8 million in 2021 on a combined basis are
down slightly from the 2020 Amended Budget. The TABOR payment of $10.7
million is included in this number (in FasTracks); the TABOR principal payment was
$10.0 million in 2020. The TABOR payment is structured to repay principal once
the Eagle project is fully in service.

Packet Pg. 120

1.C.3

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

LiVE Program Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: October 14, 2020
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 139

1.D.1

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of September 30, 2020, 12,282 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 7,593 have been
approved, 3,649 have been denied, 1,026 are pending and the remaining 14 have been closed for other
reasons. Of the 3,649 denied, 2,111 were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65
and older which entitles them to a better discount, 473 were denied because their address was out of
District, 81 were denied because it was a duplicate application, 81 were denied because the applicants
were already enrolled, 688 were denied because they did not respond to requests for a photo or
additional information, and 215 were denied because they did not meet the income threshold. Of the
1,026 pending applications, all lack an uploaded photo.
The decrease in ridership caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the suspension of fare collection from
April to June 2020 have had a significant impact on the program. The number of approved applications
went from an average of 230 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 100 in April,
50 in May and June,110 in July and August, and 123 in September.
The 7,593 LiVE participants enrolled as of September 30, 2020, provided a mailing address1 in the
following counties: Denver 3,669, Arapahoe 1,697, Jefferson 857, Adams 710, Boulder 338, Douglas
88, Broomfield 32, and Weld 32. Note that some counties are only partially in the RTD District. 170
participants reside in the RTD District but provided a mailing address in a county outside of the District,
which is acceptable under the program rules.
From the implementation of the LiVE program through September 2020, we issued 610 LiVE MyRide
cards that were used for 15,250 trips. 3,010 mobile app users bought 38,650 mobile 3-hour passes and
day passes. Nonprofit organizations bought 139,840 LiVE paper tickets. We do not know how many
individual riders received LiVE tickets from nonprofit organizations since the number of tickets issued to
each client depends on the organization and the client’s situation.
We compared sales of LiVE mobile tickets and LiVE MyRide stored value to assess the drop in LiVE
ridership related to COVID-19. These sales only decreased by 23% between February and September
2020 (47% if adjusted for the fact that there were more LiVE participants in September than in
February). This is a significantly smaller decrease than the 67% COVID-related decrease in sales for the
same fare products across RTD’s entire customer base.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
•
•

LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the

MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.
RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts. In June, RTD issued social
media posts for each fare discount. We also included information about the fare discounts
in the communications and outreach related to resuming front door boarding and fare

collection on July 1.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone, at least until the offices re-open.
Executed an amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and County of
Denver to add the services of an Outreach Coordinator at Denver Human Services. The
person in this new position will assist eligible riders who face barriers to completing a LiVE
application. We plan to offer this service at rotating locations throughout the District, for
example in homeless shelters.
Created new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver Human
Services, and community-based organizations. This included a comprehensive questions &
answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply, and how to use
the program. Updated the LiVE website for clarity and ease of use and added the new
materials and a new “partner toolkit” area.
Launched a new round of communications about the LiVE program. This included issuing a
news release and posting the new LiVE videos on social media. New communications
about the program and partner toolkit were emailed to community partners and RTD
Nonprofit Program customers. PEAK Outreach and Denver Human Services disseminated
the information through their email lists as well.

On-Going:
•

•
•

•

•

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to develop and implement a temporary
LiVE ID card. Organizations that serve individuals in emergency situations will be able to
issue temporary LiVE ID cards to their clients after the PEAK application is completed. This
will eliminate the wait time between the LiVE application and the ability to use the
discounted tickets for these individuals.
Work with the City and County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach
worker who will help individuals apply for the LiVE Program at partner locations
throughout the District.
A survey for LiVE customers asking for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE program will be
mailed within the next few weeks. We are asking for information about the effectiveness
of RTD communication, customer service provided by DHS and RTD, application
experience, fare products, demographics and income level, and suggestions for
improvement.

Next Steps:
•
•
•
•

•
•

Denver Human Services will start the hiring process for the LiVE Outreach Coordinator.
Create policies, procedures, and agreements for the temporary LiVE ID card described
above.
Prepare a program report for the first program year, late July 2019 – July 2020.
Compile and analyze results of the survey of LiVE participants to determine common
themes and offer assistance to customers who indicate that there is an issue with their
application or LiVE ID card that was not resolved.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.

In order to limit RTD’s handling of personally identifiable information for LiVE participants, RTD only
stores the mailing address of participants but not the home address. In most cases, however, home
address and mailing address are the same or in the same county.

Subject:

January 2021 Service Change Proposals Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2021 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and to
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 - Successful delivery of Transit Service.
DISCUSSION
The proposed January 2021 service adjustments reflect a mix of service enhancements, service
reductions and service suspensions in order to maximize ridership within the very limited resources
available to the District as a result of the financial shortfalls resulting from the COVID induced economic
slowdown. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments that represent the redeployment of
current resources available under the COVID 19 service plan. Overall, these proposals redirect resources
from services that are underperforming to services that have passenger capacity challenges due to limits
set by social/physical distancing policies that limit capacity on each RTD vehicle to approximately 30%
of pre-COVID capacity. Additionally, these proposals modify service patterns and levels of service on rail
corridors to more effectively match service to ridership demand. With the anticipated depletion of “Cares
Act” funding, the RTD’s ability to fund the operation of additional “follower” service will be sharply
reduced. This necessitates that services that have retained ridership during the pandemic are adequately
resourced to avoid leaving passengers behind due to capacity requirements. COVID induced reductions
in sales and use tax collections preclude returns to higher Pre-COVID service levels and overall ridership
remains less than half of former levels.

As can be seen from the tables and graph above, weekday ridership on local bus service has continued
at levels approximately 45% of pre-COVID levels while ridership on Regional services, Flatiron Flyer
services and light rail services have seen weekday ridership declines of 75%-85%. These ridership
numbers appear to be largely affected by reduced commuter activity and reduced employment center
occupancy. The tables were excerpted from a previous Ridership Restoration report and are provided to
describe changes in system ridership.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID 19 service plan be adopted as
a distinct change to the initial COVID service plan implemented April 19, 2020, as notable changes are
proposed to both bus and rail services. Leveraging the significant collaborative efforts made by the
Reimagine RTD project, a proposal to optimize RTD Light Rail service patterns are contained herein.
Continued coordination between RTD Systems Planning and Service Development staff has also yielded
alternative service plans and analyses to support proposals that shift resources to route services with
higher utilization from services with very low utilization. It should be noted that many of the routes
proposed for service improvements are routes that serve communities that rely on transit for their travel
needs. These riders often perform essential jobs and have continued to ride during the pandemic. It
should also be noted that alternative services have been considered for services that are proposed for
suspension and are listed in Attachment B of this report.
The guiding principles for proposed routine RTD service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

Packet Pg. 146

2.B.1

•
•
•
•
•

The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; and also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

However, given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guiding principles for the proposed January 2021 service changes come from the Board
adopted Guiding Principles for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 5 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams and Facebook Live between
October 7th and October 12th with 95 participants. Comments and further details from these meetings
have been recorded and are summarized in Attachment H of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal is designed to be cost neutral.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. The Title VI Analysis for the January 2021 Service Change is
pending completion and is expected to be available by October 20, 2020.

2.B.1.a

C/D Lines
Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased ridership in the morning peak, this
proposal adjusts the weekday service span: 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. –
6:00 a.m., a 15-minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute
frequency from 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would be operated from
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15minute frequency between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between
10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will accommodate the
increased passenger loads that are occurring in the morning peak that currently under the
COVID plan on a 30-minute frequency during the weekday, reduction in the overall service
span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine maintenance
(currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and minimize
overtime costs. Scheduled meets will occur all day long, instead of just the late evening
between E and D line southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer
for passengers coming from Denver Union Station (DUS) going to Mineral. Northbound
passengers will only need to wait for 3 minutes to transfer to the E line to reach DUS.
E/F Lines
This proposal consolidates the E and F lines to run the E line pattern of service to DUS from
RidgeGate. The E line has the highest ridership bi-directional peak commute when compared
to any other light rail line pre-COVID. Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased
demand in the morning peak, it is proposed that the weekday service span be adjusted to
4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 6:00 a.m., a 15minute frequency between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute frequency from 10:00
p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend service span would also be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with
a 30-minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15-minute frequency between 8:00
a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The effort
in changing service span and frequency will accommodate the increased passenger loads
that are occurring in the morning peak. The proposed reduction of the overall service span
will allow for a larger maintenance window for maintenance (currently an hour, this change
will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), and reduce overtime costs. Proposed
adjustments to the schedule would support all-day scheduled meets between E and D line
southbound at I-25 & Broadway to allow for a more efficient transfer for passengers coming
from Central Downtown Denver destined to RidgeGate Parkway. Northbound passengers
will only need to wait for 3-6 minutes at I-25 & Broadway to transfer to the D or H lines to
the Central Downtown area.
H line
Due to low ridership in the late evening, and increased demand for capacity during the
morning weekday peak, recommend adjusting the service span to be consistent with the D
and E lines. Adjust weekday service span will be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30minute frequency between 4:00 a.m. – 6:00 a.m., a 15-minute frequency between 6:00
a.m. – 10:00 p.m., and a 30-minute frequency from 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Weekend
service span will be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. with a 30-minute frequency between 4:00
a.m. – 8:00 a.m., 15-minute frequency between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m. and 30-minute
frequency between 10:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. Change in service span and frequency will

accommodate the increased passenger loads that are occurring in the weekday morning
peak that currently under the COVID plan running on a 30-minute frequency during the
weekday, will also allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine
maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window),
and reduce overtime costs.

R line
Recommend adopting the Reimagine RTD rail plan by recommending shifting the
southernmost terminal from RidgeGate to Lincoln due to low demand south of Lincoln with
a service span of 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m. on a 30-minute frequency for weekday and
weekend. Change in service span will allow for a larger maintenance window for MOW to
do routine maintenance (currently an hour, this change will allow for a 3.5-hour maintenance
window), and minimize overtime costs.
W line
Due to low ridership in the evening and increased capacity demands during the weekday
morning peak, recommend adjusting the service span to be from 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m.
Weekday frequency between Jeffco Government Center to DUS 30-minute frequency
between 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30-minute frequency between Fed Center to DUS
between 6:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
the Fed Center and DUS to address capacity concerns under the current COVID plan.
Weekend service span would be 30-minute frequency between Jeffco Government Center
to DUS 4:00 a.m. – 11:00 p.m., and 30 minute frequency between Fed Center and DUS
between 8:00 a.m. – 10:00 p.m., creating a combined frequency of 15-minutes between
Fed Center and DUS between 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. Change in service span and
frequency will accommodate the increased passenger loads that are occurring in the morning
peak that currently under the COVID plan is only running on a 30 minute frequency, allow
for a larger maintenance window for MOW to do routine maintenance (currently an hour,
this change will allow for a 3.5 hour maintenance window), minimize the need to pay
operators overtime which is usually over $1M each year.

Regional Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, ridership on Regional bus routes has fared comparatively worse
than other services offered by RTD. Even at reduced service levels, some operating routes are carrying 3
to 5 passengers per trip on routes of 25 to 40 miles in length. These poorly performing Regional routes
are:
CV – Pine Junction/Conifer – Denver
EV – Evergreen – Denver
GS – Golden – Boulder
Recognizing that travel patterns will not return to normal as people with the ability to work from home,
the vast majority of Regional passengers, will continue to do so, several options are being considered for
how to more cost-effectively serve these remaining Regional passengers. While passengers need the
mobility currently offered by RTD bus service, continuing to run full-size buses to accommodate a few
passengers is not a cost-effective or efficient use of RTD’s resources. Options being considered include:
vanpools/carpools; ride-hailing, e.g., taxi, Lyft; and RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride.
Vanpool service refers to a group of passengers with similar origins and destinations driving together in a
van provided and maintained by the DRCOG waytogo program and partially funded by RTD.
Advantages of this option include:
o Drivers are not paid, thus relatively low cost
o No deadhead, as vehicles remain with the driver
o Capacity in one van sufficient for each bus trip at current ridership, and flexible for additional
passengers
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need to stop at all bus stops along the
route and potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o One passenger must volunteer as the driver and also a backup driver needed
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions

a transportation network company such as Lyft or a taxi.
Advantages of this option include:
o No dedicated fleet of vehicles or employees

Can operate only upon passenger request, thus reduce costs relative to a fixed-scheduled bus
when demand is lower (e.g., Friday, holidays)
o Convenient trips for passengers — Vehicles would not need stop at all bus stops along the route;
potential for passenger pickup/drop-off at home or work.
Challenges of this option include:
o Vehicles are typically not ADA accessible. RTD would need to provide Access-a-Ride if requested
by a passenger to keep the service equivalent to present bus service, though this is not required
for Regional service.
o Willingness of passengers to share a vehicle under COVID conditions likely limits usage to one
passenger per vehicle, requiring multiple vehicles for each bus trip, increasing costs
o In ride-hail model the driver is not paid for deadhead time and these routes would likely require
significant deadheading, making them less attractive to drivers and less reliable to passengers.
Could be mitigated through a subscription model.
o If the service proves to be popular and attracts additional passengers, costs can rise significantly
Ride-hailing Cost
Prevailing rates apply and an individual ride is required for each rider. An estimate is $25 for a 25-mile
trip or (probably) more.
RTD FlexRide or Access-a-Ride operated could offer two operating options:
o Operating the full Regional route with smaller, more efficient vehicles
o Operating a truncated route to connect passengers with the RTD system without going all the way
to Downtown Denver. This is similar to a FlexRide as a first and last mile solution, but covers a
much longer distance.
Access-a-Ride currently has capacity to operate additional trips and meets ADA requirements. It could
provide a general public service, acting like a FlexRide anywhere in the metro area. FlexRide typically
operate in small service zones and may not achieve the same efficiencies as operating this kind of service
with Access-a-Ride.
Benefits of operating RTD Access-a-Ride include:
o Lower hourly operating cost
o Potential for less deadhead and service hours and cost by truncating route at a station
o Utilizing available capacity in Access-a-Ride
Challenges of operating RTD Access-a-Rdie include:
o Requires a vehicle and operator provided by RTD
o Passenger willingness to ride in a smaller vehicle with other passengers due to COVID concerns
o Longer travel time passenger trips If route is truncated to connect with RTD system prior to
Downtown Denver
o Truncating Route GS is not a viable option due to already only having potential connections at its
endpoints
Access-a-Ride Weekday Alternative Cost
CV (current service, but operated by AaR) – $637
CV (between Fed Center and Pine Junction, operated by AaR) - $582

In addition to the routes stated previously, there has been requests from passengers to provide service
on the following routes that were suspended entirely due to COVID-19:
116X – South Simms Express
P – Parker – Denver
Y – Lyons – Boulder
The alternative delivery options outlined in this document could also be applied to these routes, though
Route Y is similar to Route GS in that is does not have a good connection point to the rest of the system
other than at its current south end in Boulder. Boulder County is currently providing taxi vouchers to
residents of Lyons for travel to Boulder or Longmont. Additionally, Route P may be better served as a
local feeder service due to the proximity of existing rail service at Lincoln Station to most of the boarding
passengers. This can be better addressed when looking at providing alternatives to low-performing local
services.
Local Routes
During the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic several local routes were completely or partially suspended in April
2020 due to projected low ridership. As essential workers have traveled throughout the pandemic and
businesses have reopened more recently, requests for service on some suspended routes have been
communicated to RTD. Routes and options for providing service to these areas are the following:
Route 99 – South Kipling
Service has been frequently requested from passengers between Federal Center Station and the US285/Hampden Ave area. Options considered are:
o Operate hourly service on the full Route 99 between Federal Center Station and Southwest Plaza
- Serves the entire route at fixed, regular schedule
- Continues to provide service to low-demand areas that have not requested it
- Cost of three buses and operators
o Operate hourly service on a truncated Route 99 between Federal Center Station and US285/Hampden Ave
- Serves the in-demand portion of the route at fixed, regular schedule
- Cost of one bus and operator
o FlexRide
- Serves area on-demand and may have scheduled timepoints
- Cost of a bus and operator but at lower cost than bus
- Zone would be very large to cover all passengers and connect to Federal Center Station,
reducing reliability
128 – 128th Ave
Service has been requested in Broomfield on Route 128. Most of this area is currently covered by the
Broomfield FlexRide and also the Broomfield Easy Ride. Options considered are extending one or both.
RTD will work with the municipality and passengers to better communicate the options available in this
area. FlexRide currently covers the area and has capacity.

Community College. The options considered is to extend the coverage zone for the Green Mountain
FlexRide to cover Red Rocks Community College. The FlexRide zone is adjacent to the college and this
requires no additional resources.
Utilizing other demand-responsive services such as taxis, Uber, and Lyft, were examined but are not
recommended due to challenges related to providing ADA accessible service. Third parties providing
service in non-accessible vehicles require accessible vehicles be available from RTD to serve disabled
passengers and will generally offer one vehicle per passenger trip. Furthermore, it is difficult to attract
drivers to attract drivers to provide these trips for reliable service. The cost of having these accessible
vehicles on standby negates any efficiencies gained by providing trips with third-party non-accessible
operators. RTD is currently conducting a pilot program that allows for accessible trips to be provided in
conjunction with other trips operated by non-accessible vehicles. Should this prove successful and
scalable, it may be possible to implement on a larger scale across the district.

Need to have the 206 return in Boulder

We have been supporting Neighborhood EcoPasses the last 10 years even though we use the bus less than the cost of
an Ecopass. We did this to keep the program alive. And now our daughter just started 6th grade and we were
planning to have her take the 206 route in Boulder to her middle school. I understand why the 206 was cut
at the beginning of the pandemic and I believe it was the right decision. However, schools are now starting back
up and the 206 gets neighborhood kids to 2 different middle schools and Fairview High School. Now that the
students are going back to school it is time to start the 206 again.

Planned 205 Heatherwood cancellation

Hello,
I'm a Gunbarrel Estates resident who has for years relied upon, and continue to rely upon, the Heatherwood branch of
the 205 to get to and from Boulder. I and many people in my area took the 205 to get to CU Boulder for school every
day, and after graduation I continued to ride for medical appointments.
While I understand the budget constraints facing RTD, especially with the COVID‐19 pandemic restricting public transit
ridership for health and safety reasons, this route change will have a negative impact on the lives of west Gunbarrel
residents. I would ask that, at the least, RTD consider reestablishing this leg of the route in the future, when the
pandemic is sufficiently under control that students and workers will be able to safely resume the activities that take
them to Boulder.
Thank you for your time,
Anya Thurmes

Please do not suspend CV bus in 2021 for commuters

Yes there was low ridership over the summer, but there are many of us using the only 2 remaining CV buses this
fall. The RTD max is 15‐20 riders and at least 11 of us were riding home the 4:24pm on October 1. This is huge burden

Please do not start eliminating commuter routes for those still having to go downtown to their jobs despite Covid‐19.

To operate the most productive, efficient transit system for the communities we serve, we make changes to
our bus and rail system three times a year. We propose the following service changes to take effect on
January 10, 2021.
CV/CS: Due to very low ridership, it is proposed to suspend Route CV/CS between Pine Junction and
Denver, replacing it with an RTD-paid Uber/Lyft service partnership and/or taxi voucher program.
Consideration should also be given to DRCOG-coordinated carpool and vanpool options.
Attend a virtual meeting about proposed service changes or email service.changes@rtd-denver.com no

Please do not suspend Regional CV route in 2021

Could RTD please reconsider suspending the CV route in January 2021, so those who have ridden the bus to Denver area
jobs could continue to use it. If there is temporary reduction, could at least the 6:35am bus eastbound be retained?
Riding in small Uber car or shared van is concerning during COVID‐19 ‐ plus Colorado winters which many drivers are not
equipped to handle well on 285 foothills. This is not acceptable alternative during a pandemic.
We had 9‐10 riders each way today (RTD max is 15 right now on single bus) so even combining the 2 remaining buses
would likely put ridership at current max limits.
Most riders are very concerned if buses suspended in mountain communities (conifer and evergreen) they will not likely
return for years. We urge you to reconsider.

Proposed changes to Route 205

To whom it may concern:

The Heatherwood Loop at the end of this route is an essential service for many in our
neighborhood, and dropping this section of the route is really unacceptable. My teenage daughter
uses this route often to get home, and eliminating this portion would put her safety at risk, along
with the safety of other teens who depend on this section.
In addition to high school and college students, the Heatherwood loop serves people traveling to
and from work, several blind residents, as well as many senior citizens. There are no other bus
routes within miles of Heatherwood, and there are no other options besides paying exorbitant prices
for Uber or LYFT. Over the years, RTD has cut this route by 50% during the non-peak hours. Basic
bus service through Heatherwood is essential and already runs at a frequency that is barely
functional. The service must, at a bare minimum, remain in place.
RTD must look at other ways to address their budget shortfalls than cutting routes which people
depend on for their participation in society.
Thank you in advance for taking this proposed change off the table.
Sincerely,
Heidi Alina

Proposed changes to route 225, Lafayette

I’m writing to request you reconsider changing the frequency of the bus service for route 225. I understand the current
ridership doesn’t warrant the 30 minute schedule. However, once BVSD schools are back in session, many students will
need this bus route to get to and from their schools, homes, and workplaces. This route services Peak to Peak, Platt and
Platt Choice, Douglas Elementary, New Vista, and Fairview, among others. Because of the block schedules, students
don’t come and go only at set morning and afternoon times, but often need to catch the bus during the middle of the
day for open lunch, off periods, and to go to classes at other schools or CU, not to mention internships and paid
employment.
Please don’t let this strange time limit what’s available once we are able to be out and about. And, if it makes sense to
change the schedule now, please make provisions to re‐open the routes and provide more regular schedule once the
world is back on a more typical schedule.
Thank you for your time and kind consideration.

Proposed D Line changes

To whom it may concern:

As a 6 day/week, car‐less commuter between Evans station and Convention/Theatre, I regularly leave downtown
between 10‐10:30 pm. The loss of this line affected me tremendously. The reliability of a transfer from downtown to
the C line at Broadway is low enough to cause anxiety. Additionally, there is no substantial shelter at any of the 3 stops
one could make this transfer at. (The minor exception being Broadway, which is still very open and you run the risk that
a northbound train could cause you to miss the southbound C line.)
Another issue with the current D‐Line reduction is that all Southbound patrons must travel through the campus, and at
times, the trains can become unsafely overcrowded as the traffic has not been distributed. All of these problems have
caused me tremendous amounts of inconvenience and I have often had to resort to ridesharing if it is simply too late to
catch a train considering the low frequency of trips at this time.
In consideration for the Theatre traffic (Pre COVID at least), there were often riders out waiting for, even missing the
last train of the evening, and were often confused and dismayed at the situation. I heard many claim they will not use
RTD again for this simple reason. Additional service extensions until midnight would be a tremendous convenience and
a fantastic safety measure, but perhaps too much of a luxury for budgetary concerns.
We all understand the current situation and revenue concerns, but I have heard no positive reactions or anecdotes to
the service reductions, and I interact with a lot of D‐Line and H‐Line commuters and first‐timers. It seems backwards to
continue this reduction as traffic begins to return. Patrons will already be wary to use public transit, and the levels of
discomfort caused by the current D‐Line reduction could cause even long time commuters to seek alternatives.
I believe it is a wise choice to reinstate the D‐Line schedule as proposed. Any other action could be detrimental to the
future of the Light Rail system by grass‐root abandonment. Your core customers want this! Give it to us!
Thank you for your time,
8 year daily commuter

Proposed RTD Service Changes

I hope you're doing well. I'm emailing you regarding plans to discontinue the Route 205 bus line between Lookout
Rd/Gunpark and Heatherwood/Devonshire. I understand that funds are tight, and I know the 205 doesn't get as much
traffic as some of the other lines, but if at all possible, please don't discontinue it. If nothing else, could you decrease the
frequency, stop it over the winter, or just temporarily halt it during the pandemic instead? The 205 is the only method I
have to reach Walden ponds and my friends in Gunbarrel ‐‐ both of which are very precious to me. I also know people
who use it to get to work every day in the summer too. They'd lose their jobs without it.
That being said, there are people who rely on other bus lines for employment, as well, and if it comes down to the 205
or the FF1, for instance, obviously you should chose the latter. If there's any chance of saving the 205, though, please do.
There might not be many people who use it, but it means a lot to the people that do.

Best regards,
Ellie Bowers

We at RTD hate having to cut service. Right now, though, ridership is only about 40% of its pre‐

Hello Lynn

I am writing to express my serious concerns to the proposed change to Route 205 in Boulder. RTD is proposing to drop
the Heatherwood Loop off the end of this route. There are at least two totally blind residents, living in two separate
dwellings in that area and who depend on RTD for transportation. If you cut this service, they will have to get to 75th to
catch the bus.
The Heatherwood loop serves numerous commuters and senior citizens.The concern is that there are no other methods
of public transportation in that area. The frequency of stops has already been diminished a fair amount. I believe
completely cutting the route is detrimental for those who do not have a car or choose not to drive.
I ride my bike almost everywhere and the removal of the route may not significantly impact me personally, but I know
numerous people who cannot simply start riding their bike or driving their car. In the winter I usually try to take the bus
at least 2 or 3 times a week to avoid contributing to car traffic on the road.
I don't have an answer for solving budget issues. If I were the lawmaker, I would happily pay more tax money to sustain
the public transportation. I believe it is going to be even more important in the future for us to rely on public
transportation, instead of cars. I will fight for RTD and ample access to public transportation, even if it does not affect
me personally.

Sincerely,
Christina

I am a resident living in the Twin Lakes neighborhood and it has come to my attention that the Heatherwood loop may
be completely cancelled from this route. This change would not affect me personally, as I am privileged with a car,

Hi,
I have been riding your buses and light rail, etc. for the last 54 years and because of that I do not have access to a car,
nor do I want one because you guys are so fantastic!!!!
If I might suggest that because of the pandemic and your budget short fall why not run ALL of the routes in the
Boulder ‐ Denver/Metro areas at least every hour or half hour 7 days a week. Including the Flatiron Flyer....
It would be really nice if you would return the 32 route so that it goes to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science
and the Denver Zoo.
And many thanks for bringing the south bound 204 back during the week, every hour ‐ really do appreciate it as I use
it to get to King Soopers and back, and during winter/bad weather it will be much more used for that!!!!!
Thank you very much for all you do for us passengers, especially the ones who don't have cars (like me), are elderly,
or handicapped, students, etc.
I really do appreciate the email updates you send to us also, keep them coming!
Please take care and keep safe...
Sincerely yours,
Dana Kay Higginbotham

sad about Route 205 discontinuation :-(

I am writing to express disappointment upon hearing that Route 205 east of Lookout/Gunpark might be discontinued.
My family lives at 75th St and Clubhouse Rd and would be affected.
While some cuts are inevitable given coronavirus and the economy, our hope that the proposed route 205
discontinuation would be only temporary, signage would be left up (perhaps with "temporary discontinuation" stickers),
and that service would eventually be reinstated. Given that our route is "low ridership" compared to other routes with
"very low ridership" on https://www.rtd‐denver.com/service‐changes/january‐2021, we hope that route 205 could be
near the front of line when deciding which services comes back.
Best regards,
John Viloria

Support not changing the L Line schedule this service change

I would like to thank you for not proposing to reduce L Line service this schedule change, when reductions
have been proposed for other light rail line. The L Line's span of 15‐minute service ‐ roughly 9 am to 7 pm ‐ is
already shorter than the corresponding spans being proposed with this service change ‐ 6 am to 10 pm. It
strikes me as unusual that the L Line gets less service despite it being RTD's least‐subsidized (per boarding) rail
line.

I have been speaking to you about this for some time now. I live at Mexico an Chambers in Aurora for United airlines
working at DIA. I have no service but nine mile. I have no car, so now I am forced at 60yrs old to leave at 2am for a 5 mile
walk to 9 mile. Everything else forces me to take the train and I would be late everyday. We have no early morning bus
to get us to the train station. Plus connections time are just to short. Most times coming and going you have less then 4
minutes to make the 169 out 40th , the morning 169 right now only gives me 3 minutes to make the train. Same with the
153. The trains give us short periods. One real big thing no one cares about we have at a time 6, 000 employees going to
work on a morning shift. The system is not timed for that. To be honest that is why DIA EMPLOYEES DRIVE IN, THE
TIMING OF THE SYSTEM! TO MANY TIME STUCK ON A LINE!!! The A line feels like the care is for visitors to union Station.
200 dollars a month for poor service.
I shouldn't have to walk 5 miles at 2am for a 6am start with my job!
We had the 169L for almost 20yrs 40 people everyday at 5am. Never had a issue, same drivers it was great 👍.
But now, out of control. The A line is a big problem . I am a logistics specialist with united. Moving united states mail
around. So I do understand the facts. You have to rebuild. To much down time with drivers. Sit around for 30 minutes
and then leave 10 minutes late?
Seen a bus seating on a street by apartment no one around, a side street on Chambers the other day?
You need undercovers to just watch system. Includes your supervisors.
It is amazing the stories I have heard over the years about them. Problem in all departments. Clean sweep on all
levels, reorganization is called for.

Upcoming 2021 Service Changes

I am writing to heavily suggest an expansion of service on the 72 Bus Line that has ceased to be useful to many
in Arvada. Many residents, myself included, are no longer able to utilize the services of the 72 since its
operating hours were further constrained in September.
There are myriad bus lines that operate every 15 or 30 minutes, but the 72 only runs every hour; more
egregiously, it has ceased operations before 8AM, eliminating its utility for many who must leave for work
before then. We as a community need our public services now more than ever to be run as a necessary public
good rather than as a for-profit business that ignores the needs of the people. I highly encourage that the 72 be
returned to a functional schedule.
Thank you,

D Line Service Changes

I would just like to voice my support for the Jan. 2021 service change that would resume service on the D line to/from
Mineral. I know many people who work on the Southeast side of Downtown who stopped riding light rail not because of
COVID, but because of the long time involved with taking the C line and then trying to transfer to the H line. I would
anticipate many of those folks will be taking advantage of the D line once it resumes.

CV/CS Proposed Route Change

Many of us living in the foothills who work in Denver are concerned about the proposal to suspend Route CV/CS
between Pine Junction and Denver.
The stated reason for the proposed change – very low ridership – should be considered in the context of the COVID‐19
pandemic. Prior to March, the CV/CS route buses were consistently full. Regardless of which bus I caught, it was almost
always full. With the pandemic and significant moves to work from home and remote work options, ridership
understandably dropped. Oftentimes, despite a reduced number of daily routes, there would be 3‐5 passengers on the
buses. Recently, however, there has been an uptick in passengers. That trend toward increased riders will likely continue
as more employers return to “normal” operations, or at least modified operations that rely less on remote work.
For the environment and to avoid the high cost of downtown parking, many of us rely on RTD to safely and economically
get to work. Rather than suspend Route CV/CS, the better option would be to continue with the reduced route schedule
until such time as sufficient ridership warrants expanding the route options. At a minimum, RTD should defer a
suspension determination until it is able to evaluate ridership levels post‐pandemic. Otherwise, suspending service while
so many are still struggling imposes an additional, economically‐crippling burden.
I appreciate the opportunity to express my and my neighbors’ concerns.

Comment on proposed service changes -lines CV/EV

Thank you for the public comments opportunity.
Tough choices are needing to be made, I understand this.
I ride the CV bus from Pine Junction to Civic center station daily for work. I'm essential personnel in Denver.
While the bus isn't full, in the last month, ridership has doubled , going from 5 to 10 now most days. 10 is a good load
with social distancing. I suspect it will only continue to rise as more folks get back you work in person.
This is both mornings and afternoons . Seeing the afternoon riders for EV I assume this is the case for that line too
Please consider leaving at least one service time running for the CV line . There's many of us living in the 285 corridor
that rely on the bus for work. Leaving the 6:34am service and 4:24pm service running fits most people schedules and
isn't entirely stopping service.
Maybe to offset keeping CV EV running on one time, 16th Street Mall ride bus could go entirely too 15 mins times? Or as
I used to ride the FF7 maybe one less FF7 run could offset CV EV staying running?
Rather than just complain, I wanted to offer some solutions along with my concerns.
Best and I'm a big fan of riding RTD
Always

comment on service changes

I utilize wagon road park n ride to take bus downtown. I normally would take the 122x as my place of business is much
closer to civic center station. With the current reductions my commute has increased over 30 minutes each way due to
having to wait for a mall ride or timing a 0 bus or just walking due to only having the 120x as an option.
Is there any possibility of restoring some 122x routes or the metro running again or some hybrid where the 120x drops
off at union and also goes on to civic center station? Why not have the option of extending the 120x route to have an
additonal stop/travel to civic center station?
Right now the mall ride does not run frequently enough during work starting hours (630‐730am) so it's not as feasible an
option.

Also, the first LD3 runs rather late to get persons to work...not getting into Longmont till 8 AM makes me late for work

Conifer Bus Route

Hi,

While I understand that cuts need to be made, many people in the mountains do not have an alternative. Once people
are allowed to go back to work in the Denver downtown area, I do not think the Lyft‐carpool solution will be sufficient. I
am worried that when we go back down into Denver for in‐person work, RTD won't be there to make it possible for us to
travel and it would be too difficult to get the bus route back once it has been discontinued. There is not any sort of bus
service in that area and no other alternatives.
Please consider not ending this bus route and decreasing resources in other bus routes where people at least have other
options.
Thank you for your consideration,

Covid response feedback

Hello RTD,

As a student I have to say I'm incredibly disappointed in your decisions. I currently attend Community College of Denver
and prior to this quarantine you partnered with them to offer affordable transit options to students with the fee coming
directly from our student account. As most students needs changed during the pandemic, CCD made the choice to
suspend their partnership which would have forced all students to pay for an RTD pass they likely wouldn't have needed.
My program does however still require me to come to campus daily and when the college reached out to you requesting
an opt‐in program for affected students you said no.
This choice to deny introduction of a temporary opt‐in program for the Collegepass card has greatly impacted my
financial situation for these quarantined semesters. It has forced me to take the cheaper option of driving a personal
vehicle to school and work increasing my environmental impact and adding one more vehicle to the already problematic
issue of Denver traffic.
The simple fact is being a student during COVID is already hard and the choices your institution has made during this
crisis has made it even harder

Crowding issue

Dear RTD,

While you're considering high use routes, could you PLEASE see if something can be done about the weekday morning
Mallride in the 06:30 to 07:00am period? For weeks now, all busses, at least EB from DUS, have without exception been
carrying at least 25 people. Many of us depend on this to get to work, (especially as walking the Mall seems more risky
at that time of day, every day) waiting for a next bus, or trying to get an earlier one cannot be an option for us, because
so many employers not do not allow employees to enter their business early.
This is of course only going to increase as the weather gets colder. A significant number of us are seniors, so crowding
risks become very pertinent.
Thanks again for your work.

CV Route

I prefer you not cancel the CV route to Pine Junction. I bought a house in Pine Junction solely because the CV is nearby. I
don’t have parking in crowded downtown and prefer to continue taking the bus. I know that Covid has caused a lot of
rider uncertainty, but several pre‐virus riders say their companies plan for them to return to work full time in January.
I’m full time, back to work downtown and you can count on my continued support. Look forward to the virtual meeting.

D Train instead of C Train

You can not change the C train to the D train without a public restroom in central downtown! For the last 6 months, I
can't find anywhere with a public restroom in the downtown area except Civic Center station (weekdays until 7pm only),
and Union Station that are still open to the public. Someone told me to go to Pavilions, but you need a code to get in
there. And Starbucks closed all their bathrooms. CVS and Walgreens and TJ Max and Ross haven't had public restrooms
in years. I take water pills for high blood pressure along with a large portion of senior citizens, and this causes one to
have to urinate often and suddenly. With nowhere to go to the restroom between bus trip and train trip, I can not leave
my house to go shopping. I use the C train to go to Walmart in Englewood by switching from bus coming from west side
of downtown. I will no longer be able to shop at Englewood Station if I have no restroom to use in between. At least if I
switch to C train from bus, Union Station is right there. There are way more residences near Union Station than 16th and
Stout anyway. Noone is working in the Office Buildings, so why do you need the train to go there? I don't know of any
more people going to central downtown except protesters. Noone is going to Convention Center and most of the hotels
are empty.
Please reconsider switching from C train to D train only and keep the C train running into Union Station as it does now.
Thank You,
Carol Stevens

Consider shortening the route to the Mountain View pickup location instead of going all the way to Pine Junction.

This route provides vital access to high paying jobs in Denver so that the economic growth along 285 is maintained. I love
riding the bus in the winter; it’s cozy to be on a dark bus in the morning with a coffee and headphones. Replacing it with
Lyft/Uber increases the amount of cars on the road and then we are in some yahoo amateur’s car in likely adverse

EV Route Discontinuation

Dear RTD:

Pre‐Covid I would take the 6:00 a.m. EV bus from Evergreen to Denver Civic Center. I work for the federal government and we are
on Phase 1 of coming back to the office. Before Phase 1, we were on max telework. I am concerned that bus service will stop
starting in January 2021. By January 2021, my office could be in Phase 2 or even Phase 3 (full return of all staff to the office). Of
course, it will all depend on the pandemic in CO. Pre‐Covid, RTD is my only source of transportation – a family member drops me off
at the bus stop and uses the car during the day to get to and from school. I would appreciate at least one early morning and an
afternoon EV bus to and from Denver in January 2021. Otherwise, I will have to purchase a car and drive downtown.
QUESTIONS:



Will the EX bus still operate? If so, will there be an early morning EX bus that gets me to downtown BEFORE 7:00 a.m.?
I looked on the link in the email I got from RTD and I did not see detailed information about the Uber Lyft partnership
and/or taxi voucher program. Will that work with my Eco‐Pass if the EV bus is discontinued? Do you have to meet the
service at a bus stop or do they come to your home?

EV/ES route cancellation

Hi,
I'm a state employee who rode the EV/ES route daily to Capitol Hill prior to COVID. I've paid for an annual pass that is
good through the end of the year, despite not riding the bus since the pandemic began. I intend to go back to riding the
bus, and others who are currently working from home do, too. Many, many people have moved to Evergreen in the last
10 years‐‐the recent census puts the number at 40,000, a 4‐fold increase in a decade. The demand will continue to be
there post‐pandemic. Please reconsider canceling the route entirely and consider going down to 1‐2 buses a day to
weather the pandemic.

As a student living in Boulder, I find that the bus lines that are most important to me are the AB(to fly to see my family,

Feedback on proposed schedule change: Route 20

I was distressed to hear about your proposed changes to the Saturday and Sunday schedule for route 20. I rely on this
route to get to work on Sundays, and many people in our community also rely on this route to provide transit to the
Denver Museum of Nature and Science and the Denver Zoo. Cutting service to such an inconvenient time table on
weekends is paramount to cutting the route completely. People gravitate towards convenience and especially right now
safety. Decreasing service will result in a lack of ridership for those who may have decided to take this route, and more
crowded busses for those of us who have no choice. Cutting service is like slowly poisoning yourself. How do you expect
your riders to continue using your services when you keep discontinuing rides and slashing away at your capability to be
a reliable form of transportation? I implore you to reconsider this decrease of service, this is not the right time.

Hi Elizabeth,
Thank you for writing with these concerns. I have heard from other Heatherwood neighbors as well. I am
forwarding all of the emails that I receive to RTD's service planning staff and will discuss the concerns with the
proposed change with them.
We hate having to cut service. Right now, though, ridership is only about 40% of its pre‐Covid.numbers, which
is causing serious budget problems. The Heatherwood route has very few riders, especially during the
pandemic. The service team will verify ridership, and I will work with them to consider the options.
In addition, there are still three virtual public meetings where you can ask questions to staff and express your
concerns. The meetings are listed below. I encourage you and others to try to attend. Changes can still be
made, often based on the comments from these meetings and emails. I will attend the Facebook Live event

Hi Lynn,
I just learned that the 205 bus service to and from Heatherwood may be cancelled. We need our bus service! I've heard
from several neighbors who are disabled and it serves as their only form of transportation into Boulder. It is also
important to our middle and high school students as a way to be more independent. As housing prices in Boulder soar,
more college students are moving into the neighborhood to save money on rent and need transportation to CU. And for
the rest of us, we need greener options to get into Boulder. Heatherwood needs the 205!

FW: Your Recent Question

Writing to follow up on the response below. I understand schedule changes are made 3 times per year but this is a
significantly different year than previous ones. Covid changed everything in March. Ridership dropped, service was cut
back. Now we’re more aware of the covid challenges and more people have returned to work, driving. Traffic is getting
heavier and winter is approaching. I would feel confident riding the bus, masked up, and socially distant, and would
particularly appreciate riding during the winter. But the morning times for the eastbound FF5 are missing the mark with
no 8am bus. Arriving at 7am or 9am just doesn’t cut it.
I’ve kept my bus pass up all these months and now, when I need it most, I guess I will cancel b/c the scheduling can’t
meet my needs. My understanding from the message below is that nothing’s going to happen, if at all, until January,
correct?

Fwd: January 2021 Proposed Service Changes: Virtual Public Meetings

During normal times, I ride the GS four days per week, round trip from south Boulder to the Denver Federal Center
(where my office is located). With covid, of course, everything is different ‐‐ I have not ridden the GS bus since March,
and I have only been to my office a handful of times. I recognize the difficulty this puts on RTD, as I imagine that very
few people are riding the GS bus these days. So, I can see that a temporary suspension of this route makes sense, even
if it's unfortunate.
I hope very much that when things return to more of a normal pattern, the GS route will return. And, importantly, I
hope that this can happen pretty quickly. If people are commuting fairly normally, but there's no GS, then the regular
riders will develop other patterns and might not return to the GS. It seems like a pretty quick (weeks, months) return to
regular GS (even just a couple per day) will be important to keeping the ridership and keeping the healthy route.
Thanks,
Seth

January Service Changes

I appreciate your effort to improve morning rush hour service by adding more trips on the light rail E line (30 minute
frequency starting at 4:00 am). However, this does not improve the situation for Flatiron Flyer riders who connect with
light rail in the morning, as it seems the first trip out of Boulder on weekday mornings will continue to be at 5:00 am
(arriving at Union Station at 5:48).
I have been a faithful daily RTD commuter for 17 years from Westminster to the Denver Tech Center, starting with the
‘T’ bus route and then transitioning to FF1 and E line service when the ‘T’ line was cancelled. Unfortunately I need to be
to work at 6:30 am in the Denver Tech Center and was forced to stop riding when you cut service for COVID‐19. If you
don’t make an improvement to the FF1 service that is equitable to that proposed for the E line, I will be forced to
continue to drive. The same can be said of numerous coworkers who have recently discontinued riding RTD.
Please make an effort to restore service for all of your riders—we’re counting on leadership from RTD to do their best
for the entire district.

If the Route 28 is cut, there won't be buses between West Colfax to 38th Avenue. It would be a long walk either way.
I am a senior who does not drive and who has been an RTD rider for decades.
The recent cuts and the proposed cuts should be reversed as soon as possible. RTD has to improve its service for it to
survive. Thank you.

Please do not cancel Route GS

I am writing in response to the proposed elimination of the route GS bus this January. I have relied on this bus for the
past 5 years to get to work in Boulder from my home in Golden. This is largely a commuter bus that many people like
myself use to travel between Lakewood and Boulder. I understand that ridership is low due to so many of us now
working remotely during the pandemic, but just before the pandemic this route had increased ridership to the highest
numbers it has ever had. RTD had already cut this route down to a handful of busses each day. To completely eliminate
this bus would cause a huge hardship to myself and many others who rely on this bus. My fear is that it will take a long
time to reinstate this bus as we start returning to our offices, and that will leave many of us in a bind. I also fear that
they might not bring it back, as I know RTD is so short on funds.
The proposed vanpool option that RTD emailed us today is not clear. The vast majority of commuters on this route use
an ecopass. There is no information on what this vanpool would cost us out of pocket, and why we cannot use our
ecopasses, which are already paid for. I do not see this as a good option, and will cause many of us further hardship
since it will carry a higher cost.
Please do not cancel our GS bus! It is already running in a very limited capacity, please keep it that way so that we at
least have one or two options to get to Boulder each day.
Thank you,
Heather Michener

205 line in Gunbarrel

I strongly object to the cutting of the 205 line to the Heatherwood area. I live in a condo complex along that route and
am on our condo hoa board. Many of our residents rely on this service. Unfortunately Covid has a number of us still
working from home so ridership is down. Only a few years ago we worked with the county on sidewalk improvements
to improve connectivity to our bus stop.
Our complex has primarily younger workers and elderly residents both of whom have the need for this service.
Please don't cut this essential service.

Conifer/Pine Junction Bus Route

This email is in response to the proposed upcoming route changes. Removing all bus lines to/from the
foothills is an unfair way to manage your business issues. You are cutting off an entire section of the metro
area, and yes, we are still in the metro area. Reducing the number is reasonable, but eliminating is not
appropriate.
Are you basing this assessment on recent ridership? Clearly during COVID the ridership decreased to virtually
nothing, but that won't last once the pandemic gets under control.
Will this be a temporary removal of these bus lines? It sounds like this decision is permanent. If it is
temporary until COVID is under control, that's understandable. But at least leave the option open to resume
these lines.
Are you concerned at all about the environment? You are putting that many more cars on the road, through
which your other buses will have to travel.
Parking downtown used to be horrible, without these lines it will be even worse. It may not seem that way
now, but once we get back to normal, we will all pay for this in many ways.
I was unable to attend any of your meeting due to my work schedule, but wanted to provide input. And I
would appreciate responses to my questions above.
You have a faithful following up here, and I can speak for myself and say I'd prefer to pay more than see the
bus lines go away entirely.
Please reconsider!!

CS/CV Proposed Changes - comments

As a former daily rider of the CV from Aspen park who has been working remotely since March, I completely understand
RTDs reasoning for discontinuing this route at this time. There is likely nowhere near the ridership needed to justify the
use of the motorcoaches that run this route until more progress is made around preventing the spread and severity of
COVID‐19.
I would strongly encourage RTD to reinstate this route once offices in downtown Denver are once again open without
restriction as to the number of workers in each office, as I, and many of my fellow state employees, really depend on the
CV route as our main means of transportation from our foothills community to the downtown area. We also see it as a
way to keep all of our cars off the road, which reduces both traffic and pollution, and it provides a safe way to get to
work during bad weather.
In summary: totally support and understand the elimination of the route in the short‐term, but strongly encourage
reinstating the route once people are able to return to work in large numbers.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments, and please let me know if you have any questions for me, or if I can
be of further assistance.

Respectfully,
Matt Mortier

E Route

I've been riding the E route for over a decade. I HIGHLY suggest keeping this line open by running
one bus during these difficult times. If it stops running, I will close my office downtown because
parking rates are too expensive. You also get the domino effect. Denver loses demand for rent
leading to less people downtown leading to less economic activity = loose / loose situation. This route
is more than just a line on an income statement but a lifeline for businesses, families, individuals
which keep the mountain corridor connected.
Lastly, please keep this one route at a desirable time. The 5:30am buses are too early and it doesn't
solve the issue.
Sincerely,
John Briggs

Regional Transportation District

Re: RTD Proposed R Line Service Change - 2021
Dear Mr. Ballard,
The City of Aurora, like other jurisdictions and agencies, is dealing with the significant negative impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular the resulting tax revenue shortfall and associated budget gaps
that are prevailing through 2020 and expected to continue through 2021. We certainly understand that the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) is facing some tough choices on how to address decreases in
ridership, fare revenue and a fall-off in sales and use tax revenues due to this pandemic.
Before the pandemic creeped into our everyday lives, the R Line experienced a 6.2% ridership increase in
2019—the highest among RTD's light rail lines. It is important to note that throughout this public health
crisis, the R Line has remained RTD's third best light rail line in retention of ridership. The R Line remains
the most direct connection to the A Line and Denver International Airport for the eastern metro area. This
rail line delivers essential workers in the healthcare and service industries to major job centers every day. It
serves 108,000 of the metro area's most vulnerable persons such as low income, elderly, young and those
living with disabilities.
Since the R Line started service in 2017. 5,500 new residences and 800,000 square feet of new commercial
space have been constructed. Development and redevelopment activities along the R Line continue at an
impressive pace with the full expectation of bringing new riders to transit-supportive activity centers like The
Point at Nine Mile, Parkside at City Centre and the Colfax and Fitzsimons stations serving the Anschutz
Medical Campus and Fitzsimons. Over 1,700 residential units and 170,000 square feet of commercial/retail
space are currently under construction and will open in 2020. These development quantities do not include
the development capacity at 13th Avenue, 2nd Avenue and Abilene Street, and Aurora Metro Center.
Additionally, the R Line is the only direct regional connection between the growing northeast metro area and
the booming southeast corridor, and there’s no doubt that it is a critical part of a thriving and equitable public
transit system for all as we work together to recover from COVID-19.

The City fully realizes adjusting the R Line to operate between Peoria Station and Lincoln Avenue Station
rather than from the current end-of-line RidgeGate Parkway Station on 30-minute frequencies is a reasonable
rail service operating action during the COVID-19 situation for 2021. Lincoln Avenue Station served as the
end-of-line station for the R Line as well as the E and F Lines serving the southeast corridor from their
opening days until the Southeast Rail Extension Project delivered the rail line extension that added Sky
Ridge, Lone Tree Town Center and RidgeGate Parkway Stations (now the end-of-line station) several years
ago.

2.B.1.h

Business development decisions continue to be made by public and private investors around R Line stations,
taking into account the overall regional transit connections and service offered. The addition of “Mixed-Use
Transit Oriented Development (MU-TOD)” zoning classification to Aurora’s Unified Development
Ordinance further encourages higher density land uses proximate to R Line stations together with strategic
incentives offered by the City towards private Transit Orientated Development around the R Line. Needless
to say, the City and the private sector are working collaboratively to optimize the ensuing station area
development as envisioned in our recently adopted Aurora Places comprehensive plan.
As the easternmost north-south transit corridor, the R Line is a unique and important line and a critical part
of a larger mobility system for a growing region. It is the only circumferential or non-radial line serving
destinations outside downtown Denver. This design serves the critical travel needs for thousands of
employees and residents between the region’s two major and growing employment centers and corridors, the
Fitzsimons/Anschutz Medical Campus currently with 30,000 employees and 100,000 daily visitors along the
I-225 corridor, and the Denver Tech Center, Inverness and Meridian business centers along the Southeast
corridor with 240,000 employees and daily visitors as well as offering the most direct connection to the A
Line and Denver International Airport for the eastern metro area. It serves as an important by-pass route to
alleviate the already congested central rail corridor at I-25/Broadway.
The R Line connects the region to major healthcare services, an essential and critical service for all, at the
Anschutz Medical Campus, the Medical Center of Aurora, Sky Ridge Medical Center and the Rocky
Mountain VA Regional Medical Center.
Maintaining the adjusted R Line service will send a positive message to the investment and development
community that will only serve to encourage future investments at rail in rail-orientated TOD.
Thank you for taking the time to consider the City’s position, concerns and comments as well as those of our
major stakeholders and the public. Our collective customers and stakeholders will continue to be well served
by the adjusted R Line service being proposed in 2021 delivering rail service between Peoria Station and
Lincoln Avenue Station. This is a reasonable transit service plan given the extremely challenging budget
environment brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Sincerely,

James M. Twombly
City Manager

It is important to note that for the pre-pandemic and current COVID-19 times, the overwhelming majority of
R Line customers in the southeast corridor (south of Dayton Station) board/alight R Line trains between
Belleview and Lincoln Avenue stations. No development currently exists at the Lone Tree Town Center and
RidgeGate Parkway Stations. Additionally, Lincoln Avenue Station hosts crossover tracks to accomplish
reversing the trains from southbound back to northbound direction.

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 20, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2021 Proposed Performance Report and the accompanying performance
measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2021, there are 44 proposed performance measures to
be tracked for the GM, which is two higher than in 2020.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Mission-Oriented Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Service
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they should integrate with the Board’s priorities for the coming
year.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2021 are
brought to the Board of Directors for review at this time because the measures are used in
development of the 2021 Budget. These final 2021 performance measures are being presented to the
Board for adoption on October 27th.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the performance measures from 2020 to 2021 are listed below:
Goal 3.1 – Maintain system-wide on-time performance
For Commuter Rail on-time performance, the goal is broken out to measure the following:
•
•

Commuter Rail On-Time Performance – A, B, & G Lines
Commuter Rail On-Time Performance – N Line

The purpose is to report separately on DTP-operated CR lines and RTD-operated CR lines. In both
cases, the goal will be 90%.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain system-wide service availability
For Commuter Rail service availability, the goal is broken out to measure the following:
•

Commuter Service Available – A, B, & G Lines

Packet Pg. 237

2.B.2

•

Commuter Rail Service Available – N Line

The purpose is to report separately on DTP-operated CR lines and RTD-operated CR lines. In both
cases, the goal will be 97%.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2021 performance measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2021 Adopted
Budget.

Attachment: Service Availability - September 2020 (4351 : Service Availability – September 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.82% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in September 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (August) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

September 2020 – 85.12 hours
September 2019 – 12.12 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1672.72 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2579.89 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in September were bus bridges and the
COVID-19 pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.82% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
