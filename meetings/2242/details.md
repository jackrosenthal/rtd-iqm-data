### B. Recommended Actions

No recommended actions were presented.

#### 1. Federal Update - Former Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater

Committee Chair Folska introduced Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs who gave a brief update on recent Federal developments.

Mike Dino said that the President’s 2016 Fiscal Year Budget was released. In it, RTD was allocated $92 million under New Starts Full Funding Grant Agreements for the Southeast extension.  He noted that the President’s plan to fund transportation is not too dissimilar from what is being discussed in Congress: repatriating oversea profits and raising the gas tax.

Mike Dino pointed out that the President’s proposed budget also includes a significant addition to the TIGER and TIFIA programs, increasing the awarding possibilities for RTD and Colorado.  He said that the President’s budget is an indication of where his priorities are.

He noted that Squire Patton Boggs in Washington, DC, is coordinating with the Directors and staff to ensure the visit during the APTA Legislative Conference in March, 2015 will build on last year’s trip.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Mike Dino for the update.

Committee Chair Folska said it was an honor to introduce former Secretary of Transportation Rodney E. Slater.  She noted that he has an extraordinary, humbling, and inspiring background.  Committee Chair Folska asked Director Francone to read Secretary Slater’s bio, given that February is Black History month and considering his contributions to transportation and the community.  A copy is available at the RTD Board of Director’s office.

Secretary Slater started his comments by expressing how pleased he was to be in the Mile High City, which has never been short on vision and determination, always providing for the citizens.  He noted that transportation is more than just concrete, asphalt, and steel.  It is about the roads we all travel to become who we are and serve in the capacity that we serve.

Secretary Slater said that he had a chance to experience all the work RTD is doing on his way from the airport and while touring Denver Union Station (DUS).  He mentioned that his colleagues at Squire Patton Boggs keep him informed of RTD’s work.

Secretary Slater noted that this week, President Obama unveiled his $478 billion budget, giving communities like this one funds to move forward.  Secretary Slater trusts that Congress will have a discussion that can lead to common ground, then higher ground, regarding transportation.  He quoted House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who said he is, “looking forward to working with the president in all budget matters”.

Secretary Slater pointed out that current Secretary of Transportation, Anthony Foxx, met with former Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta and Google CEO Eric Schmidt on Monday, February 2, 2015. It was at Google’s headquarters that Secretary Foxx launched “Beyond Traffic: Trends and Choices,” the Department’s 30-year draft framework on the future of transportation.  The conversation included the development of technology, such as driverless vehicles.  Secretary Foxx mentioned that in 30 years Omaha, NE would be as congested as Los Angeles, CA unless transportation challenges are dealt with today.  Secretary Slater noted that not dealing with these challenges leads to gridlock, which is wasted time, wasted dollars, and wasted lives.

Secretary Slater commended RTD for its partnerships with different metro Denver communities and agencies.  He said Denver is one of the most dynamic, visionary cities in the world when it comes to transportation, including bike systems.  He encouraged RTD to continue doing what it’s been doing: delivering projects on time or early and under budget.  This, he said, is the powerful punch that prompted the President to include two RTD projects in the budget.

Secretary Slater exhorted the RTD Board to continue working together by being transparent, expressing their opinions, and leaving the table as a united body.  He emphasized that unity does not mean uniformity, but working through issues.  Secretary Slater encouraged the Directors to keep engaging with the Governor’s office and the Denver Mayor’s office.  He prompted RTD to keep dreaming big and working together just like with the DUS project, which has brought about new development and life to the area.  Secretary Slater said that there needs to be more projects like DUS so other cities can believe the best days are ahead of them.

Secretary Slater thanked the Directors for being at the meeting.  He thanked RTD for allowing him to work with the agency during his tenure as Secretary of Transportation. He was grateful he gets to work again with RTD during his tenure at Squire Patton Boggs.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Secretary Slater for his remarks.

Director Walker said that he was able to watch the last 20-30 minutes of Secretary Foxx speech at the Google headquarters.  Two things stood out to him:

- “We cannot keep budgeting for a number, budget for a desired outcome”

- “Google could not be where they are today if they had a ten month budget”

Director Walker noted that these two points are encouraging for agencies, such as RTD, who are in the process of putting together a long term strategic plan.

Director Walker asked Secretary Slater what he thought would be the impact of driverless vehicles, such as the Google driverless car, to transit agencies.  Secretary Slater replied that this technology would revolutionize transit agencies. He said that currently there is technology for maps pointing out areas of congestion.  As drivers embrace this technology, including the cars that utilize it, it would afford them to alter their routes, thereby improving the flow of traffic for transit vehicles on fixed routes.  He noted that other technology available includes self-parking cars, backing up awareness, cameras, truck-locking technology providing fuel efficiency and safety, etc.  Secretary Slater added that some people are even talking about the Hyperloop as a form of transportation, which is almost like flying through space.  There are many people that say this is not possible but there was a time when flying was considered impossible.

Director Tobiassen expressed his intrigue by Secretary Slater’s comments on Google.  Director Tobiassen noted that his current day job is in the Department of Defense (DOD), who has recently began to work with Google as well.  Director Tobiassen said that the DOD is stakeholder-centric.  Google’s conversation brings a user-centric point of view.  Director Tobiassen asked Secretary Slater his thoughts on the user-centric paradigm as it relates to RTD and transit agencies, which are traditionally stakeholder-centric.   Secretary Slater used DUS as an example of a project that was stakeholder-centric in its plan and design yet user-centric in application.  He noted that the development around DUS, such as apartment buildings with multi-use facilities on the first levels (groceries, cleaners, other quality of life essentials), allow for a compact, user-centric community.

Secretary Slater added that the Federal Highway system was originally part of the DOD.  He noted that President Eisenhower had defense at the center of the transportation network as a way to better deploy troops.  Secretary Slater pointed out that during his tenure as Secretary of Transportation, President Clinton signed an executive order allowing for more civilian use of GPS technology, which at the time was only used for military purposes.  He said that aviation originally was for defense purposes but it was not until after World War II that it was used for mail and other user-centric purposes.

Director Francone noted that District N, which she represents, is fairly large in size and accommodates both mountain and urban population.  She asked Secretary Slater his thoughts on best serving such a varied population.  Secretary Slater thanked Director Francone for the introduction she read earlier.  He noted that transportation brings different communities together by giving users choices, thereby giving them opportunities.  He noted that RTD services are already doing this.  He encouraged Director Francone and the Board to continue going out to the community they represent and being a part of the community they represent.  Secretary Slater suggested asking the constituents how RTD can be more user-centric, encouraging the agency to continue doing community forums.  He proposed that engaging in this manner would allow for discovering blind spots that the Directors may have.  He applauded RTD’s efforts in working together with other entities to strategically plan for the metropolitan area.  Secretary Slater noted that President Clinton threatened to veto transportation funding if there was not a high level of funding for transit as well as transportation. He pointed out that President Clinton was from Arkansas, where there is little transit, meaning that transit experience is not necessary to understand its necessity.

Chair Sisk expressed the Board appreciation in working with Mike Dino.  He acknowledged Senator Bennett’s bipartisan work in funding the transportation bill.  Chair Sisk asked Secretary Slater how the Highway Trust Fund could realistically be funded.  Secretary Slater mentioned that a recommendation for a gas tax increase may not be mentioned but might be what ends up happening.  He said that the last time the gas tax was increased was in 1993.  In 1998 the gas tax was taken out of the general fund and placed in the trust fund.  Secretary Slater said that the key is to keep all the options on the table.  He said that the President is challenging Congress to think big and long term.

Director Anderson recalled sitting next to Mike Dino during her tenure in DRCOG at the time TEA-21 was being enacted.  She thanked Secretary Slater for his contributions not only to transportation but also to the Civil Rights movement.  Secretary Slater noted how transportation has played such a significant role in the Civil Rights arena; he mentioned Plessy vs. Ferguson (train) and the Montgomery Bus Boycott, Selma and U.S. HWY 80.  He also noted that Memphis, TN was the main city near his hometown growing up.  He remembers the day in 7th grade when Dr. King met his fate in his favorite city resolving then to become a lawyer and make changes happen.  During his Junior year of High School he ended up in the Principal’s office for protesting his inability to participate in a program honoring Dr. King.  He was arrested, tried and not able to participate in football during his Senior year, which would have been his source for a college scholarship.  Secretary Slater mentioned that everyone can remember a moment in their story where they made a decision that has brought them to where they are at today.  He thanked everyone for making the decisions that have brought them to this place.

Director Solano thanked Secretary Slater.  He noted the similarities between the Latino and Black communities and how these communities have come together.  Director Solano asked Secretary Slater about the influence of telecommunications in transportation.  Secretary Slater replied that telecommunications has created a more “distracted drivers”.  He noted that the telecommunication technology on the dashboard has been created as part of an experience to sell.  Some auto companies, like Tesla, are classified as technology companies.  Secretary Slater said that this challenge can be managed.  Using telecommunication technology such as crash avoidance systems and roadway correction would really benefit transportation.  He noted that telecommunication technology brings forth some privacy issues as well.

Director Bagley told Secretary Slater that his ability to articulately describe what RTD is doing reflects how well in tune he is with the agency’s work.  He thanked Secretary Slater for his comments regarding unity as a Board.  Director Bagley noted that there may be disagreements but once a decision is made the Board needs to be supportive of the decision.  Director Bagley said that the Board is pleased to have Secretary Slater as a contributor to the Squire Patton Boggs team, giving RTD great confidence in working with them.

Committee Chair Folska said that as a blind person the promise of a self-driving car sounds very nice.  She said that she had a professor who said that one day we will all wonder why we allowed humans to drive.

Committee Chair Folska and Director Francone presented Secretary Slater with a DUS plaque as a token of the Board’s appreciation for his attendance and comments.

### D. Other Matters

Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that RTD made a presentation on FasTracks and Base System at the Joint Transportation Committee at the Capitol last week.  Directors Archuleta, Folska, Francone, James, and Tobiassen were in attendance.  One of the questions was regarding the public engagement on the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS).  The question was responded to in writing and the Board was copied on the reply.
