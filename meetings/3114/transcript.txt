PEGGY CATLIN: Do I have a motion?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second, Director Williams.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Williams, a second. Any opposed?
OK. We are hereby in an executive session. And now I would instruct the Directors on the line to
go into the Teams meeting for our first interview with Miss Adelee LeGrand. I will give you
couple minutes to access that meeting.
JOHN MCKAY: Before everyone goes-- this is John McKay-- could I have a quick count of
anybody who's experiencing Teams issues so that I can report that to IT right now so I can get
you in?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Rivera-Malpiede.
JOHN MCKAY: OK, thank you, Chair. I know Director Lubow-JUDY LUBOW: This is Judy Lubow. But I just got into my account so I'm going to try it.
JOHN MCKAY: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: John, I'm having some minor issues. I've been able to use Teams before on
this computer. Not having luck today. But I'm trying a different route. So it's probably just
operator error.
JOHN MCKAY: Well, I'll put in a ticket all the same. Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Thanks, John.
KATE WILLIAMS: John, this is Director Williams. I was in a meeting yesterday where, a
Teams meeting, where the computer security system saw Teams as an invader and refused to
allow people into it.
JOHN MCKAY: Thanks. OK, thanks.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK. I guess we're going to sign out and sign back in, right? Bye.

LYNN GUISSINGER: We're getting off this one. Is that right?
JOHN MCKAY: Goodbye.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
