BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO
I am pleased to introduce RTD’s Fiscal Year 2023 budget.
The FY 2023 Budget represents a financial plan for what’s next for the agency in the
coming year. Among the highlights:
• Continuation of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan implementation framework,
aligning objective, measurable inputs with established strategic priorities and a
laser-like focus on employees’ efforts on metrics that matter to RTD’s overall
success outcomes

DEBRA A. JOHNSON

• Completion of the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis to evaluate potential changes to the
fare structure and pass programs and develop recommendations to be considered for adoption by the
Board
• Implementation of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) with the January 2023 service change. Essentially,
the SOP sets the stage for the agency’s optimization of service delivery through the short-term component
of the Reimagine RTD effort, the agency’s Comprehensive Operations Analysis. The SOP is geared toward:
- Aligning service levels with workforce availability
- Increasing the agency’s focus on providing a high-quality, regional backbone network
- Sustaining the overall integrity of the transit network, and
- Maintaining assets in a state of good repair
RTD’s revenues, the funding that allows the agency to strive to deliver high-quality transit services, are derived
primarily from three main sources: sales and use taxes collected on goods and services purchased within RTD’s
service area; federal grants, which supplement not only RTD’s revenues but those of many transit agencies
across the country; and farebox revenues, the fares customers pay to utilize the agency’s services.
RTD, like most transit agencies across the country, was drastically impacted in the early days of the COVID-19
pandemic, as boardings plummeted and sales and use revenues declined as individuals, businesses, and
government entities went into lockdown. Federal rescue and relief funding provided a lifeline during difficult

BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER AND CEO

16.A.c

(cont’d from page 3)

As the agency and the region continue to recover and stabilize from the pandemic’s impacts, we are
collectively finding new norms. Ridership is significantly lower now than in previous years. In fact, industry
analysts estimate that public transit agencies across the country will experience a permanent 15-20% decline
in ridership. Remote work shifts in the composition of the workforce, and competition from third parties such
as Uber and Lyft are just a few of the factors driving this change.
Public transit is among many industry sectors facing significant challenges, not least of which are critical
worker shortages, what I call people power problems, due to the Great Resignation that has taken place over
the past two years. I firmly believe that from that Great Resignation will follow a Great Reset, wherein
governments, industries, and individuals across the nation and the globe will have the opportunity forge a
new, sustainable path forward in a post-pandemic landscape; those with the foresight and determination to
seize this opportunity will reap great rewards. It is in this vein that transit industries have the chance to rewrite
old narratives about the purpose of public transit; no longer will transit agencies be measured solely by the
number of customers they can transport but rather by the value they deliver to the communities they serve.
This exciting and important discussion of “value over volume” continues to unfold across the agency at
agencies large and small.
Although we must recognize and account for many challenges, they are not what defines this agency.
I recognize, appreciate, and honor the collaborative efforts exhibited by all of the agency’s employees
and agency leaders, as well as the Board of Directors and our union and contractor partners during
these challenging times. I thank each of you for being one of the people who move people in the
Denver metro region.
Moreover, I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation for the contributions in the timely preparation of the
FY 2023 Budget to Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer; Todd Nickel, Senior Manager, Budget; Heidi
Wagner, Senior Manager, Finance; the Budget Analysts, and the Leadership Team.
As we look toward the upcoming year and reflect on the various changes and challenges we have
collectively endured, I am proud to reaffirm our commitment to the agency’s mission: “We make lives
better through connections.”
Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

financial times, and the agency has put those funds to good use by focusing on bolstering people power;
aligning wages, salaries, and benefits with those of comparable positions in the market and sustaining transit
operations at a time when individuals in our communities relied upon RTD for access to critical services.

Introduction

This Budget demonstrates RTD’s financial capacity to address the agency’s strategic priorities based on
current information. The development of the Budget is a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence
the proposed budget for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation.
For FY2023, the operating expense budget is $816.4 million, of which $28.9 million is carryforward from
2022 into 2023. New capital is $75.9 million and capital carry forward of $568.0 million for a total capital
budget of $643.9 million. Debt service is $225.8M and reserves are $516.4 million for a total appropriation
of $2,202 million.

Perspective
The 2023 Proposed Budget focuses on the Strategic Priorities of the Board-adopted 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan. As a result, funding appropriations are aligned in a manner to direct efforts towards achieving the
desired success outcomes as measured by specific metrics.
As society emerges from the most significant impacts from COVID-19, additional clarity has and is being
realized regarding the future state of public transit services in general, as well as RTD’s specific
experiences. In light of this, a System Optimization Plan (SOP) approved by the Board is incorporated
within this budget. Additionally, RTD has positioned itself to meet the financial needs to remediate
backlogs in project completion and ensure that assets are maintained in a state of good repair.
While RTD’s current financial position is strong and funding capacity is available to fund initiatives and
programs within the Strategic Priorities, it is expected that the agency will continue to be challenged with
accessing adequate non-financial resources as a result of the difficult labor market environment, supply
chain issues and inflation.
Economic conditions indicate that there is a potential for recession which historically has impacted RTD’s
largest source of revenue, sales and use taxes. Despite these economic headwinds, these tax collections
are still expected to grow modestly in 2023 as a result of high employment and projected gross domestic
product (GDP) growth within the District. Furthermore, RTD’s reserves remain in a strong position to
moderate financial impacts resulting from unexpected volatility.
Although challenging circumstances exist in the economy, beneficial opportunities exist. The higher
interest rate environment negates the opportunities for additional interest savings from debt refinancings,
however, RTD will benefit from higher investment returns. In addition, impacts from the high inflation
rate environment will be tempered somewhat by RTD’s debt instruments all being issued at fixed rates in
addition to many annual contractual increases already being fixed.

Financial Discussion and Analysis

Revenues
Revenue sources are generally either recurring or finite. RTD’s Fiscal Policy establishes that one-time
revenues be used for one-time expenditures while recurring revenues provide a sustainable source to fund
ongoing needs. Because one-time revenues have a finite term, commitments for recurring expenditures
require an alternative source once the one-time revenues are exhausted.
RTD’s sources of recurring revenue, in descending order of size, are sales and use taxes, fares, federal
operating grants and miscellaneous revenue from advertising, investment income and rent. Historically,
RTD has also been the recipient of one-time revenues from federal capital grants, federal COVID-19 relief
funding, local contributions and land sales. RTD does not budget or forecast one-time revenues unless
certainty exists.
Revenue assumptions for the Budget include the following:
•

Fare revenue has been adjusted downward from 2022 expectations due to lower ridership. The
2022 Budget anticipated a gradual, modest return of ridership due to increased in-person
participation at universities and anticipated return-to-work requirements during the emergence
from the COVID Pandemic. While ridership has recovered from its nadir of 30% of pre-COVID
levels to approximately 60% currently, it has fallen short of the 2022 expectations of a gradual
return to 85% of pre-COVID levels. As a result, the 2023 Budget reflects a 1.4% increase in
ridership in 2023 that will drive fare revenue. In a September 2022 report, Standard and Poor’s
predicts that public transportation ridership will only return to 75% of pre-pandemic levels by 2025.

•

Sales and use tax projections were provided by the University of Colorado Leeds School of Business
(CU Leeds) in August 2022 and presented to the RTD Board in September 2022. Based on Moody’s
economic forecasts, the CU Leeds forecast model predicts that tax collections will increase 2.2% in
2023 vs. 2022 primarily driven by continued high employment, population growth and real GDP
growth in the Denver metro area. In addition, inflation is pushing prices upward resulting in
growing tax collections which is somewhat tempered by an expected modest decrease in spending.
The RTD forecast aligns with the statewide expectations from the Colorado Legislative Council
(CLC) and Office of State Budgeting and Planning (OSPB).

•

Operating grants of $141.7 million, primarily from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), are a
recurring revenue stream to RTD. These grant apportionments are based upon financial and
statistical data that RTD submits to the National Transit Database (NTD). The FTA has agreed to
apportion amounts based on prior year NTD submissions excluding COVID-19 impacts and the

The financial aspects of a budget consist of three primary categories: revenues, expenditures and reserves.
Revenues and expenditures provide the cash inflows and outflows while reserves provide the financial
balance to smooth cash flow volatility and supply the financial relief necessary for unforeseen
circumstances that inevitably arise.

•

COVID-19 relief grants are anticipated to be fully drawn by the end of 2022. This additional grant
funding combined with strong sales and use taxes has contributed to an unprecedented balance
of over $1 billion in cash and investments as well as substantial reserves which, along with higher
interest rates, will generate additional investment income in 2023. These significant cash and
investment balances are earmarked for state of good repair needs and maintaining fund balances
in accordance with the RTD Fiscal Policy.

•

Other revenue includes recurring revenue of $16 million which consists primarily of a federal Build
America Bonds (BAB) interest rate subsidy and advertising revenues.

•

Interest income of $10 million is planned for 2023 with higher interest yields on higher reserve
balances.

Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA)/Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) increases the
annual apportionment to RTD approximately 30% in 2023 which is the equivalent of $27 million.
These increased apportionments are scheduled to continue through 2026.

Expenditures
Expenditures consist of both recurring expenses, such as operating expenses, as well as occasional outlays
such as projects, debt service and capital expenditures.
RTD’s largest expenditure is core business service delivery. These costs include compensation, materials
and supplies, contracted services, insurance, utilities and other such expenses.
RTD also has a significant debt burden primarily from capital expansion projects as well as obligations
issued to finance the purchase of rolling stock. RTD has completed two refinancings in the past year to
realize interest savings and reduce the debt burden. As interest rates have risen recently, RTD does not
anticipate performing additional refinancings during 2023.
Furthermore, RTD has ongoing asset management needs that average approximately $120 million
annually. Asset management needs can fluctuate significantly by year when, for example, a single year
includes a large purchase such as fleet replacements. The 2023 Proposed Budget contemplates these
periodic needs through building Capital Replacement Fund reserves until needed. RTD has the ability to
fund these purchases with cash, rather than more expensive lease-purchases that have been utilized in
the past, and has budgeted and forecasted accordingly.

•

Salaries and wages assume full staffing to provide service levels in accordance with the System
Optimization Plan (SOP). While it is anticipated that the job market will remain competitive and will
prolong RTD’s ability to attract and maintain full staffing levels, funding has been made available
in these appropriations. In addition, the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) includes wage
increases with provisions for incentive pay for represented employees until such time that adequate
staffing levels are achieved. The compensation increases in 2023 shown below are primarily driven
by annual increases and additional RTD police officers, which is partially offset by the decrease in
contracted security services included in Outside Services

•

Benefits include the following:
o A $1 million increase for represented employee health and welfare benefit increases
o A $3 million increase for non-represented health benefits due to an 8% premium increase
as well as realignment of the plan to provide a more attractive second option based on
benefits survey feedback from employees. The second option had shifted significant
premium costs from RTD to employees during the prior three years resulting in employee
dissatisfaction. While this increase is relatively immaterial, it follows no net increase in nonrepresented health and welfare costs in 2022 while also contributing to an increase in
employee satisfaction
o Dental and vision plans for employees remain largely unchanged for 2023, however, the
non-represented vision plan will shift to a new provider with no material change in cost
while also providing more options and flexibility for employees. This change resulted from
feedback received from employees through a benefits survey
o Represented employee retirement plans include RTD contributions to the defined benefit
pension of 15% with employee contributions remaining at 5% per the CBA. This plan will
be closed to new entrants in 2023. In addition, provisions have been included to fund the
new defined contribution plan at 9% with up to a 5% match for new employees beginning
January 1, 2023. The defined benefit pension plan is 82% funded, up from 53% funded in
2022, due to the 2022 one-time cash infusion of $160 million, and 2023 contributions are
not anticipated to change materially from 2022 while also maintaining adequate funding
levels
o The non-represented employee defined benefit pension plan is funded with a $15 million
contribution based on the unanimous recommendation from the Plan Trustees. The
actuarial recommended contribution for 2023 is $8.5 million, however, the Trustees
recognized the need to fund ongoing annual benefits of $10 million plus $5 million
representing the average annual lump sum withdrawals in order to avoid selling securities
in the existing down markets. This plan is 82% funded, up from 78% funded in 2022, and
currently has 143 active participants. This plan has been closed to new employees since
January 1, 2008 and funding requirements will tail off over the next several years
o The non-represented employee defined contribution plan assumes RTD funding of 9% of
wages which is the same amount contributed in 2022. Board policy is to contribute 7-9%
of wages each year. Only non-represented employees hired January 1, 2008 and thereafter
participate in this retirement plan
o RTD will continue to offer the 457(b) retirement plan to all employees except represented
employees hired in 2023 since they may contribute to the new defined contribution plan.

Expenditure assumptions for the Budget include:

16.A.c

Subject: 2023 Proposed Budget
Page
11

•

Materials and supplies consist of consumable items such as fuel, fluids and parts. Diesel fuel
purchases have been contracted at $2.94 per gallon for 7 million gallons, up from $2.30 per gallon
in 2022. Contracting fuel purchases provides budget certainty, particularly in the volatile fuel pricing
environment. Diesel and gasoline expenses typically account for 2% of operating expenses and the
increases will add approximately $4.5 million to these costs in 2023. This increase in cost is offset
by lower fuel usage cost savings in 2022 that will fall to the fund balance as well as a decrease in
budgeted parts costs resulting from lower trends, supply chain constraints and increased focus on
utilization of parts inventory

•

Services consist of contracted specialties within IT, legal and the security realm. Additionally, these
expenses contain inflationary increases which are offset by reductions resulting in a $6.1 million
decrease in 2023. The majority of the decrease is due to lower anticipated project activity as well
as a reduction in contracted security needs which will be replaced with RTD police officers. Project
activity is expected to be lower in alignment with current experience as well as people power and
supply chain challenges

•

Insurance costs have decreased over past years due to effective claims management. The 2023
budgeted costs include additional funding for commuter rail liability insurance coverage. While this
appears to be a net increase from 2021, insurance costs are relatively flat over an extended period
since 2022 commuter rail insurance was funded with a 15-month appropriation from 2021

•

Other expenses primarily contain expenditures for utilities and purchased transportation and, to a
lesser degree, various minor business expenses
o Utilities include projected amounts for traction power commensurate with planned rail
service levels and in alignment with 2022 usage
o Purchased transportation includes contractual increases and are aligned with expected
revenue service hours and contract amendments resulting from higher wages
o Outside Services includes $2m for design and project support for a battery electric bus
facility
o Travel and training and budgets have been maintained from 2022 to 2023 to contribute to
employee development and industry participation after elimination in 2020 and 2021.
Expenses for each Board Director have been budgeted at $10,000 per individual for travel
and $1,680 for telephone
o Funding for an on-call (“bench”) contract is included to address specialty consulting
engagements, if necessary
o A budget of $250,000 is available for employee engagement to be used for outreach and
recognition programs. All other discretionary spending will continue to be limited

•

Debt service represents a significant portion of RTD’s annual expenditures. Debt service consists
of principal and interest payments on bonds, certificates of participation (COPs) and lease-purchase
agreements. Debt service payments for 2023 will total $225.8 million, down from $235.2 million in
2022 as a result of refinancings for interest savings. The Base System bond payments will expire
in 2024, at which point, the Base System will be subject to the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
38th•Blake Development Negotiation

Committee Meeting Date:
November 1, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and/or her delegate to negotiate and
execute an Exclusive Negotiation Agreement (ENA) with Portman Holdings for the future lease and
development of the real property located at 3800 Wynkoop Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Transit-Oriented Development Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired the Property located at the corner of 38th Street and Wynkoop Street to serve as a Parkn-Ride (PnR) for the 38th•Blake Station on the A Line. The 4.5-acre Property is currently a 188-space
PnR, a large drainage facility, and a vacant, grass area. The Property is part of RTD’s parking
management system and is maintained by Denver Transit Operators (DTO) through the Concession
Agreement.
In 2010, the Board adopted the Strategic Plan for TOD to create a more focused policy that guides
RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income communities near transit. In 2015, the Board
approved the Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property, which guides the Unsolicited Proposal
Procedure (UPP) that developers must follow to pursue development on RTD property. Portman Holdings
submitted Step 1 of the UPP in April 2019, kicking off a conversation between the developer and
planning staff. Portman then submitted the second step of the UPP, the Technical Review, in July 2019.
A committee of Operations, Capital Programs, Safety, Security, and Planning staff found no fatal flaws
in the project and allowed the project to proceed. Portman soon submitted for Concept Review with the
City and County of Denver, receiving approvals in May 2021.
In August 2021, Portman submitted RTD’s formal Unsolicited Proposal for Joint Development. The multidepartmental committee reconvened and determined that Portman’s proposal had legal, financial, and
technical merit. Step 4 of the UPP requires RTD to release a Request for Alternative Proposals, which
staff did in the form of a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). RTD led the RFQ process with input from the
City and County of Denver. After a 90-day bid period, several weeks of deliberations and interviews, the
selection committee chose Portman Holdings based on their extensive development experience, access
to financial resources, and intent to provide greater affordability than required by local ordinance. To
continue to the next step in the UPP, RTD must execute an ENA with Portman Holdings.

Packet Pg. 69

17.B

DISCUSSION
This action authorizes the General Manager and/or her delegate to enter into an ENA with Portman
Holdings. In adopting this recommended action, the agency furthers the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by creating much-needed
housing near transit, improving transit access, and generative revenues for RTD. The ENA will address,
among other items:
• Negotiation and design schedule
• Project financing
• Development plan (density, use, affordability)
• RTD Requirements
o Maintenance and operations
o Parking replacement
The ENA will permit a 24-month negotiation period, commencing on the effective date of the ENA.
However, RTD may extend the term of the ENA at its sole discretion.
Board authorization through a future action will be required to lease the Property to Portman Holdings
and begin construction. If RTD and Portman Holdings fail to execute the ENA, fail to successfully
negotiate a ground lease and any other necessary agreements, or if the Board does not authorize
disposition of the Property through a future action, RTD will remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the development process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of the ENA will have no financial impact to RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Access-on-Demand

Committee Meeting Date:
November 1, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute
contracts with Lyft, Metro Transportation, Uber Transit and zTrip for the provision of Access-on-Demand
services. These contracts are for a duration of three years, at a not-to-exceed cost of $9,344,175.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD has provided on-demand opt-in service through taxi companies since 2005; this service was
branded as Access-a-Cab. While this service presents an affordable alternative for paratransit customers,
the taxi industry has been unable to consistently provide a supply of resources to meet demand,
particularly for customers using wheelchairs or other similar mobility devices.
In October 2020, the paratransit department piloted an expansion of Access-a-Cab using transportation
network companies (TNC). This service allowed for an expanded service supply and a more responsive
service platform for paratransit customers opting in to RTD’s on-demand services.
In January 2022, the Uber pilot service area was expanded to the entire District to parallel the Access-aCab service area. These services provide a more convenient same-day alternative, which is more
affordable to customers and more cost-efficient for RTD and is responsive to all customers regardless of
their mobility aids.
DISCUSSION
On June 28, 2022, RTD issued a request for qualifications (RFQ) soliciting proposals for the provision of
Access-on-Demand services by taxi companies and TNCs. On October 17, 2022, four proposals meeting
the terms of the RFQ scope were received from Lyft, Metro Transportation, Uber Transit and zTrip. A
staff evaluation panel reviewed submittals to determine whether prospective service providers met predetermined objective qualifications outlined in the RFQ, including confirmation of good standing with the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission and compliance with insurance requirements. Based upon the
overall proposal evaluations, the panel recommends that contracts be awarded to Lyft, Metro
Transportation, Uber Transit and zTrip, in an amount not to exceed $9,344,175 over three years, for the
provision of Access-on-Demand service,

Packet Pg. 83

17.D

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the provision of Access-on-Demand services effective January 1, 2023, is included in the
2023 Proposed Budget. Funding for future contract years is included in the 2023-2028 Mid-Term
Financial Plan and will be considered annually within each subsequent fiscal year’s respective budget.

Access-a-Ride/FlexRide Contract Extensions

Committee Meeting Date:
November 2, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a sixmonth contract extension with MV Transportation, Via Mobility Services, Transdev and Transdev on
Demand from January 1 through June 30, 2023, for the provision of Access-a-Ride and FlexRide
services. The not-to-exceed amount for the contracted services is $23,554,323. Additionally, the notto-exceed amount for fuel is $2,086,688. The total six-month not-to-exceed amount for the contracted
services with fuel is $25,641,011.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operating Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires public entities operating a fixed route system to also
provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities which is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD’s paratransit services are currently provided by four
service providers: MV Transportation, Via Mobility Services, Transdev and Transdev On-Demand.
RTD also operates FlexRide service in 23 service areas within the District, providing first-and-last mile
connections along with access to essential locations such as grocery stores, hospitals, medical facilities,
employment sites and schools. These services are currently provided by two service providers: MV
Transportation and Via Mobility Services.
Currently, approximately 65% of RTD’s paratransit customer base regularly uses the agency’s services,
and FlexRide ridership has been steadily increasing.
Considering that current contract extensions are set to expire December 31, 2022, RTD solicited
proposals for Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services, which were received on August 10, 2022. In
conference with Civil Rights, Procurement and Legal staff, it was determined that one of the proposers
was deemed non-responsive for their DBE plan and has subsequently filed an appeal with RTD. Given the
timeline of the appeal process, staff anticipates a need to extend agreements with current service
providers.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 85

17.E

In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of
Community Value and Financial Success. In October 2022, RTD requested cost proposals from current
service providers to continue service through June 30, 2023.
Cost Analysis
An internal financial analysis indicated that the six-month estimated cost for RTD to provide similar
services internally would be $27,358,616, which is $1,717,605 higher than the six-month cost
proposed by the agency’s current service providers.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the provision of Access-a-Ride and FlexRide services effective, January 1 through June 30,
2023, is included in the 2023 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Contract Award for Welton Safety Improvements

Committee Meeting Date:
November 2, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, the authority to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to award contract No. 322FH0027 to Krische
Construction, Inc. (KCI), for an amount of $4,395,002 for Welton Street Safety Improvements.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Welton Corridor portion of the Central Corridor (the L Line) in Denver opened for revenue service in
1994. The segment from 21st Street to 30th Street and Downing Street has experienced the highest
number of accidents of any corridor in the light rail system, with 63 accidents occurring between 2012
to 2021.
Blank-out signs are traffic signals designed to alert motorists or pedestrians to changing traffic patterns
in areas such as those located along light rail corridors running parallel to surface streets. To enhance
existing safety measures along the Welton Corridor, staff is engaging in a project to replace existing
blank-out signs and add new blank-out signs. The project also updates existing static signage, warning
devices, and associated train signaling system equipment that has not been updated since the opening
of the L Line in 1994. The equipment being replaced is past its useful life and is no longer serviceable,
with spare parts being difficult to obtain or no longer available. Due to compatibility issues, the existing,
outdated light rail relay-based signal system will be converted to a new microprocessor-based system
consistent with the new signal systems equipment being used throughout the light rail system.
Staff previously solicited requests for proposals for this project in Q3 2020. An engineer’s estimate for
the construction of this project was approximately $2.7 million. KCI was the only contractor to respond
to the request for proposals, with a proposed project cost of approximately $4.8 million. Negotiations
with the contractor were unsuccessful in closing the gap between the engineer’s estimate and the bid.
In discussions with the contractor, the major causes for the differences between the engineer’s estimate
and the bid was the risk associated with utilizing conduit systems that had been installed as part of the
original construction almost 30 years ago and the schedule impacts of working with the trains still
running.
To reduce project risk, an electrical contractor was retained by RTD to investigate the existing conduit
system. The existing conduits were determined to be available for this construction, and a shut-down of
the rail service was arranged.
The project was advertised for a second time as an invitation for bids on August 5, 2022. A single bid
was received from KCI and is valid for 60 days.

DISCUSSION
Adopting this recommended action aligns the agency with the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of
Community Value and Customer Excellence. The blank-out signs and static signage will better warn
motorists of train movements, reducing the potential of accidents and maintaining service schedules.
KCI has worked on several rail replacements and other projects for RTD previously. This project has
equipment and material needs with long lead times. The project has stakeholder support and
coordination in place. Denver has agreed to waive permit fees for the project. A shut down of the
service is planned for eight weeks in Q2 2023 to complete the work. As alternate bus service is
available on this route, no bus bridges are planned.
This project also requires specialty consultant support through construction and integration testing,
which will be procured separately.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total cost of the project, including contract award, specialty consultant services, and project
contingencies is $5,274,397, for which funding is allocated in the 2022 Budget.
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission was instrumental in securing Federal Highway Administration
Section 130 Rail Highway Crossings grant funds in the amount of $1.5 million for safety enhancements,
which funding will be utilized for this project.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Bylaws Amendment — Director Informal Meeting Process

Committee Meeting Date:
September 22, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by RTD Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan that the Board of Directors amend
Article IV of the Bylaws of the Regional Transportation District to establish a procedure for informal
meetings to engage in discussions of public business with three or more Board members in addition to
regular Board, special Board, Standing committee, and Ad Hoc Committee meetings.
REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Dishell, Guissinger, and Sloan
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The proposal is intended to complement the regular structure of Board meetings by affording Directors
an option to schedule flexible and adaptable meetings when three or more members consider them to be
necessary or desirable. The purposes of such meetings include preparing a matter to bring to the Board,
discussing working relationships with stakeholders and constituents, or considering other matters related
to agency business. The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials,
the time, and location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair
at least forty-eight hours prior to the meeting. Notice of the meetings will be posted on the Board’s
online two-week calendar. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Like all Board meetings, the informal meetings will comply with applicable laws, particularly the Colorado
Open Meetings Law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Board Office staff may not be present and
informal meetings will not be broadcasted via Zoom or video recorded, nor will a written transcript be
prepared.
DISCUSSION
The proposal can encourage useful discussion of nascent issues as well as improve the presently
cumbersome and inefficient process for more-than-three-Director initiatives. If the Bylaw amendments
are adopted, Directors will be authorized to develop agendas and choose locations suitable to the
discussion topic. Blake Street will remain as a location available to Directors who wish to utilize RTD's IT
expertise, security advantages, and meeting spaces. Others may select an alternative venue
commensurate with their anticipation of meeting requirements.

Packet Pg. 89

18.G

The proposed Bylaw amendments add a new Article IV, Section 4, stating:
INFORMAL DIRECTOR MEETINGS
Informal Meetings may be called to engage in discussions of public business by three or more Directors.
The purposes of such meetings may include discussion of a matter to bring to the Board, relationships
with stakeholders and constituents, or other matters related to agency business. No formal action may
be taken. The Directors calling the meeting may set the location and agenda as appropriate to the topic
of the meeting. Written minutes shall be recorded.
Additionally, a new subsection is to be added to Section 8(c): Notice of Meetings.
NOTICE OF MEETINGS
c) The scheduling Directors must provide the meeting agenda, including any materials, the time, and
location of the meeting to the Executive Manager of the Board Office and the Board Chair at least fortyeight hours prior to the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is expected.

PREAMBLE

The Regional Transportation District (“RTD” or the “District”) was created
by the Regional Transportation District Act, § 32-9-101 et seq., C.R.S. (the “RTD
Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First
Regular Session, 1969). The District is a

political subdivision of the State of

Colorado, with those powers specifically granted and those reasonably implied from
the RTD Act and necessary or proper to carry out the objects and purposes of the
District.

The authority of the Board of Directors to adopt these Bylaws is expressly
conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

Act”) (Senate Bill 309, Sessions Law of Colorado, 47th General Assembly, First

political subdivision of the State of

District.

conferred by the RTD Act, at § 32-9-114 (1) (b), C.R.S. Some rules governing the
internal affairs of the Board of Directors are contained in the RTD Act, while others
are contained in other laws and others, by delegation, are to be established by the
Board. For convenience of reference, those that are contained in the RTD Act or
other laws, together with those that are adopted under delegated authority, are
combined in these Bylaws. Nothing contained in these Bylaws, nor any omission from
them, shall be construed as an alteration or deviation from any grant of power, duty,
or responsibility to, or any limitation or restriction imposed upon the Board under the
RTD Act or other applicable laws as they now exist or may be amended.

Director Comments to Proposed Amended Bylaws – Director Informal Meeting Process
Director Dishell
•

Last sentence of page 1 of the redline should be revised, “Board Office staff may not be present and as a
result, informal meetings may not be broadcasted via Zoom or video recorded, and a written transcript may
not be prepared.”

•

I don’t want to unintentionally restrict Directors from broadcasting via platforms of their choosing or
recording on Zoom. However, I also do not want to put that burden on staff. It seems to me that it would
make sense if the videos are recorded and provided to staff, which anyone with a Zoom license can do,
they should be uploaded. However, staff should not be required to attend, broadcast, or transcribe the
meetings.

•

Page 10 of bylaws – change must to shall for consistency with rest of bylaws choice of using shall instead
of must.

•

Across the board, instead of 48 hours, two business days for notice.

Director Rivera-Malpiede
•

After reviewing the proposed informal director meetings resolution, I am opposed for the following reasons
1. Logistics: If it is only 24-48 hour notice, will that be enough time for our staff to post the meeting?
2. Since there will be no staff support, will there be a check list to ensure that the location meets the
requirements of an elected official public meeting including is the location ADA compliant, does it have
the capability to have translation and TTY services and can folks listen in other than being there such as
zoom?
3. Will there be a designated board member who will oversee the logistics? Will they do all the leg work
in terms of finding the location, sending out the invitations and the agenda?
4. I am concerned about the sunshine law.
5. I am concerned that some may see this action as a private gathering and not transparent. This will be
a red flag for the media.
6. I fear for the safety as an elected official particularly if meetings are not held at a public facility.
7. What will be the timeline of when the minutes will be presented to the board office? The minutes must
be transparent, accurate and not up for interpretation. Validity of minutes is essential. Random minutes
puts me in a place of concern.
8. I am concerned about what additional staff time might be following up as the custodian of record.
9. What criteria will be used to determine whether or not it is an appropriate subject matter to have in a
meeting such as this?

very concerned with the media, public relations fall‐out if these gatherings are reported as private meetings
(even though they are not). We work so hard to acquire positive public relations and positive reporting on
our accomplishments, so I fear this action could easily be misconstrued as private meetings or abuse of
Colorado’s sunshine law.

•

Logistically I am concerned with numerous items such as ADA compliance, security, minute‐taking that
meets appropriate levels and board privacy of personal addresses.

•

While I’m not a “hard no” at this point, I am leaning that way.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future

Committee Meeting Date:
November 1, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to endorse the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future (MPFF). Consistent
with the System Optimization Plan (SOP), the MPFF will be reviewed and updated with Board approval
periodically on a no-less-than triennial basis to provide for a consistent and effective coordinated policy
and vision for service.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Brian T. Welch, AICP, Acting Assistant General Manager, Planning
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2018, RTD recognized that the landscape of surface transportation was in a state of flux and put in
motion several complementary efforts and initiatives. These efforts were collectively referred to as
“Transportation Transformation,” and included the following vision:
•
•
•

Transit systems need to make themselves more competitive now
It is time for a public transportation renaissance
The future of mobility depends on public transportation: practical, sustainable solutions that meet
the needs of everyone in the Denver metro area

The signature Transportation Transformation initiative became the Reimagine RTD project, and work
began in late 2019 to develop the MPFF and SOP. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on
the completion of Reimagine RTD. While the original schedule called for completion by August 2021, the
project was paused mid-2020 in response to the global pandemic, and work resumed in January 2021.
In April 2021, the Board of Directors adopted the Reimagine RTD Guiding Principles. These principles are
guideposts, along with the Board-adopted Strategic Plan, for the MPFF.
A Technical Working Group (TWG) and Advisory Committee (AC) were formed at the start of the study
effort to provide input and guidance to staff and the consultant team throughout the study process.
Their contributions are reflected throughout the MPFF. The Board was also engaged throughout the
project effort and significant public input was gathered through in-person and virtual events.

18.H

Despite the global pandemic, the MPFF has adhered to the vision identified in 2018: RTD must be a
relevant part of the region’s mobility solutions, and the agency must address industry advancements and
societal shifts that are substantially altering how and when people travel, how cities function, and how
mobility options are factored into broader visions and goals.
DISCUSSION
The completed work products identify comprehensive, forward-thinking strategies to better connect
people to the places they want and need to go. The MPFF has been successful in addressing RTD’s
primary goals for the project and is fully aligned with the agency’s Strategic Priorities of Community
Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success:
•
•
•
•

Understand and document RTD’s long-range financial capacity
Identify RTD’s role in responding to 2050 travel demands
Clarify investment priorities
Engage and build consensus with stakeholders and partners

The MPFF work products include the following and should be considered together as the MPFF:
•

•
•

A printed Executive Summary, in 8.5x11 bound format, that will be distributed to the Board and
other interested parties (this is also available in digital format: http://slides.com/fhueng/reimaginertd/fullscreen#/lead-mobility-plan)
Attachment A to this report, which reflects the content of the Executive Summary, in a format
more compatible with Board packet distribution
An extensive online resource library, providing links to numerous MPFF deliverables

The online resource library includes in-depth documentation of MPFF work products, including those
cited herein, which can be found at the following address: http://slides.com/fhueng/reimaginertd/fullscreen#/home

Fiscal and Financial Scenarios
Scenario Planning
Zero Emission Conversion
Maintenance Facilities
Mobility as a Service and Mobility on Demand
Partnerships
Workforce
District Boundaries

The overarching aspiration for Reimagine RTD is: “Moving everyone forward with solutions.” Key
highlights of the MPFF are presented by four opportunities, which are also aligned with the Strategic
Plan, describing RTD as follows:

Packet Pg. 177

18.H

•
•
•
•

Access: A mobility integrator that provides a regional transit backbone and partners with
stakeholders
Equity: A mobility provider prioritizing service to those most in need
Sustainability: A mobility leader that defines and evolves transit’s role through innovation and
collaboration
Financial: A mobility agency that is well-funded, financially stable and serves as a good steward
of taxpayer dollars while supporting regional access, equity, and sustainability

The presentation also includes an implementation plan, which is linked to Strategic Plan tactics and is
organized on a temporal and financial basis. Key implementation steps include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Implement a partnership program
Collaborate with Colorado Department of Transportation/local partners to implement regional bus
rapid transit service
Develop a zero-emission fleet transition plan
Integrate services and modes through development of a trip planning and payment platform
Continue to foster a dynamic, diverse workforce that attracts and retains valued people
Continue to seek opportunities to enhance transit safety
Initiate a formal effort to collaborate with state and local partners to increase transit funding in
the region

The MPFF articulates tactical, strategic, and policy initiatives that require subsequent action by the
Board and staff. Currently, the MPFF serves as the roadmap for those purposes but is not the vehicle for
immediate decision and action. It is therefore appropriate for Board action to endorse the MPFF and to
subsequently adopt specific actions.
The SOP Recommended Action included the following language related to future SOP updates: “with
such process to be informed and guided by any Board-adopted Mobility Plan for the Future (MPFF),
which SOP and MPFF will together be reviewed and updated with Board approval periodically on a noless-than triennial basis to provide for a consistent and effective coordinated policy and vision for
service.”
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s endorsement of the MPFF.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Federal Lobbying Contract Extension

Committee Meeting Date:
November 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute an
amendment to exercise the option to extend the current federal lobbying services contract with Squire
Patton Boggs, LLP for two additional years through and including December 31, 2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD retains services of lobbying firms to assist staff with advocacy and legislative services related to
RTD’s annual legislative program
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current federal lobbying services contract with Squire Patton Boggs, LLP, was executed on
December 19, 2019, for an initial term of three years. RTD has an option to amend the current contract
and execute two additional years of federal lobbying services. Squire Patton Boggs, LLP, has met all
contractual requirements, and their performance has met expectations, hence the agency would benefit
from executing the recommended action. No changes to the contract’s statement of work are associated
with this recommended action.
In support of RTD’s Strategic Plan priority of Financial Success, exercising the option would result in a
cost savings to the agency of $108,000 annually, netting a total savings of $216,000 for the contract
duration. If approved, RTD will execute an amendment with Squire Patton Boggs LLP, that will retain
federal lobbying services through December 19, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2023 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
November 10, 2022

2023 Legislative Program

Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2023 Legislative Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative Program. In October 2021, the Board of Directors approved the agency’s first Legislative
Program, which is considered by the Board annually and serves as a guiding document for Government
Relations staff and external advocates to pursue goals related to legislation and policy matters.
Additionally, the Legislative Program serves as an organizing document that can be adjusted throughout
a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated to, and
pursued by, agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and
federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be proactive in education and inform
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits within the framework of RTD’s financial
forecast. The 2023 Legislative Program, included as Attachment A, outlines priority actions on a variety
of issues that staff believe are achievable through advocacy and collaboration.
If approved, the 2023 Legislative Program would be implemented beginning January 1, 2023.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Approval of this recommended action has no immediate financial impact on the agency.

Attachment A

2023 Legislative Program

To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the 2023
legislative session that support the priorities and success outcomes of the agency’s adopted 20212026 Strategic Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner
with the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly
delegation, and local elected officials to advocate for policies approved by the Board.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations – such as the America Public
Transportation Association (APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional
transportation management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), Chambers of Commerce,
and other stakeholder organizations – to partner and collaborate on shared goals to advance and
seek support for legislative positions approved by the Board. Lastly, tactics included in the
Legislative Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Boardapproved 2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2023
Legislative Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative matters are likely
to arise that warrant consideration by the Board of Directors.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result of
legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be presented
to the Board as part of a Board Committee agenda. If time does not allow for an item to be
agendized for a Committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain neutral on the
legislation in question.

Attachment A

A. Implementation of
Surface Transportation
Authorization

Engage in national deliberations with partners such as the
APTA to advocate for increased federal investment in public
transportation. Ensure that programs created and
implemented by the U.S. Department of Transportation (US
DOT) are eligible for RTD to participate, and that rules and
regulations associated with US DOT’s programs do not
negatively impact the agency.

B. Discretionary Grants

Advocate for federal discretionary grants to support transit
projects and planning throughout the district. Grant programs
include, but are not limited to, Capital Investment Grant
Program, Federal/State Partnership for State of Good Repair,
Bus and Bus Facilities, and Rebuilding American Infrastructure
with Sustainability and Equity or RAISE Grant program.

State
A. Partnering with the
State of Colorado on
oversight

Work and communicate actively with members and staff of the
Colorado General Assembly on issues of state oversight
including Office of the State Auditor recommendations and
Accountability Committee recommendations. Ensure members
and staff are informed of RTD’s actions related to oversight and
implementation of recommendations.

C. Advocate for
environmental
stewardship through
Statewide Rules and
Regulations

Closely monitor, partner and participate in policy rules and
regulations proposed and implemented by the state of Colorado.
Advocate for the positive impact transit can have on air quality
improvement and ensure sources of eligible funding are
available to implement transit mitigation measures that can
assist in Greenhouse Gas reduction through the region.
Providing a safe working environment for RTD’s front-line
employees is paramount to retaining and attracting a workforce
needed to deliver transit services outlined in RTD’s System
Optimization Plan. Following examples in other states, RTD staff
will work to identify a bill sponsor to introduce and pass state
legislation that would reclassify RTD transit workers to enhance
penalties for committing assault on an RTD employee while
performing job duties.

DIRECTOR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Independent Audit Committee Appointments

Committee Meeting Date:
November 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
November 15, 2022

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. V,
Section 3(b). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by RTD Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell that the Board of Directors appoint as
members of the Independent Audit Committee Jim Brendel (External Member) to a three-year term
expiring December 31, 2025, John Olenberger (External Member) to a two-year term expiring December
31, 2024, Erik Davidson (Board Member) to a two-year term expiring December 31, 2024, and Peggy
Catlin and Bobby Dishell (Board Members) each to a one-year term expiring December 31, 2023.
REPRESENTATIVE
Directors Catlin, Davidson, and Dishell
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) completed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function, both of which included recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown)for professional
assistance in implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by the Institute
of Internal Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the staffing of RTD’s internal audit
function.
In January 2022, RubinBrown recommended that RTD outsource its internal audit function in order to
leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also benefitting from the efficiencies
to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to full-time employees.
In February 2022, RTD issued a request for proposals to outsource the internal audit function.
In June 2022, the RTD Board of Directors authorized RTD to enter a contract with RubinBrown to
provide internal audit services for three base years and two option years.
In July 2022, the RTD Board Chair appointed Directors Catlin, Davidson and Dishell to an Audit Ad Hoc
Committee to coordinate with RubinBrown on recommendations to the Board to implement the
outsourced internal audit function and form an RTD Audit Committee.

Packet Pg. 217

18.K

In August 2022, the Audit Ad Hoc Committee, in coordination with RubinBrown, began the recruitment
for Audit Committee members. Recruitment for community members interested in volunteering to serve
on the committee was publicly advertised through the RTD website and LinkedIn. Applicants were asked
to respond to the request for qualifications with a letter of interest and resume.
Audit Committee members are expected to:
•
•
•

Possess the financial acumen to read and understand RTD’s financial statements and to
otherwise help the Board fulfill its fiduciary responsibilities
Attend four to five Audit Committee meetings per year
Review committee materials in advance of meetings and come prepared to ask questions and
participate in discussions

A total of six applications were received from external applicants and three applications were received
from current Board members.
Consistent with the Audit Committee Charter, adopted by the Board on October 25, 2022, the term of
office for an Audit Committee member is two years for a Board Member, except for two initial one-year
terms upon initial formation of the Audit Committee. Board Members will have a two-year term,
staggered with at least two Board members’ terms overlapping an election year. External members of
the Audit Committee will have two or three-year terms, staggered to overlap election years. Continuance
of Audit Committee members will be reviewed annually. To ensure continuity within the Audit
Committee, the appointment of future members should be staggered to avoid full turnover in the Audit
Committee.

September 15, 2022

I recently received the Request for Qualifications for Independent Audit Committee Members for the
Regional Transportation District (RTD) from the Colorado Society of CPAs. I am respectfully
requesting to be considered for this position.
I am a Certified Public Accountant in the State of Colorado and recently retired from public
accounting after a 42 year career, all in Denver. In my career, I worked as a staff accountant through
partner in auditing financial statements of public, private, governmental and non-profit entities. I
have worked directly with audit committees of public and private companies as the audit partner,
and also as a consultant conducting special investigations. I have served on the audit committee for
two non-profit entities, and on the board of directors for two accounting firms and many other nonprofit entities.
I served as Director of Audit and Accounting for Hein & Associates, a regional CPA firm based in
Denver, with responsibilities including developing and monitoring our policies regarding auditor
independence and consulting on complex accounting and financial reporting issues. I have also
instructed classed on independence within the firm and at several colleges.
As an audit partner, I have significant experience in evaluating internal controls, including IT and
Cyber Security controls. I also have significant experience in interpreting and applying the provisions
of contracts and regulatory requirements to the operations and reporting requirements of my
clients, and was required to maintain a high degree of professional skepticism at all times.
In my leadership roles at Hein Associates, Moss Adams, and various professional associations, I have
demonstrated excellent communication and interpersonal skills and am experienced in dealing with
conflict and having uncomfortable conversations. I frequently led meetings and am experienced in
working collaboratively with other team members.
With my recent retirement, I have the time and energy to devote to new roles and would like to lend
my financial, auditing, and leadership experience to other entities where I could contribute and
make a difference. Since my background and experience is in financial statement auditing, and I
have worked with as well as served on audit committees, I am very interested in serving as an audit
committee member and I believe that is where I could add the most value.
I’ve attached a copy of my current resume and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my
experience with you.
Sincerely,

To Whom It May Concern:
I wish to express interest in being considered as a member of the RTD’s new audit committee.
A former member of KPMG’s management team with nearly 25 years of Internal Audit
experience, I started my own internal audit practice (CICN) 14 years ago with the thought of
creating a new and innovative type of firm.
I think it is important that candidates for RTD’s audit committee not only have the technical
ability to perform the work, but also personally embrace public transportation and use public
transportation in their travels and daily commutes. Growing up in Massachusetts and starting my
career in Boston at Arthur Andersen, public transportation (Massachusetts Bay Transportation
Authority- “the T”) was far more than a “nice to have”. At over $30/day for parking, if you were
traveling into or within the City you were taking the T.
A big factor for me in selecting the lot for our house was its proximity to what would become the
Central Park RTD A-line station. It was important to me to be within walking distance of an
RTD rail station as transportation to the airport and downtown clients. I usually refer to the
distance of our house from downtown as “3 stops away”, rather than 6.5 miles, and proudly
leave my car in the garage when traveling to the airport, opting to take the A-line a few stops
dropping me an escalator ride away from security check-in. Having used public transit in close
to 15 cities worldwide, it is my default, and often times exclusive form of transportation.
I enjoy seeing how things work… and how things could work better. When many people hear
the word “audit” they tend to think financial audits. While many Internal Auditors have a
financial background, myself included, Internal Audit is far more than assessing financial
controls.

Internal Audit is about gaining an in-depth understanding of how all aspects of a business
operate and working with the business to ensure the smoothness of these operations while
maintaining compliance with applicable regulations. As an audit committee member, I would
want to ensure the internal audit function does not lose sight of this operational improvement
aspect.
As a Colorado licensed CPA and former external auditor, I feel I have the financial acumen
needed to oversee both the external and internal audit functions. I also have first-hand experience
with the RTD, having participated on the outsourced audit team for a Office of the State Auditor
safety audit. Our firm is also assisting DRCOG with their operational and financial compliance
monitoring efforts for use of 5310 Federal funds passed through the Federal Transit Authority.
Some of the subrecipients of this funding are also contract providers for the RTD.
I am active in the internal audit community, serving as the Chief Audit Executive for some of our
clients and chairing the Chief Audit Executive Roundtable for the Denver chapter of the Institute
of Internal Auditors, where I previously served as the chapter president and board chair.
While this is a volunteer position, I would request an RTD ID or other pass be provided to
members of the audit committee to allow free access to encourage their use of and experiences
with the RTD system. I believe the more personal experience one has with the RTD system, the
better suited they will be to excel in this position. I would further request the audit committee be
comprised of at least three individuals, so as to promote diversity in opinions, which I believe
will best serve the RTD.
Attached is my resume. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly with any questions at
303-333-8989 or jolenberger@cicn.biz.

Sincerely yours,
