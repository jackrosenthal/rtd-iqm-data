Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Change

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past
ridership performance, Routes 89 and 116 Limited are proposed to be discontinued. Additionally, service
reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of service to current
ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes
and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: discontinue service due to very low ridership
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited: discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: discontinue the Call-n-Ride, due to low ridership
RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services
W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Route 44- 44th Avenue- reroute of service currently on Steele to use Clayton Street in order to avoid
sight distance/safety concerns at the University of Colorado A-Line crossing.
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown: reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property
Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all
service days.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from
FasTracks and $614,400 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately
$1,576,000 annualized.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are eight public hearings proposed to be held between September 26th and October 5th in Aurora,
Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and Stapleton

1.C.1.a

Bus
Route 15 – East Colfax
This proposal supports routine schedule adjustments on the Route 15, which are
anticipated to have a resource impact, estimated to be $41,000 annualized.

Route 44 – 44th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute the current service to use Clayton Street to 40th Avenue in the
place of the current Steele Street routing to improve sight lines at the rail road crossing of
the University of Colorado A Line. No operation cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
This proposal discontinues service on the Route 89, due to very low ridership. The route
currently averages 3 passengers per trip and 9 passengers per hour, which falls below the
17 passengers per hour required of Urban Local service. While the service was
implemented in response to a perceived gap in transportation in the Stapleton area, it has
not met the ridership standard for an Urban Local service. Alternatives to this service can
be found in the use of the University of Colorado A Line and the newly implemented R Line
light rail service. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $168,000 annualized.
Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited
This proposal discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership. The route
currently averages less than 5 passengers per trip and 6 passengers per hour, which falls
below the service standard for a 6.5 Suburban Local service. Alternatives to this service
can be found the use of Route 21 in the Bear Creek area and Green Mountain Call-n-Ride.
Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $90,000 annualized.
Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport
This proposal discontinues the 7:10pm southbound trip weekday and weekends. This trip
averages 5 passengers per day. It is also proposed to discontinue the 5:10pm southbound
trip on Saturday and Sunday only, which averages 6 passengers per trip. Anticipated cost
savings are estimated to be $25,300 annualized.
Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown
Due to routing currently being on St. Vrain School District property and the request
of Silverthorne High School to remove the current terminal from school property, it
is proposed to reroute the Route 324 and locate a new west-end terminal at
Grandview Meadows Drive and Nelson Road, northbound, nearside Nelson Road.
No additional operational costs are anticipated.

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
It is proposed to discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center, which is
not needed to maintain 15 minute frequency on the Route 40. Cost savings are expected
to be an estimated $8,000 annualized.

1.C.1.a

Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express
It is proposed to convert 3 PM peak north-bound and 2 AM peak southbound R
trips into RX trips and rename the route to RC/RX only. The renaming will provide
clarity in the route designation after the introduction of the new light rail R Line
service. No additional operational costs are anticipated.

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride
In November 2006, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began service. The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 6:00am – 6:00pm. Despite numerous marketing
campaigns and adjustments to the Call-n-Ride boundary, the Call-n-Ride falls in the
lowest category of boarding’s per hour and highest subsidy cost per boarding’s.
2015 end of the year numbers show the Call-n-Ride at 2.1 boarding’s per hour and
a subsidy cost of $36.30 per boarding. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Call-n-Ride service in Highlands Ranch. Alternative service includes Routes 402L
and 403. Anticipated cost savings are estimated to be $259,000 (based on 2015
numbers).
RockiesRide
With the major changes in transit corridors within the RTD, it is recommended that
many of the buses used for RockiesRide be redeployed to backup existing service
on Rockies game days in 2017. Rockies service for 2016 included opening day,
Saturday, Sunday and all fireworks games. The following changes are
recommended for the 2017 season:
 RockiesRide Route 36R / Wadsworth-Hampden – this route would be
discontinued and no replacement offered as ridership averages only 5
boardings per bus.
 RockiesRide Route 55R / Olde Town Arvada – customers will be able to use
new G Line that will be operating with service to Union Station.
 RockiesRide Route 86R / US36 & Broomfield – customers will be able to use
Flatiron Flyer service to Union Station. Back up buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route 120R / Wagon Road-Thornton – Route to remain the
same – no changes.
 RockiesRide Route BR / Boulder High School, US36 & Table Mesa Station,
US 36 & McCaslin Station – customers will use new Flatiron Flyer with
service to Union Station. Backup buses will be available.
 RockiesRide Route LR / Longmont – Route to remain the same – no
changes.
Cost savings are anticipated to be an estimated $104,700 annualized.

Rail
W Line (FasTracks)
It is proposed to discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods:
Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:16 AM, 6:46 AM, 7:16 AM, 7:46 AM,
8:16 AM, 8:46 AM, 4:01 PM, 4:31 PM, 5:01 PM, 5:31 PM, and 6:01 PM and Westbound

trips from Union Station at 5:27 AM, 5:57 AM, 6:25 AM, 6:55 AM, 7:25 AM, 7:55 AM,
3:10 PM, 3:40 PM, 4:10 PM, 4:40 PM, 5:10 PM, and 5:40 PM. This proposed change
effects approximately 789 passengers that will need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier
or later. Three-car trains will be reapportioned to adjust crowding on trains to meet
Service Standards.

The peak vehicle requirement for the W Line service would be reduced from 23 cars to 16
cars, which helps improve the spare ratio, which will be below our standard when the I225 Rail Line opens.
The proposed change effects approximately 1,434 passengers that would need to take a
train 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
The anticipated cost savings are estimated to be approximately $962,000 annualized.
Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:
Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W
Lines, on all service days. This is based on new data received from adjusting the
scheduled timepoints, which allows for a more thorough running time analysis. Running
time will only change between 15 and 30 seconds and only between a few stations on
each line. This will not alter the light rail trips and the same service will be provided. No
changes in hours are anticipated.

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Winter 2016 (2898 : Winter 2016/2017 Service Change)

This proposal creates a 15-minute frequency in the AM and PM peak period, which is
similar to the majority of other individual light rail lines in the peak periods. It reduces the
peak hour, peak direction capacity from 1,500 passengers to 1,000 passengers. Existing
ridership in the peak hour, peak direction is approximately 740 passengers, which still
leaves room for future ridership growth. This brings the peak W Line operation closer to
the level of service of the rest of the system.

ADA Expert First Annual Report

As required by the Settlement Agreement between RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition
(CCDC), RTD retained the services of an “ADA Expert” to “review, audit, and prepare a written report
(“Initial Expert Report”) to ensure that RTD implements and enforces the policy required by the
Agreement.” This policy, Boarding Individuals with Disabilities Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access
and referred to as the Policy, was designed to ensure that individuals with disabilities who use mobility
aids have equal access to fixed-route buses. The “Initial Expert Report” was shared with the Board of
Directors in November of 2014.
The Settlement Agreement further required that the ADA Expert return to RTD “to review, audit and
prepare a written follow-up report to ensure that RTD has taken the actions identified in the Initial Expert
Report (“Mid-Year Report”)”. The “Mid-Year Report” was shared with the Board of Directors in
September of 2015.
In June, 2016, KFH Group, Inc., of Bethesda, Maryland, (the “ADA Expert”) returned to Denver for the
purpose of preparing the first of three “Annual Reports” as required by the Settlement Agreement. The
“First Annual Report” was prepared based on data collected by KFH Group, and it included interviews
with RTD staff personnel and members of the disability community and observations made while riding
several RTD buses. A review was also conducted on the current pass-up incident data and ADA-related
customer complaints for fixed-route bus service.
The conclusions presented by KFH Group, Inc., stated that “RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to
the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting and to enforce the Policy over the past year.”
The ADA Expert also acknowledged that riders with disabilities continue to have “concerns about the
complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas.”
KFH Group, Inc., did not identify any formal deficiencies. However, the following recommendations
were made:


Complaint Handling: Procedures need to be better defined and consistently followed to ensure
that ADA-related complaints are correctly identified, investigated, addressed, and responded to in
a timely manner.
RTD staff is currently working on establishing detailed procedures to ensure that all ADA-related
complaints are properly captured, investigated, addressed and responded to in a consistent and
timely manner.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: This campaign would provide all riders with RTD’s
expectations for acceptable behavior when riding the bus. This campaign would include “rules”
that “ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and the securement areas.”

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.2

RTD staff will work with the Marketing Department to incorporate this type of etiquette campaign
in 2017.


Interior Bus Design: Members of the disability community should be consulted for input regarding
the interior design of future bus procurements.
RTD staff did reach out to members of the disability community for input prior to purchasing the
new Access-a-Ride vehicles. Many of the recommendations received from these individuals were
incorporated into the new bus design. RTD will again solicit input from members of the disability
community prior to the next vehicle procurement.



Staff Training: In addition to ensuring that all ADA Refresher Training is provided in accordance
with the Settlement Agreement requirements, RTD should also proceed with the implementation
of ADA Awareness Training as recommended by a 2015 Leadership Academy project team.
RTD staff is exploring the possibility of getting the ADA Awareness Training included into a
future training curriculum. The required ADA Refresher Training commenced in September of
2016.



Undercover Ride Check Form: The responsibilities for the RTD undercover ride checkers should
be expanded to include observations and notations to ensure that operators attempt to make
room for passengers using a mobility device.
RTD is currently working to modify the Undercover Ride Check program to include this
requirement.

A copy of the First Annual Report from KFH Group, Inc., is attached to this report.

First Annual Report, 2016
In keeping with the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) between the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 19, 2014,
this report is the first of three Annual Reports to be provided following the required Initial Expert
Report, submitted in September 2014, and the Mid-Year Report, submitted in July 2015.
According to the Agreement, RTD was to retain a consultant that is experienced with Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise unaffiliated with the RTD
to review and audit RTD’s implementation and enforcement of the Policy required through the
Agreement and to prepare specified reports. The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities
Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access, is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the
Policy as set out in the Agreement is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including
Wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
On an annual basis after submittal of the first two required reports, the Agreement specifies that the
ADA Expert is to review, audit and prepare a report addressing RTD’s efforts to ensure that individuals
with disabilities who use mobility aids have equal access to fixed-route buses.
Efforts to prepare this First Annual Report have included:



Review and assessment of the Settlement Agreement required reporting,
On-site work including attendance at the June 2016 meeting of the Transit and Accessibility
Task Force of the Denver Regional Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC),
Meetings with senior RTD staff who manage fixed-route service and a meeting with a CCDC
representative,
Fixed-route bus trips for first hand observations (including on Routes 15, 15L and 40), and,
After the on-site work, follow-up discussions and correspondence with RTD staff and CCDC
representatives.

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REQUIRED REPORTING
The Agreement requires that RTD monitor bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two ways:
(1) completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report” (Securement Area
Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD also monitors its bus
service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride Check Program.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.C.2.a

The Securement Area Reports are to document each time that a bus operator presses the ADA PAX
PASS-UP button and each time that a passenger complains that a bus operator has violated the Policy.

The first Securement Area Report included data from March 22, 2014 (when the Policy was adopted)
through April 30, 2014. This was referred to as the “Initial Report” in the Agreement and provides data
for just under six weeks. This first report and the efforts required for completion were reviewed in
detail in our Initial Expert Report.
In addition to this first Securement Area Report, the Agreement requires an annual Securement Area
Report beginning in 2015. RTD submitted the second Securement Area Report in January 2015, with
data from May 1, 2014 through the end of calendar year 2014. This second report, similar to the first,
includes all the data elements required by the Agreement, and covers a total of 35 weeks. Data in this
report was assessed in our Mid-Year Report.
The third Securement Area Report covers the full 2015 year and was submitted on January 15, 2016, as
required by the Agreement. Data on Pass-Ups from these Securement Area Reports are summarized in
Table 1 for the three time periods as well as the first five months of 2016.
The reasons for the Pass-Ups, including “two passengers in wheelchairs already occupying the two
securement areas” to “inoperable lifts” appear to be generally similar across the time periods. Based on
the data provided, the number of Pass-Ups on a weekly basis appears to range from about 11 to 17 per
week.

Complaint Process
In addition to the Pass-Up data, the Securement Area Reports document complaints regarding the
Policy. These complaints are handled as part of RTD’s customer service function, which handles all
complaints (as well as questions and comments) about RTD service, and complaints related to the
Policy were folded into this function.
Complaints, including those provided by email and telephone, are first handled by the Customer Care
Department. Complaints that are clearly ADA related or possibly ADA related are coded as “ADA.” This
includes complaints related to the Policy. The subset of complaints coded as ADA is then handled and
investigated by specific staff responsible for complaints for RTD-operated service and by staff
responsible for complaints related to contractor-operator service. The findings of the investigation for
every ADA related (and Policy related) complaint are detailed in monthly Customer Service Reports.
The complaints related to the Policy are also later added to the Securement Area Report, as required by
the Agreement.

The data also show a number of complaints that the operator has not given a rider using a wheelchair
the chance to board first before other riders, a procedure required by the Policy.

ADA REFRESHER TRAINING
The Agreement requires that bus operators and other operating staff as well as customer service
representatives participate in an annual “ADA Refresher Training” course. This training is to last for no
less than three hours total, with up to 45 minutes to cover the Policy. After the training, attendees are
to pass a test demonstrating an understanding of the material. The contractors are also required to
provide annual ADA Refresher Training, according to the Agreement, for their bus operators and other
operating staff.
RTD indicated that the ADA Refresher Training has not been initiated yet for 2016, as the training
materials are being revised and updated. More specifically, revisions are being incorporated to include
information on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Reasonable Modification Rule, which became
law in July 2015. This rule clarifies that public transportation agencies are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure programs
and services are accessible to people with disabilities.
RTD indicated that it will provide the ADA Refresher Training materials to CCDC for the organization’s
review prior to initiating the training this year as required by the Agreement. Such review in the past
has resulted in comments by CCDC, and RTD indicated that suggested revisions were made. We
believe that it is important that the training materials provided to CCDC for review are labeled as draft,
demonstrating that the material is not yet finalized and that revisions or changes are possible.
We suggest that the three RTD staff members who are responsible for investigating ADA and Policyrelated complaints provide specific input and potentially participate in the ADA Refresher Training
provided to the Customer Care Department staff who are tasked with taking complaints. These are the
staff members who initially document and categorize complaints which are then further reviewed,
investigated, and resolved, and it is critical that complaints are captured correctly and categorized
appropriately for further handling. Riders and particularly riders with disabilities given the Settlement
Agreement who take the time to complain about a specific issue deserve respect and attention to
address the identified issue. This is particularly important for those complainants who request a
response.

Table 2 displays the complaints related to the Policy since the start of data collection required by the
Agreement and through the end of 2015. While the Policy related complaints are a relatively small
number, the data show that issues remain with riders putting large items in the securement area as well
as riders boarding with strollers that are not folded. According to the information related to complaints
about strollers, the rider frequently tells the bus operator in these situations that the rider or the child
has a disability as the reason the stroller is not folded.

Other Potential Training on the ADA
In discussion with RTD staff about training on ADA issues, staff explained that a recent project
developed through the RTD Leadership Academy focused on ADA Awareness and envisioned an
organization-wide education campaign to ensure that all staff – at all agency departments – understand
ADA and what that means for public transportation. Significantly, this educational effort would include
training throughout the agency to help each staff member understand how their individual job impacts
riders with disabilities. This will be different for a mechanic who works on bus lifts, for someone who
plans bus routes, and for someone who sell fare media, but each staff member has a role in ensuring
that riders with disabilities can effectively and successful use RTD service.
This ADA Awareness effort is a more holistic approach to ADA training than that provided through the
Settlement Agreement required Refresher Training, which focuses only on staff in operations and the
Customer Care Department. Such an organization-wide effort would help staff understand the ADA and
their individual role in providing accessible public transit service to riders with disabilities.

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
As part of our efforts for this Annual Report, we met with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force at the
June 2016 meeting. We also met with a representative of CCDC and had follow-up correspondence with
CCDC.
Discussion topics and issues raised are summarized below, some of which address issues beyond
Settlement Agreement related requirements.

Wheelchair Securement Tie-Downs
A member of the Task Force indicated that the tie-downs on the buses can be difficult to use. This
individual also said that he would prefer more versatile tie-downs particularly equipment that a rider
could use independently.

1.C.2.a

There was discussion about the difficulty of maneuvering a walker down the aisle of some of the newer
low floor buses. RTD had recognized this issue previously with the narrow aisle on these new buses,
including the 9300-series buses, given the partition/barrier installed in front of the first forward-facing
seats and initiated a retrofit on these buses to reduce the footprint of the partitions/barriers in order to
widen the aisle.
Given concerns raised at the Task Force meeting and input from other riders with disabilities, RTD’s
maintenance department determined that the retrofit on some of the 9300 series buses was not
adequate and a second retrofit is being scheduled on those buses.

Large Items and Grocery Caddies
The issue of large items and grocery caddies impeding access in the bus aisles and to the securement
area was raised, as it has been in the prior two years of our involvement with RTD and the
Settlement Agreement. Comments were made that the extra space area that has been created on the
buses by the removal of seats has helped the problem with these larger items that riders bring on the
bus, but issues remain.
In particularly, grocery caddies continue to be a problem based on the input from the riders with
disabilities. RTD has established a policy and procedures for its bus operators to deal with grocery
caddies. Accordingly, riders with grocery caddies are allowed to ride the bus without collapsing the
caddy and removing the groceries. These riders are to sit behind the securement area, positioning their
caddy so it does not block the aisles. Those riders who are elderly or have disabilities and traveling with
a grocery caddy, however, are allowed to sit in the priority/securement seating areas. However, if a
rider using a mobility device needs the securement area, the bus operator is to tell such riders with a
grocery caddy to move. RTD’s policy also states that the operators are to offer assistance to the riders in
this situation.

Customer Complaints
The issue of customer complaints was raised at the Transit and Accessibility Task Force meeting as well
as by the CCDC representative. We note that this issue was also raised last year during our efforts to
prepare the Mid-Year Report and documented in that report.
Discussion on complaints at the Task Force meeting began with comments that not all complaints
related to the Policy and service for riders with disabilities are provided to RTD. One Task Force
member said that he hears other riders describe a complaint but he said that apparently many of those
riders do not file a complaint to RTD. According to the discussion, this may be because riders are too
busy or just don’t get around to filing a complaint.
The CCDC representative noted that he has filed two complaints with RTD this calendar year (one
concerned fixed-route service for another rider who uses a wheelchair), each time asking for a response
but he has yet to receive a response. RTD investigated the fixed-route complaint, as it appears that it
was not appropriately captured when first provided in March, and provided a response in June.

1.C.2.a

For those complaints given by telephone, staff answering the phone do not automatically ask
complainants if they would like a response after the complaint is investigated. If a response is
specifically requested or if the complaint is particularly problematic, RTD will provide one. Regardless,
all complaints are investigated and, as appropriate, follow-up with the bus operator is conducted to
correct problems.
We suggest that RTD add the same question now provided for online complaints – “Would you like a
response from our customer service team once our investigation is complete?” – to its website under the
link “Contact Us” for those riders who wish to call regarding a complaint. In this way, those who call
with a complaint are treated equally with those who file a complaint online and given the same option
to request a response.
CCDC raised another issue regarding the complaint process. Apparently, CCDC members are
sometimes told to submit complaints to RTD’s ADA Manager rather than through RTD’s Customer Care
Department. This has led to some confusion about where or whom to submit complaints and likely
leads to frustration on the part of complainants. This may also lead to complaints “falling through the
cracks” and not resulting in a proper investigation.

Large and Oversize Mobility Devices
The Task Force discussed large and oversize mobility devices and problems that riders using such
devices face when using the bus. The increasing incidence of riders using larger and oversize
wheelchairs and other mobility devices is recognized within the transit industry, and it is a problem for
fixed route bus as well as paratransit operators. It is both changing demographics of the overall
population (with an increasing size and age of individuals) and the increasing size and weight of
wheeled and powered mobility devices that cause problems. It can be challenging to accommodate
larger and heavier passengers and mobility devices on transit vehicles that met the ADA standards in
place when the vehicles were purchased.
In 2011, the federal government issued revisions to parts of the ADA regulations. These include a revised
definition of the “common wheelchair.” And, to the point of larger mobility devices, the revisions
require that when transit agencies have vehicles and/or lifts that can handle larger and/or heavier
mobility devices, they are required to serve riders and their devices if the lift and vehicle can physically
accommodate them, unless doing so is inconsistent with legitimate safety requirements. This revision
recognizes the fact that many lifts are now designed to accommodate up to 800 pounds.
This discussion on larger and oversize mobility devices overlapped with the discussion on the design of
bus interiors, as documented below.

First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: First Annual Report and Appendix A 07.14.16 (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

The issue of response to complaints was further discussed. The online complaint form for those
complaints provided by email includes a question asking the complainant if a response is requested.
RTD reports that if a response is requested, a response is provided. This may take ten and up to 15 days
given the steps involved in the investigation and resolution.

1.C.2.a

The design of the interior of buses was discussed in relation to providing adequate space for riders
traveling with mobility devices and possible changes in configuring the wheelchair securement areas.
Within the overall space dimensions of a fixed-route bus and given the location of necessary vehicle
components (e.g., the wheel housings on low-floor buses) as well as ensuring compliance with ADA
regulations, the design of seating, wheelchair securement areas and priority seating for elderly
passengers and those with disabilities can have variations.
When RTD prepares specifications for new vehicles (or retrofits older ones), two suggestions from
CCDC are worth considering. One suggestion is to offset the wheelchair securement areas to allow
more room for riders with a mobility device, particularly a larger device, to maneuver into and out of
the space.
The second suggestion concerns the three aisle facing seats over the securement area on the new low
floor buses. When a rider with a walker sits in that area, the walker impedes access in the aisle. A
CCDC representative suggests that a previous design offers advantages, with two seats facing the aisle
and two facing the driver that give a rider with a walker the ability to sit facing the driver and a location
to put their walker by lifting up the seat facing the aisle.
We recommend that RTD involve the disability community directly when initiating plans for the next
bus procurement and at a time in the process where variations of the seating and securement area
design can be considered. This involvement will provide the opportunity to determine if there are
adjustments or variations or new ideas for the interior bus design that would improve access to fixed
route bus service for riders who use mobility devices. And this involvement can also address the issue
raised in our discussions with riders with disabilities related to larger and oversize mobility devices.
According to transit industry research, transit agencies can improve their accessibility with a “culture of
innovation and citizen advisory committees” that works collaboratively with the transit agency to make
“improvements for all passengers.” 1 This same research report documents efforts made by the transit
agency in Los Angeles to improve its bus accessibility with “new bold signage, forward facing seats as
priority seating, a dedicated spot for walkers that is not in the wheelchair space, and the use of the new
three-point securement systems that is intended to make securement easier for the driver or the
wheelchair users.” See Figure 1.

The transit agency serving the Philadelphia metro area (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority or SEPTA) provides another example of operating buses with signage directly on the
passenger seats; see Figure 2. Starting around 2011, SEPTA has procured buses with such seating, which
is a more direct notice to riders about yielding seats to riders with disabilities including mobility
devices.

Another industry research report specifically recommends that it is “a good practice to seek input from
riders with disabilities when determining the type of vehicle, or specific type of equipment, to procure.”2
The report explains that some transit agencies have asked their vehicle vendors to provide “a ‘sample’

bus or rail car that riders can test by actually boarding, maneuvering to the securement area, and using
the securement system.” Input and comments from riders who use mobility devices can improve the
design of vehicles.

Other Issues
Other discussion at the Task Force meeting brought up service animals and the automatic stop
announcements (ASA) on the buses.
Regarding service animals, task members noted that some of the dogs that riders bring on board do not
appear to be service animals. According to the ADA, service animals do not have to wear a harness or
have a special ID tag that shows the animal is a service animal. However, the regulations state that a
bus operator, if there are questions as to whether the animal is a legitimate service animal, may ask the
rider if an animal is a service animal or ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform.
RTD staff explained the transit agency’s policy on service animals, which states that bus operators are to
assume that a dog or other animal that a passenger brings on board is a service animal unless there is a
valid reason to believe otherwise. If there is a valid reason, the operator may ask if the animal is a
service animal for a person with a disability. If the passenger says yes, then operators are instructed to
do nothing further unless the animal creates problems or is disruptive on the bus. At that point, the
operator is instructed to contact dispatch for direction.
One Task Force member commented that the ASAs are very useful but said that if the ASAs are not
working, the bus operator does not always call out stops and this is a problem. RTD’s bus operators are
trained to call out stops in such situations. RTD staff said that when operators fail to call out stops
should the ASA not be functioning, riders should contact RTD so that the agency can follow up with the
operator in question.
There were also a couple of more general comments at the Task Force meeting regarding the experience
with fixed route bus service by riders with disabilities. One member stated that generally bus operators
have a better attitude than in the past with their interactions with riders with disabilities and that there
is general improvement in serving riders with disabilities. Another Task Member commented that the
operators mostly understand how to deal with his particular mobility device and try to ensure the aisle
is clear so that he can maneuver to his seat.

SUMMARY AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting
and to enforce the Policy over the past year. These efforts require dedicated staff resources and
attention; key staff involved in ensuring compliance with the Policy appear committed to the mission.

11
First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: First Annual Report and Appendix A 07.14.16 (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

RTD recently involved its ADA paratransit advisory committee when evaluating vehicles being
considered for procurement for Access-A-Ride. This was reportedly a useful and cooperative
undertaking and allowed RTD to incorporate most of the suggestions offered by committee members.

1.C.2.a

We have not identified formal deficiencies. But, based on our review of the Policy-required data reports
as well as discussions and input from riders with disabilities and RTD staff, we identify the following
actions that RTD should pursue to ensure not just compliance with the Policy but a commitment to
providing service to its riders who have disabilities.


Complaint Handling: RTD needs to ensure that complaints related to the Policy are captured
when submitted by a rider, that they are investigated and resolved, and as appropriate, that a
response is provided to the complainant. This may require more targeted and specific training to
the Customer Care Department staff who are the frontline when complaints are submitted.
These staff should err on the side of coding a complaint as ADA if there is any question that it
might be and allow the three RTD staff members tasked with reviewing ADA complaints to
determine if a complaint is related to the Policy. We further suggest that these three staff
members provide input to and possibly participate in the ADA refresher training for Customer
Service staff. RTD should also review current procedures for complaint categorization to ensure
all complaints related to the Policy are appropriately captured, categorized, investigated, and, as
needed, responded to. We further suggest that RTD let complainants who submit a complaint
by telephone know that they can request a response.
RTD should also clarify procedures for complaints so that those complaining about ADA issues
know where to send their complaints. Once resolved, procedures should be clearly stated on the
RTD website and disseminated as appropriate.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: We strongly recommend that RTD develop,
publish, and disseminate what we refer to as “rules for riders,” which are a set of statements that
tell riders what RTD expects of them when riding the bus. These should explicitly include
statements explaining “rules” that ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and
to the securement areas. For example, one of the rules should state: “At bus stops, allow riders
using mobility devices including wheelchairs to board first.” This is our third report to include
this recommended action regarding development of “rules for riders.”
The “rules of the road” can be the centerpiece of an etiquette campaign, an effort that reportedly
RTD is considering. We recommend that RTD pursue such a campaign as soon as possible and
dedicate adequate resources for an effective and sustained campaign. Some transit agencies
have worked with graphics design students at a local college or university to provide support
with graphics, an approach that can be cost-effective.
We also suggest that the campaign indicate why it is important to allow riders using wheelchairs
to board first and to ensure they have access to the wheelchair securement area. It isn’t just
good manners or “just” the law to allow such riders to have access to the securement positions.
Without this access, riders who use wheelchairs are unable to ride public transit. One approach
to getting this point across is to include a video of actual riders who use wheelchairs stating why
they need this access, and use these personal testimonies as part of the campaign. Personal
stories from real people can be very powerful, and may be more effective than communicating
rules alone.

Input from riders with disabilities regarding compliance suggests mixed results. There continue to be
concerns about the complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas,
which impedes access for riders using mobility devices.

1.C.2.a



Interior Bus Design: We strongly encourage RTD to involve representative riders with
disabilities when the transit agency begins to plan for the next bus procurement. Such input
may be very useful in considering and possibly adopting variations or new options for the bus
seating and securement areas that will improve access and service for riders who use mobility
devices.
Additionally, given that the large majority of Pass-Ups have been due to both of the securement
areas already being occupied by passengers in wheelchairs (consistently 65-69% of all Pass-Ups
reported during March 2014 to December 2015), RTD could consider procuring buses with three
securement positions rather than two. The transit agency in Corpus Christi, Texas was able to
do this in a 40’ transit coach without reducing its standard bus seating.



Staff Training: RTD should ensure it completes the required ADA Refresher Training for the
Settlement Agreement-identified staff, once the training materials have been reviewed by
CCDC. RTD should also commit resources to implementing the ADA Awareness campaign
developed through the Leadership Academy, an internally-initiated education effort that will
help staff members throughout the agency understand their role in providing accessible service
that meets both the ADA regulations as well as the intent of the ADA.



Undercover Ride Check Form: RTD has an Undercover Ride Check program that uses parttime employees to provide unobserved checks of bus operators compliance with specific duties
and responsibilities related to ADA service, including, among others, did the operator attempt to
make room for passenger with a mobility device? To address a concern raised by CCDC that bus
operators do not always call in all Pass-Ups as required by the Agreement, we suggest that this
item be added to the Undercover Ride Check Form as another compliance item to monitor. This
would involve revision to the current form and instructions to the checkers that they have one
additional matter to look for. The instructions to the checkers should also include an
explanation of the proper procedures regarding a Pass-Up so the checkers understand what bus
operators should do and determine if the operator followed the right procedures.

First Annual Report, 2016
In keeping with the Settlement Agreement (Agreement) between the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver dated February 19, 2014,
this report is the first of three Annual Reports to be provided following the required Initial Expert
Report, submitted in September 2014, and the Mid-Year Report, submitted in July 2015.
According to the Agreement, RTD was to retain a consultant that is experienced with Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance with fixed route bus service and otherwise unaffiliated with the RTD
to review and audit RTD’s implementation and enforcement of the Policy required through the
Agreement and to prepare specified reports. The Policy, titled Boarding Individuals with Disabilities
Who Use Mobility Aids to Ensure Access, is included in Appendix A to this report. The purpose of the
Policy as set out in the Agreement is: “RTD will ensure individuals who use Mobility Aids, including
Wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses and to the Securement Areas.”
On an annual basis after submittal of the first two required reports, the Agreement specifies that the
ADA Expert is to review, audit and prepare a report addressing RTD’s efforts to ensure that individuals
with disabilities who use mobility aids have equal access to fixed-route buses.
Efforts to prepare this First Annual Report have included:

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REQUIRED REPORTING
The Agreement requires that RTD monitor bus operators’ compliance with the Policy in two ways:
(1) completion of the “CCDC Settlement Agreement Securement Area Issues Report” (Securement Area
Report), and (2) through a “Complaint Process” concerning the Policy. RTD also monitors its bus
service through deployment of Street Supervisors and its Undercover Ride Check Program.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

1.C.2.b

The Securement Area Reports are to document each time that a bus operator presses the ADA PAX
PASS-UP button and each time that a passenger complains that a bus operator has violated the Policy.

The first Securement Area Report included data from March 22, 2014 (when the Policy was adopted)
through April 30, 2014. This was referred to as the “Initial Report” in the Agreement and provides data
for just under six weeks. This first report and the efforts required for completion were reviewed in
detail in our Initial Expert Report.
In addition to this first Securement Area Report, the Agreement requires an annual Securement Area
Report beginning in 2015. RTD submitted the second Securement Area Report in January 2015, with
data from May 1, 2014 through the end of calendar year 2014. This second report, similar to the first,
includes all the data elements required by the Agreement, and covers a total of 35 weeks. Data in this
report was assessed in our Mid-Year Report.
The third Securement Area Report covers the full 2015 year and was submitted on January 15, 2016, as
required by the Agreement. Data on Pass-Ups from these Securement Area Reports are summarized in
Table 1 for the three time periods as well as the first five months of 2016.
The reasons for the Pass-Ups, including “two passengers in wheelchairs already occupying the two
securement areas” to “inoperable lifts” appear to be generally similar across the time periods. Based on
the data provided, the number of Pass-Ups on a weekly basis appears to range from about 11 to 17 per
week.

Complaint Process
In addition to the Pass-Up data, the Securement Area Reports document complaints regarding the
Policy. These complaints are handled as part of RTD’s customer service function, which handles all
complaints (as well as questions and comments) about RTD service, and complaints related to the
Policy were folded into this function.
Complaints, including those provided by email and telephone, are first handled by the Customer Care
Department. Complaints that are clearly ADA related or possibly ADA related are coded as “ADA.” This
includes complaints related to the Policy. The subset of complaints coded as ADA is then handled and
investigated by specific staff responsible for complaints for RTD-operated service and by staff
responsible for complaints related to contractor-operator service. The findings of the investigation for
every ADA related (and Policy related) complaint are detailed in monthly Customer Service Reports.
The complaints related to the Policy are also later added to the Securement Area Report, as required by
the Agreement.

The data also show a number of complaints that the operator has not given a rider using a wheelchair
the chance to board first before other riders, a procedure required by the Policy.

ADA REFRESHER TRAINING
The Agreement requires that bus operators and other operating staff as well as customer service
representatives participate in an annual “ADA Refresher Training” course. This training is to last for no
less than three hours total, with up to 45 minutes to cover the Policy. After the training, attendees are
to pass a test demonstrating an understanding of the material. The contractors are also required to
provide annual ADA Refresher Training, according to the Agreement, for their bus operators and other
operating staff.
RTD indicated that the ADA Refresher Training has not been initiated yet for 2016, as the training
materials are being revised and updated. More specifically, revisions are being incorporated to include
information on the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Reasonable Modification Rule, which became
law in July 2015. This rule clarifies that public transportation agencies are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure programs
and services are accessible to people with disabilities.
RTD indicated that it will provide the ADA Refresher Training materials to CCDC for the organization’s
review prior to initiating the training this year as required by the Agreement. Such review in the past
has resulted in comments by CCDC, and RTD indicated that suggested revisions were made. We
believe that it is important that the training materials provided to CCDC for review are labeled as draft,
demonstrating that the material is not yet finalized and that revisions or changes are possible.
We suggest that the three RTD staff members who are responsible for investigating ADA and Policyrelated complaints provide specific input and potentially participate in the ADA Refresher Training
provided to the Customer Care Department staff who are tasked with taking complaints. These are the
staff members who initially document and categorize complaints which are then further reviewed,
investigated, and resolved, and it is critical that complaints are captured correctly and categorized
appropriately for further handling. Riders and particularly riders with disabilities given the Settlement
Agreement who take the time to complain about a specific issue deserve respect and attention to
address the identified issue. This is particularly important for those complainants who request a
response.

Table 2 displays the complaints related to the Policy since the start of data collection required by the
Agreement and through the end of 2015. While the Policy related complaints are a relatively small
number, the data show that issues remain with riders putting large items in the securement area as well
as riders boarding with strollers that are not folded. According to the information related to complaints
about strollers, the rider frequently tells the bus operator in these situations that the rider or the child
has a disability as the reason the stroller is not folded.

Other Potential Training on the ADA
In discussion with RTD staff about training on ADA issues, staff explained that a recent project
developed through the RTD Leadership Academy focused on ADA Awareness and envisioned an
organization-wide education campaign to ensure that all staff – at all agency departments – understand
ADA and what that means for public transportation. Significantly, this educational effort would include
training throughout the agency to help each staff member understand how their individual job impacts
riders with disabilities. This will be different for a mechanic who works on bus lifts, for someone who
plans bus routes, and for someone who sell fare media, but each staff member has a role in ensuring
that riders with disabilities can effectively and successful use RTD service.
This ADA Awareness effort is a more holistic approach to ADA training than that provided through the
Settlement Agreement required Refresher Training, which focuses only on staff in operations and the
Customer Care Department. Such an organization-wide effort would help staff understand the ADA and
their individual role in providing accessible public transit service to riders with disabilities.

INPUT FROM RIDERS WITH DISABILITIES
As part of our efforts for this Annual Report, we met with the Transit and Accessibility Task Force at the
June 2016 meeting. We also met with a representative of CCDC and had follow-up correspondence with
CCDC.
Discussion topics and issues raised are summarized below, some of which address issues beyond
Settlement Agreement related requirements.

Wheelchair Securement Tie-Downs
A member of the Task Force indicated that the tie-downs on the buses can be difficult to use. This
individual also said that he would prefer more versatile tie-downs particularly equipment that a rider
could use independently.

Partition/Barriers in Front of First Forward-Facing Seats on Newer Buses

Given concerns raised at the Task Force meeting and input from other riders with disabilities, RTD’s
maintenance department determined that the retrofit on some of the 9300 series buses was not
adequate and a second retrofit is being scheduled on those buses.

Large Items and Grocery Caddies
The issue of large items and grocery caddies impeding access in the bus aisles and to the securement
area was raised, as it has been in the prior two years of our involvement with RTD and the
Settlement Agreement. Comments were made that the extra space area that has been created on the
buses by the removal of seats has helped the problem with these larger items that riders bring on the
bus, but issues remain.
In particularly, grocery caddies continue to be a problem based on the input from the riders with
disabilities. RTD has established a policy and procedures for its bus operators to deal with grocery
caddies. Accordingly, riders with grocery caddies are allowed to ride the bus without collapsing the
caddy and removing the groceries. These riders are to sit behind the securement area, positioning their
caddy so it does not block the aisles. Those riders who are elderly or have disabilities and traveling with
a grocery caddy, however, are allowed to sit in the priority/securement seating areas. However, if a
rider using a mobility device needs the securement area, the bus operator is to tell such riders with a
grocery caddy to move. RTD’s policy also states that the operators are to offer assistance to the riders in
this situation.

Customer Complaints
The issue of customer complaints was raised at the Transit and Accessibility Task Force meeting as well
as by the CCDC representative. We note that this issue was also raised last year during our efforts to
prepare the Mid-Year Report and documented in that report.
Discussion on complaints at the Task Force meeting began with comments that not all complaints
related to the Policy and service for riders with disabilities are provided to RTD. One Task Force
member said that he hears other riders describe a complaint but he said that apparently many of those
riders do not file a complaint to RTD. According to the discussion, this may be because riders are too
busy or just don’t get around to filing a complaint.
The CCDC representative noted that he has filed two complaints with RTD this calendar year (one
concerned fixed-route service for another rider who uses a wheelchair), each time asking for a response
but he has yet to receive a response. RTD investigated the fixed-route complaint, as it appears that it
was not appropriately captured when first provided in March, and provided a response in June.

Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: First Annual Report - screen reader (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

There was discussion about the difficulty of maneuvering a walker down the aisle of some of the newer
low floor buses. RTD had recognized this issue previously with the narrow aisle on these new buses,
including the 9300-series buses, given the partition/barrier installed in front of the first forward-facing
seats and initiated a retrofit on these buses to reduce the footprint of the partitions/barriers in order to
widen the aisle.

1.C.2.b

For those complaints given by telephone, staff answering the phone do not automatically ask
complainants if they would like a response after the complaint is investigated. If a response is
specifically requested or if the complaint is particularly problematic, RTD will provide one. Regardless,
all complaints are investigated and, as appropriate, follow-up with the bus operator is conducted to
correct problems.
We suggest that RTD add the same question now provided for online complaints – “Would you like a
response from our customer service team once our investigation is complete?” – to its website under the
link “Contact Us” for those riders who wish to call regarding a complaint. In this way, those who call
with a complaint are treated equally with those who file a complaint online and given the same option
to request a response.
CCDC raised another issue regarding the complaint process. Apparently, CCDC members are
sometimes told to submit complaints to RTD’s ADA Manager rather than through RTD’s Customer Care
Department. This has led to some confusion about where or whom to submit complaints and likely
leads to frustration on the part of complainants. This may also lead to complaints “falling through the
cracks” and not resulting in a proper investigation.

Large and Oversize Mobility Devices
The Task Force discussed large and oversize mobility devices and problems that riders using such
devices face when using the bus. The increasing incidence of riders using larger and oversize
wheelchairs and other mobility devices is recognized within the transit industry, and it is a problem for
fixed route bus as well as paratransit operators. It is both changing demographics of the overall
population (with an increasing size and age of individuals) and the increasing size and weight of
wheeled and powered mobility devices that cause problems. It can be challenging to accommodate
larger and heavier passengers and mobility devices on transit vehicles that met the ADA standards in
place when the vehicles were purchased.
In 2011, the federal government issued revisions to parts of the ADA regulations. These include a revised
definition of the “common wheelchair.” And, to the point of larger mobility devices, the revisions
require that when transit agencies have vehicles and/or lifts that can handle larger and/or heavier
mobility devices, they are required to serve riders and their devices if the lift and vehicle can physically
accommodate them, unless doing so is inconsistent with legitimate safety requirements. This revision
recognizes the fact that many lifts are now designed to accommodate up to 800 pounds.
This discussion on larger and oversize mobility devices overlapped with the discussion on the design of
bus interiors, as documented below.

The issue of response to complaints was further discussed. The online complaint form for those
complaints provided by email includes a question asking the complainant if a response is requested.
RTD reports that if a response is requested, a response is provided. This may take ten and up to 15 days
given the steps involved in the investigation and resolution.

1.C.2.b

Interior Bus Design

When RTD prepares specifications for new vehicles (or retrofits older ones), two suggestions from
CCDC are worth considering. One suggestion is to offset the wheelchair securement areas to allow
more room for riders with a mobility device, particularly a larger device, to maneuver into and out of
the space.
The second suggestion concerns the three aisle facing seats over the securement area on the new low
floor buses. When a rider with a walker sits in that area, the walker impedes access in the aisle. A
CCDC representative suggests that a previous design offers advantages, with two seats facing the aisle
and two facing the driver that give a rider with a walker the ability to sit facing the driver and a location
to put their walker by lifting up the seat facing the aisle.
We recommend that RTD involve the disability community directly when initiating plans for the next
bus procurement and at a time in the process where variations of the seating and securement area
design can be considered. This involvement will provide the opportunity to determine if there are
adjustments or variations or new ideas for the interior bus design that would improve access to fixed
route bus service for riders who use mobility devices. And this involvement can also address the issue
raised in our discussions with riders with disabilities related to larger and oversize mobility devices.
According to transit industry research, transit agencies can improve their accessibility with a “culture of
innovation and citizen advisory committees” that works collaboratively with the transit agency to make
“improvements for all passengers.” 1 This same research report documents efforts made by the transit
agency in Los Angeles to improve its bus accessibility with “new bold signage, forward facing seats as
priority seating, a dedicated spot for walkers that is not in the wheelchair space, and the use of the new
three-point securement systems that is intended to make securement easier for the driver or the
wheelchair users.” See Figure 1.

The design of the interior of buses was discussed in relation to providing adequate space for riders
traveling with mobility devices and possible changes in configuring the wheelchair securement areas.
Within the overall space dimensions of a fixed-route bus and given the location of necessary vehicle
components (e.g., the wheel housings on low-floor buses) as well as ensuring compliance with ADA
regulations, the design of seating, wheelchair securement areas and priority seating for elderly
passengers and those with disabilities can have variations.

Figure 1: Priority seating near the front of the bus on MTA buses in Los Angeles

The transit agency serving the Philadelphia metro area (the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority or SEPTA) provides another example of operating buses with signage directly on the
passenger seats; see Figure 2. Starting around 2011, SEPTA has procured buses with such seating, which
is a more direct notice to riders about yielding seats to riders with disabilities including mobility
devices.

Figure 2: Priority seating on SEPTA buses

Another industry research report specifically recommends that it is “a good practice to seek input from
riders with disabilities when determining the type of vehicle, or specific type of equipment, to procure.”2
The report explains that some transit agencies have asked their vehicle vendors to provide “a ‘sample’

bus or rail car that riders can test by actually boarding, maneuvering to the securement area, and using
the securement system.” Input and comments from riders who use mobility devices can improve the
design of vehicles.

Other Issues
Other discussion at the Task Force meeting brought up service animals and the automatic stop
announcements (ASA) on the buses.
Regarding service animals, task members noted that some of the dogs that riders bring on board do not
appear to be service animals. According to the ADA, service animals do not have to wear a harness or
have a special ID tag that shows the animal is a service animal. However, the regulations state that a
bus operator, if there are questions as to whether the animal is a legitimate service animal, may ask the
rider if an animal is a service animal or ask what tasks the animal has been trained to perform.
RTD staff explained the transit agency’s policy on service animals, which states that bus operators are to
assume that a dog or other animal that a passenger brings on board is a service animal unless there is a
valid reason to believe otherwise. If there is a valid reason, the operator may ask if the animal is a
service animal for a person with a disability. If the passenger says yes, then operators are instructed to
do nothing further unless the animal creates problems or is disruptive on the bus. At that point, the
operator is instructed to contact dispatch for direction.
One Task Force member commented that the ASAs are very useful but said that if the ASAs are not
working, the bus operator does not always call out stops and this is a problem. RTD’s bus operators are
trained to call out stops in such situations. RTD staff said that when operators fail to call out stops
should the ASA not be functioning, riders should contact RTD so that the agency can follow up with the
operator in question.
There were also a couple of more general comments at the Task Force meeting regarding the experience
with fixed route bus service by riders with disabilities. One member stated that generally bus operators
have a better attitude than in the past with their interactions with riders with disabilities and that there
is general improvement in serving riders with disabilities. Another Task Member commented that the
operators mostly understand how to deal with his particular mobility device and try to ensure the aisle
is clear so that he can maneuver to his seat.

SUMMARY AND FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS
RTD has continued its efforts to adhere to the Settlement Agreement including the required reporting
and to enforce the Policy over the past year. These efforts require dedicated staff resources and
attention; key staff involved in ensuring compliance with the Policy appear committed to the mission.

11
First Annual Report, 2016 l KFH Group

Packet Pg. 39

Attachment: First Annual Report - screen reader (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

RTD recently involved its ADA paratransit advisory committee when evaluating vehicles being
considered for procurement for Access-A-Ride. This was reportedly a useful and cooperative
undertaking and allowed RTD to incorporate most of the suggestions offered by committee members.

1.C.2.b

Input from riders with disabilities regarding compliance suggests mixed results. There continue to be
concerns about the complaint process and placement of larger items in the aisle and securement areas,
which impedes access for riders using mobility devices.



Complaint Handling: RTD needs to ensure that complaints related to the Policy are captured
when submitted by a rider, that they are investigated and resolved, and as appropriate, that a
response is provided to the complainant. This may require more targeted and specific training to
the Customer Care Department staff who are the frontline when complaints are submitted.
These staff should err on the side of coding a complaint as ADA if there is any question that it
might be and allow the three RTD staff members tasked with reviewing ADA complaints to
determine if a complaint is related to the Policy. We further suggest that these three staff
members provide input to and possibly participate in the ADA refresher training for Customer
Service staff. RTD should also review current procedures for complaint categorization to ensure
all complaints related to the Policy are appropriately captured, categorized, investigated, and, as
needed, responded to. We further suggest that RTD let complainants who submit a complaint
by telephone know that they can request a response.
RTD should also clarify procedures for complaints so that those complaining about ADA issues
know where to send their complaints. Once resolved, procedures should be clearly stated on the
RTD website and disseminated as appropriate.



“Rules for Riders” – Etiquette Campaign: We strongly recommend that RTD develop,
publish, and disseminate what we refer to as “rules for riders,” which are a set of statements that
tell riders what RTD expects of them when riding the bus. These should explicitly include
statements explaining “rules” that ensure riders using mobility devices have access to buses and
to the securement areas. For example, one of the rules should state: “At bus stops, allow riders
using mobility devices including wheelchairs to board first.” This is our third report to include
this recommended action regarding development of “rules for riders.”
The “rules of the road” can be the centerpiece of an etiquette campaign, an effort that reportedly
RTD is considering. We recommend that RTD pursue such a campaign as soon as possible and
dedicate adequate resources for an effective and sustained campaign. Some transit agencies
have worked with graphics design students at a local college or university to provide support
with graphics, an approach that can be cost-effective.
We also suggest that the campaign indicate why it is important to allow riders using wheelchairs
to board first and to ensure they have access to the wheelchair securement area. It isn’t just
good manners or “just” the law to allow such riders to have access to the securement positions.
Without this access, riders who use wheelchairs are unable to ride public transit. One approach
to getting this point across is to include a video of actual riders who use wheelchairs stating why
they need this access, and use these personal testimonies as part of the campaign. Personal
stories from real people can be very powerful, and may be more effective than communicating
rules alone.

Attachment: First Annual Report - screen reader (2901 : ADA Expert First Annual Report)

We have not identified formal deficiencies. But, based on our review of the Policy-required data reports
as well as discussions and input from riders with disabilities and RTD staff, we identify the following
actions that RTD should pursue to ensure not just compliance with the Policy but a commitment to
providing service to its riders who have disabilities.

1.C.2.b



Interior Bus Design: We strongly encourage RTD to involve representative riders with
disabilities when the transit agency begins to plan for the next bus procurement. Such input
may be very useful in considering and possibly adopting variations or new options for the bus
seating and securement areas that will improve access and service for riders who use mobility
devices.
Additionally, given that the large majority of Pass-Ups have been due to both of the securement
areas already being occupied by passengers in wheelchairs (consistently 65-69% of all Pass-Ups
reported during March 2014 to December 2015), RTD could consider procuring buses with three
securement positions rather than two. The transit agency in Corpus Christi, Texas was able to
do this in a 40’ transit coach without reducing its standard bus seating.



Staff Training: RTD should ensure it completes the required ADA Refresher Training for the
Settlement Agreement-identified staff, once the training materials have been reviewed by
CCDC. RTD should also commit resources to implementing the ADA Awareness campaign
developed through the Leadership Academy, an internally-initiated education effort that will
help staff members throughout the agency understand their role in providing accessible service
that meets both the ADA regulations as well as the intent of the ADA.



Undercover Ride Check Form: RTD has an Undercover Ride Check program that uses parttime employees to provide unobserved checks of bus operators compliance with specific duties
and responsibilities related to ADA service, including, among others, did the operator attempt to
make room for passenger with a mobility device? To address a concern raised by CCDC that bus
operators do not always call in all Pass-Ups as required by the Agreement, we suggest that this
item be added to the Undercover Ride Check Form as another compliance item to monitor. This
would involve revision to the current form and instructions to the checkers that they have one
additional matter to look for. The instructions to the checkers should also include an
explanation of the proper procedures regarding a Pass-Up so the checkers understand what bus
operators should do and determine if the operator followed the right procedures.

2016 2nd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route
Report

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2016 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize
bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators.
The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings,
through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 2nd quarter. First Transit Longmont and First Transit Commerce City did not meet the goal;
however, only one of the passenger accidents that occurred in the 2nd quarter (3 year to date)
was classified as preventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of
passenger safety through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger
accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.

Packet Pg. 43

1.C.3



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Denver, and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service
with 88.1% and 89.2% on-time performance respectively in the 2nd quarter. Transdev continues
to make progress with 87.9% and First Transit Commerce City declined to 84.1% on-time
performance due in part to the high number of new operators. RTD and the private contractors
continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time performance with a strong focus on
first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with
operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach
88% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and
Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 28,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 2nd quarter. First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Denver held steady
at .0005 and Transdev improved to .0007 Complaints per Boarding in the 2nd quarter.
Complaints per board continue to reflect the difficulties experienced in the earlier part of the year
due to operator shortages which resulted in a high number of bus late and bus no show
complaints. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with
operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist
operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding ontime performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue
to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

2016 2nd Quarter Access-a-Ride/Cab Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 1% through the 2nd quarter of 2016 compared to the same period
of 2015. Productivity increased from 1.19 to 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 10%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
decreased by 2% compared to 2015. Total boardings decreased from 457,576 total boardings thru Q2
of 2015 to 449,918 total boardings thru Q2 of 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased by 4% through the 2nd quarter of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015. Access-a-Ride is approximately 5% under budgeted revenue
hours through the second quarter of 2016.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2016 was 95.3% a slight decrease as compared
to the same period of 2015 (95.6%).
Passenger on-time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2016 was 83.87% a slight decrease as
compared to the same period in 2015 (84.27%).
On time performance continues to be challenging as a result of operator shortages and the continuing
trend of traffic, construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to address the operator
shortage challenge by utilizing radio, on-line websites, job fairs, and help-wanted ads as a means of
attracting potential operators. In addition, our dedicated vehicle service providers have instituted salary
increases, hiring bonuses, and other incentives in order to attract and retain operators.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 2nd quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer satisfaction.

Preventable Accidents:

2nd Qtr 2015 – 3 Accidents

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership continues to be down. Changes to how we are scheduling trips for the school children,
low gas prices and the new fare increases have affected ridership in the Call-n-Ride areas.
All Call-n-Rides have had new computers installed.
internet connections.

This makes for better scheduling and better

Belmar – The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
Light Rail service. The Call-n-Ride operated with 2 peak vehicles and one all day vehicle, weekdays
only. Over the past two years, the service has been modified to improve ridership as it does not
meet the minimum of three boardings per hour. The RTD Board approved discontinuance of this Call-

n-Ride in April 2016. The Call-n-Ride was discontinued as planned. April 22nd was the last operating
day.
Evergreen – A strong Call-n-Ride over the years, there are two major factors in the decline of
ridership: a school whose students rode CnR closed and the Extension program for the disabled
moved and acquired their own bus. We have met with the Seniors’ Resources Center (SRC) and
they have been actively working with the senior living communities and the schools to increase
ridership. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to evaluate the service and make
recommendations for change. As a direct result of the TAC, marketing has taken place, a shopping
trip was created for the seniors, and Call-n-Ride worked to encourage school age children to use CnR
for school trips. At the end of 2015, the shopping trip was discontinued but marketing continues.
Ridership has increased to over 3 boardings per hour Jan-May 2016. With school ending in May,
ridership has declined for the summer months.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Route 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to
Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch provided a cost share with the
RTD for 50% of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to
increase ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015
runboard. The school trippers have increased ridership slightly, but this requires a great deal of staff
time. Ridership continues to be a challenge. Recommendation to discontinue the Call-n-Ride has
been placed in the Winter 2016 Service Recommendation.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker provided a cost share with the RTD for 50%
of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
In August 2016, a school trip was set up that is showing positive results. The impacts of this
change on ridership will be reported in the next quarterly report.

Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2016. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2015.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The 2015 goal remained at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. The 2016 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
For the 2nd Quarter of 2016, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Denver had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. Transdev (formerly Veolia) had .0007 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding.
The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2016, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 2nd Quarter 2016: the complaints in this category increased 58.4% compared to
the same period in 2015. Due to on-going operator shortages at both RTD and the private contractors,
a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number of passengers
experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 7.10
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 4.48 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.3% compared to the same period
in 2015. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible

Packet Pg. 67

1.C.7

passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 5.046 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 5.32 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 6.9% compared to the same period
in 2015. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving on-time
performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2016 is 10.64 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 11.42
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 19.4% compared
to the same period in 2015. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
4.08 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.06 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.6% compared to the
same period in 2015. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 10.72 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2015 was 11.35 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 22.9% compared to the same
period in 2015. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 0.20 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2015 was 0.27 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 41.3% compared to the same
period in 2015. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 1.34 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 0.95 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 7.9% compared
to the same period in 2015. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 68

1.C.7

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
8.69 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 8.06 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 31.0% compared to
the same period in 2015. The recent high turnover of operators has resulted in an increase in new
operators on routes. This in turn has contributed to the higher numbers in this category. The combined
efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2016 is 0.51
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 0.39 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 2nd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 2.1%
compared to the same period in 2015. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (77 of the total 2,038 = 3.8%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 11.26 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2015 was 11.03 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station and Commuter Rail Platform Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail and commuter rail 11platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the
estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests
made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations
other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection
program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law
enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
