### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Change

Gina Callahan, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, noted that the proposed Winter 2016-2017 Service Changes were outlined in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  She reminded the Board that these were not for approval.  Staff wanted the Board to be aware of the proposed changes prior to the public hearings.  She said Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, was with her to answer any questions.

Director Francone pointed out that there are recommendations for service reductions in Jefferson County.  She asked staff to provide further details about the proposed changes.  Jessie Carter stated one of the changes was the proposed W Line service reduction.  He explained the reduction would establish 15 minute headways similar to the other light rail lines.  He said boarding per hour for the W Line average around 72 while our other light rail lines are in the 120 to 130 range so the current headways are not justified.

Director Francone indicated she was specifically concerned about the cancellation of Route 116L.  Jessie Carter explained that in 2013 with the launch of the W Line certain bus service was cancelled; however, it was determined that there were a number of trips that then took much longer than anticipated so Route 116L was introduced.  Jessie Carter pointed out that Route 116L is duplicated by several services, thus the ridership for those routes is being cannibalized.  He noted ridership on Route 116L is very low.  Director Francone asked to discuss the cancellation offline.

Director Lubow asked if the changes would go into effect in January.  She thought that Route L was supposed to be having some changes but commented that they were not included in these recommendations.  Jessie Carter indicated staff anticipates the proposed Winter 2016-2017 service changes going into effect in December or January.  He said the Route L changes Director Lubow was referencing were actually part of the fall runboard that has not yet occurred, but staff would notify the Board before they take effect.

Director Bagley wondered why the W Line originally had 7.5 minute headways when compared to the other lines that were at 15 minutes.  Jessie Carter stated that Lakewood and the other municipalities were originally promised that there would be 5 minute headways; however, he reiterated that ridership does not support the current headways which is why staff is recommending the change.

Director Bagley commented that with the current budget shortfalls, he is pleased to see staff being prudent and recommending service changes that result in a $1.6 million savings.

Director Sisk said he agrees with Director Bagley’s comments and really applauds the savings.  He asked staff to make sure they are proactive in communicating with our constituents about alternative service options, especially with the changes to the RockiesRide services.

Director Menten inquired if discontinuing Route 89 would impact anyone’s access to Access-a-Ride.  Jessie Carter stated staff had not done an analysis but would get back to the Board with that information.  He pointed out that this route has a very high subsidy per boarding.  Director Menten recognized that it might have a high subsidy but it would be an issue if cancelling the route impacted someone’s ability to use Access-a-Ride.

Director Solano shared that he had been traveling between Commerce City and Parker recently and pointed out that Route 483 only had service during the a.m. peak hours.  He stated getting to Parker is like pulling teeth.  Jessie Carter indicated that Route 483 is a new route that has service during a.m. and p.m. peak hours.  He shared that the route is performing better than expected but ridership does not currently justify mid-day or weekend service.  He said this is something staff hopes the route will grow into.

##### a. Winter 2016

#### 2. ADA Expert First Annual Report

Gina Callahan reminded the Board that this report was required as part of the settlement agreement that was reached with the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition as it related to individuals with mobility aids having equal access to fixed-route buses.  She noted the report was included in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  She thanked Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Service, and Alice Osner, General Superintendent of Transportation, for the tremendous amount of work they did in helping with this report.

There were no questions from the Board.

#### 3. 2016 2nd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route Report

Gina Callahan indicated the report was included in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. She stated this item will be discussed further in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee.

There were no questions from the Board.

##### a. CS Monitoring Summary Report Q2 2016

##### b. Quarterly Performance Stats 2016

#### 4. 2016 2nd Quarter Access-a-Ride/Cab Report

Gina Callahan indicted the report was included in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Anderson expressed that one issue facing Access-a-Ride users is how trips are handled when the driver does not show up and the trip is rescheduled.  Specifically, she received a complaint from a woman who needed to get to work.  When another driver was sent, Access-a-Ride drove right past her place of employment to take another passenger to adult daycare.  She believes priority should be given to passengers trying to get to work.  Carolyn Conover stated it was difficult to understand how the scheduling software works when a trip needs to be fit in to something already scheduled.

Director Deadwyler stated that a lot of our passengers with disabilities do not call to report issues with their drivers because staff does not log the issues.  She said that an elderly couple was left all day with no one to pick them up.  She asked that the Dispatch Center’s process be reviewed and updated.  She remarked that she too uses Access-a-Ride and has had the same issues.

Director Folska said she appreciates the challenge to provide this type of door to door service, but stated this might be a more appropriate relationship to have with Uber or Lyft.  She agreed that the system for Dispatch and Planning are not good and asked Auditing to review those processes for improvement or streamlining.

Director Solano said the call center should be monitored for accuracy and efficiency.  He stated that the hold time gap should be closed so that the riders can get their ride and get going.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated there are two different systems involved.  The Telephone Information Center (TIC) accepts all type of customer calls, the other call center is for Access-a-Ride.  As Gina Callahan previously mentioned, Customer Care records and monitors all calls.

Carolyn Conover indicated the report was included in the September 20, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  She stated this is a new report that will be included in the quarterly updates and it includes statistics through the second quarter of 2016.

There were no questions from the Board.

#### 7. 2016 2nd Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis

Gina Callahan commented that this report broke down the various customer experiences and included complaint analysis.  She indicated some of the data from the video tapes has not been as good, but staff hopes with improvements they can be used for coaching and training.  Carolyn Conover noted the results still show the impact of the operator shortages with a high number of complaints related to buses not showing up, being late, someone got passed up, etc.  She indicated these issues were improving but it is still a challenge to get operators.

Director Francone asked if there was a way to identify complaints by District, specifically for District N.  Carolyn Conover said she would work with customer care to determine the best way to organize the information.  She stated the complaints could be sorted by route but she was unsure if it could be pulled by location.

#### 8. 2nd Quarter 2016 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

Director Solano commented that fare evasion is listed as 1.6% on this report, but he feels it is much higher.  He said he is never asked for his pass on the light rail and thinks RTD is losing money.

General Manager Genova stated the information in the report is based on fare inspectors and plain clothes officers.  Staff is using current resources to increase peak service inspections.

Director Walker said in his experience on light rail, almost everyone has a ticket.  He stated that the fare inspectors often go from one end of the train to the other checking fares without stopping to write a ticket.

Director Deadwyler noted the complaints against security were not listed in the report.  She asked for the number of constituents who complain about how they are treated by RTD Security as she thinks the complaints are numerous.  She added that the contractor who provides security services on the rail lines are not getting the same training that the RTD officers are receiving which needs to be addressed.

Director Anderson remarked it was astonishing that 700,000 patrons were checked for fares.  She said statistically, RTD is doing well and she is okay with the system as it is because there are undercover officers who ride the rails.

### D. Other Matters

Director Folska indicated she attended the APTA Annual Conference in Los Angeles last week and it was the first time she was able to ride the train from downtown to Santa Monica.  She said the train had a recording which reminded passengers to tap on and tap off and recommended that RTD provide the same type of announcements.

Director Solano added he too attended the APTA Annual Conference and the L.A. Metro system has a turn style at each exit which also forced people to tap their cards.  He said L.A. is doing things right and RTD should learn from them.

Director Francone commented that the APTA Annual Conference had sessions devoted to transit Board Directors.  She said most sessions are fairly technical, but she was happy that there were sessions of interest to her as a Director which covered ADA compliance as well as first and last mile issues.

Director Anderson agreed that RTD could use the recorded reminder on the trains for the local college students so that staff can gather accurate ridership figures.

Committee Vice-Chair Walker said the APTA Conference theme this year was how to integrate technology with transportation.  He added that one of the liveliest sessions at the conference covered affordable housing and overall, it was a very interesting convention.

### F. Adjourn
