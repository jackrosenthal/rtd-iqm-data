B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates, Inc
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, remarked that his written report was
included in the Government Relations board packet. He noted that the
Metro Mayors would meet tomorrow, and that there may be some
interesting conversations from that meeting that he would report to the
Board next month.
Committee Chair Walker thanked Mr. Sherman for his local update and
moved to the state update.

• State Update - Brandeberry Mckenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry-McKenna (BBMK), stated that the end of
the legislative session was five weeks away. She said that there was an
extended debate the previous week in the House on the bipartisan
transportation package. The transportation bill is, as stated in BBMK’s
report, very substantive and stands to change significantly having moved to
the second chamber. The bill has to go through two additional committees,
and BBMK predicts that there will be a number of amendments proposed in
the Senate Transportation Committee before moving on to the Finance
Committee, where the bill will live or die. If the bill does continue past the
Finance Committee, BBMK speculates that it is very likely that it will end up
in a conference committee and will require significant compromises. As the
legislative session comes to a close, all of the big items are still unfinished,
including the budget. The long appropriations bill has left the Senate and is
now in the House, the Transportation Bill has left the House and is now in

Director Deadwyler was absent.

the Senate and there is also the hospital provider fee bill. She said there is a
lot left to be done at the end of the session, and other transportation bills
introduced have gone by the wayside. She noted that everyone in
transportation is trying to work through the bigger bill, which is HB17-1242
(HB1242).

Ms. Brandeberry stated that HB1242 is a referred measure to increase the
sales tax statewide. She said the sales tax increase would generate $700
million and $300+ million would be dedicated to the Colorado Department
of Transportation (CDOT) to bond for infrastructure. She stated the
remaining funds would flow back to the local jurisdictions to use as they see
fit.
Director Francone asked whether a portion of the sales tax revenue
generated by HB1242 would go to CDOT, which has an appointed Board, to
prioritize projects.
Ms. Brandeberry commented that CDOT has a list of how they prioritize
projects and the funds would be applied to the current process.
Director Francone questioned whether that process would usurp the RTD
Board’s authority to set policy and to prioritize rail and bus projects.
Ms. Brandeberry remarked that half of the money would be reserved for
CDOT. The remaining funds would not flow to RTD directly but would be
given to the local governments, and RTD can partner with them to prioritize
projects.
General Manager Genova stated that the RTD Board has discretion over
anything that impacts RTD.
Director Anderson noted that the metro region does the planning for
transportation and it is important for RTD to be a part of that process. She
inquired about the hospital provider fee and if there has been any movement
in that bill. She remarked that, if the fee is removed from state revenue
calculations under the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR), there would be more
money for transportation and education.
Ms. Brandeberry stated that there is a Senate bill which was introduced by
Senator Sonnenberg that would cut the base spending by $670 million.
That amount would be offset by an enterprise mechanism for the hospital
provider fee. It would also capture some of the SB228 money that is
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked about the initiative bill. She noted that she had not
heard anything mentioned about the possibility under its terms to use some
of the funds to finish the rail corridors.

6.A

dedicated for transportation, and that money could be issued for Certificates
of Participation (COP) for infrastructure. Because SB228 was designed as
two-thirds for transportation and one-third for capital, there is a potential for
additional capital projects to go towards COP’s and an additional piece that
funds rural schools. If the Sonnenberg bill passes the Senate, she said it
would change significantly in the House.

Ms. Brandeberry indicated that a bipartisan urban renewal bill was
introduced the previous day. She said the bill cleans up and clarifies some
applicability issues that arose two years earlier. She stated another bill is
expected to be introduced that deals with downtown development
authorities.
Director Folska stated that there are a lot of numbers being provided, but
CDOT needs $9 billion to finish their projects and FasTracks needs $2.2
billion. She asked how $700 million would get to the $11 billion needed in
the near term.
Ms. Brandeberry commented that, if the sales tax were increased to the
level proposed in HB1242, it would generate $604 million a year for
transportation. She stated that $375 million would be allocated for CDOT to
leverage up to $3.5 billion in bond packages for capital projects. Of the
remaining funds, 70% would be allocated to cities and counties to follow
the existing distributions in current law and a portion of the remaining funds
would be allocated to a new multi-modal transportation options fund.
Director Folska asked if people in the northwest corridor could then bond to
raise enough funds to finish the northwest rail line.
Ms. Brandeberry noted that they could use the money how they wanted.
General Manager Genova stated that nothing would prevent local
jurisdictions from pooling their funds, but they would have to determine if
doing so is practical and would need to know the exact dollar amount.
Director Menten inquired about transportation initiatives that have been filed,
the amount of tax revenue they would raise, and a brief summarization of
each.
Mr. Sherman commented that there are five that have been filed to date. He
noted that two are based on a $.005 sales tax increase with a 20-year
sunset provision that would generate $566 million and contemplate $150
million from the state general fund. The distribution would also follow close

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Broom asked if there were any urban renewal bills under
consideration.

6.A

to the distribution listed in HB1242. He stated that two other initiatives are
based on $.006 percent increase that would raise $685 million. The main
difference between the $.005 and $.006 is that $.006 does not
contemplate money coming from the state general fund. He said the fifth
initiative was based on a full cent increase and that it will not progress
forward.

Ms. Brandeberry stated that she would provide the RTD Board with the list
that has been filed along with the schedule for the Title Board as it will
cover every measure filed, not just those for transportation. She noted that
the effort to pass HB1242 has been serious.
Director Sisk inquired about SB17-153 (SB153). He noted that it has
potential for RTD and asked why RTD is not supporting it along with CDOT.
He stated that SB153 would provide rail service up and down the I-25
corridor and would be a great way to have cooperation with CDOT because
an RTD Board Member would sit on that commission.
Ms. Brandeberry noted that SB153 is up for committee next week in the
House. She stated that she thinks it will pass, regardless of whether RTD
vocalizes its support for it.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, stated that three weeks earlier the General
Manager, members of the Board, and Sherry Ellebracht, RTD’s Government
Relations Officer, traveled to Washington, D.C., to attend the APTA
Legislative Conference. He noted that those who attended the conference
had very productive visits and were able to meet with the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA), the state delegation, and several House and Senate
committees to provide updates for the University of Colorado A Line, G Line,
and appropriation requests for fiscal years 2017/2018. He added that the
Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing (RRIF) loan was discussed
as well as the $28 million collateral refund that RTD is working to get
refunded. He noted that the federal government is still operating under a
continuing resolution for fiscal year 2017. If the continuing resolution is
continued through the end of the fiscal year, which would end on September
30th, RTD’s request of $167 million will not materialize and would instead be
$150 million, which was the funding level for the previous fiscal year.
Squire Patton Boggs hopes that the government can find a way by April 28th
to finish the appropriations bills for the current year. He commented that
the House is optimistic but the Senate has been caught up this week with
the Supreme Court nomination process.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked what other entities besides the Independence
Institute have filed initiatives.

6.A

Director Folska asked how the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) would be
impacted, if at all.
Mr. Dino commented that there should not be an impact to SERE as the
project was fully funded in the previous fiscal year.
General Manager Genova added that RTD had already received the funds so
that extension is in good shape.
Director Menten noted that Congressman Perlmutter commented about the
opening of the G line and a possible Plan B. She asked what his impression
of RTD’s Plan B was.
General Manager Genova stated that Congressman Perlmutter’s Plan B
would be to do something different on the at-grade crossings. He added
that he would have an update in the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee with positive news.
Committee Chair Walker remarked that the City and County of Denver is
going out for a general obligation (GO) bond for $600 million and a large part
of that would go towards mobility and transit. He asked if there are other
initiatives similar to that in the metro area.
Ms. Bradeberry stated that she is not aware of any in the metro area. She
noted that Grand Junction and Mesa County are considering doing
something for mobility on the western slope.
Mr. Sherman said that everyone is waiting to see what happens with
HB1242 first.
Director Francone said part of the GO bond is based on Denver’s Transit
Moves draft report, which came out recently.

Packet Pg. 9

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Dino added that five members of the House have signed off on RTD’s
2018 appropriations request, including Congressman Ken Buck from the 4th
Congressional District. He remarked that Congressman Jared Polis was
heated in his advocacy for the Northwest Rail and wanted it completed as
soon as possible. He noted that the Secretary of Transportation, Elaine
Chao, indicated that the administration may publish an infrastructure
package or proposal in May. Lastly, Mr. Dino stated that the President
published his budget, which included a 13% cut to the Department of
Transportation. Two of the programs that would be eliminated would be the
New Starts and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery
(TIGER) Grants.

B. CAC

• Citizens Advisory Committee
Ken Claussen, Citizen’s Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, asked for all of
the CAC to raise their hands to be recognized. He stated that the CAC
concluded their meetings with Board members last week. He said that it
was too soon to compile a comprehensive report; but stated that the CAC
would provide a complete written summary to RTD after their meeting in
April. He emphasized that this report will include common themes and
takeaways from all the meetings. Mr. Cluassen said most of the Board
members see value in the CAC but some Board members had a lack of
clarity to what the CAC’s role is. He said that there were a lot of
discussions regarding who is responsible for engaging the committee. He
stated that the consensus is that the Administration is responsible for
identifying ways that the CAC can assist the agency. Mr. Claussen affirmed
that General Manager Genova would be attending the CAC April work
session.
He closed by saying that there some positive first steps were made from the
meetings.
Director Solano asked if he could address a Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC) concern that he had. Committee Chair Lubow asked if he
could please present his concern during the Other Matters portion of the
agenda.

C. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements
Contract
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to execute the contract for Wagon Road
Packet Pg. 12

Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements with T-Bone Construction, Inc.,
in the dollar amount of $1,270,874.94. Funding of this action is included in
the 2017 Adopted Budget.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 18, 2017
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, introduced Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Chief Engineer
for Capital Programs, and Cory Granrud, Manager of Park -nRide Design.
Ms. Vishwakarma described the Wagon Road Park -n- Ride as
one of the oldest in the District. She said her team wants to
rehab the development all at one time with a minimal
inconvenience to RTD passengers.
She stated that, for this particular project, her division worked
with other RTD departments to lay out a very careful phasing
plan and the minimal use of parking space during the project.
She stated that the design has been done in-house and she
recognized them. She said the construction is planned to last
approximately 180 days and that the bid they received is
lower than the internal cost estimates. Ms. Vishwakarma
asked Mr. Granrud to give an overview of the project.
Mr. Granrud stated that the design engineers have been
working on the plans for the face lift for a couple of years. He
said remodel will include refurbishing the pavilion, installing
new benches, upgrading the lighting and screening, and as
well as ADA upgrades which will make it easier to maneuver
through the complex. He stated that there will be some
realignment to the Kiss -n- Ride area to make it better. He
said the contractor will be installing conduit for future fiber
optic connectivity to link Wagon Road’s Park -n- Ride’s
electronic devices to RTD’s network at District Shops through
CDOT’s backbone along I-25. He went on to say that RTD
received three bids and they were all competitive, but our
preference is T-Bone Construction. He said that T-Bone
Construction has done work for RTD in the past and the team
is requesting the bid get awarded to them.
Director Archuleta asked where the Park -n- Ride is located.
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

6.B

Mr. Granrud stated that it is in the vicinity of 120th and I-25.
Director Broom asked whether they looked at making changes
to the driver relief area, did the RTD team considered putting
in public restrooms.

Director Broom stated that he would like the Board to look at
the bathroom policy in the future to see if it makes sense to
provide more public restrooms.
Chair Hoy said he uses this facility all the time. He stated that
he noticed that the pedestrian navigation is not the best. He
spoke of how people are making their own pathways to get
from point A to point B easier. Chair Hoy stressed that he can
only imagine that people with disabilities have a hard time
walking through there. He said he is hoping that the planning
team will look closely at the pedestrian usage.
Mr. Granrud said his team can look at the traffic patterns to
see what the pedestrians are doing. Mr. Stopplecamp echoed
Mr. Granrud and stated that they will look at the patterns. He
said the biggest challenge is that people like to take short
cuts, which RTD does not encourage because of safety issues.
Chair Hoy offered to meet the team at the Park -n- Ride to
discuss his concerns.
Chair Hoy offered the team at the Park -n- Ride to discuss the
issues he has concerns with.
Director Folska asked Mr. Stopplecamp why RTD does not
have any public restrooms that are unmanned.
Mr. Stopplecamp said that there are two concerns with public
restrooms, one being security and the other is maintenance.
He stated that Denver Union Station and Civic Center are both
manned and have security along with janitorial services. He
said it takes a lot of resources to keep the restrooms available
to the public.

Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Stopplecamp replied that RTD’s current policy does not
allow for public restrooms if the facility is not manned. He also
said that the original driver’s kiosk is not in good condition and
needs to be demolished and that a new facility needs to be
built for RTD drivers.

6.B

He said the Board and senior management have decided in the
past not to offer public restrooms. He stated that the deciding
factor is whether or not to continuously staff restrooms.

Director Folska asked about the pedestrian-orientated
developments, which includes the Park -n- Ride facilities.
Director Folska said that Chair Hoy is correct about the ease of
walkways at the Park -n- Ride facilities. She stated that it
would be helpful if the planning committee would try and walk
through projects blindfolded to get a sense of the layout; and
offered to assist.
Director Mahalik asked what the construction time span is for
the Wagon Road project.
Mr. Granrud said the project will last 180 days.
Director Solano asked if this project would create more parking
spaces.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that at the Wagon Road property has
no room to expand. He said by making the facility more
pedestrian friendly they are losing some parking spots.
Director Lubow stated that six months is a long time; and
asked how disruptions would be minimized.
Mr. Granrud replied that their team has designed three
different phases of the project with a plan to shuffle the buses
around to minimize any safety issues.
Director Lubow asked if some parking spaces will be
unavailable during the construction.
Mr. Granrud stated that there are some ADA parking spots are
near the Park -n- Ride that may be shifted but will still be
available.
Mr. Stopplecamp explained that most of the work will take
place on the plaza sidewalks and at the drivers kiosk rather
than the parking facility.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova stated that public restrooms relies on
management and maintenance of the facilities.

6.B

Director Williams asked if the Park -n- Ride was across from
the Cracker Barrel and asked what was being built behind the
Park -n- Ride.
A member of the audience stated the new structure is the
Adams County Human Service building.

History
• 2004: FasTracks plan included a circulator for downtown to
complement and relieve peak period demands on the mall shuttle
• 2005: Denver’s Downtown Multimodal Access Plan defined the
18th/19th Street Alignment and recommended transit priority
measures (dedicated lanes)
• 2006 – 2014: Further planning and design to define the route, stop
locations and transit priority measures (separate stops, bus bulbs,
shared HOV lane)
• 2014: Free MetroRide opens providing weekday peak period service
every 6-9 minutes between DUS and Civic Center
• 2016: DRCOG grant funded an expansion of service allowing for
extended peak periods and 4-6 minute headways
Current Operations
• Fare-free service with multiple door boarding
• Uniquely branded 60 foot low – floor articulated buses
• Shared bus/bike/HOV lane on 19th Street
• Bus bulbs on 18th Street between Curtis and Wynkoop
• Dedicated and enhanced stops
• Simple, frequent service – no schedule required
• Service: Monday – Friday: 5:00am – 9:00am; 2:30pm – 6:30pm
• Headways: 4-6 minutes
• 3,000 boardings a day
Need for Improvement
• Goal of the Free MetroRide is to provide faster service through
downtown than the Free MallRide
• With increased congestion, the Free MetroRide is often no faster or
more reliable than Free MallRide especially during the PM peak
• With 2 additional FasTracks commuter rail lines coming on board by
2018 (G Line and N Line), even greater need to circulate those
passengers and relieve pressure from the mall shuttle
Funding
• The capital project was completed significantly under budget due to
cost savings from the bus purchase
• $1.5 million of the initial project funding has been reserved in the
FasTracks APE for future improvements

Ms. Bell stated that she was the Manager of the Free Ride program from
2012-2014. She said that her team is currently working with the City and
County of Denver to improve the travel time and reliability of the program.
Ms. Bell provided the following update.

6.B

Anticipated Outcomes
• The potential for additional dedicated space allows buses to operate
more reliably – not as constrained by congestion. This also decreases
bus travel time.
• Potential signal improvements prioritize buses – decreased travel time
and increased reliability.
• Potential separation of bike/bus facilities allow for both to operate
more efficiently/safely.
• Potential stop improvements decrease dwell time – decreasing overall
travel time.
Process/Schedule
• All potential improvements include modifications to Denver streets
and/or traffic signals
o More efficient to have the City lead the study and
implementation of these type of improvements
• RTD will provide $1.5 million to CCD to fund:
o Feasibility analysis AND
o Implementation of feasible improvements
• Spring/Summer 2017: Finalize IGA including RTD Board approval
• Fall 2017: Feasibility Analysis and Design
• 2018-2019: Additional Design and Implementation
Director Broom asked how long the DRCOG grant will cover the expansion
of services.
Ms. Bell stated that the grant is for three years and after that time RTD has
it budgeted to continue at those service levels.
Director Folska asked if the plan is to give the City and County of Denver
(CCD) $1.5 Million dollars and they would conduct the study of the lights.
Ms. Lacy stated that the 1.5 million would go towards the feasibility study
and to any improvements that RTD approves that would be beneficial to the
agency.
Director Folska asked if we are going to give them money to hire an outside
consultant will conduct a feasibility study.

Potential Improvements
• Bus Priority Signal and Queue Jump Analysis for the entire route
o Implement where feasible
• Traffic Signal Optimization study for the entire route
o Implement where feasible
• Transit-Only Lane on Broadway
o Will provide benefits for other RTD routes as well

6.B

Ms. Lacy stated that most of the study will be conducted by City and
County of Denver’s in-house traffic staff.
Director Anderson stated that she received some complaints about the
construction taking place west of Union Station.

Director Francone asked the amount of capital savings and where the
savings were placed.
Mr. Van Meter did not have the exact figure and said the remaining balance
went into the FasTracks general fund.
Director Francone asked if the $1.5 million would cover the study and
whatever improvements are agreed upon.
Mr. Van Meter confirmed that it would cover the study and only
improvements agreed upon.
Director Francone asked whether RTD could use the Denver Moves study
that came out last year to assist with any feasibility issues.
Mr. Van Meter said that he knew about the study; but stated it offered a
higher level look at transit. He said the new study is a more defined look at
the Free MetroRide, 15 and 15L, Flatiron Flyer, and other routes that use
Broadway and Civic Center.
Director Tisdale explained that he understands that the $1.5 million proposal
will cover the feasibility analysis conducted in-house and that it will be
based off a great amount of work that RTD has already conducted. He
stated the only expenses that can be incurred are ones that have been
agreed upon.
Director Lubow asked Ms. Bell how much money RTD and O&M will put
towards the Free MetroRide once the DRCOG monies have been exhausted.
Ms. Lacy said she will follow up with a correct figure.
Director Lubow asked if Denver has put any money into this study and if
other municipalities have put money into similar feasibility studies.
Mr. Van Meter stated that Denver and other municipalities offer a great
amount of staff time to assist with projects. He stated that Denver is

Ms. Lacy stated that the construction detour is hindering the ridership of the
Free Metro Ride.

6.B

committed to making transit a priority over roadways. He also stated that
the City of Boulder offers the same type of assistance and investment into
these projects.
Director Lubow is looking very carefully at FasTracks funding because she
wants to fund the uncomplete corridors. She stated that she believes that
this is best for the district. She stressed that she will be voting yes on this
recommendation action.

• FasTracks Program Management Update
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that he wanted to bring the Board up to speed on
how his department is managing the FasTracks program. He stated that he
wants to come back to the Board next month to request funding to extend
some current contracts. He said that funding is already built into the annual
program evaluation. He gave an overview of the projects scheduled through
2019.
Mr. Stopplecamp explained the FasTracks program employed nearly 300
people at its peak; 80 were employed by RTD and the other 200 were
consultants. He said the people who work on FasTracks brought different
skill sets to the table and that the consultants transitioned from one
FasTrack program to another. He said that every year the project managers
plan out what support they need for their projects and then they meet with
the partners to see what they can do to accommodate RTD’s needs. He
said the consultants are based off projects, on a year-to-year basis. The
level and nature of assignments change each year depending on the work to
be done in that year.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that the FasTrack consultants assist with different
facets of the program. There are FasTrack employees working on senior
management and overall program oversight, construction and planning
project managers, and core staff with different disciplines. He stated that
RTD also hires for short term roles, on an interim basis. Mr. Stopplecamp
gave an overview of the three consulting firms working on FasTracks.

Director Menten asked how many employees work in the FasTracks
department.

Director Lubow asked, if any of the unfinished corridors get funded, how
they would fit in to the scheme of the other projects.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that RTD cannot start building any projects until a
the environmental process and design is completed, at which point the
agency can transition into construction. He stated Triunity Hill is on
contract to augment our staff. He explained that Mr. Van Meter’s staff
would work on the planning side, Ms. Vishwakarma would lead on the
engineering and construction side of the project and any gaps in between,
and RTD would rely on Triunity Hill to assist.

E. Other Matters
Director Solano asked Barbara McManus to pass out a map of the bus alterations
that were made to accommodate a request by the Colorado Cross-Disability
Coalition (CCDC). Director Solano said that he met with a CCDC advocate, who
stated an alteration was a good idea but still does not accommodate two wheel
chairs. Director Solano said that the advocate was concerned the configuration
was a safety issue, because the driver would not be able to get through the aisle in
an emergency. Director Solano also mentioned that the advocate for CCDC said
that her group was invited to give feedback on the changes but none of them were
implemented.
Director Lubow replied by saying that Director Solano’s concern would be better
answered by someone from Bus Operations.
Director Anderson said that she was the Chair the Operations and Customer
Service Committee and she would be happy to answer Director Solano’s question.
She stated that the Operations Committee would discuss the issue during their next
meeting.
General Manager Genova gave an update on his meeting in Washington D.C. on
April 3, 2017.
He said that his team had provided updates to the Federal Railroad Administration
(FDA) on the A and B Lines and there was a lot of progress to report. He reminded
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Stopplecamp replied that there are 85 dedicated RTD employees and
100 full time equivalent positions shared among 200 consultants.

6.B

General Manager Genova explained that their last meeting with the FRA,
approximately a month ago, RTD indicated that the process of adding buffer time
and how RTD may have to go back to the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and
amend the application. He said that last month his team reported back to FRA that
RTD would not be able to finish that process by April 30, 2017. He stated that
this week RTD will be filing three petitions with the FRA. He stated that the first
petition is to extend the date to the University of Colorado A Line waiver to more
indefinite timeline until the PUC process. He said the second petition would be a
request to remove the B Line from the waiver altogether and that the third petition
would allow RTD to get limited waiver to do testing on the G Line. He stated that
he feels positive in moving forward.
Mr. Stopplecamp said that RTD has a lot of work to back up its claims and requests
for the waivers.
General Manager Genova stated that RTD needs to work closely with the PUC to
ensure their confidence with this approach and allow the Agency to move forward
with an amended application.
Director Folska offered kudos to General Manager Genova and his staff for
continually nurturing RTD’s relationship with the FRA. Director Folska asked an
update on the five-part plan.
Mr. Stopplecamp stated that phases 1-4 are 90% done and phase 5 still needs to
be completed.
Director Anderson asked if the information General Manager Genova is sharing is
for public consumption.
General Manager Genova stated that the information is public. He asked the Board
to consider that there is still some time before final completion but he wanted to
demonstrate that progress has been made.

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 4, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the Board that last year the FRA approved a five-part implementation plan and was
happy to report that the majority of the five-part plan has been implemented. He
stated that his team was able to demonstrate the progress for the at-grade crossing
design warning times and constant warning times. He said that those two things
were the primary topic of the meeting. General Manager Genova stated that RTD
has been working on a methodology where they are looking at the calculations of
that design warning time and the calculations towards adding some buffer time. He
said that the FRA is in agreement with the methodology that was presented and
over the next couple weeks they will be finalizing implementation. He stated that
after much talk about the progress made they talked about the status of the waiver
set to expire April 30, 2017.

6.B

Henry Stopplecamp stressed that RTD still needs to meet with PUC first, he
suggested that the Board wait to share information until they can provide a
complete update at the next committee meeting.
Chair Hoy reminded the Board that there is not a completion date.

Director Lubow asked if General Manager Genova had a PowerPoint presentation he
could share with the Board and when they could expect a lessons learned
presentation.
General Manager Genova stated that his team is still working on that document and
that it will cover the design, build, and commissioning phase. He said he will give
the Board an executive summary soon.

B. Recommended Actions

• 2018 Performance Measures Adoption
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopts the attached 2018 Performance
Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2018, there are 41
proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the
same number as in 2017.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the April 18,
2017 Board Meeting.
Director Broom seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, presented the 2018
recommendations for agency performance measures. She
spoke about several specific goals:
 Goal 2.1, regarding prompt responses to graffiti
complaints. She stated the recommendation was to
raise the threshold to fewer than 3 complaints per
month. She said that the current goal of fewer than 1.5
complaints per month was unreasonably low
considering that the linear footage of graffiti
Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Archuleta was absent. Director Folska participated via phone.





vulnerability has nearly doubled due to the addition of
new rail corridors.
Goal 3.1, regarding system-wide on-time performance.
She said the recommendation was to lower the
performance benchmarks for local on-time bus service
from 88% to 86% and for regional service from 94% to
92%. She stated that the addition of GPS devices on
the buses has enabled the collection of far more
accurate data, with 18,000 points of electronic data
collected daily compared with 240 trips observed on a
daily basis previously. She said the data shows that
local bus service on-time is between 83% and 86%
currently. She said that, based on the last two years
collection data, the current goal of 88% on-time service
cannot be met.
6.2, regarding ridership. She said the overall ridership
goal would be established through the 2018 budget
process.

Director Francone asked why the goal of 1.5 or fewer graffiti
complaints per month is unreasonably low.
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital
Programs, said that the agency barely meets the 1.5 or fewer
complaints per month benchmark currently and that RTD
facilities and equipment are subject to several hundred graffiti
hits per week. He said the 1.5 benchmark is very tight,
especially in W Line corridor, and said more will occur along
the I-225 corridor. He said the benchmark was set at 2
complaints or fewer in 2006.
Director Francone said that the doubling of the benchmark
makes sense.
Mr. Stopplecamp noted that the staff has not doubled though
the length of the corridors has.
Director Francone said Bus Operations had previously reported
that an additional $2 million would be needed to meet the 86%
on-time performance benchmark.
Ms. McKillop responded that even with an additional $2 million
the current lack of drivers causes problems for on-time
performance.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said
that prior to the addition of automatic passenger counters
(APC) to buses, service monitors and street supervisors would
be stationed on street corners, observing buses driving by, in
order to gather on-time performance data. He said that the
GPS-based APCs were added in 2011 and that those devices
report where the buses are and at what time. He said that the
manual counts, which only registered 200 to 300 data points
per day, have been phased out and that measured on-time
performance went from 89% to 83% when the switch was
made to APC-generated data. He stated that the local service
on-time performance did not actually drop by 6%, but rather
the APCs presented a more realistic picture of actual
performance. He said the question is whether an additional $2
million can help the agency reach the 86% local on-time
performance target. He briefly discussed service planning and
presented a scenario in which the agency would have to add
an additional bus to a trip in order to maintain schedule
consistency and rider expectations.
Director Francone said that certain service contractors have
experienced higher levels of complaints than RTD itself. She
asked whether there are sanctions in place for contractors that
are not meeting performance goals or whether the
underperformance of the contractors would be judged against
General Manager Genova’s performance.
Mr. Abel said that the agency is working on the issue. He said
in some cases the higher level reflects additional challenges on
the labor front in terms of lost service from operator shortages,
and in other cases the level is reflective of the routes operated
by the contractor and may be affected by detours on a given
route or a variety of other factors. He said the agency does
have some potential penalties and incentives at its disposal but
stated those have not taken effect because of a lack of
volatility.
Director Francone asked whether sanctions have been issued,
and Mr. Abel responded that some have been issued but noted
the issues are not prevalent.
Director Tisdale, speaking to goal 2.1, noted that risk for
graffiti has increased by 50% in terms of exposed walls, but
that the recommended benchmark has been doubled. He asked
whether there may be a middle number that would be suitable,
Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.C

6.C

because he felt the doubling of the current benchmark seemed
disproportional compared to the increase of risk exposure.

Director Tisdale said he wanted to make clear that he was not
trying to micromanage but rather wanted to understand the
rationale behind the benchmark increase.
Mr. Stopplecamp said he asked his staff to look at the number
of graffiti incidents and present a reasonable goal. He said the
benchmark has been the same since 2008 and that the agency
has been meeting the goal. He said several hundred graffiti
incidents occur each week that are never reported because
RTD employees quickly take care of them.
Director Tisdale, speaking to goal 3.1 said, said that the
reporting data quality improved by virtue of increasing the data
collection points. He said he would be inclined to set the
benchmark at whatever number staff proposed but stated that
it is the Board who approves the schedules. Speaking to Mr.
Abel’s planning scenario, he asked why the schedule could not
be changed to ensure a 100% on-time performance.
Mr. Abel responded that, from a customer standpoint,
frequency and convenience are two of the major drivers of
ridership. He said that a bus timetable that establishes
departure times at set points during the hour allows riders to
remember their own bus schedules. He said buses are generally
scheduled to depart at a certain time after every hour, but in
the event that traffic increases during the run time of that bus,
the agency is faced with one of two options: change to a onehour, five-minute schedule or try to operate on time but not
quite make it. He said customers appreciates regularity
Director Tisdale asked whether the lowering of the on-time
benchmark had been proposed previously and what the answer
was at that time.
Mr. Abel said that the recommendation had been made three
years earlier, when the agency first gathered meaningful data
from the APCs. He said the Board initially approved the change
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Stopplecamp said that Director Tisdale hit a good point. He
said the Eagle Project is being completed and additional Park-nRides and other facilities and structures that are subject to
graffiti are being erected. He said that the benchmark could be
set at 2 or whatever number the Board decides.

6.C

but politically the change did not appear to be in the public
interest.

Mr. Abel said that the estimate was calculated in 2016 and
does incorporate economic adjustments required for staffing to
meet that goal. He said that over the last several years during
service change process the agency has focused on improving
the poorly performing routes.
Director Lubow reiterated that performance has not changed
but that the real level of performance is evident from the
current data collection methods. She asked whether an 83%
on-time performance is typical among other agencies.
Mr. Abel said that reviews among peer agencies in Los
Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Diego, and Dallas show their
average on-time performance was 81.9%.
Director Broom said that the Directors had received a letter
from the Adams County Commissioners requesting an extra
bus stop and asked whether the on-time performance of that
route would be affected by adding the stop they requested.
Mr. Abel said he could not answer the question without looking
at the Route 48 schedule. He said that currently the bus may
take 40 minutes to make one circuit. He said the performance
would not be impacted if the stop adds 5 minutes to the
circuit. He said that, if the circuit were 55 minutes and the
stop took an additional 7 minutes, the on-time and financial
performance would be impacted.
Director Menten said the agency could find the $2 million
needed to pay for the service improvement. She said she was
disappointed that the standard had to be lowered but
recognized that the data collection is more accurate than
before. She said she would vote yes on the action but noted
that meeting agency-established performance goals affects the
General Manager’s performance payout.
Mr. Abel responded that the agency has not yet attained the
86% benchmark and is currently performing at 85.3%. He said

Director Anderson stated there was a cost to meet the
proposed 86% on-time benchmark. She said that, unless the
Board agreed to pay for that level of service, it did not make
sense to set the benchmark at that level.

6.C

that the benchmark was set at 86% in order to be realistic,
measurable, and attainable.
Director Menten said that the $2 million could come from
money that would otherwise be spent on development and said
the agency spends money outside of its core goals.

• Award of Mobile Ticketing Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute all documents necessary to award a contract for the new Mobile
Ticketing System to Masabi LLC, in an amount not to exceed $1,450,000.
This price includes the cost for period of performance of a base two-years
and three one-year options.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 18, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ms. McKillop said RTD has been working to provide mobile
ticketing and has, selected a recommended vendor from the
RFP process. She said the vendor will be providing second-tier
support for mobile ticketing, the first tier being RTD Customer
Care. She said that customers will be able to download a
mobile application (app) in order to purchase passes. She said
users of the app will have value stored on an account and will
be able to purchase day passes that will be valid on the day of
their purchase. She said that RTD will not responsible for the
back end of the service and that the vendor will be PCI

Director Anderson pointed out that the performance measures
under discussion are for 2018 and do not impact the 2017
goals for the General Manager.

compliant, will handle users’ credit card numbers, and will
track the value on the users’ accounts. She said the vendor will
also develop and maintain the app. She stated that the first
media offered via mobile ticketing will be day passes, with the
option to add limited additional media later on if the first phase
of the program goes well. She said the fixed implementation
costs for the program are $47,000, with an additional 2.25%
per transaction in the first year, 2% in the second year, and
lower transaction costs in subsequent years. She estimated
payment processing fees of approximately $120,000 per year,
which would be borne by RTD rather than passing the costs
the customer. She stated the recommended vendor, Masabi,
has been in existence since 2001 and in 2012 deployed the
app used by transit agencies in New Orleans, Boston, New
York, and Las Vegas. She stated that is has come to RTD’s
attention that Masabi and one of the other vendors involved in
the RFP process have become involved in patent litigation but
said that she felt comfortable at this point that RTD would be
protected from the litigation by way of the contracting process
Director Menten asked for the name of the other vendor
involved in the litigation.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said that the litigation is
between Bytemark and Masabi, which are two of the top halfdozen companies engaged in mobile ticketing.
Director Anderson said that she supports the program and has
spoken with managers of other agencies who have seen
increases in ridership, particularly among younger patrons,
upon the rollout of similar programs. She said she looks
forward to the increased ridership.
Director Broom asked whether there are other offsets from the
program aside from the additional ridership.
Ms. McKillop said that it is unclear what impact the program
will have on current sales of paper tickets and that she
anticipates an increase in day pass sales.
Director Broom asked how the app would compete with the
Smart Card.
Ms. McKillop said that, since the My Ride card has not been
implemented, there is no in-house competition. She said that
staff sees the service as an enhancement.

Director Williams asked if mobile ticketing would allow
someone to buy a ticket once the person has already boarded
the train or bus.

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said
that under the mobile ticketing program passengers could
technically purchase a ticket after boarding and that nothing on
the train or in the app that would prevent that. She said she
anticipated some problems and challenges with that capability
but noted that, for riders found aboard trains without tickets,
fare enforcement agents could force those riders to buy fare
media at that time or face citations. She said RTD is
implementing technology to show when a person purchases a
mobile ticket.
Director Tisdale said that he supports the program and wanted
to express his confidence in RTD legal staff’s ability to draft
language in the contract to protect agency from the ongoing
litigation.
Director Lubow asked whether RTD’s potential involvement in
the litigation would be a practical mess, even if the drafting of
the contract language were perfect.
Mr. Asphaug said that there have been internal discussions on
how to proceed and whether to postpone in instances such as
this. He said that vendors can be sued by patent trolls and that
those people are more likely to sue end users than legitimate
litigants in a dispute. He said the two vendors involved in the
litigation are among the top providers of services in their
industry and that it is unlikely that they would seek remedies
against the end-user. He said vendors would shoot themselves
in the foot by attacking potential clients. He said parties usually
come to an agreement but offered no guarantees that would
happen in this case, which is why protective contract language
would need to be put in place. He said another factor in
determining whether to proceed was that that the initial cash
outlay for the program is only $47,000. He said he felt it
would be appropriate for the Board to proceed and noted that
Masabi has implemented similar services in other large cities.
Packet Pg. 34

Ms. McKillop said that technologies exist that would prevent
patrons from purchasing tickets after they have boarded the
train.

6.C

Director Lubow asked Mr. Asphaug if he could envision the
litigation causing difficulties for RTD.
Mr. Asphaug indicated that an injunction against Masabi could
bar RTD from implementing the program, in which case the
agency would have to wait until the lawsuit is settled before
proceeding.

Director Lubow asked how mobile ticketing would interact with
Smart Cards.
Ms. McKillop said the two programs are entirely separate. She
noted that the other option for the mobile ticketing program
would be to do nothing but stated RTD had no intention of
awarding to the bid second vendor or any of the other vendors.
She said that waiting for the litigation to conclude could take
years.
Director Sisk said that the program is exciting and has
experienced similar programs in other cities. He said he
understands the impact of the potential for litigation but said
that the program would never happen if the agency is afraid of
litigation. He said he would like to see more background
information about Masabi.
Director Menten said that an internet search shows that the
Masabi looks like a young company but was founded in 2001
and that their mobile app was released in 2012.
Ms. McKillop noted that the company had implemented
ticketing solutions prior 2012.
Director Francone noted that Ms. McKillop stated Masabi
would be second-tier support for customer questions and
issues. She asked whether RTD Customer Care would provide
first-tier service and asked how the program would impact their
operations.
Tonya Anderson said she did not know how the mobile
ticketing phone menu would work but stated that RTD would
be the first point of contact for service and questions. She said
that Customer Care’s call volume would increase but noted

Director Lubow asked whether such a scenario was taken into
account, and Mr. Asphaug confirmed that it had.

6.C

that a training program would be implemented. She was unsure
how many additional phone calls the program would generate.
Director Francone asked whether the implementation cost for
the program would cover additional types of fare media that
will be sold under the program in addition to day passes.

Director Solano said he supported the idea and asked whether
the program would push the agency any closer to offering
customer wi-fi service on buses and trains.
Ms. McKillop stated the mobile ticketing program did not
include wi-fi service.
Director Solano said that he understood but asked, if the
program becomes successful, whether it would be important to
add wi-fi service to allow patrons to purchase tickets using the
mobile app.
Ms. McKillop said that not many people used wi-fi during a
limited test program and instead relied on their own cellular
data. She said that wi-fi would be a good topic for a
presentation and would bring more information back to the
Board.
Director Deadwyler said she likes the program and thinks that
constituents would love it. She asked whether RTD is stuck
with Masabi as a vendor.
Ms. McKillop said that six vendors were reviewed during the
RFP process and that two were shortlisted. She said that
Masabi was best vendor from a technical and financial
standpoint, which is why the company had been recommended
to the Board. She said that from a litigation standpoint it would
make no sense to go to the second vendor, which is also
involved in the suit, and that the other RFP respondees were
judged not capable.
Director Deadwyler said that RTD was involved as a third party
in litigation some years prior and that she would hate to see

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

additional services would cost $300,000 and that the agency

added under the current recommended pricing.

the mobile ticketing service stop as a result of the legal
outcome.
Ms. McKillop said that she did not see the patent litigation as
being a risk to RTD and recalled that the litigation Director
Deadwyler referred to was in relation to a bankruptcy.

Ms. McKillop said that both Masabi and Bytemark are based in
England.
General Manager Genova said that technology changes rapidly
and that the beauty of the current project proposal is its low
implementation cost. He said that, even if RTD could not use
Masabi’s product in a year, he anticipated another vendor
would come into the market by that point. He said the question
of whether RTD will be implementing mobile ticketing is the
question he receives most.
Director Walker concurred that he is most frequently asked the
same question and asked whether other agencies that have
implemented mobile ticketing have experienced a reduction in
the amount of paper transactions.
Tonya Anderson said that question of reduced paper
transactions did not come up in talks with other agencies but
noted that the other agencies experienced an increase in
ridership and a shift in purchasing.
Director Folska said that a mobile app is something the agency
has envisioned happening but stated that, for the reason
General Manager Genova stated regarding other vendors
coming into the market, it may be best to wait and see. She
said that, because the Smart Card program is not yet stable,
she would feel more comfortable waiting to implement the
mobile ticketing program until after other pieces of RTD’s
technology are firmly grounded. She said she is troubled that
Masabi is based in England because the agency will need to
rely on the company for troubleshooting. She said the agency
has spent a lot of money installing ticketing machines on buses
and validators for trains. She stated that her constituents have
not contacted her about a mobile ticketing app, though she
said she is in support of the concept. She offered that RTD

Director Deadwyler asked whether a local company could
provide the mobile ticketing service and asked where the
vendors were located.

could sponsor a $25,000 contest to allow local vendors to
compete to provide a mobile ticketing app for the agency to
use.

Chair Hoy said he is concerned with fraud and envisioned
passengers waiting to see fare enforcement officers before
purchasing fares. He said he would be more comfortable
knowing that someone could not purchase a mobile ticket once
the person’s train is moving.
Ms. McKillop said that Portland, Oregon’s transit agency uses
technology to prevent riders from purchasing tickets after a
train has started moving but noted that such technology is
extremely expensive. She said that Portland’s technology is
part of their fare enforcement. She noted that patrons must
purchase a ticket prior to boarding a bus. She said that the
agency’s perspective is that a person found to have boarded a
train without at ticket would at least be paying when before
they would not have paid. She noted that citation revenue does
not flow back to RTD. As for fraud prevention, she noted the
mobile ticketing app will have security features and that one of
the reasons Masabi was chosen is that the company offers an
enforcement vehicle app for iPhones, which RTD fare
enforcement officers currently use. She said that RTD could
stop ticket purchasing once a train is in movement if the
agency is willing to pay enough for the technology
Chair Hoy asked why the 2.25% transaction fee should not be
collected from customers. He said that the agency currently
charges users a nominal fee for mobile parking.
Ms. McKillop said that the transaction fees could be collected
from customers but said that the thought process behind the
decision not to charge customers was to encourage people to
use the app.
Chair Hoy said the app could be deployed initially with the fee
being charged to customers and said the fee could be absorbed
by RTD if people are not using the app.
Director Francone said that she loves the idea of mobile
ticketing and has faith in the legal department to draft
appropriate language to protect RTD. However, she said that

• Approval to Enter into Agreements to Contribute Funding to the Colorado
Department of Transportation for the Mobility Choice Blueprint Technical
Consultant(s)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into any and all agreements required to provide $400,000 in Regional
Transportation District funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint
Study. RTD’s funds are to be used for the technical consultant(s) selected to
conduct the Study, in partnership with the Colorado Department of

been discussed in March and that he would answer any
questions the Board may have.

Director Solano said that he initially voted no but likes the
changes that have been made to the proposal. He said it is
unclear whether federal funds will be invested in transit and
that the agency must look to future because the presidential
administration can change. He said that a yes vote would yield
a better future.
Director Williams stated the first/last miles lead to RTD and
that the agency is the heart and backbone in the transit
system. She stated that any plan that involves first/last mile
involves RTD.
Director Francone said she spent hours researching the
proposal and thanked those who spent time speaking with her.
She said she voted no in September and remains a firm no
because the study lacks transparency. She said she had
objection to the substance of the study but stated the entire
process was developed in secret and continues to be in secret.
She said the study was not subject to sunshine law or financial
transparency. She said the study is predisposed to leave out
car drivers and that it is that this is probably illegal because of
the use of public funds to promote a ballot initiative. She said
that one of functions of the study is to promote 2018 ballot
initiative and that the organizers did not disclose that fact,
though conversations show that an initiative might still be on
the agenda.
Director Walker said that he would be supporting the study and
that the end users are RTD’s constituencies. He said that RTD
owes it to its customers to innovate, because it is in
everyone’s interest to improve mobility choices in the District.
Director Lubow said she has spent weeks studying the
proposal and said that it is a wonderful, necessary idea for the
three agencies whose responsibilities are to address

Chair Hoy said that, with a yes vote on the Mobility Choice
Blueprint, RTD has an opportunity for community commitment.
He stated that it is rare to see commitment among
government. He asked how transportation, technology, and
first last mile solutions will impact the agency in the future. He
said RTD has an opportunity to move the action forward.

transportation to discuss the impact of new technologies. She
said that RTD must have this discussion but noted that she has
too many questions to vote yes. She said she would be a
reluctant no vote because she is not satisfied that the Mobility
Choice Blueprint is the right vehicle. She said she was unsure
whether the pilot projects identified in the study would conflict
with RTD’s commitment to complete the unfinished corridors
and would not commit to any proposal that would do so. She
said the Mobility Choice Board also concerned her, in that she
did not know what purpose they or the executive director
would serve. She said these issues addressed by the study are
not going away and that RTD would need to tackle them. She
urged RTD staff to review the 20 prior studies conducted on
the same issues. She said that, if the study is approved, a task
force could be formed to report back to the RTD Board on the
study’s findings.
Director Anderson said that certain members of the RTD Board
have been studying transportation issues for years and
specifically named Directors Tisdale, Sisk, and Broom. She said
a former Mayor of Longmont, Leona Stoecker, was the lead on
transportation planning for the entire metropolitan region. She
stated that the input of private industry is needed in the study
because private companies provide jobs and social welfare. She
said that she served on the Jefferson County transportation
planning body for 30 years and on the board of Northwest
parkway and Jefferson County parkway. She said that not
everyone will be able to drive their own vehicle in the future
and that RTD needs a seat at the table to verify that everyone
involved is getting a fair shake. She said impacts to
transportation will happen sooner rather than later.
Director Tisdale said he likes the idea of being at the table and
supports the study. He also agreed with Director Francone’s
comments on transparency but did not see the issue of
transparency as being enough to stop RTD’s participation. He
echoed Director Anderson’s comments that RTD should trust
but verify in order to address transparency. He stated that a
new superstructure is being created and there is a question of
how large the structure should be. He questioned whether the
Mobility Choice Board would need 21 members or whether the
study would need an executive director or just a talented staff
person. He advised the Board that RTD is a mass transit
system and stated the agency is not obligated to look at
first/last mile solutions but should anyway in order to create a
cooperative solution. He urged the Board not to let the perfect

Director Menten said that RTD has a lot of available resources
that are already in place such as the Citizens Advisory
Committee. She said she does not want RTD to rush to be the
first to experiment. She stated that Director Lubow made an
excellent point in questioning the urgency of the study. She
said she believed the end goal of the study is a tax increase.
She stated that the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce
(DMCC) receives a substantial amount of public taxpayer
money paid in dues from the State of Colorado, RTD, and other
government bodies and that all taxpayers are therefore
shareholders in DMCC and should have a vote on how much
they are paying an executive director. She said that CDOT and

C. Updates

• Sales and Use Tax Forecast
Doug McLeod, Controller, introduced Dr. Robert McNown, Dr. Richard
Wobbekind, and Brian Lewandowski, economists from the University of
Colorado Leeds School of Business (CU Leeds). Mr. McLeod said that CU
Leeds presents budget forecasts to the Board in April and October every
year. He said the October study is used for the annual budget and the April
forecast is used for the amended budget.
Dr. McNown said that the economy has reached full capacity and that any
further growth would be driven by supply-side factors. He stated the labor
market does not have much slack at national level and even less in Colorado.
He said that gross domestic product is showing a 2 to 2.2% growth rate
when adjusting for inflation, which he said tracks with the rate over the past
decade. He said that, at the national level, a lack of labor force participation
would suppress overall output and income. He said that the state economy
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

be the enemy of the good and stated the Mobility Choice
Blueprint is a good solution. He stated he would a reluctant yes
vote because of the known issues with the study but said he
was confident those issues would be addressed.

6.C

Dr. McNown said that employment is major driver in national short-term and
medium-term forecasts, personal income is a key driver in Colorado
forecasts, and retail sales and taxable sales are important for both national
and state projections. He stated that the long-term model is driven by
population projections. He spoke about forecast uncertainty and the factors
that contribute to that uncertainty. He suggested that a consensus forecast
utilizing an averaging of available models would present an accurate
depiction of what to expect in coming years. He noted that the revenue
forecasts showed a growth rate 4.1% last year, and he projected a rate of
4.0% for the current year. He spoke about the reliability of past CU Leeds
forecasts and noted the gap between optimistic and pessimistic forecasts is
only about 4%. He noted that forecasts predicting long-term growth depict a
flattening of the revenue income curve toward 2040. He compared the CU
Leeds forecasts to those used by other organizations in the state performing
similar projections and noted that forecasts put out by the Colorado
Legislative Council and the Governor’s Office of State Planning and
Budgeting (OSPB) are more optimistic. He said he is glad to see that CU
Leeds is more conservative in its estimates and noted that the organization’s
forecasts are model-based rather than human-interpreted projections.
Director Williams asked Dr. McNown to give an average of the CU Leeds
forecasting errors.
Dr. McNown estimated the average error would be 2 to 2.5% and stated
that most forecasts under the model previously used were too high.
Director Williams said that an aging population may be slowing down the
economy but pointed out that older people are more likely to use
transportation.
Director Lubow said that the recent recession has technically passed. She
stated that there has been a significant redistribution of wealth and that
many people work multiple jobs and asked whether those factors were taken
into account in the forecast.
Packet Pg. 43

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

has grown more rapidly than national economy and expected that trend to
continue because of the state’s net migration of workers. He said that the
increase in available workers would allow a slightly higher rate of growth for
Colorado than for the nation. He said that Colorado is not in top tier in terms
of overall employment growth among states but is in the second tier. He
stated that the most recent recession has passed and predicted slow and
steady growth into the foreseeable future. He noted that households are in
sounder condition in terms of balance sheets but face challenges such as
high housing costs, uncertainties in terms of fiscal and monetary policy at
national level, and energy prices. He said those factors have both positive
and negative effects on state economy.

6.C

Dr. McNown said that the wages and incomes of workers, which figure
prominently in retail sales and tax revenues, are incorporated in the model.
He said that even if employment grows by 2% in the coming year and
wages grow by slightly more than that, the forecast directly takes that into
account. He said that a tightening labor market creates upward pressure on
wages, thereby increasing retail sales.

Dr. McNown explained that the consensus study is composed of projections
from ten or more government agencies, such as the Congressional Budget
Office, the Office of Budget and Management, and the Department of
Commerce, and that each agency has its own forecasting methodology.
Dr. Wobbekind said that consensus forecasts have been closer and that the
Moody’s forecast CU Leeds used previously has consistently come in too
high, which is why they will be switching to a forecast with a larger sample
size.
Director Lubow noted that even a small over-forecast can cause big trouble.
She said it is important for forecasts to be as accurate as possible or slightly
below.
Dr. McNown said that CU Leeds wants to provide the best estimate and
does not tilt results one way or the other. He said there is solid academic
research to shows that averaging forecast uses different information that
provides better results, which he attributed to the wisdom of expert crowds.
Dr. Wobbekind suggested that the Board consider budgeting toward the
bottom end of the projections rather than the middle.
Director Mihalik said that the Board had just discussed disruptive technology
as it relates to RTD customers. He noted that the forecasts did not reflect
job automation technologies that would make office and blue collar jobs
redundant in the future.
Dr. McNown said that depressed wage growth has been attributed to
globalization and to automation. He said the automations Director Mihalik
spoke of are just a continuation of that trend and are captured by the
analysis.
Director Mihalik also stated that that real estate is in the largest bubble in
history.
Packet Pg. 44

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow asked whether the consensus forecast that CU Leeds will be
using in future forecasts has historically been more accurate.

6.C

Dr. McNown said that it is unrealistic for projections to accurately predict
future recessions but noted that forecasts CU Leeds has provided to staff do
anticipate the possibility of a recession. He offered that, to extent that CU
Leeds forecasts are conservative, their forecasting does perhaps account for
declines experienced during a recession.

Dr. McNown said he has not reviewed the impact of the tax reforms in 1986
because doing so is a politically laden analysis. He said that some
economists found that the economy boomed as a result of the changes
while others said that the results were from normal growth. He said his own
opinion was that, in terms of real economy, changes to tax laws would not
make a difference, because the future is dictated by demographics already in
place. He said that real economic growth is limited by the number of
workers, and if no miraculous growth of productivity takes place, no change
in fiscal policy will make a difference. He noted that government fiscal policy
changes would drive changes in inflation.
Director Menten agreed that the recession is nearing its end but stated there
are indicators that show big challenges ahead. She said it would be a good
idea to be pessimistic in forecasting and asked whether a government could
be too conservative in its forecasting.
Dr. McNown said that an organization such as RTD is in the business of
providing services to the public. He said that a forecast that is too
conservative would cause RTD to spend too little money to provide adequate
services to its clients.

• Review of 2018-2023 SBP Development Process and 2018 Budget
Assumptions
Ms. McKillop said that the purpose of the Strategic Business Plan
(SBP) is to provide overall guidance for RTD. She said that the SBP
aligns with the agency’s strategic goals and incorporates
performance goal, sets target fund balances. She said that the SBP
and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) are both six-year plans now
and that both will be incorporated in one long-range plan going
forward. She said the development process is such that projects that
are approved go into the SBP. She said as new projects are brought
in they are then prioritized through an evaluation against the mission
statement and strategic goals and are analyzed against operating cost
forecasts.
Ms. McKillop spoke about the elements considered in the SBP for
2018-2023, including bus and rail service, the state of good repair of

Director Broom said the last major change to federal tax laws took place in
1986 and asked how changes in tax laws impact economic forecasts.

operating and passenger facilities, capital elements, and the fleet
plan. She said that the age of RTD facilities was discussed at the
joint strategic planning session held in March 2017. She said that
RTD uses two forecasts for revenue assumptions, one in March that
is used for SBP and long-range planning and the other in the fall that
is used for the annual budget. She said the baseline forecast for
2016 should look familiar: 4.1% was the actual growth from 2016,
and 2017 growth is projected at 4.0%, which tracks closely to
realized year-to-date figures. She said both forecasts are below-trend
forecasts. She stated that the baseline forecast scenarios assume
that the Federal Reserve will increase short term rates, the dollar will
remain strong, deficit spending will increase, and oil prices will slowly
rise. She said that staff would recommend to the Board that the set
the growth forecast at 4.0% rather than a lower forecast, because
CU Leeds has recently changed to a more conservative forecast
model. She stated that forecasts do not typically build in recession
assumptions but noted that her department looked at a model that
factors in a slight recession in 2018 or 2019. She said a recession is
historically due, because they typically occur every seven to ten
years. She noted that a projected or realized recession could have a
dramatic effect on project selection.

Chair Hoy asked what the CU Leeds forecast would have shown if
the school had not changed their forecasting model.

Ms. McKillop said she did not have that number but noted that the
September forecast produced under the previous model showed
much higher growth than was actually experienced.
Director Sisk noted, with upcoming collective bargaining agreement (CBA)
negotiations, staff needs to have those models in place. He said the CBA is
what drives the train and the bus. He said the Board just heard from Dr.
McNown that employees are going to be less employed. He said he is very
concerned with creating an SBP with numbers that may not be realistic with
CBA renegotiations.
Director Menten said she was in favor of the lowest, most conservative
forecast possible.

• Non-Profit Program Update
Ms. McKillop said that changes were made in 2016 to the non-profit
program, which has been in place for 25 years. She said the program is
designed to allow nonprofits that are able to do means testing to receive a

Ms. McKillop said the agency was able to manage the program under
existing resources through November, but in December the program
experienced a large spike in participation. She said the fare media issued
under the program was tracked manually via a spreadsheet, which is why
the program ran $700,000 over budget in December. She said that her
department was able to compensate for the overrun from last year but noted
that staff has made her aware that new program participants are placing
very large orders for fare media. She projected that the program would run
out of money in just a few months if the purchasing trend continued, which
is why she had approached the Executive Committee to put stopgap
measures in place. She reported that the Executive Committee agreed that
new program applicants would be waitlisted and that existing participants
would be limited to the amount of fare media they purchased in the same
month the prior year. For participants who had joined within the last few
months, she said those organizations would be able to purchase the average
number of tickets they had purchased in recent months. She said that the
Board had several options for the program:
 To fund the program at the $6.8 million level. She indicated that
funding at this level would mean a reduction in the amount of fare
media available to participants.


To increase the program by $730,000, which would allow
participants to purchase the same amount they purchased last year;



To increase the program by another $1 million, which would allow
current participants to purchase more but close the program to new
participants.

She noted that the value of the fare media is not money the agency is losing
but rather revenue the agency is not collecting. She said she sought input
from the Board, and eventually a recommended action, because the outcome
of their decision affects how the amended 2017 budget will be structured.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, said that RTD
anticipated a 10% increase in program participation because of the change
in the accounting process. He said the program previously employed a twoPacket Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

50% discount on the face value of fare media, which they can pass on to
the people they serve in the community. She said the nonprofits are able to
either sell or give away the media to qualified constituents. She noted that
the amount available to the program was increased by $1million in 2016 to
a total of $6.8 million. She said constraints were put in place to monitor the
total value of media sold so that the program would not exceed the
budgeted amount. She said RTD anticipated increased interest in program,
because changes to the program were made in order to streamline the
administrative paperwork and tracking requirements

6.C

Ms. McKillop noted that program participants do not always continue to
place orders for fare media and suggested that those groups could be
temporarily moved out of the program to make way for new participants.
Director Williams asked whether the program had been discussed with the
pass program working group. She also asked how many passes were issued
under the program and at what cost, and she inquired why the group from
Denver that is asking for 10,000 passes has not been added to the program.
She asked to see a list of program participants.
Ms. McKillop stated that many of the new participants are individual
schools. She said that Denver Public Schools (DPS) participates. She stated
the non-profit program is not a part of the pass program as a whole and said
that the outcome of the pass working group could affect non-profit program.
She said the reason the non-profit program was not offered to everyone is
that the agency we would go bankrupt and stated that Denver alone would
exceed the established limit of available media. She indicated that some of
the school districts were the reason the program overshot the amount of
available media.
Director Williams asked whether the increased cost of adding routes and
drivers as a result of the increased fare media was contemplated.
Ms. McKillop said that the cost had not been calculated and that there was
not enough data to know who receives the media.
General Manager Genova said he was waiting on demographic information
from Denver before factoring similar costs into the My Denver pass.
Director Walker asked whether the issue is an accounting problem or a cash
flow value problem.
Mr. Reed said that the issue is the revenue impact to RTD.

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

tier application process with onerous accounting requirements. He said the
changes in the program were not marketed, but rather social service
agencies and umbrella agencies for the counties let their members know
about the changes. He said Director Deadwyler attributed the increase to
unmet need. He said Director Tisdale asked how the overrun came about,
and Mr. Reed explained that, because the accounting for sales of fare media
under the program was a manual process, it took a while to realize when the
sudden increase occurred at the end of the year.

6.C

Director Walker suggested the use of a block-grant program, where
participants would submit requests for media in advance for the following
year.

Director Walker asked if it would be possible to produce a smart card that
would allow program participants to fill the cards as one would an expense
account.
Mr. Reed said that would eventually be possible.
Director Anderson said she would like to see the program receive maximum
funding but noted that RTD is a transit agency and not a social services
agency and said RTD has been taken advantage of. She said she needed
more information on the program’s impact on revenues and the agency’s
ability to provide safe service before deciding how she would vote.
Chair Hoy said that the non-profits making large purchases have no skin in
the game, because they can purchase and resell fare media at the same
price. He suggested that non-profits be limited to reselling tickets at 25% of
face value, otherwise the program could sell out quickly. He mentioned that
certain organizations receive an additional 50% discount and can purchase
tickets at a quarter of the face value. He also suggested auditing program
participants and establishing a purchase limit. He said accounting staff
should be updating the tracking spreadsheet numbers daily to watch the
total number of tickets sold.
Director Tisdale said that he supports nonprofits but noted the money for the
program is public money. He said RTD is losing money by not receiving the
value for a ticket and noted that Directors took an oath to guard public
money. He said that a ticket given under the program is a gift of public
funds, not a right, and that no one is entitled to receive the tickets. He
agreed with Director Williams that the non-profit program should be part of
the pass program agenda. He reiterated that no one is interested in stopping
the program but rather are interested on pausing until the program can be
examined.

Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Reed noted that the program funds had never before been exhausted.
He said staff is performing triage on the program and trying to establish
ways to control the process. He stated that the controls that may be put in
place could lead to more onerous accounting methods that will slow down
the distribution of fare media.

6.C

Director Lubow said that there exists a lot of unmet need and that she finds
it appropriate for a transit agency to provide access to disadvantaged
people. She asked whether the process could be automated.
Ms. McKillop said that automation is not possible presently but that her
department is working on it. She mentioned that the pass program is not a
part of the agency’s regular programs or processes.

Director Francone said that any additional spending should be stopped until
the program can be made equitable. She said that the program would need
to be stopped for the year if it were to run out of money even in the next
month. She said that Directors Tisdale and Walker offered good ideas and
that she was sure Ms. McKillop would create controls for the program.
Director Broom asked what portion of the ridership is represented by the
non-profit program, and General Manager Genova said that figure would be
reported by the next week.
Director Walker said there should not be a question of who is worthy to ride
transit and who is not and stated everyone deserves to be able to ride. He
said the question at hand is how much the agency can provide with the
money that has been allocated.
Director Menten said that she did agree to the additional $1 million because
the Board was told that non-profits were being neglected. She stated that
she does not want the non-profit program to be part of the pass program,
which she said should involve only the Eco Pass. She said she would not
have voted for the increase if she would have known the eventual outcome.

• SmartCard Project Update
Ms. McKillop offered to take questions only on the last two update items.
For the SmartCard. She reported that the go live date for the project was
still scheduled for May 10, 2017, for pilot participants May 24, 2017, for
the general public.
Director Francone asked about the notice to cure status of the disputed
project completion items.
Ms. McKillop reported that the main outstanding items were payment card
industry (PCI) compliance and platform validators. She said the vendor has a
plan to put fans in the platform validators to cool them down, thereby
hopefully preventing the screens from turning black under sunlight. She said
the vendor has been asked to compare validators side-by-side, one with the
Packet Pg. 50

Director Lubow said she is concerned with possibility of fraud.

6.C

fan and one without. She said the vendor is servicing the validators even
though warranty has expired. She said the vendor would hopefully resolve
the PCI compliance prior to the before go live date but that all issues are
currently within the agency’s risk tolerance.

Ms. McKillop said the actual sales and use tax revenues came in close to
projections and that the agency is very close to being on budget for the year
to date. She reported that ridership is down slightly and that fare revenue is
slightly above projections. She said the amended budget would be presented
soon and that the 2017 budget last year projected sales and use tax growth
of over 6%, whereas the realized growth was 4%. She said this gap has
resulted in a $20 million shortfall but said that she has a plan to
accommodate for the difference.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten asked when the agency would begin to review fare structure
changes slated to be implemented in 2019.
General Manager Genova said that those discussions would take place starting in
early 2018.

B. Recommended Actions

• Award of “Group 27” Contracted Fixed-Route Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract with First Transit for the provision of contracted fixedroute transit services “Group 27.” This contract is for three years, with
two one-year options for a total of 5-years, for a 5-year cost of
$128,033,723.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct
fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $13,804,915.00 for the total 5-year
term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route
transit service and fuel is $141,838,638.00.
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible
proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-055 to
provide “Group 27” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide
this service is scheduled to be effective on May 13, 2017.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the April 18, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

C. Updates

• 40' Bus Seating Configuration
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that over
time, staff, received a number of comments from the disabled community
regarding the seating configuration on buses. He commented that last year
staff was preparing for a new bus order and before that order was finalized,
staff met with members of the disabled community. He stated that he
wanted to discuss some of the comments brought to staff, note the
environment in which RTD is working, and highlight the process and
outcome for the seating configuration of the new 40’ transit coaches.
Mr. Abel noted that staff was anticipating two bus orders for 2017: 40
buses were ordered April 1, 2017, and another 15 would be ordered in the
fourth quarter. A number of issues were brought to RTD from the disabled
community, and in order to address those issues, staff convened a meeting
with representatives from the disabled community on December 20, 2016.
At that meeting, RTD staff met with Douglas Howie, Colorado CrossDisability Coalition (CCDC), Tina McDonald CCDC, Vivian Stovall, Citizens
Advisory Committee (CAC), Andrew Montoya, CCDC’s Attorney, Dr. William
Gross, and Kurt Miller. The purpose of that meeting was to discuss the
issues communicated to RTD and provide information concerning the
regulatory, physical, and customer service environment in which RTD
operates. He noted that staff informed the group at that meeting that two
new bus orders would be placed 2017, the first in April and the second in
the fourth quarter. Staff also had conversations with Gillig, Inc., the
manufacturer of the new buses to determine if they could alter the first bus
order with the new seat configuration.
Mr. Abel explained that RTD operates within a regulatory environment from
the Americans with Disabilities (ADA) Act, which sets forth minimum
requirements that RTD must meet in terms of the design of the 40’ coaches.
A few of those requirements include:
 Ramp design load must be able to hold 600 pounds and it must be 30
inches wide.
Packet Pg. 54

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously

6.D






Securement devices must be able to hold 4,000 pounds for each
mobility aid.
There must be two 30”x 48” securement areas near the accessible
entrance as practicable. At least one securement area must be
forward facing. Additional securement areas may be forward facing
or rearward facing.
Common wheelchairs and mobility aids must be accommodated.
Vehicles must have seatbelts and shoulder harnesses.
Priority seating signage and securement location signs must be
visible.

Mr. Abel added that there are a variety of issues laid out in the ADA that
RTD must comply with, at a minimum, and it is another regulatory
environment in which RTD exists. He noted that there is also a physical
environment, and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) limits
the maximum width of any vehicle on Colorado roadways to 102” wide, and
noted that RTD’s transit coaches are 102” wide. As a result of
transportation laws throughout the nation, bus manufacturers only make
buses 96” or 102” wide. Another element of RTD’s physical reality is that
the interior walls of buses are not perpendicular, and they do not meet the
floor at a right angle. If buses are 102” on the outer wall, the inside wall at
the shoulder is 96” and 86-88” at the floor. The original seat design had
two 30” x 48” securement areas located at the front of the bus, meeting the
minimum ADA requirement. The primary issue brought to RTD was that,
due to the securement areas being immediately opposite of each other, it
was difficult for a mobility device to swing into a vacant securement area if
the other was occupied. Also, if both securement areas were occupied, it
created a narrow aisle way that would not be sufficient to accommodate a
walker. Secondary issues centered on the folding seats behind the
securement areas. On the curb side of the bus, there is one center facing
seat behind the securement area, and it was brought to staff’s attention that
not only was the seat useless, but it made the seats behind it useless as
well.
Mr. Abel stated that prior to the December 20, 2016 meeting, staff asked
Gillig to provide floor plans that are currently in use by other transit agencies
across the county. In response to that request, Gillig provided RTD staff
with two dozen options. Staff vetted and reviewed the plans and narrowed
the options down to four floor plans that staff presented to the group for
conversation and discussion. The outcome of that conversation and
discussion was consensus that floorplan C, as it was known at that time,
was the best variation available for RTD to address the issues that had been
articulated to staff. After the December 20th meeting, staff went back to
Gillig to determine what could be done with floorplan C. The result was the
new design seat layout. The new seat design layout addresses:
Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 11, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)



6.D



The swing issue. The curbside securement area will be expanded to
58”x 30” which exceeds the ADA requirement.
The two securement areas have been offset to provide
maneuverability and to minimize the narrow aisle way.

Mr. Abel remarked that part of RTD’s reality is that it has a limited amount
of space on buses with which it can work. He highlighted that buses are
102” on the outside, 96” inside at shoulder height, and 88” inside at the
floor. RTD’s job is to balance competing demands from a variety of
customers, because RTD is a single public transit agency that has to meet
many needs. The new design seat layout was staff’s balancing act to
address the securement area space.
Mr. Abel noted that Tina McDonald suggested that RTD utilize thin profile
flip seats at the front of the bus, and she provide information from the
manufacturers. He stated that using these seats, when flipped up, will allow
for the maximum clearance space available and provide a few extra inches
to the securement areas.
Mr. Abel commented that, on the new design layout, the floor of the
securement areas will be blue. He stated the blue color will outline the
securement area, and wheelchair symbols will be added to the bottom of the
flip seats to further visually reinforce the securement areas to others.
Mr. Abel remarked that, after working internally and with Gillig, staff met
with the group from the December 20th meeting again on March 6, 2017,
and provided the new design layout. Attendees at that meeting were staff,
Douglas Howie, Tina McDonald, Dr. Williams Gross, and another individual
unfamiliar to staff. He stated that staff communicated that the new design
layout was the path RTD would be moving forward with based on the
previously presented issues. The vast majority of the people in attendance
provided feedback that was positive, but there was not universal acceptance
of the new design. The main complaint from those opposed to the new
design was that the street side of the bus still had a securement area of 48”
x 30”.
Mr. Abel reiterated that RTD’s job is to find a balance between numerous
competing demands. He added that 2.6% of RTD’s daily bus ridership are
ramp events where the ramp is deployed. In the course of a day, with
256,000 passenger boardings, there are over 6600 ramp events. Ramp
events could be a wheelchair boarding, a walker boarding, or any other
boarding where the ramp is requested. Staff, in its attempt to balance a
number of competing needs, made the modifications that it felt were
appropriate. He added that he was pleased to inform the Board that Gillig
was able to accommodate the new design layout modifications in the April
assembly run that just began.

Director Broom asked how this layout compares with what is currently on
light rail or commuter rail.

Director Solano stated that he had met with a couple of advocates from the
CCDC and they said that the offset of the securement areas would not allow
the operator to go to the back of the bus, or passengers to go to the front of
the bus in the event of an emergency.
Mr. Abel stated that, with the new seat layout, the front door has the exit
ramp for the securement areas. In addition to the two door exits, all
windows on the bus, per federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS),
push out so that people can exit the bus through the windows in the event
of an emergency. There are also two ceiling exits that double as
ventilators/emergency exits.
Chair Hoy noted that he liked Ms. McDonald’s suggestion about the thin
profile flip seats and asked if the seats are designed to automatically flip into
the upright position.
Mr. Abel remarked that nothing would preclude RTD from operating with
those flip seats in the upright position.
Lou Ha, Manager of Technical Services, stated that currently, seat
manufacturers do not make automatic flip up seats. They are considering
designing them, but they are not available yet.
Chair Hoy asked how much the reconfiguration would cost.
Mr. Abel said it would be an additional $1200, which is eminently
reasonably.
Director Walker stated that not everyone with disabilities uses wheelchairs
or walkers, and he would be interested to see how the new seat design
works.
Mr. Abel commented that staff’s perspective is that this is a constant
balancing act to manage a variety of articulated requests.

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, commented
that newer light rail vehicles have the 60” maximum turn around area on
both sides. He noted that existing vehicles will be updated with the same
configuration, and added that light rail cars have a bit more room than
buses, and the walls are straighter.

6.D

Committee Chair Anderson stated that she appreciated all of the work staff
put into this.
Director Solano asked about the metal secure brackets, as the two measure
differently.

• Lost Service Hours 4 11 17
Mr. Abel said that in March 2017 there were 283 lost service hours,
compared to 1127 in March of 2016. He commented that there has been a
dramatic improvement, but RTD is still challenged internally because it
requires staff to mandate operators in order to meet service requirements.
He noted that customers are seeing better service on the street and staff will
continue to work with Human Resources (HR) to get additional operators.

D. Other Matters
Director Menten commented that a constituent asked her about RTD’s policy where
someone could call in and ask for a three-minute courtesy hold for local bus
service. She stated that she was unaware of the policy and hoped that RTD was
not continuing the practice.
Gina Callahan, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that
RTD will do a three-minute courtesy hold for a bus if a customer calls in time. She
added that RTD will be adding an additional feature called “Connection Protection”
to help bus operators know that a transferring bus is coming within a three-minute
window to help customers make connections. However, the service will not be
available on a snow day or during sporting events. She noted that staff has
observed that the three-minute hold does not effect on-time performance.
Director Menten asked how many calls RTD typically receives requesting a courtesy
hold.
Ms. Callahan remarked that 30 calls a day come in from bus drivers who have a
customer asking for a hold and 400 calls come in through dispatch.

Mr. Abel stated that there is a metal bracket that is mounted to the floor and
the mobility devices are secured to that bracket. In existing vehicles, staff is
reviewing if that bracket intrudes into the 48” x 30“securement area. He
added that staff will be working with the disabled community to fix any
additional issues that arise.

canceled be added to the Board Meeting agenda for April 18,
2017.
Director Menten agreed.

Director Menten asked how the language for the executive
session would read.
General Manager Genova and Barbara McManus said that the
language would be the same as that which appeared in the
OCS agenda. General Manager Genova said the Board would
likely not be as pressed for time at a Board Meeting.
Chair Hoy asked if there were any objections.
Director Anderson asked for assurances that the executive
session was intended to discuss legal issues. She noted that,
pursuant to Colorado law, only certain topics are permissible
for executive sessions. She said she wanted to make sure that
the particular matter to be discussed is a subject that could be
discussed in executive session under Colorado law.
General Manager Genova said that the matter at hand is
similar to other items the Board has discussed. He said that he
would be discussing contract requirements related to the Eagle
P3 Project.
Chair Hoy said that Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, would be
one of the main presenters and that Mr. Asphaug knows the
requirements of the open meetings law.
Director Menten asked whether discussing the matter during
an open meeting would damage negotiations.
General Manager Genova said that would be a possibility.

Vote on
Motion:

Other Matters
Director Menten stated it is her understanding that, if something were improperly
discussed during an executive session, a relevant Colorado court ruling from
Greenwood Village held that the First Amendment rights of an individual overrules
the executive session privilege. She said that the person would not be barred from
speaking to the matter outside of the meeting.
Director Anderson added that she was familiar with the lawsuit.

Public Participation
Chair Pro Tem Francone stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to
address the Board. She reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.


Frank Tapy from Denver stated that he was a long-time resident of the Park Hill
neighborhood. Mr. Tapy informed the Board that he was the Treasurer of Together
Colorado. He summarized Together Colorado as a state-wide, multi-faith, racially
inclusive, non-partisan, non-profit organization that is affiliated with People
Improving Communities through Organizing (PICO) National Network. Mr. Tapy
explained that Together Colorado is involved in national issues that include:
education, mass incarceration, immigration, health care, and economic justice. Mr.
Tapy mentioned the fact that he was a teacher for several decades teaching art and
coaching basketball. He emphasized the importance of extra-curricular
opportunities for students. He stated that lack of affordable transportation often
means that some students cannot participate. He stated that the situation has
become more problematic with continued economic disparity and the increase in
school choice options that require longer travel distances. He stated that if
students possessed an Eco Pass, then it would allow him or her to have greater

access to more activities. Mr. Tapy concluded by saying that statistics state that
children that participate in a wide range of activities typically have better
attendance, high academic performance and better graduation rates. He stressed
that the education of our youth must be the highest priority in Colorado and in the
Denver Metro Area. He said as a community servant, RTD can play an important
role in the educational experience for students.
Daniella Torres, Denver, stated that she was a freshman at Colorado Academy.
Ms. Torres said that if she had a bus pass she wouldn’t need to worry having
money to get to school and her soccer games. She explained that transportation
should not discourage a student’s desire to learn and do extra-curricular activities.
Tony Lewis of Denver, the Executive Director of the Donnell-Kay Foundation, stated
that his organization’s core focus is to improve education and a key piece of that
objective is providing transportation. He said that high school students need
access to after-school programs, summer programs, jobs, and access to school of
choice. Mr. Lewis explained that two years ago the Donnell-Kay Foundation started
researching transportation policies of Denver Public Schools (DPS), City and County
of Denver (CCD) and RTD. It became apparent after the study that most students
lack transportation resources and need public transit. He said that the Donnell-Kay
Foundation, along with DPS and the CCD, have tried to engage in pass
conversations with RTD but have failed on many occasions. He explained that all
the parties involved created a pilot program that would link up with the My Denver
card and Eco Pass. Through this pilot, Denver Public Schools would purchase
10,000 Eco Passes. Mr. Lewis stated DPS does not want free passes only access
to the Eco Pass program. He explained that RTD has denied this request and he
believes it’s a big mistake. He asked the Board to overturn this decision and allow
DPS to purchase 10,000 passes for the pilot program and in turn RTD will get
valuable ridership data on high school students for the pass study task force.
Miguel Ceballos, Denver, stated that he remembered when DPS provided buses to
take kids to school. He followed up by saying that he does not see that as a
growing priority in his Montbello neighborhood. He said students need to get to
activities after school and they need access to get there. He said that he used to go
to school to Emily Griffith School growing up and had to travel to and from
Montbello every day. He said he didn’t know how he would have afforded the
transit fares if he did not have a reduced rate pass. He asked the Board to consider
the people that their decision that if effects.
Marcos Cortes, Denver, stated that an Eco Pass would benefit him, his friends and
it would also help out his parents. He said that most of his friends’ parents do not
drive them to school because the distance is too far. Mr. Cortes said that once he
starts East High School next year he will need to take RTD to and from school. He
said that it is too hard for his mom to transport all of his siblings to various schools

each morning. He asked the Board to let DPS and CCD purchase Eco Passes the
same way RTD allows corporations to purchase passes.
Jennifer Agrray, Denver, from Young Aspiring Americans for Social and Political
Activision (YAASPA), stated that, if all students had access to an RTD pass, they
would have access to more quality schools. She asked RTD to step up and let DPS
buy RTD passes.
Benedict Botchi, Denver, YAASPA and Together Colorado, said it is vital for
students to have access to bus passes. He explained and example of how his
brother missed a very important test because he chose to save money for other
things instead of using it for the bus. He urged the Board to prioritize figuring out a
solution to this problem.
Jessica Agrray, Denver, stated that a lot of her friends miss school because they do
not have money for the bus. She pleaded with the Board to allow CCD to purchase
bus passes.
Phoebe Amoako, Denver, YAASPA, stated that parents are paying $50/month for
their child to access a bus pass. She said that she is considering going to a school
far from where she lives; however, she may not be able to afford to get there. Ms.
Amoako said that there are a lot of kids who do not receive the education they
deserve because of transportation issues. DPS has the money to purchase 10,000
passes from RTD from their Eco Pass program, the same program corporations
purchase passes for their employees.
Reverend Nelson Bock, Denver, Together Colorado, stated that he has lived in
Denver for over 30 years. He cited that a large percentage of students from
Denver Public Schools come from low-income families and are on the free and
reduced lunch program. Rev. Bock said that transportation to and from school for
these families can be a very large financial burden. He said that parents want to
allow their children to have every opportunity to thrive and extracurricular activities
teach them very important values. He explained how extracurricular activities help
young people to fully develop their potential and become productive members to
our society. Rev. Bock plead with the Board to break the barriers and support the
request for RTD to negotiate a bulk purchase of Eco Passes for DPS students.
Victoria Okane, Denver, YAASPA, said that she believes that RTD passes cost too
much for students and families. She stated that she would redirect that money to
purchase swim equipment. She urged the Board to work with DPS and CCD in the
purchase agreement of 10,000 Eco Passes.
Caprice Agassounom, Denver, YAASPA and Together Colorado, stated that
transportation is essential to all students. In order to go her school of choice she
would have to take two buses and one train. The amount of money needed to do
this every day to and from school would greatly affect her family. Ms.
Agassounom asked the Board to consider working with DPS and CCD in the
purchase of the bus passes.

Myra Gonzales, Denver, stated that she was representing the Montbello Organizing
Committee on behalf of the Montbello students that could not attend. She noted
that out of 4,965 high school students residing in Montbello, 1,174 have opted to
attend out of district schools; therefore they need reliable transportation. Ms.
Gonzales stated that Director Deadwyler has told that she would support a plan if it
was cost neutral. She encouraged the Board to work with DPS, CCD, and Together
Colorado to provide bus passes for students.
Nola Miguel, Denver, Director of Globeville Elyria-Swansea Live Well, and former
Together Colorado. Ms. Miguel said that she was involved in forming the Success
Express program, which operates the little yellow buses that transport parents and
students in Northeast Denver. She said that this program originated when a group
of 8th grade students and their parents formed a committee to find transportation
for their children transitioning into high school. She said the children of the
Globeville and Elyria-Swansea neighborhoods are required to walk far to attend
schools near them, and are faced with safety elements that can make it dangerous
for them such as the highway crossings and train tracks. She mentioned a mother
who was faced with paying for numerous fares for her children and stated that
receiving passes for her high school students would help tremendously. Ms. Miguel
encouraged the Board to be part of the pilot bus pass effort.
Miguel Salgado, Denver, Youth Leader with Together Colorado, stated that
receiving an education is a gift. He said the true colors of modern society shows
when a student‘s education is compromised by how the student gets to school. He
explained that he has been riding RTD for a long time and sees how modern day
technology has manipulated and taken advantage of all people standing before the
Board. He then explained that a child paying $1.10 to get to and from school every
day would pay approximately $66 a month. Mr. Salgado said that he cannot speak
for other students but he stated he has rarely received an allowance and never had
a job, so getting money to travel on the bus is a hardship for him and his family.
He stressed that he does not understand how society expects them to succeed if
they continually set up obstacles. He asked the Board to let DPS, CCD and
Together Colorado negotiate a year around pass program for students.
Hadyn Roberts, Denver, explained the importance of the bus to persons of all
economic levels and backgrounds. He referenced a Fox 31 report by Kevin Torres,
which stated that, according to RTD sources, an increase to bus and rail fares is
necessary to keep up with inflation and rail expansion projects. He agreed that the
increase made sense but highlighted RTD’s mission statement, to provide safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service. He emphasized to
the Board that bus fares are not cost effective to students. He stated that a
student’s bus fare increased by $0.20 and with approximately 180 school days a
year times two trips a day, a student is paying out of pocket approximately $2.60

day or $468 a year, whereas an Eco Pass is $600 a year. He explained that in
order for a person to break even using the Eco Pass, the person would have to ride
the bus 102 times. He asked the Board if they would commit to working with DPS
and the City of Denver to expand transportation options for students.
Vivian Stovall, Denver, Alliance for Retired Americans, stated that she’s been
taking transit since 1974 and has a passion for advocating for seniors and people
with disabilities. She said that she has watched RTD grow and appreciates the
services they offer to the community. Ms. Stovall said her main concern is
advocating for citizens that are transit dependent. She stated that she has a
concern that there are so many committees with the same goals not
communicating with each other. She mentioned that she is on the Citizens
Advisory Committee and she visits a lot of senior living committees where she
frequently answers RTD-related questions. Ms. Stovall suggested that she would
not mind being an advocate for RTD to assist with the communication barriers with
citizens.
Paul Garrett, Denver, an Episcopal Priest and Director of the Episcopal Church of
Colorado. He stated that he grew up in Denver and went to East High School. He
listed his different means of transportation used to get to school every day and one
of them was the bus. He noted that his church is five blocks away from East High
School and driving to school will be hazardous to students because of the evergrowing neighborhood. He suggested that it would be safer for students to bus to
school instead. Mr. Garrett asked to the Board to make Eco Passes available to
DPS students.

General Manager Genova stated that he has been meeting diligently with staff at the City
and County of Denver (CCD) regarding the bus passes for Denver Public School (DPS)
students. He said that in these meetings with CCD he explains the different pass
programs in detail. He explained to CCD that the sale of our Eco Passes to high schools is
outside of the Eco Pass policy. He also pointed out that in his quarterly meeting with
Mayor Hancock he has been discussing the My Denver card and how RTD might be able to
use that card as a transit pass.
General Manager Genova also mentioned his discussion with the Executive Committee
regarding the non-profit pass. He said that non-profit organizations can buy fare media at
a 50% discount and then it is up to that organization to do the means testing for their
participants. He explained how the Board approved an increase of value fare media sales
by $1 Million dollars in 2016, which raised the face value of media available under the
program to $6.8 Million dollars. He said that the study performed in 2015 helped
convince the Board to increase sales to nonprofit organizations. Towards the end of 2016
sales peaked and RTD exceeded the $6.8 Million dollar threshold by $700,000. He stated
that in monitoring sales since the beginning of this year there has been a significant spike.
He explained that two temporary actions will be implemented in order to not exceed sales
of available media in 2017. He said the first measure would put any new agencies on a
waiting list. The second measure would limit purchases to what agencies have purchased
historically.
General Manager Genova stated that his team would come back to the Board next month
during a committee meeting and present a better analysis of the program and more

General Manager Genova also explained how some schools purchase passes from the nonprofit pool of passes and can also capturing an additional 50% discount if they conduct
their own means reporting. He said he met with the Mayor and the Superintendent from
DPS regarding their pass request and talked about creating a pass that is similar to the
college pass, which would be based on use. He noted that RTD is awaiting demographic
information from DPS showing where students that qualify are located.
Director Folska asked General Manager Genova for more detail on where RTD is with the
FRA extension, which is set to expire on April 30th. She asked what the reasonable
expectation beyond April 30th is and when the opening of the G Line will occur.
General Manager Genova stated that he met with the FRA in March and talked about doing
a variance to the equation on how we calculate the warning times. He reported that the
FRA stated that RTD is on a good path moving forward and suggested meeting with the
public utilities commission. He explained that, since the waiver’s expiration date is set for
April 30th, RTD will need to ask for an extension during their visit to Washington D.C. on
Monday, April 3rd. He asserted that the FRA stands firm that, until RTD has a solid plan
on the completion of the University of Colorado A Line crossings, they will not allow RTD
to test the G Line. He stated that Denver Transit Partners (DTP) said that once testing is
approved for the G Line it would take them approximately 8 weeks for testing. He said
that the FRA asked RTD to set a revenue service date and they requested the end of
October 2017. He stressed that October 31, 2017, is not the opening date; it is simply a
response to their request.
Director Tisdale said that he appreciated hearing all of the students’ desires to participate
in extracurricular activities. He stated that he too grew up on transit and he appreciates
and empathizes with them. He asked General Manager Genova to give the Board
assurance that the temporary measures adopted by the Executive Committee will remain in
place until there is a report to the Board. He also requested an explanation on why the
program was oversold by $700,000. Lastly, he requested a process that will prevent
some non-profits from buying up all the passes, and said there needs to be a fair
purchasing mechanism.
Director Lubow asked why there was a huge purchasing spike in December.
Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer/Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, stated that agencies were spending their end-of-year budgets in December,

Packet Pg. 72

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 28, 2017 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 28, 2017)

information on purchasing. He said during this presentation staff will identify some
options for the program. He affirmed that through the Board’s input staff will create a
Recommended Action for May.

8.A

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, said he has a long history
working with these individual agencies but RTD did not anticipate the level of interest. He
said that there was not a tracking mechanism in place prior to accepting the orders, so the
orders received had to be honored. Mr. Reed explained that the new temporary actions,
capping sales and establishing a waitlist, will allow staff to monitor sales more closely until
a revised procedure is put into place.
Director Lubow asked General Manager Genova to explain how school districts can get an
additional 50% off of their purchases through the non-profit pass option.
General Manager Genova explained that school districts can purchase passes at the 50%
student discount rate and then request another 50% off for being a non-profit
organization; however they will need to conduct a means test on the student to make sure
they qualify for the discount.
Director Lubow asked if that same type of scenario would work for the Denver Public
Schools’ students.
General Manager replied that some DPS schools currently go through this program and
RTD has discussed all the different options with DPS.
Director Lubow said that she is getting feedback that staff is not interested in discussing
the mechanics of RTD’s different pass programs. She stressed that RTD needs to have a
“Getting to Yes” attitude when assisting our customers.
General Manager Genova said that he has been having conversations with DPS however,
RTD has not said yes to the Eco Pass request because it is outside the policy guidelines.
He said staff continues to discuss how RTD can help DPS.
Ms. McKillop stated that Denver and Aurora purchase passes through the non-profit
program and on a school-to-school basis, based on the budgets they have available. She
said the means testing is based on whether or not the child qualifies for free lunch not
reduced lunch.
Director Lubow asked if the school districts have money to purchase the passes, could
RTD sell DPS passes through the non-profit program.

Packet Pg. 73

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 28, 2017 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 28, 2017)

which accounted for the spike in sales. She also stated that there were 35 new agencies
that joined the program in 2016. She noted that the program went over budget because
the purchasing process is a manual process and not electronic, therefore staff was unable
calculate numbers while processing orders.

8.A

General Manger Genova said that DPS currently wants 10,000 Eco Passes at $2 Million
dollars per year. 10,000 local passes at the student discount rate would cost $6 Million
dollars and 10,000 regional passes would be double that amount.
Mr. Reed stated that RTD has in place a Board-adopted policy to sell Student Passes,
College Passes, and Eco Passes. The Eco Pass program is set up where every employee
signs up for the program but not every employee is going to utilize the pass. He continued
by saying that DPS will actually be using all 10,000 passes, so it doesn’t qualify as an Eco
Pass purchase. He emphasized that RTD has had numerous discussions with the parties
involved. He stated that DPS want the Eco Pass price but everyone will use their pass and
you will not be able to account for the reduction in usage which levels out the very low
price.
Director Williams stated that there are a lot of other groups that could benefit from
discounted programs. She said that there needs to be equity when offering discounted
rates.
Director Broom asked General Manager Genova if the FRA’s request that RTD consult with
the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) means that RTD has covered all of their bases and
the software issues are fixed.
General Manager Genova stated he was encouraged by the last meeting with FRA and
today’s meeting with the PUC as well.
Chair Pro Tem Francone stated that if RTD is going to give discounted rates to Denver
Public School students then we need to accommodate all students in all regions. She
calculated that the face value of 10,000 passes worth $49 per month over a period of 12
months would cost $5,880,000, which would result in a $3,880,000 taxpayer subsidy for
the program. She stated that she has had conversations with the Together Colorado
representatives and they were astonished by the numbers she presented them.
Chair Pro Tem Francone asked General Manager Genova if he could explain what was
going on with the definition of cohort.
General Manager Genova stated that RTD does not believe it is part of a cohort, and has
applied for a collateral refund.

Packet Pg. 74

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 28, 2017 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of March 28, 2017)

Ms. McKillop replied that DPS wants bus passes on a much broader basis which would
exclude the means testing. The volume that they want doesn’t fit into any of the
programs RTD currently has. She stated that RTD would not be able to afford the volume.

Ms. McKillop explained that when the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA),
Denver Transit Partners (DDP) and RTD applied for the Railroad Rehabilitation &
Improvement Financing (RRIF) Loan, RTD was required to put up a $28 million credit risk
premium/collateral on the loan. Those funds have been sitting in Washington, D.C. as
RTD was considered high risk even though DUSPA applied for the loan. Since that time,
RTD has argued to get that money back. The only people that have been successful in
getting that money refunded were those that had paid off the loan, and had smaller credit
risk premiums. Between the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21)
and the new Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, there was a piece of
legislation that said anyone that had paid off their loans as of 12/31/2015, could get their
credit premiums back. RTD paid off both the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (TIFIA) and RRIF loans on February 3, 2017. At that time, RTD sent a
notice to the people in office indicating that RTD planned to get that money refunded.
RTD has now sent official letters through DUSPA indicating that the loans have been paid
off, RTD is not part of a cohort, and RTD is applying the previous bill language written to
our set of circumstances. That letter was sent on March 22, 2017 and staff is waiting for
a response. She added that RTD will use whatever political mechanisms it can to help get
that money refunded, and noted that the $28 million would be split between the City of
Denver and RTD.
Director Deadwyler stated that she can relate to many of the students because she too
had to travel back and forth to school each day on buses. She said that she loved hearing
the students speak out; however, she realizes that they are millennials and they do not like
to spend money on anything. She said that she believes the students should be required to
pay for a portion of the pass.

Approve Contract Amendment for the Supply of 15 - 40' Transit Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise the contract
option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. for the purchase of 15 additional
40’ transit buses and associated spare components in an amount not to exceed
$6,598,000.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to approve
the Contract Amendment for the Supply of 1540’ Transit Buses.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten asked if the placement of the wheelchair area
will allow for open access on the aisle and if the buses getting
the modifications were the buses that she had been hearing
about.
Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, replied
that it is the current set of buses and RTD has been
working with Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) on
issues of accessibility and securement for different mobility
devices. He explained that the current configuration has the
wheelchairs facing each other and now they will be lined up
parallel on the curbside of the bus. He stated that the buses
will have a thinner flip up seat which will provide 4 more
inches to the aisle. He added that there will be additional
space for priority seating and extra space securement area.
Director Menten asked if CCDC will be happy with the
arrangements that are being made.
Mr. Gieske stated that staff met with CCDC on March 6 and
they were appreciative of the changes being made.
General Manager Genova stated that RTD was exceeding the
minimal ADA requirements, and staff worked with the ADA
community on the design of the buses. He noted that RTD
does the best to accommodate what we can, that is practical.

Gina Callahan, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, added that the seating arrangements that were
designed addressed many of the concerns; such as the ease of
maneuvering through the aisle without little blocking the aisle.
She stated that the changes made will allow easier mobility
while maintaining the seating on the bus.
Director Menten asked if a lot of money was spent to
accommodate this request.
Mr. Gieske stated that it cost $2,000 per bus, but the money
was in the budget. He stated that staff believed in the
changes so much that they modified an additional 40 new
buses that RTD has purchased.
Director Williams stated that RTD has ADA Design Committee
and that committee reviewed this layout as well. She noted
that she was a member of that committee.
Director Deadwyler stated that she cannot fit on the train or
the bus with her mobility device because the areas are too
tight. She stated that even if additional inches were removed,
she still would not be able to park parallel.
Mr. Gieske stated that the flip up seats and mobility device
space on the curbside exceeds 57 inches, unfortunately, due
to the engineering of the vehicle, staff could not reconfigure
the street side of the vehicle.
Director Deadwyler stated that when she rode the R Line her
chair was backed up against the door and she didn’t feel
secure. She asked General Manager Genova is staff would
apply this configuration to the light rail trains as well.
General Manager Genova stated that RTD is waiting for the
approval of the modifications.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, advised the Board that as
soon as the settlement agreement between CCDC and RTD
has been approved by the court then the adjustments will be
made.

Approval of Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion
and Plaza Improvements Contract

General

Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the
contract for Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements with T-Bone Construction, Inc., in
the dollar amount of $1,270,874.94. Funding of this action is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is RTD’s second-highest capacity Park-n-Ride. The facility was initially
constructed in 1978, and it was expanded in 1992 as part of the North I-25 Bus/HOV project. This PnR
is served by the 120X & 122X Express routes, the 8, 12,120 & 128 Local routes and the AA Denver
Airport route, and it will continue to play a key transit role in the future I-25 HOV lane projects ongoing
with CDOT. In 2016, 1,451 cars were parked there on an average weekday, making it the most heavily
used Park-n-Ride facility on the RTD system.
Over the last 15+years this PnR has experienced many minor maintenance issues that have driven the
need for the requested improvements from accessibility, functionality, security, and state of good repair.
In early 2016, LED light fixtures were purchased & installed throughout the overall parking area bringing
the light levels up to RTD current standards.
The construction effort is planned to minimize impact to the traveling public. Over the past couple of
years Capital Programs’ Engineering team has collaborated with our Facilities Maintenance and Budget
staff to combine portions of multiple expense budgets to provide sufficient funding to initiate this multifaceted project in a single effort, so to minimize the disruption to our patrons.
DISCUSSION:
The Wagon Road Park-n-Ride Pavilion and Plaza Improvements project will improve safety, accessibility,
lighting and security, Kiss-n-Ride functionality, ease of maintenance, energy efficiency, and appearance
within this heavily used plaza. The major improvements include:
 Refurbishing the existing pavilion structure with new paint, refurbished seating, and new
windscreens.
 Replacing the aging driver’s relief building.
 Replacing pedestrian plaza area paving to eliminate tripping hazards.
 Replacing light fixtures within the bus plaza area with LED fixtures.
 Relocating the north Kiss-n-Ride area to the west to lessen vehicle congestion.
 Reconfiguring the north and south Kiss-n-Ride walk areas.
 Replacing the ADA ramps at the plaza and Kiss-n-Ride areas.
 Restriping the crosswalks between parking lot and plaza area.
 Replacing deteriorated non-functional fencing.

Award of “Group 27” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with First Transit for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 27.” This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years, for a 5-year cost of $128,033,723.00. In addition,
RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $13,804,915.00
for the total 5-year term. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route
transit service and fuel is $141,838,638.00.
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-055 to provide “Group 27” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on May 13, 2017.
BACKGROUND:
As a result of a series of State legislative activities over the years, and in support of the Board
adopted strategic goals, RTD outsources a portion of the delivery of its fixed route bus service.
On January 12, 2017, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 16-DH-055 named “Group 27” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. This service package “Group 27”
replaces “Group 23” and consists of 130 buses operating 37 routes providing approximately
343,449 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in “Group 27” is included as
Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals were due on February 17, 2017. Proposers
were required to provide detailed operating plans for providing fixed-route service, including hiring
and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating
requirements. The contract award was anticipated to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based
on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.
DISCUSSION:
Procurement:
One (1) proposal was received from First Transit in response to RFP 16-DH-055 for the Provision of
Group 27 Public Transportation Services. MV Transportation, National Express Transportation and
Transdev, also expressed interest in the solicitation however, elected not to submit proposals due to
the lack of available facilities in the Denver metropolitan area.
The First Transit proposal was evaluated on the following evaluative criteria:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).

Packet Pg. 84

11.B

The technical evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services;
David Ober, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive
Services, and Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services. The technical evaluation team reviewed
and scored each proposal based on a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation
and b) experience/qualifications and safety record.
The SBE plan and goal attainment evaluation team consisted of Zamy Silva, Senior Manager, Civil
Rights, and Alexis Nightengale, SBO Compliance Officer.
The scores for pricing were provided by the Procurement Department staff.
The following is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal:
Key Strengths:
Increase in bus operator wages. First Transit’s proposal provided a much needed increase in bus
operator wages. The bus operator starting wage increased from $13.46/hour to $15.13/hour.
Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels. RTD, as well as our contractors,
have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining qualified operators. The proposed wage
increases will provide First Transit the opportunity to offer a more attractive wage package, which
will improve recruitment and retention of operators, which will result in improved service for our
passengers.
Dedicated on-site recruiter. This full time new position will be solely focused on the recruitment of bus
operators and maintenance personnel for the First Transit Denver location.
Enhanced Quality Control. Corporate team to work with local team to identify causes and potential
modifications to improve on-time performance.
Strong maintenance program. Mechanics required to complete 40 hours of initial training and 40 hours
of skills enhancement training annually. First Transit promotes the Automotive Service Excellence (ASE)
training and certification program. The Denver location has 12 mechanics that are ASE certified and 4
mechanics that are Master Technician certified.
The proposed management team. Under this team’s leadership, the First Transit Denver division
consistently meets/exceeds RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with Denver and surrounding governments and communities. The
team is experienced in providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 23” contract to the new “Group 27” contract. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
Experience of firm. First Transit has been providing RTD service for 28 years. The company has been
providing fixed-route bus service in other locations for over 60 years. The company currently has over
300 contracts in 39 states and other countries.
SBE goal set at 5%. First Transit’s proposed SBE plan met the 5% goal.
Key Weaknesses:
The proposal weaknesses identified below were forwarded to First Transit for clarification. The
responses received from First Transit adequately address the perceived deficiencies.

Packet Pg. 85

11.B

Operator in-service evaluations. Process not thoroughly discussed in proposal. First Transit provided
detailed description of annual in-service operator evaluations.
DOT hours of service monitoring procedures. No monitoring procedures for ensuring compliance with
DOT hours of service included in the proposal. Procedures were provided upon request.
Distracted driving policy. Policy not included in the proposal. Policy and clarification was provided upon
request.
Corporate safety record details. Safety record for company not included in the proposal. First Transit
provided this information upon request. Numbers show less than 0.2 NTD reportable accidents per
100,000 miles.
Customer complaint procedures. Procedures not thoroughly discussed in proposal. First Transit provided
sufficient information to ensure all complaints are thoroughly investigated and appropriate action is
taken.
Safety Manager experience. Resume did not include tenure in other positions held within First Transit.
An updated, complete resume was provided.
First Transit “Group 23” Performance:
First Transit Denver division currently operates this fixed route service package which has been
evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance measures:







Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles ≤2.0
Passenger Accident ratio per 100,000 miles ≤0.18

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: First Transit utilized bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasized safety with all
employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their
facilities.

Packet Pg. 86

11.B

Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: First Transit raised awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: First Transit placed a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation was diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: First Transit continues to understand the impact new operators, construction
detours, and traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 23” contract, First Transit
worked in conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to continuously improve OTP. They
achieved this improvement, from 85.2% (2012) to 87% (2016), by identifying low performing routes
and assigning supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with operators to discuss factors that
impacted their ability to run on time. Schedule issues were forwarded to RTD Service Planning and
Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: First Transit continually exceeds the goal in this area by
completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner,
monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: First Transit’s performance in this category reflects the difficulties
experienced throughout the RTD district in the earlier part of the year due to operator shortages which
resulted in a high number of “bus late” and “bus did not show” complaints. First Transit, along with
RTD, continues to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. First Transit utilizes
onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In
addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should help address some customer
complaints. First Transit addresses complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
To ensure a fiscally sustainable service delivery, RTD prepared an internal estimate of cost for
outsourcing the “Group 27” service package as well as a RTD cost model projection of costs for RTD
to bring the operation of the Group 27 service package in house.
RTD Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the Group 27 service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent labor shortages experienced by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
address these challenges by increasing operator and maintenance personnel wages. RTD also
factored a 3% increase in inflation.
RTD’s total five-year estimate for the Group 27 service package was $130,333,390. First Transit’s
proposed total five-year price was $128,033,723 or $2,299,667 less than the RTD estimate. First
Transit reported that their proposed price included increases in operator and mechanic wages,
inflation, and increases in maintenance costs associated with the aging 2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet.
Note: bus operator starting wages increased from $13.46/hour to $15.13/hour; C level Mechanic
starting wages increased from $18.03/hour to $20.00hour.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the Group 27 service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $142,283,722, which is $14,249,999 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by First Transit. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected
wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixedroute services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the
“Group 27” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and
maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services.
The First Transit total five-year proposed price represents a $14,249,999 million (10%) savings over
the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the Group 27 - Proposer Service Cost

Contract Cost Details:
This contract is for an initial three-year amount not to exceed $73,418,463 with two (2) one-year
options in the amount of $26,781,472 (option year 1) and $27,833,788 (option year 2), for a total
five-year not-to-exceed amount of $128,033,723 for service. In addition, RTD will reimburse the
contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $8,054,771 for the initial
three-year contract term, $2,845,625 for option year 1, and $2,904,520 for option year 2, for a
total of $13,804,915 for the five-year period. This results in a total not-to-exceed contract amount
of $81,473,234 for the initial three year contract period and $141,838,638 for the five year period
for service and fuel.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contract. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the approved
2017 RTD budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future
years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, as recommended
2)
Resolicit the Group 27 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than the RTD internal cost estimate and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

April 6, 2017

Subject:

2018 Performance Measures Adoption

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2018 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2018, there are
41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same number as in 2017.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and integrate with the Board’s 2018 priorities of Fiscal
Sustainability, Workforce/Human Capital and State of Good Repair. A report detailing year-to-date
performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the end of
each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2018 are brought to the Board of Directors for
approval at this time because the measures are used in development of the 2018-2023 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and 2018 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2017 to 2018 are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
The goal for average graffiti complaints per month is raised from ≤ 1.5 per month to ≤
3.0 per month. Our vulnerability to graffiti has increased by at least 50% based on
linear feet for the new corridors and that percentage is expected to increase due to the
nature of the areas through which the W line and R line travel. The existing target of ≤
1.5 complaints per month is unreasonably low.

Packet Pg. 94

12.C



Goal 3.1 System-wide on-time performance
o The goal for system-wide on-time performance is reduced for Local On-Time Bus Service
from 88.0% to 86.0%, and for Regional On-Time Service from 94.0% to 92.0%. Ontime service data has been collected since 2011 using Automated Passenger Counters
that have a GPS component which has enabled the collection of far more accurate data
regarding scheduled and on-time performance. Data counts alone have exceeded
18,000/day vs. 240/day using the previous observational method.
The data
consistently shows on-time performance in the 83%-86% range for local service.
A peer review survey indicated an on-time performance goal of 87.6% on average with
actual on-time performance of 81.9% on average. Peer performance is below RTD’s
current performance of 85.3% and the requested goal of 86%. In order to consistently
meet the current 88%/94% goal, Bus Operations determined that an additional
$2,000,000 in resources would be required.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall ridership increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2018 Budget in November 2017, and is carried as a placeholder at this
time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2018 Budget in November 2017 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2018 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2018 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2018 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2018 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2018 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2018 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2018 Performance Report.

1 The measure reports on resolution of customer complaints across all subject matter throughout the District and the
number includes all departments utilizing TrapezeCOM system for commendation and complaint research.
2 All three carriers had a high number of complaints related to missed service or late service (no show, bus late,
discourtesy, passed up passengers at stop) along with a decrease in ridership. “No show” complaints showed an
increase most likely due to the number of routes that were dropped or returned to RTD due to lack of operator
availability.

From:

Subject:

Award of Mobile Ticketing Contract

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for the new Mobile Ticketing System to Masabi LLC, in an amount not to exceed $1,450,000. This price
includes the cost for period of performance of a base two-years and three one-year options.
BACKGROUND:
In the fare arena, RTD offers a wide variety of products to meet the unique travel needs of the Rider. At
this time, there are four fundamental methods:
 cash on the bus (single trip or Day Pass);
 cash or credit at RTD ticket vending machines and sales outlets, and retail outlets;
 group accounts through the Smart Card Program (EcoPass, CollegePass, NeighborhoodPass); and
 on-line purchases such as FlexPass and Yahoo Store.
Currently, the medium of the above fare products is by paper ticket, paper pass or a card (MyRide,
EcoPass, CollegePass). The objective of this procurement is to add a mobile ticketing fare “medium” on
a smartphone application (app) that complements the currently available medium. A key element in the
procurement is that the vendor had to demonstrate an existing, functioning and deployed system with
minor configuration allows a reduced time to deliver to RTD of an operating system.
The goal of this project is to implement a day pass (phase 1) and (phase 2) other fare products through
mobile ticketing. Mobile ticketing gives a rider the ability to buy a fare product on their mobile device,
and then to use the mobile device as their fare medium. After electronically purchasing a ride on their
phone, the rider activates the ticket to board the bus or rail service and a ticket appears on the phone
screen for visual validation. RTD receives many requests to offer this type of fare medium.
The vendor will provide second-tier support for customer questions and issues that cannot be easily
resolved or addressed by RTD Customer Care personnel. The vendor will be responsible for all aspects of
receiving and processing payments from customers for fare products and deposit the funds due to RTD.
The product is a Software as a Service (SaaS) implementation, where the vendor provides access to the
software remotely over the Internet. The vendor will provide on-going support and regular support
patches updates for the mobile applications. Any updates to the mobile ticketing applications shall not
affect customers’ purchased fare products, account information, and other associated data. The vendor
also will supply fare inspector enforcement software.
DISCUSSION:
In RTD’s 2014 market survey, three-quarters of RTD customers aged 18-44 had Internet-capable mobile
devices—a penetration surely much higher today, and to be higher still later in 2017. Utilizing mobile

Packet Pg. 107

12.D

ticketing, patrons may purchase fare media at their convenience and avoid waiting in line at ticket
vending machines.
The popularity of downloaded applications (apps) on smartphones is huge, and continuing to trend
upwards. For example, Google Play—the main source of apps for the Android platform—reported1 billion
downloads in August 2010; and 65 billion in May 2016.
The RTD riders will be able to download for free the app / software using Google Play or Apple Store.
The rider will need to register and provide a payment option. The vendor provides the daily operations
and support.
RTD advertised an RFP seeking proposals from qualified firms to provide and implement a Mobile
Ticketing System, using a wireless communications enabled mobile devices.
The evaluation team consisted of personnel from the following departments (Bus Operations,
Communications, Finance and Administration and Safety, Security and Asset Management). The
proposals were reviewed in accordance with the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this
procurement including: fulfilling RTD specified design and functionality requirements, cost, offering
functional strength, experience and qualifications and project plan and schedule. After reviewing all six
proposals, interviewing the top two vendors and obtaining clarifying answers, the evaluation team
unanimously selected Masabi, as the Mobile Ticketing Vendor to move forward in the procurement
process.
Some of the strengths of Masabi’s proposal were:
 Back office application includes well designed reports and is integrated with the customer care
tool
 They had iPhone inspection with proven deployment
 The application is fully multilingual and comes with translations
 Ability to frame external trip planner application/ website
 Ability to contact support by opening a ticket via email
 Training plan focuses on ensuring successful roll-out
 Strong security features
Masabi is a London based technology company that develops and markets mobile ticketing services
for public transit companies. The company was founded in 2001. In 2012, the company launched the
first ticketless rail system in the United States, for the MBTA. Masabi’s mobile ticketing and fare
collection solutions are in use by 25 transport agencies and operators around the globe, including: Virgin
Trains, Abellio, London’s Thames Clippers, New Orleans’ RTA, Boston’s MBTA, Transport for Athens,
Los Angeles’ Metrolink and New York’s MTA.
Masabi’s cost model includes capital for implementation and expenses for operation. The expenses are
based on a monthly charge for the inspection application and a transaction fee on ticket sales including
credit card processing fees. Masabi’s cost proposal was for $1,061,000.00 over 5 years based on an
estimated annual day pass ticket sales of $3 million or approximately 480,000 transactions a year.
Masabi’s product will enable RTD to sell additional ticket types. RTD intends to implement additional
ticket types after the initial launch of day pass tickets therefore, it is in RTD’s interest to have contract
authority beyond the proposal amount by $389,000 to allow for these additional products.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Mobile Ticketing System contract cost for deployment is fixed, monthly fixed charge and the
remaining expenses are based on transaction fees on actual total ticket sales. The contract authority
shall not exceed $1,450,000. Funding for this project is included in the associated SBP and Operating
budgets.
ALTERNATIVES

1. Recommended Action: Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract
with Masabi to implement a Mobile Ticketing System. The new service, uses wireless
communications enabled mobile devices, to provide new options for customers to pay for RTD
Fares.
2. Not Recommended: RTD IT staff could be tasked with development of a comparable system,
but it would take away from current assignments and would require substantially more time
and possibly resources to complete.
3. Not Recommended: RTD could choose not to implement a Mobile Ticketing solution.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: April 6, 2017

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

April 6, 2017

Subject:

Approval to Enter into Agreements to
Contribute Funding to the Colorado Department
of Transportation for the Mobility Choice
Blueprint Technical Consultant(s)

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: April 18, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into any and all agreements required to provide
$400,000 in Regional Transportation District funding in support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint Study.
RTD’s funds are to be used for the technical consultant(s) selected to conduct the Study, in partnership
with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), as articulated in this Board report.
BACKGROUND
At the June 2016 Operations & Customer Service Committee meeting, RTD staff briefed the Board
regarding the proposed Mobility Choice Blueprint study effort. The Board was informed that RTD staff
had been participating in discussions with CDOT, DRCOG and the Denver Metro Chamber about forming
a partnership to create a joint public/private mobility vision for metro Denver by developing key
strategies to leverage current assets using new technologies and provide an integrated system for all
users.
At the September 2016 Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting, RTD staff presented a
Board Report with a recommendation to participate with CDOT and DRCOG in the funding of the
Mobility Choice Blueprint study effort. The proposal was for the three public agency partners to share
equally in funding the study, with each agency’s share being $500,000. This recommended action failed
in Committee. At the time, key issues identified by some Board Members included: the desire to assure
that the public partners, including RTD, retain a lead role in the oversight of the Study; questions
regarding the flow and management of public funds; concerns regarding the level of the proposed dollar
amount of RTD’s participation ($500,000); and the composition of the Chamber’s Mobility Choice
Board.
At the March 21, 2017 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Meeting, RTD staff presented
updated Mobility Choice (MC) Blueprint information and responded to a number of Board inquiries
regarding the proposed effort. Don Hunt (Acting Managing Director of Mobility Choice, Inc.), Kelly
Brough (President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce), and Jim Gunning (former Lone
Tree Mayor and proposed Mobility Choice Executive Director) also were in attendance and answered
questions posed to them by Directors. Highlights of the update, based upon Board comments and
questions, include the following:

Private and Public Sector Participation






The public agencies would take the lead in the study, while the private sector participants would
use the results of the study and any information gained to support projects outside public agency
purview.
One purpose of Mobility Choice is to prevent “siloing” of transportation planning.
Completion of the FasTracks program will not be negatively impacted by Mobility Choice. The
commitment to District voters will not be altered by the study results.
The RTD Board would have a voice at the table during the Mobility Choice effort through regular
feedback during the study.
Participating agencies would determine how to implement study findings, and Mobility Choice
study findings would not be binding on CDOT, DRCOG, or RTD.

MC Board Structure and Role of MC Executive Director









Two economic development organizations have been added to the MC Board to enhance
geographic diversity.
Jim Gunning (proposed MC Executive Director) would be paid through private sector funding.
The current MC Board includes eight private company individuals, three public agency
representatives, two at-large public officials, and two economic development agency
representatives. The charter limits the MC Board to 21 members.
The proposed MC Executive Director position would technically become a program director within
the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce.
The MC Board would oversee the MC Executive Director and Mobility Choice would promulgate a
charter or operating agreement to be approved by the MC Board.
The Mobility Choice Executive Director would be part of the project management team. The
Executive Director would determine whether sufficient funding existed to conduct public outreach
and would look for pilot programs to initiate new transportation modes, among other study
leadership and management responsibilities.
The MC Board has made it clear that MC Board members represent the entire MC Board, rather
than private interests.

Mobility Choice Study





Mobility Choice would include examination of, for example, first/last mile transit, bicycle and
pedestrian access, bus feeder systems, and interactions with transportation network companies
(such as Uber and Lyft).
Colorado academic institutions did not respond to the initial Mobility Choice Request for Interest
(RFI). Academic institutions, however, may respond to the forthcoming Request for Proposal
(RFP) as a project lead or as part of a technical team.
The consultant selection process would be similar to a CDOT or RTD selection process. Private
MC Board members do not have any financial interest in the firms that would conduct the study.
The study would be completed in approximately nine months.

DISCUSSION
The stated purpose of the Mobility Choice Blueprint is to: Maximize existing investments in our
transportation system; leverage technology to plan for our future workforce; and increase economic
opportunities and quality of life. The attachment provides more details on the proposed Mobility Choice
Blueprint Public/Private Initiative. Participating in the Mobility Choice Blueprint Study aligns with the

Packet Pg. 111

12.E

District’s 2018 strategic goal – Fiscal Sustainability – by maximizing partnerships and using innovative
approaches.
In response to the issues raised by the RTD Board in September 2016, the Denver Metro Chamber and
Mobility Choice leadership initiated discussions and identified proposed modifications to the original
approach. A description of the key proposed modifications follows.
A management/organizational structure was developed to clearly articulate RTD, DRCOG and CDOT’s
co-lead roles in managing the technical consultant’s work efforts. Under the structure, a Project
Management Team will have direct oversight of the consultant’s work. The Project Management Team
will be comprised of senior representatives of each of the agencies and one representative from the
Mobility Choice Board. Further, CDOT has agreed to take the lead role in procuring the consultant
services, pursuant to State Procurement Rules; and to administer the consultant contract. As such, if
this action is approved, RTD would enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with CDOT for the
funding of the Study. This approach provides assurance that RTD’s interests will be represented and that
the competitively selected Mobility Choice Blueprint consultant team will be responsive to CDOT, RTD
and DRCOG’s oversight and direction. Further, membership on Mobility Choice Board is to be expanded
with the addition of “2 other economic development organizations” which will serve to broaden the
diversity and geographic representation within the metro area. RTD, DRCOG and CDOT will continue to
have representation on the Mobility Choice Board.
Additionally, the proposed contribution from each of the public agencies, including RTD, has been
decreased to $400,000. Through discussions with public agency staff and Mobility Choice leadership,
and with careful consideration of the planned scope of work, it was determined that this level of funding
will still be satisfactory to achieve the goals and mission of the Study, albeit with less contingency
available. Private sector funding would be used for project administrative support, stakeholder
engagement and ongoing work following study completion.
Once the study is complete, the Blueprint, which includes a significant public involvement process,
would be used to recommend mobility options for RTD, CDOT and DRCOG intended to assure that the
agency’s investments are well-coordinated and aligned to support future technological and related
advances in transportation. The Blueprint recommendations would not be binding on any participating
agency and it will be at the RTD Board’s sole discretion to accept or pursue any of the plans or
recommendations contained within the report. The current plan is for the study to initiate in summer
2017, with completion in early 2018.
To date, CDOT and DRCOG have taken actions to secure their share of funding. DRCOG’s action is
contingent on all three public partners participating at like amounts in funding the technical study work.
RTD Board approval of this funding request will allow RTD to have an equal voice with our planning
partners in the oversight, direction and management of the Blueprint.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this project in the amount of $400,000 is available from the District’s FY 2016/17 Board
Appropriated Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into
any and all agreements required to provide $400,000 in Regional Transportation District funding in

support of the Mobility Choice Blueprint. RTD’s funds are to be used for the technical consultant(s)
selected to conduct the study, in partnership with the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) and the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) as articulated in this Board
report.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not allocate $400,000 to the Mobility Choice Blueprint.
This action is not recommended as it would result in RTD not having a role in the study and could
run counter to RTD’s interests.

MOBILITY CHOICE SUMMARY

Who are the proposed partners?
The four proposed partners are RTD, DRCOG, CDOT and the non-profit Mobility Choice organization.
Mobility Choice is a program of the 501c3 Denver Metro Chamber Leadership Foundation. The
governing board of the Mobility Choice program is composed of large employers, tech-mobility
companies, regional economic organizations, retired local officials, and partnering public agencies.
How is the Blueprint effort funded?
Each of the four partners would allocate $400,000 to the Blueprint effort. DRCOG, CDOT and Mobility
Choice have already committed funding. All of the public agency funds would be directly used to hire
and pay a technical consultant to prepare the Blueprint document. CDOT would manage agency funding
and enter into the agreement with the technical consultant. No public funds will be used to support the
Mobility Choice organization.
What will the Mobility Choice organization provide?
With its funding contribution, the Mobility Choice organization will provide a staff person for the
Blueprint Project Management Team, additional public outreach and education, administration for the
technical effort and the Mobility Choice Board, and identification of potential pilot projects.
What type of technical consultant will prepare the Blueprint?
Consulting transportation companies have been contacted to provide information on how to approach
the Blueprint. Engineering, planning, and strategic transportation consulting firms will respond to a
request for proposal. Academic institutions may also respond as a project lead or as part of a technical
team.
How will the Blueprint be governed?
Each of the four partners would provide a staff person to a Project Management Team. The Project
Management Team will select the technical consultant and oversee preparation of the Blueprint. Each
Project Management Team member will report back to his/her respective agency management and
board.
What are the expected Blueprint outcomes?
The Blueprint will make recommendations for policies, programs and projects that will be affected by
emerging mobility technologies over the next 15 years. The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks plan will be
an input into the Blueprint. The Blueprint will focus on maximizing the investment in the region’s fixed
transit system, identifying new cost-effective approaches to mobility, and effectively connecting all
modes to create an integrated system.

Attachment: MOBILITY CHOICE SUMMARY (3115 : Mobility Choice Blueprint)

What is the Mobility Choice Blueprint?
The Mobility Choice effort is a proposed collaboration to develop a Blueprint, a 15-year strategic
direction for metro Denver transportation that incorporates the effects of rapid technological change on
mobility.
