BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 15, 2013

Subject:

Donation of Vintage Rail

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail, tie plates and wooden ties for
restoration purposes to Como Depot.
BACKGROUND
The vintage rail is located in a land locked area between Evans and East Asbury Avenue. The adjacent
properties include high density housing, storage units and a paint distribution store. The existing rail is a
mix of narrow gauge 80-90 pound connected to wooden ties with plates and steel spikes. RTD has
never or will ever use this weight of rail or our existing light rail service. With no long term plan for
restoration or use, a constrained budget, the opportunity for removal and re-use was considered in the
fall of 2012.
In summer of 2012, RTD was contacted by the Como Depot stating their desire to remove the rail,
wooden ties and plates, restore and reuse them in a historical round house located in Como, Colorado.
The Como Depot, a non-profit historic organization, is in process of refurbishing the historic roundhouse
and hotel which dates back to 1879. Como Depot has partnered with several entities which include
CDOT, State Historical Fund, Colorado Preservation, Denver South Park and Pacific Historical Society,
Park County and South Park National Heritage Area.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties be donated to Como Depot. RTD staff developed an advertisement method,
described below under Discussion, and compiled a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of the vintage rail and components was a Request for Expression of
Interest and Information (REFII). REFII No. 13JB008 was issued on 05/25/2013 and copies of the REFII
were provided to 15 prospective vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency.
The vendor list was:
Como Depot
SRC Industries, Inc.
Railroad Specialties
United Railroad Service Co.
North American Rail Products
Pikes Peak Historical
Littleton Museum
Colorado History
Lakewood Historical Society
Colorado Historical Foundation
Arvada Historical Society

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

Jefferson County Historical
Forney Transportation Museum
Colorado Railroad Museum
Advertisement was closed on 06/12/2013 with two proposals received, one from Como Depot and SRC
Industries, Inc.
On 06/24/2013 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Como Depot more than qualifies them for the project of the Buchtel Vintage Rail, Tie Plate and
Wooden Tie Removal.
Como Depot is willing to accept all aspects listed in the REFII 13HJB008 for the removal of the
vintage rail.
Como Depot funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Como Depot partners include State Historical Fund, CDOT, Colorado Preservation, Denver South
Park and Pacific Historical Society, Park County, South Park National Heritage Area, with others
contributing their time and funds for the Depot restoration.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars, this proposal, if accepted would result in no
expenses for RTD. RTD will not receive any funds in return for these vintage rails, tie plates and
wooden ties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties for restoration purposes to Como Depot.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to donate vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties to Como Depot. Instead, leave the property as is
and do not disturb the vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties. This alternative is not recommended
as RTD has no long-term plan or budget for restoration or reuse of these items.

Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-aRide Call Center services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years, with two one-year
options for a total 5-year amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal represents the most
responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-026, to
provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective October 1, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transportation Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while MV Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, Via
Mobility, and Global Transportation provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility functions
are handled by Easter Seals of Colorado.
On May 29, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to
provide Access-a-Ride Call Center Services. This service represents the re-bid of service currently
provided by First Transit. The RFP was mailed to 11 firms that indicated an interest in proposing on this
service. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on June
28, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Four (4) proposals were received in response to RFP 13-DH-026 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride Call
Center services. Proposals were received from First Transit, MTM, SCR, and Veolia Transportation.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 13-DH-026, that RTD award a contract for Access-a-Ride Call Center service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and
individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (30%); and c) price (30%).

Packet Pg. 6

2.11.B

The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services; Larry Buter,
Manager of Paratransit Services; Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services; David Terada, ITS
Administrator; Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor; and Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety and
Training Compliance Officer.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the four
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Proposed Key Positions.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in
these categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by Veolia Transportation
and MTM. SCR was the lowest rated technical proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each
proposal was calculated by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of
each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted
in First Transit being the highest rated proposal followed by MTM and Veolia Transportation. SCR was
the lowest rated proposal. First Transit received an overall total score of 91 (out of 100); MTM received
an overall total score of 79. Veolia Transportation received a total score of 77 and SCR received an
overall score of 74. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best
proposal in terms of understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed
organization/business plan/approach to deliver the requested service, and proposed price.
First Transit was the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period between
First Transit and MTM was $497,683. The overall rating represents the evaluation process conclusion
that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal outweighed the strengths of the MTM, Veolia,
and SCR proposals. While the strengths of the MTM proposal included an experienced General Manager,
the proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of pay scale for reservationists and for not
identifying a Training Manager. The strengths of the Veolia Transportation proposal included an
experienced Firm, General Manager, and proposed use of “Reveal,” software designed to improve
efficiencies. However, the proposal failed to identify the Scheduling, Reservations, or Dispatch
Supervisors. In addition, the evaluation committee felt that the Veolia Transportation proposal
inadequately scheduled enough resources for both the reservations and dispatch departments. Finally,
the strengths of the SCR proposal included an experienced General Manager, scheduling software
experience, and experience with providing both paratransit and Medicaid transportation services. The
evaluation team was concerned with SCR’s proposed Assistant General Manager who did not meet the
minimum years of experience required in the RFP. In addition, SCR proposed installing “Opti-Run,” a
software designed to assist with creating driver schedules to match service demands. The Access-aRide Division purchased this software several years ago, thereby making the SCR proposal less
advantageous to RTD.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the Access-a-Ride Call Center consistently meets RTD expectations. The team is
experienced in providing Call Center service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and,
consequently, no disruption of service when transitioning to the new contract. First Transit proposed
“Info Manager” software designed to monitor system performance and allows staff to make necessary
adjustments. In addition, First Transit proposed to provide up to 50 Mobile Data Tablets for use in the
anticipated non-dedicated vehicle component of the Access-a-Ride program.

RECOMMENDATION

Packet Pg. 7

2.11.B

It is the recommendation of staff that First Transit be awarded the Access-a-Ride Call Center Contract
for three years with two one-year options for an amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal
represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals
(RFP) 13-DH-026, to provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to the RFP
issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical and price issues
consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
operating the Telephone Information Center (TIC).
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted 2013
amended budget and in the 2014 requested budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and
therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the 2013 budget. Funds will be requested in future
budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MTM, the second ranked proposer. This is not recommended as it
does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process and RTD’s
procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 and March 26, 2013 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for
the I-225 project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, additional
acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary in those areas for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.

Packet Pg. 11

2.12.C

The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.

Subject:

Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride
Facilities)
by
and
between
Regional
Transportation
District
and
Stadium
Management Company, LLC

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real
property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to
the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises
will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this
lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year
funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
BACKGROUND
The West Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement, October, provides for RTD to lease parking
spaces from the stadium for RTD parking. The Full Funding Grant Agreement by and between the
Regional Transportation District and the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit
Administration acknowledges this commitment.
DISCUSSION
The lease of approximately 1,100 parking spaces, known as Lot M, will be for a term of thirty (30)
years. There are provisions in the lease for early termination of the lease in whole or in part in the 3rd
Sublease Year (2016), the tenth Sublease Year (2023) and the 15th Sublease Year (2028). The lease
can be extended twice, each for an additional fifteen (15) year period.
The lease will provide that RTD may retain any and all revenues generated from the parking of vehicles
within the Subleased Premises on all dates during the term with the exception of SMC Event Days. The
SMC shall have the exclusive right to use the Subleased Premises in connection with any event to be
held at the Stadium for fifteen (15) days, guaranteed, and may designate another fifteen (15) days
during each calendar year. SMC shall provide RTD with a written schedule of the dates which SMC
designates as the SMC Use Dates as soon as practicable after SMC’s receipt of each National Football

Award Contract to Supply 103 Cutaway Buses
for access-a-Ride Service

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Supreme Bus for the
purchase of up to 103 new cutaway buses for the access-a-Ride service in the amount not to exceed
$5,228,589, with an option to purchase up to 350 additional cutaway buses over a five year period.

BACKGROUND

RTD uses the cutaway buses for its access-a-Ride service. The buses are based on the cutaway van
chassis and have an average service life of about 5 years. The new buses will replace existing buses
that are five, six, and seven years old, and have reached the end of their service life. The Invitation for
Bid (IFB) for the bus procurement was issued on June 4, 2013. Sealed bids were received on August 6,
2013.

DISCUSSION
Four companies submitted their bids, Supreme Bus, Intermountain Coach, Colorado West and Arizona
Bus Sales. The bidders submitted their costs as follows.

Supreme Bus
Intermountain Coach
Colorado West
Arizona Bus Sales

Bid Price
$50,763
$51,049
$52,167
$52,452

Supreme Bus was found to be the most responsive, responsible low bidder after all submittals and
options had been evaluated.
The new cutaway buses will be based on the Ford E-350 chassis. They will be fully ADA compliant.
They will be equipped with a wheelchair lift and wheelchair tie-down equipment for two wheelchairs.
In addition, they will be equipped with a security camera system.

2.12.E

This contract is for the purchase of 103 cutaway buses in the amount not to exceed $5,228,589. The
funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2013 Adopted Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 350 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Supreme Bus has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of
its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

Authorize the General Manager to award the contract to Supreme Bus for the purchase of
103 cutaway buses to be used for the access-a-Ride service. This is the recommended
alternative.

2.

Award the contract to Intermountain Coach, the second lowest bidder. This is not the
recommended action as it would contradict with RTD’s procurement practice.

3.

Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not desirable as it would
result in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Award Contract to Supply 52 – 60’ Low-Floor
Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to New Flyer of America Inc. for the
purchase of 52 – 60’ low-floor articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $34,636,614, with an option to purchase up to 140 additional articulated buses over a five year
period.

BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 13 years old and have accumulated on average 380,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have become
unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) calls for the replacement of the 9100 Series buses over the next three years, 40 buses in 2013,
40 buses in 2014 and 18 buses in 2015.
On May 28, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the Downtown Denver (18th/19th Street) Circulator
service plan. Twelve (12) of the requested New Flyer articulated buses will be expansion buses to be
used for this service. This initial order includes forty (40) buses to replace forty (40) existing 13-year old
2000 Model Year NABI buses, and twelve (12) expansion buses to be used for the new Downtown
Denver (18th/19th Street) Circulator bus service.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on February 27, 2013 for the procurement of articulated
buses. The RFP solicited proposals that offer buses in different power configurations: clean diesel, CNG,
hybrid electric and battery electric. Proposals were received on May 17, 2013.

DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from four companies: New Flyer, Nova Bus, North American Bus Industries
(NABI) and BYD Motors.
The proposers submitted their costs as follows.

Bus
$637,000

CNG Bus

Staff has performed an in-depth life cycle cost analysis of the different power configurations to
determine the most cost effective and efficient propulsion power system for the new buses.
The hybrid buses are $173,974 (for the series hybrid) or $209,706 (for the parallel hybrid) higher in unit
cost than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able to purchase thirty (30) to thirty-one
(31) hybrid buses for the available budget instead of the forty (40) replacement vehicles desired.
Based on RTD’s experience of 20% better fuel economy for the hybrid buses and its current diesel fuel
purchase price, it would take between 34 and 41 years for the return on investment (ROI) on the hybrid
buses. This far exceeds the twelve (12) year useful life of the vehicle. Accordingly, hybrid vehicles were
eliminated from further consideration.
Current generation electric buses are running on batteries exclusively. They are twice the unit cost of
the diesel buses. They are still experiencing issues such as short operating range – only 155 miles
between battery charges and less than half of RTD normal operating range requirement of 400 miles,
and heavy bus weight. Accordingly, the current electric vehicles were eliminated from further
consideration.
The CNG buses are $61,519 higher in unit cost than the diesel buses. Currently, CNG fuel is about 50%
lower in cost per diesel gallon equivalent than diesel fuel. In order to convert to CNG operations, RTD
must also invest in new CNG stations and safety modifications of existing maintenance and parking
facilities. The CNG stations required for fueling CNG vehicles at two RTD divisions, Platte and East
Metro, are estimated to cost upward of $3,540,000 per each division. The facility modifications to these
two divisions alone to bring them into compliance with fire codes for safe operations of CNG fuel are
estimated to cost up to $8.8 Million for Platte and $12.3 Million for East Metro. The total facility
upgrades for the two divisions are estimated to result in a $28.1 million investment. This analysis does
not include RTD’s Boulder operating division nor any of the four (4) private contractor operating
divisions.
The CNG analysis by staff indicates:




Savings in CNG fuel cost will be more than offset by the higher cost of bus purchase and
upgrading the maintenance and parking facilities.
Prices of natural gas and diesel fuel have been historically extremely volatile. There is no
guarantee that the current pricing advantage of natural gas over diesel fuel will continue into the
future.
There are no significant air quality impacts to convert from diesel to CNG operations. Both new
clean diesel and new CNG buses have significantly lower emissions than the older buses they
replace. The emissions of new clean diesel and CNG buses are considered to be the same.
The CNG facility upgrade will take at least two years to implement. Going with CNG buses will
delay the bus procurement process at least two years.
In the past CNG buses showed higher maintenance costs than diesel buses. However, in the last
several years, CNG engine technology has improved. Even though CNG buses require certain new

Packet Pg. 25

costs for CNG related maintenance such as CNG engine sparkplug replacement and high pressure
fuel system maintenance, staff has assumed CNG and diesel maintenance costs to be equivalent.
The reliability and durability of CNG engines are still questionable at high altitude and cold
weather conditions, coupled with the usage of low energy natural gas available in Denver metro
area.
High altitude conditions cause loss of engine power and hotter engine operating
temperature. Cold weather causes CNG engine starting problems. Denver’s natural gas has lower
energy content than the rest of the country. Low energy gas causes engine operating issues.
CNG is a combustible gas at very high pressure (3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure).
Safety and security for the operation of CNG are of concern.
The high cost CNG stations and associated facility upgrades may become obsolete in 12 years at
the end of life of the buses under this procurement. Electric vehicle technology appears to be the
preferred technology of the future. A number of electric buses are currently in production or
under demonstration by bus manufacturers. As electric bus technology is still in its infancy, it
currently has issues such as high purchase cost and low operating range. In the upcoming years,
it is expected that the technology will advance and production processes will improve, allowing
the bus cost to come down and the operating range to increase.

There are risks that the very large investment in CNG facility upgrades and CNG buses may not pay off;
that the savings on CNG fuel may not be realized due to commodity price fluctuations; that the CNG
technology may become obsolete to better engine technologies currently being demonstrated such as
electric vehicles; and that CNG operational difficulties may be experienced under RTD’s high altitude,
cold climate and low energy natural gas usage. Based on the above considerations, staff has
recommended that RTD stay with clean diesel technology as a good public policy.
The proposals were also rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability.
New Flyer submitted the highest rated proposal in both costs and technical ability. New Flyer’s proposal
is the most responsive, responsible, lowest cost and best value proposal. New Flyer meets and exceeds
RTD technical specification requirements. New Flyer has the experience and qualification in the
manufacture of transit buses, being the largest and financially stable manufacturer in North America.
New Flyer offered a lifetime warranty against bus structure corrosion damage. New Flyer proposed a
delivery schedule that meets the implementation timeline for the Downtown Denver (18th/19th Street)
Circulator service.
The articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their
clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90%
from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count
system and a security digital camera system. The articulated buses for the base transit service will have
two passenger doors and 57 passenger seats. The articulated buses for the Downtown Denver
(18th/19th Street) Circulator service will have three passenger doors and 46 passenger seats. In addition,
the circulator buses will have the exterior BRT package. They will have a progressive and modern look
with aerodynamic and streamlined appearance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This current contract is for the purchase of 52 articulated buses and associated spare components in the
amount not to exceed $34,636,614. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2013 Adopted Budget.

Packet Pg. 26

2.12.F

The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 140 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to New Flyer for the purchase of 52diesel articulated buses and associated spare components. This is the recommended
alternative.

2.

Award the contract to New Flyer for 52 CNG articulated buses.
This is not the
recommended action as it would delay the bus purchase at least two years due to the long
process to construct the CNG fuel stations and modify the maintenance and parking
facilities. CNG requires higher bus purchase costs and multi-million dollar facility costs,
which will offset the CNG fuel savings. There are risks of operational difficulty for CNG
buses in RTD’s high altitude and cold weather conditions, in addition to the availability of
only low energy natural gas in Denver metro area. In addition, no funding has been identified
to finance the necessary capital improvements.

3.

Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost
of the project.
