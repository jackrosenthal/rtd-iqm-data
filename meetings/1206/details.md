## II. August Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Anderson walked through the August Board agenda.  General Manager Washington shared that they had contacted the Board members who had expressed a concern with the sublease agreement between RTD and the Stadium Management Company LLC.  While they understand the issue that has been raised by Director Sisk, RTD has no legal standing to ask for the parking lot to be free.  Director Anderson added that if we look at the total cost to condemn the land and build a parking lot, it would be more expensive than this lease.  General Manager Washington added that right now, there is not much usage but he expects that as the school year kicks in, many of the students at the Auraria campus will figure this out and start to park there.

General Manager Washington shared that the question had been raised about lease versus purchase for the access-a-ride cutaway buses.  CFO Terry Howerter had provided an analysis which was sent to the Board members today. Director Hoy shared that with CNG, the buses would lose 20% of the horsepower and combined with the air would not make CNG a good choice at this time.  General Manager Washington stated that the trend is moving toward electric which is another variable to consider.

Chair Anderson asked for a motion to approve moving the August agenda forward to Board on August 20, 2013.

Motion:              Director Daly made the motion to approve moving the August agenda forward to the August 20 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

## IV. Exception for Board Member Travel

Chair Anderson introduced this item.  The current Board policy allows for Board members to travel to two conferences where the registration costs are paid from the Board office budget.  Board members who would like to travel to an additional conference may submit a request to the Chair of the Board for written approval assuming that they have sufficient funds in their travel budget.

This year, a number of Board members have already attended two conferences.  Chair Anderson stated that she has been approached by a number of Board members who are interested in attending a third conference (Railvolution) and/or the APTA Annual Conference where General Manager Washington will receive the 2013 Outstanding Manager of the Year Award. Railvolution is a very educational and informative rail conference for Board members, especially as we introduce light rail, commuter rail and other rail technologies into our multi-modal operations.  The APTA Annual award is an honor, not only for Phil but for the whole RTD Agency of which the Board members are the governing body.  Where possible, she is encouraging Board members to attend APTA Annual in support of our General Manager.

Because of the importance of these conferences, she asked the Executive Committee to approve a one-time exception for 2013 to our current policy that will allow Board members who have already attended two conferences and have available funds in their budget, to attend the Railvolution and/or APTA Annual Conference.

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to approve a one-time exception in 2013 to the current policy to allow Board members who have already attended two conferences and have available funds in their budget, to attend the Railvolution and/or APTA Annual Conference.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy expressed that we have a conscientious group of Directors who should be able to manage their travel to their travel budget.  He does not think the current policy to request approval has value if the Board members have funds in their account. Director Daly stated we might have had more of a concern when the travel budget was reduced during our budget austerity program.  Chair Anderson expressed this is really a check and balance by having someone to approve that third trip.  This is a good check to have in the policy.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion Passed.

Chair Anderson requested Paula Perdue to please communicate this exception to the Board and work with the Board members regarding their available funds.

- General Manager Washington shared that the grant for livability for the 16th Street Mall (pavers) was approved.  More details to follow.

- Chair Anderson asked if the questions by the RTD Board related to the 16th Street Mall had been answered.  Paula clarified that Director Menten had indicated she will bring her questions pertaining to the 16th Street Mall back to the next meeting.  General Manager Washington indicated that staff can explain the agreement between RTD and the Downtown Denver Partnership.

- Chair Anderson shared that she was a member of the APTA Nominating Committee that met in Dallas, Texas this week to look at the candidates for the Executive positions.  This was a fascinating experience and she learned how this committee follows the Bylaws of APTA, seeks diversity, and tries to make sure this is a well-balanced process.  General Manager Washington was one of the nominees for APTA Vice Chair.  She recused herself from the voting for a potential conflict of interest but expressed the importance of this committee doing what is in the best overall interest of the organization.  The Nominating Committee approved Phil Washington for the position of APTA Vice-Chair.  The Nominating Committee will take forth their recommended slate. They discussed the next step in this process which will probably culminate in a vote at the APTA Annual event in October.  General Manager Washington indicated the current 3-year process includes 2 years up for CEO/GM, and 1 year for Board of Directors or Business unit group.  Chair Anderson concluded by saying she thinks General Manager Washington is a good choice.  He has done a good job with innovation, diversity, the WIN program and has produced great results that can be applied in his role as APTA Vice-Chair.

- Director Walker inquired about the Ethiopia Delegation to Denver and asked if RTD was the only transit agency they will be visiting.  General Manager Washington indicated this was his understanding.  General Manager Washington indicated that they are planning to build the first rail in the Sub-Saharan Rim.  Director Daly noted how wonderful it is that RTD has received the kind of recognition from as far away as Ethiopia that they would want to come talk to RTD.  Director Daly noted that Colorado has a high population of Ethiopians, many of whom are bus drivers.

- Director Daly noted that Minneapolis is addressing some of the same concerns of the effect of electromagnetic interference on sensitive medical equipment.

- Chair Anderson shared that the Eagle P3 Elected officials briefing went well today.  She and Director Hoy were in attendance.  Director Hoy commented people are anticipating seeing the train. Chair Anderson shared that when she attended the rail conference in Philadelphia, she had a chance to go to the factory to see the trains being built.  She also rode the train straight from the airport to the hotel and marveled at how easy the process was. General Manager Washington indicated he will check with Kevin Flynn to see if the trains will have monitors similar to the ones in Philadelphia.

- Director Hoy shared that when he and Director Walker were in Austin, they rode a diesel that was extremely quiet.
