BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Funding Agreement - City of Boulder/HOP for 2021

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a Funding Agreement with the City of Boulder for financial support
for HOP circulator operations within the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas for calendar year 2021 for an amount
not to exceed $978,092.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Erin Vallejos, Manager, Competitive Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder (Boulder) has supplemented RTD’s bus service within the City by providing circulator
bus service, known as the HOP, since October 1994. The HOP provides mobility and access to Boulder’s
commercial areas, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential
developments.
RTD provides extensive bus service to/from and within Boulder and has worked collectively with Boulder
staff to ensure that these services are attractive, effective and complementary for people living, visiting,
and working in the area. The HOP connects to many local and regional RTD bus routes, as well as with
the Downtown Boulder and Boulder Junction at Depot Square Stations.
In early 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the HOP operated 10-minute frequencies during the day
and 15-minute frequencies at night and on weekdays; 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20minute frequencies on Saturday nights; and 15-minute frequencies during the day and 20-minute
frequencies Sunday nights and on holidays. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in
ridership declines, the HOP service was modified to a Saturday schedule on weekdays and on actual
Saturdays. This represents an approximate 20-25% reduction in service hours from pre-pandemic levels.
DISCUSSION
In January of 2021, RTD’s General Manager and CEO, members of her leadership team, as well as staff
met with Boulder and HOP staff to discuss the history and longstanding HOP partnership; the parties
continued commitment to supporting and enhancing the HOP service; and, the planning challenges faced
for the current year given the uncertainty of ridership and COVID-19 recovery. During the meeting
Boulder staff shared that the City’s Amended Budget Process begins in April and requested RTD’s
assistance with service planning and budget efforts for the remainder of 2021.
The agreement is for one year. The first portion of the agreement was executed under the General
Manager and CEO’s authority for the period of January 1 through March 31, 2021 for an amount not to

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

exceed $244,523.
The second portion of the agreement will be for April 1 through December 31, 2021, for an amount not
to exceed $733,569. RTD funding for HOP operations in 2021 is at 60% of the funding level agreed to
in 2020, which was $1,630,154.
From June 2020 through February 2021, HOP ridership has been approximately 468 daily boardings
which is a reduction of 78% from 2019 when daily ridership averaged 2,140 boardings. RTD and
Boulder staff are monitoring ridership regularly, especially as in-person learning resumes at the University
of Colorado Boulder Campus, and are working cooperatively to ensure that service levels can meet
demand. It is important to note, the City of Boulder reported that 65% of HOP ridership is directly linked
to the University of Colorado Boulder Campus.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
HOP operations funding was included in the approved 2021 Budget. Nothing herein obligates RTD to
renew or extend this Agreement.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
June 2021 Proposed Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the June 2021 Service Changes and to authorize the General
Manager or her designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
services are impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the February 2, 2021 Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting, staff shared
with the Board of Directors the plan to launch an overarching enhanced approach to stakeholder
engagement throughout the District, as a continuous effort to foster open dialogue. This is an
opportunity for the Board and staff to hear directly from key stakeholders on RTD matters that matter
most to them. One aspect is conducting a round of stakeholder engagement sessions at the beginning of
each service change process to hear feedback from stakeholders about transit services in their
communities. The stakeholder listening phase is in addition to the public listening phase, which will
begin this month as part of the June service change process. Both the stakeholder feedback and the
public input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
Transit ridership remains significantly lower than pre-COVID levels which is affected by a lack of
commuter activity based on remote working and learning practices that have been effectuated due to
health orders. Moreover, public health orders remain in a protective posture and the agency’s COVID-19
service plan levels are reflective of the current challenges facing the District.
While ridership remains relatively unchanged, a review of ridership at the route/line level does support
increases and adjustments to some route services showing higher levels of ridership. Additionally, transit
system maintenance to improve on-time performance and service reliability is needed on both bus and
rail services. The proposals herein, contain a mix of service enhancements and adjustments that address
transit system connectivity and contract compliance, while maintaining the necessary resource capacity
to support social distancing throughout the transit network.
It is intended that the service adjustments proposed to the current COVID-19 service plan be adopted as
further modification to the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19, 2020 and modified in
January 2021. Many of the routes proposed for service improvements serve vulnerable communities that
are transit dependent. These customers often perform essential jobs and have continued to utilize RTD
services during the pandemic.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected customers;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-19 induced economic slowdown, the
overarching guidance for the proposed June 2021 service changes come from the Board adopted
guidance for COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 3 public meetings conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams and Facebook Live between
March 30th and March 31st. Comments and further details from these meetings have been recorded and

Service Equity Analysis
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines
provides recipients receiving Federal financial assistance with directives for compliance with Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this
Circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately adverse impact on minority or low-income populations.
Staff assessed the 35 proposed June 2021 service changes and the results indicate none of the changes
meet the major service change threshold. Therefore, a service equity analysis is not required per RTD’s
Title VI major service change policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal is designed to be cost neutral.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Safety Management System Quarterly Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 13, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Mike Meader, Assistant General Manager, Safety, Security and Asset Management
Dan McClain, Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Federal regulations 49 CFR Part 674 State Safety Oversight (SSO) Program, administered by the
Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), and 49 CFR Part 673 Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan (PTASP) mandate Rail Transit Agencies develop a PTASP based on a Safety Management System
(SMS) framework.
49 CFR Part 673 requires that RTD identify an Accountable Executive to ensure that the agency’s SMS
is effectively implemented throughout the agency’s public transportation system in compliance with the
State Safety Oversight Program. The Accountable Executive for RTD is the General Manager and CEO.
The CPUC State Safety Oversight Program states the RTD Board of Directors must approve the PTASP
annually prior to its submission to the CPUC. Furthermore, the SSO Program requires the Board receive
regular briefings on the SMS to ensure awareness of the agency’s safety performance and activities on
an ongoing basis.
DISCUSSION
The General Manager and CEO has directed the Chief Safety and Security Officer to provide a quarterly
presentation to the Board of Directors regarding the agency safety performance and status of the SMS
development. The quarterly update will include a discussion of the following:
•
•
•
•

Safety Performance Targets
Safety Performance
Current SMS projects
SMS Development and Review Roadmap

This Discussion Item includes a review of RTD’s 2020 safety performance and the first quarter 2021
safety performance across the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.
