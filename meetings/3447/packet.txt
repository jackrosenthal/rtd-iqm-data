BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Schedule for In-person and Remote Meetings

February 23, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2023 Schedule (Schedule) for In-person and Virtual Meetings.
In adopting the Schedule, the Board anticipates holding all standing and ad hoc committee meetings
virtually and holding monthly Board Meetings, Special Board Meetings, and study sessions in-person at
the 1660 Blake Street Offices, commencing with the March 28, Board Meeting, unless otherwise
determined by the Chair in consultation with the Executive Committee.
REPRESENTATIVE
Lynn Guissinger, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since the Board Meeting held on Tuesday, March 24, 2020, and until February 2023, the Board of
Directors has held all its official committee and Board meetings virtually, at first due to physical
distancing practices necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic and later due to the unavailability of the
Board’s primary meeting room at 1660 Blake Street while renovations to the room were taking place.
DISCUSSION
Current local, state, and federal health guidance now allows for individuals, specifically those who are
not displaying signs of illness and who follow proper precautions, to resume meeting in indoor public
places. Further, the renovation work to the Board’s primary meeting room is winding down, although
similar renovations are needed in the Board’s smaller conference room to ensure a welcoming and
accommodating environment for meeting attendees.
During the Tuesday, January 31, 2023, Board Meeting, the Directors discussed options for the
resumption of certain in-person meetings. From this discussion, the following themes emerged:
1. All meetings to be held in-person every other month
2. All meetings to be held virtually
3. All committee/ad hoc meetings to be held virtually, with Board Meetings, Special Board
Meetings, and study sessions to be held in person
4. All monthly meetings for a given month to be held in person on a quarterly basis
5. All meetings to be held in-person

Packet Pg. 5

1.3.1

Board Office staff later polled the Directors and asked them to rank the options by order of preference.
Of the Directors who responded anonymously to the ranked choice polling, a majority of Directors
preferred option 3. In adopting this recommended action, the Board memorializes this ranked-choice poll
to resume holding certain meetings in person, while the remainder will be held virtually, as identified in
the Schedule.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board memorializes the plurality of members’ desire to resume
holding certain meetings in person, while the remainder will be held virtually, as identified in the
Schedule.
The Chair, in consultation with the members of the Executive Committee, may determine that a change
in meeting location for a given meeting, whether virtual or in-person, is necessary or advantageous to
the Board or its committees. Sufficient public notice will be given in the event of any change of meeting
location.
Approval of this recommended action meets the agency’s Strategic Priorities of Community Value and
Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Sufficient funding for anticipated financial impacts associated with this action item is currently allocated
in the 2023 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – February 2023

February 23, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2023 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the District’s elected
officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on January 26, 2023. This report was prepared on February
13, 2023, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting scheduled
for Thursday, February 23, 2023.
Federal
At the federal level, Congress has organized committee assignments and started work to process the
federal budget and annual appropriations process. With a lack of agreement on how to move forward on
the federal debt ceiling, agreement on key spending levels necessary to facilitate the consideration and
passage of annual appropriations bills will be challenging. A key step in the annual appropriations
process is the introduction of President Biden’s budget recommendations. The Federal Fiscal Year (FFY)
2024 White House Budget is expected to be released in early March 2023.

Packet Pg. 7

1.5.1.1

Additionally, at the federal level, RTD Board members and staff participated in the Northwest Mayors
and Commissioners Coalition (NWMCC) annual effort to advocate in Washington, D.C. RTD’s delegation
participated in discussions urging support for a Boulder County US Department of Transportation
Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) Grant application for transit
improvements to CO 119 between Boulder and Longmont. RTD has committed $33 million to the local
funding portion of the grant application. Also among the priorities advocated for in Washington, D.C.
was the advancement of the front range passenger rail project through the Federal Railroad
Administration’s Corridor Identification and Development Program (CIDP). The General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) holds a non-voting seat on the Front Range Passenger Rail District Board of Directors, and
RTD is committed to working in partnership with the Front Range Passenger Rail District.
State
Following the Board’s vote to support and amend House Bill 23-1101 (HB1101) – Ozone Season Transit
Grant Program Flexibility – the House Energy and Environment Committee voted unanimously to adopt
an amendment that achieved the Board’s directives. Specifically, the amendment allowed the unspent
funding eligible to RTD in 2022 to be used during the 2023 grant cycle. The bill as amended was then
passed by the committee in an 8-3 vote. HB1101 was then approved during second reading by the
Committee of the Whole on February 9, 2023, by a vote of 44-18. Staff and contracted state liaisons
will work to support the expeditious passage of HB1101 as the bill is considered in the Senate.
Local
At the local level, staff issued a save-the-date notification for a local elected official meeting that will
take place on March 8, 2023. The meeting will be an opportunity for mayors, county commissioners,
and municipal councilmembers to hear from agency leadership on priority programs and projects.
Subregional Service Council meetings with staff from the local jurisdictions are being planned in April
2023 following the local elected official meeting.
Lastly, staff continues to work on furthering engagement with local elected leaders. On January 30,
2023, an agency delegation including the GM/CEO, Directors, RTD’s Government Relations Officer, and
a representative from the RTD’s local public affairs liaison, Catalyst Public Affairs, met with the Douglas
County Commissioners. The meeting provided a positive opportunity to share updates on agency
initiatives and to receive feedback from the commissioners on prospective areas of focus and avenues
for building stronger partnerships.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Salaried Trustee Appointment

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2023, replacing Leah Riley, Chief
Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer as Trustee with a term expiring
December 31, 2023, replacing Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations with Adam Barnett, Manager,
Total Rewards as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024, extending the December 31, 2022
expired term of Bill Weidenaar, Manager, Technical Services as a Trustee through December 31, 2024,
extending the December 31, 2022 expired term of Director Bob Broom as a Trustee through December
31, 2024 and replacing Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022 with Director
Bobby Dishell as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2024 for the Salaried Employee Defined
Benefit Pension Plan (DB plan) and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
1), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
Trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee Trustees

Packet Pg. 10

2.16.A

who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same Trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
RTD provides a defined benefit pension plan to non-represented (salaried) employees hired before
January 1, 2008, and a defined contribution retirement plan to salaried employees hired thereafter. Each
plan is currently overseen by a Board of Trustees comprised of four RTD staff, two RTD Board members
and the RTD Chief Financial Officer serving as a permanent Trustee. RTD staff Trustees are
recommended to the RTD Board by the General Manager and CEO for appointment and the RTD Board
Chair, with full RTD Board approval, appoints two RTD Board members as Trustees.
This action item seeks Board approval to modify the Trustee composition of these Trusts with the
following:
• Replace Trustee Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer, with Charlene Polege, Chief People
Officer, as a Trustee with a term expiring December 31, 2023
• Replace Trustee Kent Enwright, Manager, Labor Relations, with Adam Barnett, Manager, Total
Rewards, with a term expiring December 31, 2024
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Trustee Bill Weidenaar, Manager,
Technical Services, that expired on December 31, 2022
• Extend through December 31, 2024, the term of current Board member Trustee Director Bob
Broom, whose term expired December 31, 2022
• Replace Board member Trustee Director Peggy Catlin, whose term expired December 31, 2022,
with Director Bobby Dishell to a term expiring December 31, 2024
• No change to current Trustee Bill Sirois, Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, with a term
expiring December 31, 2023
• No change to the Chief Financial Officer position as a permanent member
The above actions will result in a body of seven Trustees with two of those Trustees, Mr. Weidenaar
and Mr. Sirois, being participants in the closed defined benefit pension plan.
The appointment of these Trustees will focus Trust governance with employees who participate in and
represent staff colleagues participating in these retirement plans, have expertise in the areas of human
resources, health and wellness benefits and finance as well as maintain Board participation in the
salaried employee retirement Trusts in its capacity as a policy-making body.
Further, the Trust plan documents will continue to require Board approval for changes in plan design and
annual budget appropriation in addition to any material changes to the plans coming to the Board
through the Audit Committee.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Town of Parker Anthology Annexation

February 14, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the annexation petition from Anthology Management for inclusion
of a 984-acre parcel into the District. Upon approval of this annexation, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, Planning Department
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-106.7, Colorado Revised Statutes, provides a process for areas outside the RTD boundary
to petition into the District. Specifically:
32-9-106.7. Additional district area – petition or election – required filings – definitions. (1) (b) For
any area in an incorporated or unincorporated portion of any county containing multiple parcels of
land, any of which is less than 35 acres and which area is contiguous to any boundary of the district,
the area may be included in the district after one of the following conditions is met:
I.One hundred percent of the owners of the land within the specified area, including the owners of
any land constituting a planned unit development or subdivision, submit a petition to the
board seeking inclusion in the district. The petition shall contain a legal description of the land,
shall state that assent to the inclusion is given by the fee owner or owners thereof, and shall
be acknowledged by the fee owner or owners in the same manner as required for the
conveyance of land.
II.(A) A petition requesting an election for the purpose of including the specified area in the district
signed by at least eight percent of the eligible electors who reside within the geographic
boundaries of the area is submitted to the board. The petition shall contain a legal description
of the area.
Pursuant to 32-9-106.6 (1) (b), Colorado Revised Statutes, any area annexed by an in-District
municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. However, many
properties within the Town of Parker, including the property in question, were annexed to the Town of
Parker prior to 1994 and, accordingly, are not included within the District boundaries, thereby creating a
checkerboard of properties that lie within and outside the boundary.

Packet Pg. 16

2.16.B

The applicant, Anthology Management, owns 100 percent of the property and has submitted an
annexation petition to RTD, which includes a legal description of the property in the Town of Parker. The
petition has been reviewed by Legal Division staff for legal sufficiency; the legal description has been
further reviewed by RTD’s boundary mapping consultant.
The property is in the Town of Parker and contains approximately 984 acres west of South Parker Road
in the general vicinity of an area defined by Motsenbocker Road, Hess Road, Stroh Road and
undeveloped land to the west. The land is mostly vacant, although zoning will allow for a mix of
approximately 23 acres for commercial use with the remaining land zoned as open space and residential
uses, allowing up to 3,082 residential units in a mix of single and multifamily residences.
The land is contiguous with the current District boundary along several boundaries to the north, east and
south side of the land to be annexed. The proposed annexation is located adjacent to Director District G.
Currently, the nearest transit service to the property is provided by the P Regional route, which runs
along South Parker Road, approximately two miles east of the property. The Board-adopted System
Optimization Plan does not envision new service to this area.
DISCUSSION
Upon the Board’s approval of the Anthology Management’s petition, the area would become part of
District G, currently represented by Director Bouquet.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of
Community Value. Currently, much of the Town of Parker is within the RTD boundary, but substantial
pieces lie outside, thereby creating confusion among residents as to whether they are required to pay to
park at Park-n-Rides or whether they are subject to the RTD sales and use tax. Inclusion of additional
areas of the town into the District will serve to alleviate this issue to some extent.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Financial impacts to RTD from this action include an undetermined amount of additional revenue from
sales tax and use taxes from the commercial properties and relatively small amounts from automobile
sales to residents of the area. There may also be future expenditures should RTD opt to expand transit
services to this area. The Board-adopted System Optimization Plan does not envision new service in the
immediate area; however, the Subregional Service Councils and the Call for Projects Partnership Program
provide an avenue for ongoing dialogue and potential funding for new services, if desired.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy
Revisions

February 15, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
February 28, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to the Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, authorizes the district to develop,
maintain, and operate a mass transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.
In order to provide for the safety, convenience, and comfort of all customers, the agency has established
a Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use,
operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles, facilities, or property. To enforce this Code, RTD has
established a Service Suspension Policy (Policy) setting forth procedures and enforcement guidelines.
The Code and Policy are tools in an overarching strategy to maintain a welcoming transit environment
for all RTD employees and customers.
In addition to security personnel and a growing contingent of sworn transit police officers, RTD deploys
a team of mental health clinicians and a full-time outreach coordinator focused on houselessness issues,
in the spirit of firm compassion, to engage with individuals utilizing the system who may be in need of
assistance and those experiencing mental health or substance abuse issues. For several years, the
agency has also engaged with local law enforcement jurisdictions to share resources and information and
bolster the agency’s public safety presence throughout the service area.
Beginning in January 2022, the GM/CEO along with several senior staff members engaged with
representatives from the City and County of Denver, including individuals from Mayor Hancock’s
administration as well as law enforcement, criminal justice, public health, and social services entities, to
form a steering committee focused on mitigating the impacts of unwanted behaviors affecting Denver
Union Station and its surrounding area, as well as other locations in Denver’s central core. The steering
committee and its subcommittees met on a monthly basis with the intent to establish a holistic and
compassionate strategy for the reduction of sales and use of illicit drugs as well as aggressive behaviors

by those not utilizing transit services, patronizing businesses, working, or living in the impacted area.
Staff and contractors are also working towards implementation of additional Crime Prevention through
Environmental Design (CPTED) elements identified through a collaboration with the Denver Police
Department to curb unwelcome behaviors and ensure that multimodal transit hubs are being used by
customers for their intended purpose.
RTD-PD also works closely with WellPower Denver to utilize its Support Team Assisted Response
(STAR) Van, which provides person-centric mobile crisis response to community members experiencing
problems related to mental health, depression, unhouselessness and substance abuse. RTD-PD also
provides support to the Downtown Action Team, which includes members from the Denver Police
Department, Denver Fire Department, Denver Public Works, and outreach organizations that focus on
assisting individuals in the immediate downtown Denver area. RTD-PD have been invited to use the
newly opened AID Center, which stands for “Assessment, Intake, Diversion” and is a drop-off area for
individuals that have committed low level offenses related to theft or shoplifting. The program is
intended to assist these individuals in receiving assistance rather than being subjected to the criminal
system.
During Q4 2022, staff collaborated to craft revisions to the Code and Policy intended to align with both
the Board’s direction regarding the restoration of a welcoming transit environment, pursuant to
Resolution No. 3, Series of 2022, and the recommendations contained in the subsequently published
report from the peer review panel of American Public Transportation Association (APTA) subject matter
experts who convened to assess the agency’s policing model.
The report specifically identified gaps that exposed customers to noncustomers loitering in facilities or
engaging in aberrant or illegal behavior that may jeopardize overall public safety. The recommended
revisions to the Code were made to augment the tools that members of the police department may
employ to address chronic offenders and provides additional opportunities for improvement using
discretion; they strengthen policy but notably remain in alignment with the overall goal of contributing to
the RTD strategic priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership.
In drafting these revisions, staff garnered input and perspectives from the RTD Police Department,
Operations staff, and the Operator Assault Committee (Committee), comprised of representatives from
the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 and the Operations and Administration departments, to
ensure the concerns and experiences of employees and customers were considered. Other employees
were invited to engage with the Committee including Legal Services, Communications and Engagement,
Capital Programs staff, as well as those from the Bus and Rail divisions.
The proposed revisions are intended to provide enforcement tools that are responsive to the present
experiences of RTD’s employees and customers, and do not reduce the expectation that public safety
employees apply alternative problem-solving strategies when engaging community members who suffer
mental health crises, addiction to illegal narcotics, and who are unhoused.

•

Clearly differentiate between Code violations and violations related to criminal offenses
Ensure that the most serious consequences in the Policy are for violent criminal offenses,
including increased penalties for criminal offenses committed against RTD’s employees and
contractors
Ensure that recognized fundamental rights are protected for individuals on RTD property

Code and Policy, based on industry best practices and in alignment with the Board-adopted
Strategic Priorities. Staff will ensure that the Board will be made aware of any such changes prior
to implementation.

Service Suspension Policy Revisions

SUSPENSION CRITERIA
1. Purpose:
In the interest of public safety as well as compliance with federal law, state law and/or the RTD Customer
Code of Conduct Policy, a person may not engage in prohibited conduct on any RTD vehicles, operational
and maintenance facilities, and property, including but not limited to bus shelters, bus stops, rail
platforms, administrative, and/or RTD equipment.
Violation of the above may subject a person to enforcement ranging up to and including the following:
1. A verbal or written Notice of Suspension,
2. Immediate suspension, and/or
3. A criminal citation.
An individual suspended from the transit system will not be entitled to any refund of unused fare media
that may expire during the time of his/her exclusion.
2. RTD Transit Suspension Procedure
Committing a violation of federal law, state law, and/or the RTD Customer Code of Conduct Policy may
be cause for suspension of a person’s privileges to enter upon RTD property and use of the transit system.
Notice of such suspension shall be in a written “Notice of Suspension” form and will notify the person
suspended of the cause, the period of the suspension, appeal procedures, and that failure to comply may
be grounds for criminal prosecution. Only an RTD Transit Police Officer, RTD Transit Security Officer,
RTD Bus/Light Rail/Commuter Rail Line Supervisors, and any Peace Officer may issue a Notice of
Suspension.
RTD Transit Police Officers and RTD Transit Security Officers have the authority to remove, immediately,
a person from RTD property who violates federal law, state law, and/or the Prohibited Conduct set forth
within the RTD Customer Code of Conduct.
The immediate suspension of a customer that frequents RTD transit services functions as a system that
holds customer/s accountable for their actions and promotes the public health and safety, while using
