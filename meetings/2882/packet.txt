Unanimous Consent
A.

Expense Policy Amendment

It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee
that the Board of Directors approve an amendment to the RTD Board of Directors Expense
Policy and Procedures Manual (Expense Policy) regarding the attendance or participation of
a Director’s spouse or significant other or invited guest in a local, transit-related event
when the Director is unable to attend the event.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Core Goal #2 –
Strong & Ethical Leadership.

XII.

Recommended Action
A.

August 2019 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the August 2019 Service Change package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A resulting in an annualized base system cost savings of $856,000 and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments
as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
B.

Approval of General Manager's 2020 Core & Task Goals

It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2020 as
defined in the attached General Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
C.

Approval Pass Program Phasing from 3 to 5 Years

Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing of the price
increase due to the 2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood
EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the
20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and
2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
GM Goals
 GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
D.

Approval FT Litigation Contract Authority

It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of

counsel to represent RTD for an additional $4 million for a total amount not to exceed

TABLE OF CONTENTS

11.A.a

The Regional Transportation District Act, specifically in sections 32-9-114 (d) and
32-9-117, establishes the authority for reimbursement of necessary expenses
pertaining to the activities of the District.
General Policy

Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the District for reasonable expenses
incurred that are necessary to the transaction of official District business. Each
Director must, at all times, exercise sound judgment when incurring and submitting
such expenses, in keeping within the standards and proprieties of an agency
supported by public tax dollars.
Each Director’s annual budget is as follows:
Travel Expense and
Conferences Annually
$6000.00

Local Expense Annually

IT Expenses Annually

$4000.00

1680.00

At the discretion of the Chair, the Board Office may transfer monies between a
Director’s Travel and Local budget accounts to cover expenses incurred or anticipated
to be incurred by the Director. IT expenses eligible for reimbursement are outlined in
Section 5.0, Business Communications. Directors may not transfer monies from their
IT expense budgets to either Local or Travel budgets. A Director may not transfer
expense monies to another Director. The Chair may, at his or her discretion, utilize
monies from the Chair’s discretionary funds to pay for another Director’s travel or
local expenses.
The Board of Directors may choose to periodically limit by way of resolution the
amount annually allocated to the Directors’ expense accounts as the economy and
the fiscal sustainability of the District dictate.
The Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District has taken formal action
to delegate authorization for travel necessary to the transaction of official business
as follows:
1. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, business travel expenses
for Directors to consult with Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Federal
Railroad Administration (FRA), other federal agencies, or the Congressional
Delegation in Washington, D.C., on matters pertaining to RTD activities.
2. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, conference travel
expenses for Directors to attend transit industry related conferences.
3. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, training travel expenses
for Directors to attend educational workshops.
4. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, business travel expenses
for Directors to visit other transit properties.
5. The Chair may authorize, within budget limitations, transit related local travel
and related expenses.

11.A.a

The Chair may choose to deny a request from a Director for travel not covered by
items 1-6 above, refer the request to the Executive Committee, or both. The Chair
may refer any travel request to the Executive Committee without the Chair’s prior
determination on the request.
A Director whose request for travel has been denied by the Chair or the Executive
Committee may appeal for reconsideration of the denial by the full Board. Unless the
travel request is subsequently approved, the Board Office cannot make further travel
arrangements related to the denied trip. A Director is not eligible for reimbursement
for the cost of any unapproved travel costs or arrangements booked by the Director.
The Chair must deny the travel request of any Director who has expended or will
have expended prior to the trip all monies from the Director’s travel budget, unless
the Chair elects to pay for the Director’s trip expenses using the Chair’s discretionary
funds.
The Board of Directors may not incur expenses to any RTD departmental (except
Board Office) or non-departmental budget code. All incurred travel related-expenses
eligible for reimbursement by a Director must be charged to the Director’s travel
Budget.
For any travel in the last three months of service of a Director’s term, the District
cannot reimburse expenses for transit conferences to Directors who have not met
the statutory requirements to be placed on the ballot for re-election or who are term
limited. Special travel requests by these Directors to complete special projects or
those who have been approved to speak on behalf of the agency can be reviewed
for approval by the full Board, within budget limitations.
A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary event expenses
incurred by the Director and a spouse, significant other, or guest if the event is a
local, transit-related event sponsored by RTD. The expenses of the Director and the
Director’s spouse, significant other, or invited guest, are paid from the Director’s
local expense fund. (Resolution 002, Series of 2019).
Directors serve as ambassadors for the entire agency and its mission when attending
local, transit-related events.
A Director is not authorized to delegate that
ambassadorial duty to a spouse or significant other or other invited guest if the
Director is unable to attend such events personally. As such, it is appropriate for any
such other person to refrain from attending an event in a Director’s stead.
While the Colorado Independent Ethics Commission has ruled that Article XXIX of
the State Constitution (also referred to as Amendment 41) pertaining to ethics in
government does not specifically apply to the RTD Board, the recommendation from
RTD’s General Counsel is for Directors to refrain from accepting anything of greater

than nominal value in the exercise of their official duties. A Director who attends,
as a function of his or her official duties, a meal or event for which the expected
value of attendance exceeds $50.00 is responsible for the cost of the Director’s
attendance. Directors may submit itemized receipts for reimbursement, or the Board
Office can make arrangements prior to the meal or event and charge the cost to the
Director’s local expenses.
2.0.

Reimbursable Expenses

To protect the interest of the District and to provide guidelines for the Directors to
follow, the following provisions govern allowances for out of town and local business
related expenses within established budget limits. Only business expenses may be
claimed. The purchase of alcohol is not reimbursable and should not be reflected on
submitted receipts.
In order to be eligible for reimbursement for an ordinary and necessary RTD business
related expense, the Director must submit a proper itemized receipt showing the cost,
time, date, business purpose, and the name and title of any qualifying attendee, if
applicable. An ordinary expense is one that is common and accepted in one’s field
of trade, business or profession. Examples of ordinary and necessary local expenses
include mileage reimbursement, conference or seminar registration fees, parking,
business meeting expenses, and attendance at transit-related or community events
that are considered a necessary part of conducting District business. Political
meetings partisan conferences or political group activities cannot be covered as an
RTD expense.
In order to be reimbursed for meals and event expenses, Directors must submit an
itemized receipt. If meetings between Directors and either employees or business
contacts take place outside of the District office, the meal costs are equally divided
among the Directors attending and charged to each Director’s local expense account
accordingly. Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for meals or event fees
incurred by spouses, significant others, or guests except as described in Section 1.0,
General Policy.
In the event that RTD purchases a table for an event for which not all seats are
claimed by Directors and staff, a Director may request additional seats on a firstcome, first-served basis and may invite a guest at no cost to the Director’s local
expense account.
Expenses for meals submitted without a proper itemized receipt and documentation
of time, place and purpose will only be reimbursed $10.00 at the discretion of the
Chair.
Board or Committee Meetings are typically arranged at the convenience of Directors
to coincide with meal times and are considered a District expense. If meetings
between Directors and employees or business contacts take place outside of the
District offices, the meal cost will be equally divided among the Directors attending

11.A.a

Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for expenses, such as meals, flights,
hotels, etc., whether local or out-of-District, for any non-RTD transit-related business.
This includes expenses incurred by spouses, significant others, guests, or
dependents. In the event that a Director departs from an out-of-district event or
conference earlier than anticipated or stays longer than originally scheduled through
the Board Office, the Director cannot be reimbursed for meals or lodging fees for the
day or days of the early departure or late stay. For any additional airline fees or
charges incurred as the result of a flight change due to an early departure or late
stay, the Director must bear the cost as a personal expense.
The following expense categories may be claimed as a necessary part of
conducting District business:
 Registration fees (with approval and receipt only)
 Air transportation
 Ground transportation and tolls
 Mileage for personal vehicles
 Parking fees
 Lodging and travel internet expenses
 Personal meals for out-of-town travel or approved local conferences, as
outlined in section 4
 Business meeting expenses, both local and travel
 Gratuities – housekeeping, transportation and restaurant with receipts
 Cell phone fees associated with travel
 Rental car
 Postage for District business only
 Toner cartridges
 Other expenses identified for the benefit of the District.
The following expenses are not authorized for reimbursement unless approved by the
Chair:
 Personal expenses such as personal hygiene items, magazines, in-room
movies, in-flight movies, pre boarding fees, laundry, raincoats, childcare,
pet care, etc.
 Travel insurance (note:
All Directors receive Travel and Accident
Insurance, which covers the Director while traveling on district business.
 Alcohol (Reference RTD Drug and Alcohol policy)
 Expenses that are of unusual nature
The Chair has discretion in approving Director expenses. If requested expenses do
not fall within the expense guidelines, the Chair must seek advice and
recommendations from the Executive Committee.
The Chair may authorize Director travel to locations for the purpose of coordinating
with governmental agencies, consultants, contractors, or for participation in

Travel Request Process
3.1. Reservations

Travel arrangements for the RTD Directors are typically handled by the Board Office.
Travel authorizations signed by the Chair are required for all travel. Directors should
contact the office at least 30 days in advance and provide all information needed to
complete the airline and hotel accommodations. If a Director chooses to make his or
her own travel arrangements, all travel confirmations are to be provided to the Board
Office at the time of booking for the purpose of providing travel packets.
When requesting travel arrangements, Directors should provide the following
information to the Board Office:
 Purpose of the trip
 Destination
 Requested arrival and departure time
 Preferred airline and frequent flyer number (if applicable)
 Any applicable discounts, credits or travel miles to be utilized
 Special considerations
 Travel advance required
Unless prior approval is obtained, the Board Office arranges Directors’ travel on the
most economical fare for the required journey and makes every effort to book the
Directors their desired flights and host hotel accommodations. The Board Office
provides travel packets to each Director with the flight and hotel confirmation,
transportation information, a copy of the event registration and agenda, and other
pertinent travel materials, including an envelope for receipts and travel advance, if
requested, as described in Section 3.2, Travel Advance.
Travel requests received less than seven business days before the scheduled trip are
processed based on the most current rates and availability. A travel approval must
be submitted prior to booking any travel, and a travel advance cannot be issued due
to such short notice.
3.2.

Travel Advance

Directors may request a travel advance up to the amount of the $200.00 for
estimated out-of-pocket expense that will be incurred, less any expenses paid directly
by RTD. Advances should be limited to expenses such as registration fees and
lodging (if not pre-paid by RTD), ground transportation, meals, and gratuities.
A Director seeking a travel advance must request the advance for anticipated travel
expenses at least three weeks prior to the expected departure. Cash advances
cannot be granted unless sufficient funds are available in the requesting Director’s
budget account and are issued through General Accounting approximately five days

professional meetings deemed in RTD’s best interest. Attendance will be authorized
if the meeting offers a substantial benefit to the conduct of District business or
enhancing professional advancement of the Director.

11.A.a

4.0.

Travel Arrangements
4.1.

Transportation
4.1.1. Air Transportation
Air transportation for travel to out-of-District conferences and events is typically
arranged by the RTD Board Office. Travel by indirect routes, or inclusion of side-trips
for personal reasons, must be approved by the Chair. Reimbursement for travel
expenses in a host city is allowed one day before the start of a conference or one
day following scheduled conference events where travel scheduling provisions or
same day flight times are not available or convenient, such as when a Director would
need to fly from Denver to Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a
conference with a start day of Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director
to arrive in time for the Sunday meeting start time.
Directors are responsible for any portion of ticket costs resulting from personal side
trips (including hotel, food, ground transportation, and parking). Airfare is calculated
on a pro-rated basis, but under no circumstance is RTD’s expense to exceed the
economy class or equivalent direct-route pricing.
If the RTD air travel is a portion of another planned flight that has been arranged
directly by the Director, a copy of the itinerary and ticket claiming reimbursement
must be provided to the Board Office at the time of booking and with the expense
report form.
A Director is responsible for any first-class, business class, stretch seating, and prorata boarding expenses.
Directors who wish to use their frequent flyer miles (if applicable) must provide the
Board Office with the frequent flyer number at the time of the booking. The Board
Office requests this information in advance, but it is the sole responsibility of the
Director to ensure his or her account has been credited with the frequent flyer mileage
information.
All air transportation credits paid for by RTD are to be utilized in the booking of future
Director travel only and are not for personal use.
4.1.2. Ground Transportation
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual expense of ground
transportation necessary to conduct official business. As a representative for the
transit agency, Directors are expected to utilize the most efficient, timely, and costeffective ground transportation when traveling locally or out of town, namely public
transit, shuttlebus service, transportation network company such as UBER or LYFT,
RTD Board of Directors Expense Policy and Procedures Manual

prior to departure. The Director is responsible for submitting the final expense form
within 30 days after return to the District and must remit any unused cash advance
monies to RTD in the form of a check at the time of submitting the final expense
form.

11.A.a

4.1.3. Car Rental
Car rental expenses are permitted only with prior approval of the RTD Board Chair
and only when absolutely necessary in the event that another means of transportation
is not feasible. Rental car arrangements should be made by the Board Office staff.
Travel between the airport and the hotel or conference center by rental car or other
means are eligible for reimbursement with receipts provided that the Chair has
authorized the rental.
The rental car should be contracted for a size appropriate for the number of
passengers. The Director must include a copy of the rental contract when submitting
the expense report. Reasonable parking and storage fees for rental cars may be
claimed for reimbursement. Note: Travelers must ensure that adequate insurance
coverage is in place by purchasing optional insurance coverage as part of the rental
agreement. Cars are to be refueled before returning to the rental agency.
4.1.4. Personal Vehicles and Travel Outside the District Other Than
by Air
The use of personal vehicles outside of the District is not encouraged. Directors must
have the Chair’s approval prior to using a personal vehicle for official business outside
the boundaries of the District. This includes local conferences covered in Section
4.6, In-State Travel.
If a Director chooses to travel by car or long distance rail rather than by air, the Board
Office staff will follow established guidelines to determine the lowest available flight
cost to and from the destination. If use of a personal vehicle is requested, the
Director is eligible for reimbursement for the cost of mileage up to the maximum
allowable under the Internal Revenue Service guidelines but not to exceed the cost
of air travel to the destination. The cost of the air travel is to be determined by the
Board Office staff prior to the date of travel to determine the amount that may be
reimbursed for mileage. The determination is established by example of other
Director’s airfare for the same trip or by research of the lowest fares. All supporting
documentation must be submitted by the Board Office staff along with the Director’s
expense form.
4.1.5. Mileage Reimbursement
The standard vehicle mileage allowance is determined annually by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Board Office verifies with the RTD Accounts Payable
Supervisor the most current rates at the start of each calendar year and includes this
amount in each Director’s local and travel expense spreadsheet.
All local mileage incurred by a Director is paid through the local expense cost code
to the Director on all submitted travel expense forms. Round-trip travel to the airport

taxi, or rental car, in this order of preference. If a Director pays for the transportation
of other Directors or staff, all names are to be documented on the receipt and expense
report for reimbursement.

11.A.a

4.2. Lodging (Hotel Accommodations)
The Board Office typically books lodging accommodations via P-Card for each
Director attending an out-of-District event. In the event these fees are not pre-paid,
the Director must submit a copy of the official hotel bill with the expense report when
claiming reimbursement.
The Board Office makes reasonable arrangements at the single occupancy rate for
hotel accommodations in accordance with acceptable standards for that location.
For APTA conferences, hotel reservations cannot be booked until the attendee is
registered for the conference. Directors should inform the Board Office staff in a
timely manner they wish to attend a conference, otherwise the conference hotel
could fill up.
Hotels typically require a personal credit card for the person staying at the hotel for
purpose of incidental expenditures. Arrangements made via RTD P-Card only cover
room and tax. Upon check in, the Directors will need to provide the front desk with
their own personal credit cards for miscellaneous expenses. When checking out,
Directors must ensure that their personal credit cards were not charged for room and
tax.
Note* For Directors using a debit or bank card to cover miscellaneous expenses, the
hotel may place a hold on the card in a set amount for the duration of the stay.
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for the actual cost of lodging, including room
charges and taxes. Charges other than room charges or taxes appearing on the hotel
bill may be reimbursable upon submittal of a completed, signed expense report
accompanied by itemized receipts. Directors must use sound judgment in the
selection of lodging in keeping with the purpose of the travel so as to minimize the
cost to the District. Lodging or hotel accommodations billed to a P-Card require
itemized receipts to match to the actual incurred amount.
When a Director is accompanied by another individual, the District is to be billed only
for the single-occupancy rate for lodging. The Director must pay for the difference
between single- and double-occupancy rate for the room, if applicable.
4.3. Meals
Directors are eligible for reimbursement for daily personal meals and gratuities with
the submittal of an itemized receipt and documentation that identifies the time, place,
and business purpose.
Directors may claim reimbursement for travel expenses, including meals and
gratuities, incurred one day before the start of a conference or one day following a
conference where travel scheduling provisions or same-day flight times are not
available or convenient, such as when a Director would need to fly from Denver to

locally is included in this expense if agency-issued transit passes are unable to be
used.

11.A.a

When attending an out-of-District event or conference for which meals are provided,
Directors are expected to reduce the number of meals for which they intend to be
reimbursed by the number of meals that are provided at the event or conference.
However, a Director is eligible for reimbursement for a meal purchased outside of the
conference if the Director submits an itemized receipt explaining the business purpose
for the meal.
4.4. Miscellaneous Expenses
Miscellaneous expenses such as meal gratuities are to be included with each meal
and indicated on the receipt submitted with the expense report. Reasonable gratuities
for baggage handling at airports or the place of lodging upon arrival and departure
are allowable and must be shown as a separate item under “miscellaneous expense”
on the expense report. Baggage fees paid to airlines for travel must be accompanied
with a receipt. Gratuity for housekeeping during lodging is an allowable expense.
Directors are not eligible for reimbursement for personal calls. Calls for District
business are fully reimbursable as long as documentation related to the person called
and the subject of the call is included with the expense report. A Director who claims
reimbursement for monthly cell phone service may not claim a business call as a
separate, additional expense if the call is also included in the monthly service.
Directors traveling out of the country should coordinate with the Board Office to
determine the most cost-effective means of carrying out RTD-related communications
during the time the Director is traveling.
4.5.

In State Travel

Directors travelling within the state but outside the District to attend seminars,
conferences, or transit-related meetings are eligible for reimbursement for travel
expenses so long as the location is more than two-hours’ driving distance each way
or greater than 160 miles from the point of origin. Covered expenses include
registration fees, lodging, standard mileage, and food when accompanied with valid
itemized receipts and expense reports showing time, place, and purpose. Directors
are not eligible for reimbursement for lodging expenses without the prior approval of
the Chair if the location of an event is within two-hours’ driving distance or less than
160 miles from the point of origin. For additional information regarding in state travel
see section 4.1.4 Personal Vehicles and Travel outside the District other than Air.

Washington, D.C., on Saturday to arrive in time for a conference with a start day of
Sunday, and no flights are available for the Director to arrive in time for the Sunday
meeting start. Directors cannot be reimbursed for any day that they may choose to
go early or stay late for personal reasons. (See Section 2.0, Reimbursable Expenses.)
Directors must provide itemized receipts for incurred travel-related expenses.

in, Directors are eligible for reimbursement for an initial home office setup package.
Eligible equipment includes a smart phone, high-speed internet equipment such as a
cable modem and router, fax machine, and printer. The Director is responsible for
selection, use, ownership, loss, and replacement of all equipment after initial
reimbursement by the District. Directors may opt to purchase the equipment or utilize
RTD-owned equipment. Equipment purchased by Directors and reimbursed as part
of the initial $700 set up fee is considered RTD property. All equipment provided by
the District remains the property of the District and must be returned upon the
Director’s departure from office. RTD-owned equipment is subject to RTD rules for
the use and handling of agency-owned equipment, including but not limited to policies
governing the type of information permitted to be stored or accessed on the computer
or smart phone. The total package selected is subject to the $700 initial setup limit.
(Added per the changes in travel and local policy approved November 20, 2007)
In the alternative, Directors may use their existing equipment or may acquire their
own equipment for use in conducting their official duties. To be eligible for
reimbursement for recurring IT expenses, a Director must submit on a monthly basis
documentary evidence such as a telephone bill indicating the time, place, amount,
and business purpose, which is sufficient to meet the IRS requirement for time, place
and business purpose for equipment purchase or usage. The first land-line telephone
into a home is considered personal and cannot be reimbursed as a business expense.
Monthly reimbursement claims that are not accompanied by supporting
documentation are not eligible for reimbursement.
RTD IT covers the cost of each Director’s first technical home visit each year, for the
purpose of providing IT consultation and verification that the Director’s personal or
agency-provided hardware and equipment is in good working order. An outside
vendor, rather than an RTD staff member, is responsible for the technical home visit.
6.0.

Publications

Directors are eligible for an annual allowance of up to $95 for local publications.
Directors should identify, on an annual basis, publications to which they subscribe
and submit their subscription costs on their monthly local expense report.
(Added per the changes in travel and local policy approved November 14, 2006)
7.0.

Conference Registrations

Registration fees for conferences, workshops, or other approved events are typically
pre-paid directly by the Board Office. In circumstances where a Director pays for his
or her own registration fees, the Director is eligible for reimbursement and must
submit with the expense report when claiming reimbursement a receipt or proof of
fee and a copy of the program setting forth any fees for registration.
The Board cannot exceed its budget allocations for conferences, seminars, and other
such events. Out-of-District registration fees for the first two sanctioned events for
each Director are not charged against the Director’s expenses, subject to the

limitations indicated below. Local registration fees are charged to the Directors’ local
expenses. The Chair monitors the Board expenditures on a quarterly basis.
Local Conferences/Seminars

Directors are eligible for reimbursement for expenditures or fees incurred while
attending local seminars, technical meetings, or meetings related to professional
development upon submittal of a local expense report along with appropriate receipts.
Such fees are charged to the Director’s local expense budget.
7.2.

Out of Town Conferences

The Chair is responsible for reviewing Directors’ travel authorization requests to
attend out-of-District conferences, such as APTA conferences and Rail~Volution.
Each Director is permitted to attend up to two such sanctioned out-of-District
conferences each year. Budget permitting, the Chair may choose to permit individual
Directors to attend additional transit industry-related conferences. The Board Office
is responsible for registering attending Directors, and the office pays the registration
fees for the first two sanctioned conferences using the office’s general budget rather
than the Directors’ individual travel expense budgets.
8.0.

Professional Affiliations/Membership Subscriptions

The Regional Transportation District encourages development of Directors through
active membership in professional organizations.
Although membership in
professional affiliations can be an indirect benefit to RTD as an organization, the main
benefit is the development of the Director, by allowing the Director to keep abreast
of trends in their transportation or technology, cultivate networks with other
professionals, and develop skills and ideas to become more effective in their policymaking at RTD. Any memberships that are of an extraordinary cost or that require
approval will go before the Executive Committee for approval.
Membership subscriptions in local chambers or approved organizations are processed
through the RTD Public Relations Office. Directors should submit their membership
requests through the Board office who will track and coordinate with the RTD staff
responsible for payment. Organizations must meet the criteria of being transit-related
and/or necessary to the conduct of business and local community involvement.
Membership requests that do not fit this criterion must be approved through the
General Manager’s budget. The Board policy on Organizational Memberships was
passed in August of 2011.
For budgeted events only, such as the Board Member/Board Support conference
hosted by the Board in 2015, the budget allocations for specific events serve as the
official authorization for the Chair to approve. For out-of-District budgeted events
only, the “RTD Travel Request and Authorization” form and the expense report
require approval from the Chair.

11.A.a

Transit Related Community Events

A Director is eligible for reimbursement for normal, customary expenses associated
with attending an event for the Director and one guest, along with other approved
attendees as approved by the Chair, so long as the event is transit related. The
expenses of the Director and one guest are paid from the Director’s local expense
fund. The approved attendees will come from the general Board Office budget.
10.0. Participation in Community Non-Transit Related Events
Participation in community non-transit related events is supported by RTD with
approval of the benefit to the agency. Such events are essential in getting the
community involved in the mission and vision of RTD. At times the General Manager
or RTD outreach departments purchase a table at a community event and invite
Directors as ambassadors for RTD at no cost to the Director; any other approved
events are paid for out of the Director’s local expense budget. Should a Director
decide to purchase a table for an event in the Director’s community with local
expense funds, any unused seats are to be paid for out of the Director’s local budget
as well.
At no time can a Director’s expense funds or RTD funds be used for any event or
expenditure that is political in nature. For guidance on determining whether an
event or expenditure is political in nature, Directors should consult with RTD
General Counsel.
11.0. Travel Insurance
RTD has in force a special Travel and Accident Policy for Directors while on official
business; therefore, additional travel insurance is not eligible for reimbursement.
12.0. Expense Reports
12.1. Travel Expense Reports
Pursuant to IRS guidelines, a Director must submit a completed expense report to the
Board Office no later than the end of the month following the Director’s return to the
District. (e.g., If the trip was taken in October, the expense report is due no later
than by November 30th). The Executive Committee reserves the right to suspend the
provision of travel arrangements for any Director who is delinquent in submitting an
expense report. If extra time is needed to complete the expense report or the Director
has a valid reason for the delay, the Chair should be notified to make the decision to
extend this timeline.
The Board Office processes an expense report for each Director traveling to an outof-District conference or event. In order to provide processing time for the staff to
meet the deadline for submitting the reports to the Chair, the Directors must submit
original copies of all receipts, invoices, travel itineraries, hotel bills, and associated

documentation for expense reimbursement. Directors should submit a signed expense
report to the Board Office within two weeks after returning from the trip.

Pursuant to IRS guidelines, in order to receive reimbursement for local expenses, a
Director must submit a completed monthly local expense report to the Board Office
within 90 days of the date of the incurred expense. In the months in which no
expenses are incurred or in which the Director does not wish to claim any expense,
the Director must still submit a signed report for the reporting month with zero
balance.
12.3. Expense Records
The Board Office keeps records of each Director’s submitted local and travel
expenses and provides to the Chair a quarterly summary report of all expenses
incurred by the Directors. The Board Office retains a copy of the report for audit
purposes. The Chair may request a written explanation for any outstanding expense
reports.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 5, 2019

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

June 5, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

August 2019 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2019 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized base system cost savings of $856,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
Alongside the implementation of the Board adopted G Line Bus Service Plan, these service proposals are
submitted in an effort to maintain the existing transit network in accordance to RTD’s Service Standards
and Policies. Included is a proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low
ridership and replace the fixed route service with the proposed Platte Valley FlexRide. Proposals affecting
the Broomfield, Golden, Superior FlexRides are also submitted in this proposal. Additionally, a number of
service changes aimed at increasing on-time performance and service reliability are also included. We will
monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: minor adjustment to downtown routing near Wewatta and Delgany
Streets.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $856,000.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2019 service changes has
found no disparate impacts.

Local
Route 3L – East Alameda Avenue
Route 83 - Cherry Creek/ Parker Road
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add an exception bus stop at Speer Boulevard/Washington Street, to serve a developing
high density neighborhood. This change would also provide an alternative to Route 1 on 1st
Avenue. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 4 – Morrison Road
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Implement Saturday service, based on strong weekday midday ridership performance (30
passengers per hour), which will address a life-line weekend neighborhood transportation
gap. Cost impacts anticipated to be an estimated 728 hours and $105,600 annualized.
Route 6 - East 6th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments, focused on peak periods. No cost impacts
anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add one trip and respace all trips from 9th/Clermont to downtown Denver between 7:30am
and 8:30am, in an effort to relieve passenger capacity issues. Additionally, 5 westbound
Route 10 morning trips which currently terminate at 15th Street/Delgany, will instead turn
right from 15th Street onto Wewatta Street, and terminate at Wewatta/17th Street adjacent
to the Wewatta Pavilion at Denver Union Station. Cost impacts anticipated to be an
estimated 255 hours and $21,000 annualized.
Route 31 - Federal Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Early morning and late evening trips will be curtailed on the route’s long-distance pattern
from the existing 112th Ave (FRCC) terminal to 106th & Melody. This is due to a request
by Front Range Community College for RTD to vacate its existing on-campus bus terminal
used by route 31, low ridership on the far north segment of the route to FRCC, and the need
for operator restrooms to be open for the route’s late evening trips. (Pending outcome of
operator test bus). No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue service due to low ridership and replace with new Platte Valley Flex Ride. Due
to low ridership performance, it proposed that this route service be discontinued. Current
ridership performance stands at 10.3 passenger per hour, which falls below the Urban Local

Broomfield FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2016, the Broomfield FlexRide expanded the service area and added a 2nd vehicle
which was funded by a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant applied for by the
City and County of Broomfield. The grant was for 3 years. In 2015 the Flex Ride had
averaged 4.0 boardings per hour operating with one bus and a small service area. The grant
doubled the FlexRide service area. The average boardings per hour from Aug 16-Feb 19
has been 2.9 boardings per hour. Recommendation is to discontinue the 2nd vehicle and
reduce the FlexRide service area to operate with one vehicle. Recommended service area
will have the FlexRide east boundary at Sheridan. Service times for the reduced area will
continue to be 5:30am – 7:00pm. The City and County of Broomfield applied for a new
grant to keep the expanded service area and the 2nd vehicle. If this grant is approved prior

Golden FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2017, the RTD and the City of Golden agreed to a Cost Share Agreement in which
the city agreed to pay for 1 additional vehicle on the Golden FlexRide route. Prior to this
agreement, the RTD FlexRide operated the flex route every 30 minutes with 1 bus. The 2nd
bus on the FlexRide route has the service at every 15 minutes. There are 2 other buses that
operate the “on demand” service in Golden. The boardings per hour for 2018 was at 6.2
boardings per hour. Recommendation is to keep the 2nd bus on the FlexRide route.
Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $132,677 including fuel.

Superior FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2016, the Superior FlexRide began service. The FlexRide was funded by a
Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant applied for by the Town of Superior. The
grant was for 3 years. The average boardings per hour from Aug 16-Feb 19 has been 3.4
boardings per hour. Recommendation is to keep the Superior FlexRide. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $162,830 including fuel.
Platte Valley FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
FlexRide service will replace Route 33 – Platte Valley. Trips will match the Route 33 with
the same times and alignment except that the route will use Lipan rather than Kalamath.
Service will be operated with a small, 14 seat, shuttle type bus. Anticipated cost impacts

Board of County Commissioners

Regional Transportation District (RTD)
Attn: Customer Care Division
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202

To Whom It May Concern:
As staunch supporters of enhanced transit in the Denver Metropolitan area. And, like RTD, as
the Board of County Commissioners move into our own 2020 budget discussions and the
impacts facing our County, we understand the challenges that lay ahead for Boards such as
yourself as you look at the areas you serve.
However, like the City of Golden, there is a concern with the adjustment to fare structure and
proposed service cuts for the W Line and support Golden ' s Resolution No. 2658: A Resolution
of the City Council of the City of Golden Recommending Adjustments to Regional
Transportation District Fare Structure and Service Cuts Affecting the W Rail Line.
As you are aware, the W Line terminates at the Jefferson County Government Center, which is a
location where citizens access a wide range of government services. RTD chose to make this
stop a regional, the only one on the W Line, rather than a local stop, resulting in increased fares
for many of the citizens of our community that can least afford to pay higher rates.
We respectfully ask that you reconsider the decision to make the Jefferson County Government
Center a regional stop and continue to engage the community in identifying ways to increase
ridership and serve the community.

May 2019 RTD Service Change Recommendations for W Line

Purpose of Agenda Item: This item is presented to Council as follow-up to
Council's discussions over the past month regarding potential May 2019 service
changes by the Regional Transportation District (RTD) . The item includes a draft Council
resolution for discussion on February 28th and repeats some previously presented
background material.

Background: RTD evaluates its overall service plan for busses and rail three times a
year. This effort is intended to match the level of service provided within the district to
available resources. Potential service enhancements or reductions are identified and
presented to the public in a series of public meetings, prior to board consideration and
action . In the past, the City of Golden has requested adjustments to the RTD
recommendations, most recently in August 2017 to request that RTD hold off on
reducing the frequency of trains for non-peak (mid-day) hours rail service from 15 minute
to 30 minute frequency. Based in part on our request RTD did not reduce "mid-day"
weekday or Saturday service frequency in those changes that went into effect in January
2018.
On January 19th, 2019, Council was notified by the local RTD Director that a further
Saturday service reduction is under consideration. If enacted , this service reduction
would change the frequency of Saturday "daytime" service from every 15 minutes to
every 30 minutes to match Saturday evening and Sunday all day service. RTD staff
estimates that this service reduction would save approximately $134,000 a year based
upon the reduction from 7 all day trains to six. The recommendation is based upon
Saturday ridership levels below RTD standards.
City Council discussed the infomiation from RTD on January 241h and provided direction
to staff. The primary recommendation was that Council felt a meeting in Golden,
attended. by RTD representatives, would be necessary in order to effectively
communicate about the proposed changes, as well as other local issues related to the
RTD system and operations. The other topics discussed that evening included Golden's

on-going support for transit mobility options and a serious concern about the existing
fare structure and map that places the W Line end of line station just outside the
boundary of having a trip downtown from this station be a "local" fare. The significant
price differential between a local fare at $3.00 and the current "regional" fare of $5.25 for
a trip to downtown Denver is a significant deterrent to ridership.

Following that January 24th, 2019 Council discussion , a community meeting was
scheduled and held on February 13th in City Council Chambers. The meeting was
attended by several staff and board members from RTD, all of City Council, and a
number of Golden citizens. Each Councilor commented on the record for RTD in support
of changing the fare structure and/or map, in opposition to the Saturday cuts, and in
continued support of transit alternatives.

Alternatives: As a result of the February 13th community meeting and City Council
comments, the attached draft resolution has been prepared for Council discussion and
potential action. Council's meeting comments are already on the record but Council may
wish to take the more formal step of adopting a resolution.

Recommendations: Staff recommends that City Council discuss the draft resolution
and determine whether to use the resolution as a more formal response to RTD before
the RTD board's official discussion of the topic on March 25th at 5:30 PM at RTD offices.
Public comment will be accepted at that time.

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
GOLDEN RECOMMENDING ADJUSTMENTS TO REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT FARE STRUCTURE AND
SERVICE CUTS AFFECTING THEW RAIL LINE
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden and its residents and businesses contribute significant amounts
of tax dollar resources to the Regional Transportation District (RTD) system; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden is a staunch supporter of enhanced transit in the Denver
Metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines, individually contributed
local funds to the 2013 establishment of the combination Call and Ride/Flex Route service at the end of
line station ofthe W Rail Line, which service is one of the most successful elements ofRTD' s Call and
Ride program; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines and Jefferson County, are
currently funding a two year pilot program to add an additional Flex Route bus daily, so that the flex route
bus matches the 15 minute headways of the W Line and thereby further enhance ridership of both services
by addressing first and last mile challenges; and
WHEREAS,
Light Rail service to the W Line station in Golden is already burdened by the fare
structure which requires a regional fare from this station to downtown Denver, and therefore should not be
further discouraged by service reductions; and
WHEREAS,
the Golden City Council recognizes the budget constraints faced by the RTD
board, and wishes to make constructive recommendations to both improve system usage and manage costs,
as well as increase local marketing efforts and ridership incentives.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF GOLDEN,
COLORADO
The Golden City Council hereby recommends that the Regional Transportation District Board of
Directors commit to give the most serious consideration to the below recommendations that provide the
opportunity to enhance W Line usage as well as improving local transit for our committed community.
a.

Commit to consider the long-term ridership, system operations, and fiscal implications of
adjusting the fare structure such that the W Line end of line station at the Jefferson County
Government Center is in fare zone B, under the current fare structure. In addition, City Council
urges RTD to take the opportunity, of more overall system transit lines being operational, to
review the entire fare structure related to station locations.

b.

Delay for an additional year those proposed W Line service cuts related to reduction of
headways in Saturday periods currently scheduled for fifteen (15) minute headways in order to
continue to seek ways to boost weekend ridership to match the growth in weekday ridership.

c.

In conjunction with these two recommendations, City Council commits to continue to seek
ways to promote and encourage transit use for the benefit of the community and the entire
region.

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Jeff Dunning, Cooper Langdon, Dan Menter, Brian
Matthews, Pat Heye, Sage Thornbrugh, Miguel Aguilar, Maux Sullivan and Tegan Rice. There were
additional RTD staff member from the Communications Department including Laurie Huff,
Christina Zazueta and Lisa Trujillo. There were 6 members from the public in attendance, along
with Director Peggy Catlin with the RTD Board.
Dianne Lyons - was complimentary of the Flex Ride services that connect to the W Line. Says
they work much better than the Call N Rides used to. She was happy that the G Line was finally
open, but disappointed that it doesn’t connect to the Ward Road Park N Ride. Was interested in
further details about the discount program and appreciative of the update that was given during
the beginning of the meeting. Is especially interested as her son is currently paying a lot of money
for a monthly pass and so that program could really help once implemented. Wanted further
details about exactly how it will be implemented. Was wondering why RTD implemented
commuter rail and didn’t just stick to Light Rail. She really likes the Light Rail and bus service and
doesn’t understand why RTD “switched” to commuter rail. She later made a comment based on
another attendees statements that there should be an educational pamphlet or something to
teach people how to use RTD Next Ride and My Stop because they’re wonderful services and
really help people to know when the bus will get there so they know if it’s delayed or not.
Thomas Quinlan - appreciated the disability card he has through RTD to get a discounted fare.
He relies on RTD services a lot. Wanted to know what stops were being eliminated from the 66
for stop consolidation. Was especially concerned about the stop on Panama Drive that is proposed
to be removed as he uses that stop frequently. Discussed his concerns with buses not being on
time or not even showing up at all. He can’t rely on the bus due to these issues. He also discussed
his displeasure with people getting on the bus that smell like marijuana because he said it causes
him to have a seizure due to a traumatic brain injury he sustained.
Berda Steen - said she attended the meeting because she wanted further details about the
discount program and when exactly it would be implemented. She also expressed her concern
about the 15 bus stop on 15th between Stout and California. She said that frequently there are
cars parked there or in the way of the bus stop, so the bus is unable to pull all the way to the
curb to let passengers off. She was concerned that this is unsafe and especially difficult for those
with limited mobility.
Paolo Salazano - had several concerns. Expressed that he does not believe our on-time
performance data as it is inconsistent with his experience. Wanted to see more detailed report of
the data. It was mentioned that he could get that information via the quarterly reports which are
online. He mentioned that both bus and rail are unreliable and was concerned about the number
of dropped bus trips. He said that only 1/3 of the trips he takes are on-time and cited a recent

Streetsblog article that discussed the rail on-time performance. He also wanted to know what
impact the lawsuit between RTD and DTO will have on the rest of RTD service. Wanted to know
why there is still a driver shortage and what RTD is doing to address on-time performance.
Carol Streamer - was concerned that there aren’t enough Route 11 stops on Mississippi.
Mentioned there used to be one near the shopping center and IHOP. Staff said that no stops have
been removed. Maybe one of the stop signs is missing that staff will look into that.
Samantha Garrett - had questions about the 36L and its reliability. Says it’s either late or early
and she ends up waiting a while for the next bus. Stated that there should be more frequent
service and that it should be more reliable. Expressed interest in getting more involved to do what
she can to help make things better.

Staff in attendance included David Menter, Pat Heye, and Christina Zazueta. There were nine
members from the public in attendance.
Miriam Garcia (interpreted by friend Andrea Martinez) - requested that the current route
31L make a better connection with the B-Line and stated that the route 31L should be retained
even in the August runboard.
Staff explained that in August, as part of the 2016 board-approved G-Line integrated bus and rail
plan that route #31L would be discontinued. Staff explained that for customers desiring to travel
to/from points along north along Pecos, that they could transfer from bus route #19 at the Pecos
Junction Station and take either the B or the G Line to reach DUS. For riders desiring to travel
to/from points along north Federal, they could transfer from bus route #31 at the Clear Creek
Federal Station and take the G Line to reach DUS. In addition, bus routes #19 and #31 would
also be pulling into the Stations to make good connections. Even though a transfer would be
involved, staff explained that riders would have far more trips and times to choose from – as
opposed to having just the 3 morning and 3 afternoon trips currently offered by the 31L.
Laura Gallegos - also asked that Route 31L be retained.
Rocio Aguilar - also asked that Route 31L be retained.
Elmer Smith Jr. - asked that Route 43 retain the bus stops currently proposed for elimination
on Martin Luther King Blvd & Ivy. He stated that he uses the 43 daily and has trouble walking.
He said the bus stops at Ivy are very close to his home.
Glenda Bartels - was concerned about the elimination of Route 33. Staff explained details of
the new Flex-Ride service that would take its place.

Carol Young - expressed a concern and a question about why the G-Line bus changes weren’t
implemented when the G-Line started. Staff explained that RTD wanted to open the G-Line just
as soon as possible following final regulatory approvals, and the final rail approvals did not come
in time to be able to line up with the May bus runboard. The Commenter also complained that
the RTD ‘NEXT RIDE’ app regularly does not work and gives false info. It regularly says ‘no bus
on route’. In addition, the Commenter complained that bus stops were too dark and needed
night-time street lighting or bus stop lighting along 26th Avenue in Wheat Ridge and Edgewater.
Commenter also said that the bus stop on 26th Ave, Eb, at Benton was unsafe, it was on too
narrow of a sidewalk, and needed to be improved. Commenter also complained that MALL
SHUTTLES ‘bunch-up’ too often and that they should be more actively managed. She said she
ended-up walking the entire distance of the MALL at rush hour recently before a shuttle appeared,
and then there were 4 in a row travelling nose-to-tail.
Ethel Williams - wanted to know why Route 31 would not always terminate at FRCC. Staff
explained that after hours Route 31 would operate as far north as 104th Ave. Staff explained the
hours of FRCC (it closes at 10p weekdays and 5p on weekends) and that FRCC administrators
were increasingly concerned with campus security. She also stated that the bus stop on
Broadway, Sb, at 6th Ave needed night-time street lighting or bus stop lighting.
Gordon D. - expressed a concern and a question about bus on-time performance (OTP). RTD
staff explained how OTP data is captured by the fleet and that staff looked at performance reports
monthly and that those reports lead to some action to help improve OTP at most every runboard
change. For example, in the August runboard, there are at least 7 routes that have running time
adjustments noted in the flyers, and these changes are intended to help adjust on-time
performance. Stop reductions, as proposed by route 66 in the August runboard, is another way
staff is working to help improve bus route reliability and speed service. Gordon also complained
that RTD’s Nest Ride app often provides erroneous information and that Google maps transit
information is better. Gordon also complained that operator turnover seemed especially high on
the FF4, and that operators needed more training about the routes and route turns they were
driving. FF4 operators regularly pass up riders at the Wewatta/Delgany & Park Ave bus stop.

Bob Broom, General Manager Performance &
Oversight Committee

Date:

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

Approval of General Manager's 2020 Core &
Task Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2020 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and
Staff Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals consistent with the
RTD employee evaluation process as well as elements of the approved GM contract approved in 2018.
This action item formalizes that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2020 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 4, 2019 GMOC committee. This approval will move to the June 11, 2019 Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee and then to the full Board for final approval on June 18, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation memo which identifies the five
core goals for 2020 and the 5 task goals for 2020. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for
2020 is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2020 Goals.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2020 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2020 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.

Re:

Proposed Core and Task Goals for 2020

This memo presents the proposed 2020 GM core and task goals in a memo, bullet point
format. For each core and task goal, the overall goal is listed followed by the criteria for
needs improvement, achieved goal, and exceeded expectations. The task goals are based
on the five strategic priorities from the 2019 Board/Senior Leadership Team retreat in
March 2019, the subsequent 2020 tactical plan, and the Board input/comments received
from the Board at the April 23 Tactical Plan Study Session presentation. Fiscal
sustainability applies to all goals. A common theme regarding the Board comments were
around the Address Transit Equity strategic priority including service coverage and
demographics. There are a number of specific goals to address these comments under
the strategic priorities of Address Transit Equity, Enhance Current and Future
Transportation Methods, and Increase Ridership. The proposed core and task goals will
be discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
meeting. This memo includes agreed upon changes as discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee meeting.

This memo presents the proposed 2020 GM core and task goals in a memo, bullet point
format. For each core and task goal, the overall goal is listed followed by the criteria for

sustainability applies to all goals. A common theme regarding the Board comments were
around the Address Transit Equity strategic priority including service coverage and
demographics. There are a number of specific goals to address these comments under
the strategic priorities of Address Transit Equity, Enhance Current and Future

be discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee

to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019
and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
GM Goals
 GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
When the Board passed the new fare structure and pricing in September 2018, they requested that staff
continue to work with stakeholders on implementation issues particularly in the area of the CollegePass
program. Based on the Board’s direction, RTD staff has had many meetings with stakeholders over the
last 6 months and have looked into the many requests that we received. For example: Could we allow
CollegePass and EcoPass holders at the age of 19 and under to be priced at the 70% Youth discount?
Would we be open to having the tap data that is used for pricing to be audited? Would we be willing to
phase the price increases for CollegePass over 5 years instead of 3 years?
Staff has researched various options and has agreed to have the tap data audited by our financial
auditing firm on a three (3) year basis. In addition, we looked at the option of applying the youth
discount to the CollegePass program and phasing the price increases for the CollegePass over 5 years
instead of 3 years. Although we will not be pursuing the youth discount for CollegePass at this time,
there is merit in looking at expanding the phase-in period for CollegePass. The results are below. We
looked at applying the 5 year phase-in period to the CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and EcoPass as
these pass programs have similar program attributes and financial impacts to the customer and RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff has spent the last several months working with our consultants to model the impacts of spreading
the implementation of the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass pricing changes over 5
years instead of 3 years. Currently the increase for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
increases are capped at 20% in years 2019 and 2020 with the entire increase implemented in year
2021. This was a proposal from the Pass Working Group and was adopted by the Board.

Packet Pg. 93

12.D

The new proposal would move the phasing of the price increase from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5
year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and
2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.

The Modeling Assumptions Were as Follows:
 The revenue & ridership impact of extending the phasing are based on the model assumptions,
namely the degree of retention of organziations given price increases
 Modeling assumptions regarding retention were used to provide conservative revenue estimates
for price increases for pass program organizations
 Modeling assumed that all Colleges, Large Employers, and Master EcoPass contracts would remain
in RTD’s pass programs in both phasing scenarios.

Title VI Impacts:
 Phasing over 5 vs 3 years would not be considered a fare change
 To understand how the phasing would impact the overall average fare increase of riders in 2021, a
comparision of the increase in average fare for minority and low-income riders were compared to
all riders
 The percentage point change in the average fare between protected riders and all riders is within
RTD’s +/- 5% threshold under either phasing timeframe

Packet Pg. 94

12.D

FINANCIAL IMPACT
 Extending phasing would result in identical ridership but a loss in revenue in 2021 and 2022
 Estimated Revenue Loss
o 2021 - $1.5 million to $2.5 million
o 2022 - $1.5 million to $2.0 million
o 2023 - $0 to $500,000
o Total 2021-2023 is between $3 million and $5 million
 These estimated revenue changes will be incorporated in the upcoming 2020-2025 Mid-Term
Financial Plan, if this change is approved by the Board.
ALTERNATIVES
 Recommended Alternative: It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing
of the price increase due to the 2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood
EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20%
cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the
full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
 Other Alternative: Do not approve this action. The structure for phasing in the pass program
fare increase would stay the same.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute contracts, including contract
amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional
$4 million for a total amount not to exceed $12.5 million.
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD has received certain claims from its contractors for both the Eagle P3 and NMRL Projects that have
led to alternative dispute resolution and litigation in Denver District Court. RTD has engaged certain law
firms to assist RTD’s General Counsel and the RTD Legal Services Division (RTD Law) in providing legal
representation concerning these various claims. The approved budgets for 2018 and 2019 included
funding designated and available for these litigation costs. In May 2018, this Board approved a
recommended action for contract authority up to a total of $8.5 million in litigation costs. At that time,
the requested amount was RTD Law’s best estimate of funding required for 2018. However, RTD Law
advised that if the litigation matters became more complex or otherwise continued into 2019, RTD Law
expected that further contract authority would be necessary.
DISCUSSION
For the NMRL Project, this Board approved a resolution of the delay claim pending at the time this Board
approved the prior contract authority. Since that time, RTD’s contractor has given notice of other delay
claims that may proceed to arbitration. In 2019, RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in order to defend
those claims.
For the EAGLE Project, RTD’s Concessionaire Denver Transit Partners (DTP) has filed a complaint against
RTD in Denver District Court. That litigation is ongoing; the court has set a trial to begin in May 2020.
RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in preparation for that trial.
RTD will continue to use in-house legal resources and pursue alternative dispute resolution (settlement
discussions) to try to limit expenses. Contracts for outside services are procured competitively in
accordance with RTD procurement standards.

Packet Pg. 96

12.E

FINANCIAL IMPACT (If any)
This recommendation will be completed primarily with funding from the Board-approved 2019 FasTracks
project budgets.
ALTERNATIVES (if any)
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance and Administration
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
negotiate and execute contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to
engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional $4 million for a total amount not
to exceed $12.5 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the Recommended Action is not approved, the
General Counsel would use the current contract authority available and then seek to obtain Board
approval for individual contracts or amendments. While RTD Law intends to represent RTD on
certain disputes or to partner with outside counsel to reduce costs, the primary litigation matters
require a large law firm with more resources and depth of expertise beyond the capacity of RTD
Law. The Board’s failure to provide the requested contractual authority could impair RTD’s ability
to satisfy its legal obligations and act in its own best interest in defending pending claims, as well
as delay completion of FasTracks projects.

Introduction and Program Overview
This initial report has been prepared by RTD staff as the first of a proposed series of detailed
responses to the RTD Board of Directors’ Resolution Number 004, Series of 2019, adopted on
April 16, 2019, addressing this agency’s continuing commitment to complete FasTracks and to
explore the construction and operation of a Peak Service Plan in the Northwest Corridor. A copy
of that Resolution is attached as Appendix A. That Resolution identifies four corridors and
extensions that have not been completed as of this date, nor have funds for their completion
been identified or committed: 1) the Northwest Corridor from Westminster to Longmont; 2) the
North Metro Corridor from 124th Avenue to State Highway 7; 3) the Central Corridor Extension
from 30th and Downing to 38th and Blake; and 4) the Southwest Corridor Extension from Mineral
to C-470 and Lucent. Collectively, these projects were identified as the “Unfinished Corridors” in

AF
T

the Board Resolution.
The April 16, 2019 Board Resolution directs “RTD staff to investigate and research all
reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and operation of the Unfinished Corridors and
creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a
report to the Board . . . outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward on these
Unfinished Corridors.” Additionally, that Resolution directs RTD staff to report to the Board

R

“outlining proposed steps appropriately moving forward on the [Peak Service] Plan.” (Appendix
A, April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)

D

The ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and illustrative,
laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive dialogue with the
voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most promising of these can be
further refined and pursued. As indicated above, this is the initial report to the Board regarding
these matters. As directed, this report identifies proposed steps to be taken in order to
accomplish the will of the Board. Over time, following the collaborative communications that will
take place, especially with the Board, RTD staff will refine these steps in order to present
further reports addressing “reasonable cost-savings measures for construction and operation of
the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as
reasonably possible,” and “will proceed in a commercially reasonable manner to explore,
analyze, fund and facilitate construction and operation of the Peak Service Plan.” (Appendix A,
April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)
The Board should note that the sales and use tax forecasts used in preparing the financial
scenarios in this report are based on the latest CU Leeds School of Business forecasts, and will
change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to
change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD Mid-Term Financial Plan, Long-Range

Financial Plan and Budget. Also, as further explained in the FasTracks Funding Scenarios section
of this report, the Base System unrestricted fund balance under all scenarios presented is
negative between the years 2021 and 2049. Other key inputs such as capital and O&M costs
are estimates and also subject to change. Of particular note, for the purpose of the Northwest
Rail Peak Service Plan, RTD has updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost estimates using an
approach that we believe is conservative, however, as described in the Northwest Rail Peak
Service Plan section of this report, these order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided
by, nor reviewed by, the BNSF railroad.
The June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” (included as Appendix B)
provides: an overview of the Program; a brief history of progress, challenges and key decision-

AF
T

points; a summary of the current status; and a financial overview. That document provides
detail on the variety of factors that impacted the FasTracks Program in the years between voter
approval in 2004 and today, including those highlighted in the Board Resolution: “(a) the
requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and new signal systems and
commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that all but one of the trains be electricpowered rather than diesel-powered; (c) additional EIS and local government drainage and
traffic requirements; (d) an increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased
costs for construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009” (Appendix A, April

R

16, 2019 Resolution, sixth Whereas clause.)

To repeat, this will be an iterative process. This initial report is intended to provide an overview

D

of the issues, a background and history of the FasTracks project, an assessment of the current
situation, a series of possible funding scenarios, a discussion of creative funding options, and
supporting Appendices. With the benefit of Board consideration and further input, RTD staff will
continue in the refinement of these proposed steps and will regularly report back to the Board
for information, guidance and approval.

Background
The 2004 FasTracks Plan (Appendix C) and ballot language (Appendix D) included more than
the construction of the completed rapid transit corridors and the Unfinished Corridors.
Regarding the use of the sales and use tax increase and the bond proceeds the ballot language
states: “…to be used and spent for the construction and operation of a fixed guide way mass
transit system, the construction of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement
of existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service ” (emphasis added).
To implement the increased bus service component, the adopted FasTracks Plan included the
following enhancements: “Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit”; and “Suburb to Suburb
Service”. Funding for these Base System service increases was included in the 2004 FasTracks

AF
T

financial plan. Consistent with that financial plan, in January 2006, RTD began a financial
contribution from FasTracks to the Base System bus services equivalent to 1% of total bus
service hours each year, anticipated to continue through 2020. The intent was that the
contribution would increase starting in 2021 to 1½ % per year through 2025.
On December 18, 2012, the RTD Board of Director’s voted to fund the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) in part by capping future enhanced bus service to 2013 levels plus

R

inflation (CPI). Between 2006 and 2013, prior to the FISA action, $73.5 million in total was
contributed for this service. It is estimated that between 2014 and 2025, $396 million in total
would have been used for enhanced bus service without the FISA action. In the absence of
change in the FISA policy, $230 million will have been provided for this enhanced bus service by

D

2025. The difference of $166 million will have instead been redirected to the FISA.
The 2019 Adopted Budget includes a FISA contribution of $13.4 million in 2019 based on this
bus service cap. This funding equates to approximately 133,000 revenue service hours. For
comparison this is approximately equivalent to the current service levels of: the routes 15 and
16; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 100, 128 and 130.
By 2025, the contribution to the FISA is estimated to increase to $21.7 million. This funding
equates to approximately 185,000 revenue service hours. For comparison, this is approximately
equivalent to the 2019 service levels of: the routes 15, 16 and 31; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 92,
100, 120, 128, 130, and 169; OR all local service in Boulder.
The following table provides FasTracks Program costs through 2020, including those expended
through 2018 and the total capital costs committed through 2020, the year service is scheduled
to start on the North Metro line to 124th Avenue, the final corridor for which to date funding has
been identified.

Southwest Extension
The Southwest Extension is a 2.5-mile double track LRT project that would extend the C and D
lines from the existing Mineral Station to a new station with a 1,000-space Park-n-Ride lot. The
additional station will be located near the C-470 & Lucent Blvd. intersection in Highlands Ranch.
An Environmental Evaluation (EE) was completed for the Southwest Extension in March of 2010
and the RTD Board adopted the mitigation measures from the EE. Limited activity on this
project is currently underway; the District recently made a financial contribution to access

improvements near the proposed park-n-ride lot at the request of Highlands Ranch and the City
of Englewood. Environmental review is largely complete for the project, and engineering design
reached approximately 30 percent. Moving the project forward will require identification of
operating and capital cost funding as shown in the table above.
North Metro Completion
The entire North Metro project envisioned in the FasTracks Plan consists of an 18-mile Electric
Multiple Unit (EMU) corridor going from DUS to SH 7/162nd Avenue. The majority of the
corridor is single track with passing locations in five areas along the corridor. The initial
operating line, from DUS to 124th/Eastlake, is anticipated to begin revenue service in 2020. The
project will utilize the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) at 41st and Fox Street, which

AF
T

will be shared with NWES, the Gold Line and the East Corridor with Denver Transit Partners
maintaining the vehicles and RTD responsible for operations, right-of-way maintenance and
associated operational functions. The project will also share the substations (at Argo---Gold Line
and Sandown—East Corridor) with the EAGLE project.

The first phase of the project terminates at the 124th/Eastlake Station. Completion of the
project north of 124th Avenue as envisioned in the FasTracks Plan will result in additional
stations at 144th and SH 7/162nd. Design work for this future segment was completed up to the

R

30 percent level; additional environmental review and mitigations will also be necessary. Moving
this project forward will require identification of operating and capital cost funding as shown in

D

the table above.

Central Rail Extension

The project, as currently proposed, consists of in-street running LRT connecting the existing L
Line light rail service at 30th and Downing with the 38th and Blake Station on the University of
Colorado A Line (approximately 0.8 mile). Two new stations would be constructed at
33rd/Downing and 35th/Downing. Now referred to as the L Line Extension, the project would
provide rail service between downtown Denver and the 38th & Blake Station, and complete the
“loop” around downtown.
RTD completed a detailed mobility study for the project in 2014, examining several options.
During the study effort, it became clear that the project as currently proposed – in-street LRT
sharing the travelway with vehicular traffic – would operate unreliably. In fact, staff was unable
to write a schedule for the proposed service due to significantly variable travel times between

Based on that analysis, RTD is now working closely with the City and County of Denver as part
of Denver’s downtown transportation planning efforts to define a project that would meet the
intent of the FasTracks plan. When a feasible project is defined – that is, one that would meet
RTD’s service standards for reliability and on-time performance – identification of operating and
capital costs funding, likely in the range shown on the table above, would need to be identified.
Northwest Rail
In order to ready the Northwest Rail (NWR) corridor for final design and construction, RTD
completed an Environmental Evaluation (EE) in 2010. Operational analysis conducted during the
EE found that the maximum service that could be provided, given capacity constraints at
Denver Union Station, would be 30-minute frequencies. The EE recommended 30-minute peak

AF
T

service and one-hour off-peak service, which would provide 55 one-way trips per day. The EE
estimated the corridor cost at approximately $1 billion in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars
depending on how many stations were included in the corridor, as identified below.
The original FasTracks plan assumed eight stations, including Denver Union Station, as follows:
Longmont

•

Gunbarrel, Boulder

•

Boulder Junction

•

Downtown Louisville

•

Flatiron, Broomfield

•

Church Ranch, Westminster

•

Westminster Station

•

Union Station

•

During the EE process, local stakeholders requested four additional stations for the corridor as
follows:
•

Twin Peaks, Longmont

•

East Boulder at 63rd and Arapahoe

•

116th Avenue, Broomfield

•

88th Avenue, Westminster

BNSF Preliminary Engineering
It is informative to understand that the NWR corridor envisions passenger operations on track
that would be shared with the BNSF, which would continue to operate freight traffic in and
through the corridor. This shared track arrangement will require the use of passenger trains
that are compliant with the Federal Railroad Administration’s crash-worthiness standards. It also
means that RTD will need to continue to closely coordinate with the BNSF and to pay the
railroad for access and improvements to their infrastructure (tracks, signals, PTC, Quiet Zones
etc.).
To this end, RTD and BNSF have been working together on this project for over 15 years.
Beginning in 2003 the parties finalized a Letter of Understanding followed by a Memorandum of

AF
T

Understating (MOU) in 2009 and a Contract Agreement in 2010. Through the Contract
Agreement RTD paid BNSF $86 million for the right-of-way and relocations in the segment from
Union Station to Pecos Street, and $9 million for the segment from Pecos to 72ndAvenue
(Westminster Station). The Contract Agreement included NWR Segment 1 from Union Station to
the Westminster Station. The completion of this contract allowed the Eagle P3 project to
proceed, including construction of the B line from Denver Union Station to the Westminster
Station. Additionally, in 2011, RTD paid BNSF $650,000 through a Planning and Support
Agreement to prepare 30% design plans and evaluate operating assumptions for Segment 2

R

(Westminster Station to Longmont) based on two operating scenarios provided by RTD as
follows:
Scenario 1: Peak-Only Service, 18 trips per day, bi-directional service, 20-minute peak
period/peak direction headways, DUS to Longmont, no weekend service;

•

Scenario 2: Opening Day Service, 55 trips per day, bi-directional service, 30-minute peak

D

•

headways/60-minute off-peak headways, weekdays, DUS to Longmont, hourly service
on weekends.
Capital Costs provided by the BNSF as part of this work included upfront costs for purchasing
operating time slots in perpetuity, including double tracking the entire corridor, but not annual
Operating and Maintenance (O&M) costs.
The BNSF cost estimates were as follows:
•

Scenario 1:

$410 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

•

Scenario 2:

$535 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

The BNSF cost estimate did not include costs for items assigned to RTD, such as stations, Parkn-Rides, and vehicles. Based on the costs from the BNSF and the items assigned to RTD, the
2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) estimated the total corridor cost to be $1.035 billion
(2011 dollars). The high-level breakdown was as follows:
•

BNSF corridor improvements: $535 million

•

RTD corridor improvements: $314 million

•

RTD Stations and Park-and-Rides: $129 million

•

Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) maintenance facility $57 million

Northwest Area Mobility Study
In response to the financial challenges RTD faced in delivering the full FasTracks program as
documented in the June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” (Appendix
B), RTD, in collaboration with the Northwest area stakeholders, completed the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) in August 2014. The intent of NAMS was to examine several key items in
the Study area. Three of those areas of analysis were directly related to the NWR corridor and
the findings from the final report found the following:

R

1. Confirm the cost to complete the Northwest Rail:

The cost to complete the NWR corridor from Westminster to Longmont ranged from $1.2 to

D

$1.4 billion (2013 dollars). This estimate was consistent with previous cost estimates.
2. Evaluate feasibility and cost of constructing the Northwest Rail in segments:
The study evaluated the possibility of operational/service and construction phasing options
along the Northwest Rail Line from the current terminus of the B line at Westminster Station
to Longmont. Phasing segments that were evaluated included:
•

116th St/Broomfield

•

Louisville

•

Boulder Transit Village

•

Downtown Longmont

These segments were selected based on a careful examination of technical considerations
including an understanding of BNSF operational requirements to co-exist in this corridor.
The phases outlined were reasonable segments for building the NW Rail project at some

point in the future. BNSF, while not an active participant in the study, did provide a list of
conditions for their further engagement in regard to allowing for the necessary rail
infrastructure construction and agreements which would allow RTD to provide commuter
rail service on the BNSF alignment to Longmont. The operating plan for this phasing
analysis assumed a 30 minute peak and 60 minute off-peak service plan.
The phasing considerations included avoiding grades greater than 1% and avoiding
impacts to BNSF, including accommodating their need to have 10,000 feet of “chambering”
or storage track at the end of the phased segment of commuter rail.
Along with the phasing considerations, RTD also conducted a funding analysis to determine

AF
T

the availability of FasTracks revenue to support a phased build-out of the corridor. The
analysis indicated that while phasing could provide incremental buildout of the corridor,
any FasTracks funding would still be beyond the 2035 timeframe. The Northwest Area
stakeholders and RTD, after careful consideration of study results, determined that given
the funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to secure a railroad
agreement, the completion of the Northwest Rail was no longer a viable near-term goal for
the corridor. The costs, ridership, annual cost per trip and travel time for each segment
from NAMS are summarized in the table below:

3. Evaluate potential alternative routes as an alternate alignment (such as via extending North
Metro Line) to serve Longmont with rail service:
NAMS stated that reaching Longmont via an extension of the North Metro Corridor along the
Union Pacific Boulder Branch was not viable for a variety of reasons. The alignment would
not be cost-effective for the minimal projected ridership; Broomfield, Louisville and Boulder
would not be served by this alignment; and, the alignment was not in the original FasTracks
plan. Furthermore, the proposed alignments contained segments outside the District
boundary.
As part of NAMS, the stakeholders developed a Consensus Statement for prioritizing future
activities in the Northwest area. One request from the stakeholders was for RTD to provide

Peak Service Plan

AF
T

an annual update on the status of the Northwest Rail and any activities that have occurred
to advance the rail forward. On May 22, 2014, the Board approved Resolution No. 006,
which accepted the stakeholder Consensus Statement for prioritization of future activities in
the Northwest area, subject to future Board consideration.

In 2017, acknowledging the NAMS findings that the potential to phase service by segment is

R

not financially viable in the near-term, the local jurisdictional stakeholders requested that
RTD evaluate a limited, starter commuter service so as to reduce potential capital costs as
much as possible. In response, working closely with the local jurisdictional stakeholders,

D

RTD has developed a potential starter commuter service plan for the corridor – the Peak
Service Plan. The proposed service would be as follows:
•

Three trains from Longmont to Denver during the morning peak period; and

•

Three trains from Denver to Longmont during the afternoon peak period.

Stations would be provided at the following locations:
•

Downtown Longmont (1st and Main)

•

Boulder Junction

•

Downtown Louisville

•

Flatiron (Broomfield)

•

Broomfield (116th Avenue)

•

88th Avenue (Westminster)

•

Westminster (currently in operation as the B-Line terminus)

•

Union Station (currently in operation for the B-Line)

14.A.a

Packet Pg. 112

The projected travel time from Longmont to Union Station would be approximately 66
minutes. The estimated 2040 weekday daily ridership would be 1,400 riders.
In support of this report, RTD has also updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost
estimates for the NWR Peak Service Plan using an approach that we believe is conservative.
These updated cost estimates are based on actual commuter rail cost experience for the
Eagle and North Metro projects and on the cost information provided by BNSF through the
2011 work described in this report (which is substantially different from the current NWR
Peak Service Plan). These order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided by, nor
reviewed by, the BNSF railroad. The NWR Peak Service Plan capital cost estimate is $708.2

AF
T

million (2018 dollars).
RTD has also estimated that the incremental cost for completing the full NWR corridor (at a
date subsequent to the initiation of NWR Peak Service Plan) to provide the full level of
service identified in the 2010 Environmental Evaluation (55 trips/day) would be
approximately $871 million (2018 dollars). The total capital cost estimate for first instituting
NWR Peak Service and then subsequently instituting full NWR service, then, is $1.579 billion

R

(2018 dollars), which is higher than the estimated capital cost estimate for constructing the
NWR full service scenario at $1.5 billion (2018 dollars) because of the costs associated with
updating planning, environmental, and engineering work, as well as mobilization and
additional construction costs associated with building the corridor in two phases.

D

RTD’s operating and maintenance cost estimate for the Peak Service Plan scenario is $14
million per year (2018 dollars), while the cost estimate for the NWR full service scenario is
$20.6 million per year (2018 dollars).
Since 2017, RTD has continued to discuss and analyze the NWR Peak Service Plan with
stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the related opportunities and challenges. To
this end, in the summer of 2018, RTD submitted a letter to the BNSF requesting feedback
on the Peak Service Plan. Subsequently, RTD has sent periodic status requests to BNSF and
based on their most recent response, we understand that the railroad is working on a
formal response which will include their feedback on the proposal.

FasTracks Funding Scenarios
Introduction and Modeling Assumptions
RTD annually prepares updated mid-term and long-range financial forecasts for the Base
System and FasTracks. These comprehensive forecasts utilize the latest cost information for
ongoing operations and maintenance, capital commitments, State of Good Repair funding needs
and all related costs needed to maintain service and keep the transit system operational while
meeting the Board of Directors’ priorities. Similarly, the forecasts utilize updated forecasts
regarding all revenue sources, including sales and use tax, farebox, grant revenues and other
sources. Specifically, the sales and use tax revenue forecasts use the latest information (March
2019) provided by the CU Leeds School of Business. These sales and use tax forecasts will
change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to

AF
T

change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD mid-term Financial Plan, long range
financial plan and 2020 budget. Additionally, other key inputs such as Unfinished Corridor
capital and O&M costs are estimates and also subject to change. As documented in the
previously referenced June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” and in
various financial updates to the RTD Board of Directors and to stakeholders and the public, RTD
does not forecast the capacity to proceed with any FasTracks capital investments in the near to
mid-term horizon. Nothing in the intervening time has changed to improve these forecasts.

R

Recognizing these financial constraints, RTD staff has prepared ten FasTracks funding scenarios
with differing assumptions regarding the timing of delivery of Unfinished Corridor projects and

D

regarding the construct of potential future TABOR elections in support of the preparation of this
report. These scenarios extend the financial planning horizon to the year 2050, consistent with
the horizons for the Transportation Transformation (T2) Comprehensive Plan and DRCOG’s
upcoming Regional Transportation Plan.
The forecasts and conclusions presented in this section focus on the FasTracks financial plan.
The related financial forecasts for the RTD Base System for these scenarios have not been
optimized; however, the Base System unrestricted fund balances under these scenarios is
negative between 2021 and 2049. This means that: 1) no Base System Funds are available to
support funding of FasTracks projects; 2) no Base System Funds are available to loan to
FasTracks projects, even if it where permissible to make such loans; and 3) during this
extended period, there will be no capacity to support Base System bus or rail service increases.
In fact, if the negative balances cannot be resolved, there may be the need to cut levels of Base
System bus and light rail service throughout the District. All scenarios are based on the capital
and annual operating and maintenance costs described previously in this report. All revenue,
cost, bonding and associated projections are stated in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars. All

scenarios also assume ongoing operations and maintenance, including vehicle replacements and
capital maintenance, consistent with expected useful life, of all currently open and committed
FasTracks projects.
Scenarios 1a and 1b: No New Bonding Authority or Funding
These Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and use tax authorization (0.4%)
and bonding authority with no new or additional FasTracks bonding authority nor any additional
sales and use tax funds. They do assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required
replacement of previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when
each of the Unfinished Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M
cost estimates contained in this report. Neither scenario allows for completion of the Unfinished

AF
T

Corridors by the year 2050.
Scenario 1a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2039, the Southwest Extension in 2040 and the North Metro
Completion in 2041. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding to finish either the NWR
Peak Service Plan or the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

R

Scenario 1b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042. No other corridors can be completed within the 2050
horizon under this scenario.

D

Scenarios 2a, 2b and 2c: TABOR election for Additional Bonding
Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and
use tax authorization (0.4%), but they also assume that a TABOR election is held prior to 2032
authorizing additional bonding authority. Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios also
assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of previously
purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when each of the Unfinished
Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M cost estimates contained
in this report.
Scenario 2a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2037, the Southwest Extension in 2038, the North Metro Completion in
2039 and the NWR Peak Service Plan in 2048. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding
to finish the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

Scenario 2b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042 in this scenario. Under Scenario 2b, the Central Extension
would be opened in 2047, the Southwest Extension would open in 2048 and the North Metro
Completion would be accomplished in 2049. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding
to finish the NWR Full Service Plan by 2050.
Scenario 2c tests the capacity to finish the NWR Full Service plan given the assumptions
identified. In this case, the NWR Full Service plan corridor could be completed by 2046. Under
this set of assumptions, no other Unfinished Corridor could be completed by the year 2050.

Scenarios 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e: TABOR election with Bonding and Sales Tax

AF
T

Increase
These Scenarios assume that a TABOR election is held in 2021 authorizing both additional sales
and use tax rates and revenue and additional bonding authority starting in 2022. None of these
Scenarios require Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of
previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. All of these scenarios provide for the completion of all
of the Unfinished Corridors prior to the year 2040.
Scenario 3a assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (one-tenth of a penny). It sequences
the NWR Peak Service Plan first, followed by the remaining Unfinished Corridors starting with

R

the least expensive corridor next. It is designed to strike a balance between delivering the
Unfinished Corridors quickly while also minimizing the number and size of debt issuances to
support project delivery. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service Plan in

D

2026, followed by the Central Extension in 2027, the Southwest Extension in 2032, and the
North Metro Completion in 2035. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service
plan by 2039.

Scenario 3b assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (again, one-tenth of a penny). It
sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first, finishing with
construction of the NWR Full Service plan. Under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not
funded with the objective of completing the all Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an
expeditious manner. This scenario allows completion of the Central Extension in 2026, the
Southwest Extension in 2027, the North Metro Completion in 2028 and the NWR Full Service
Plan in 2032.
Scenario 3c assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase. Scenario 3c is a variation on Scenario
3a where the key distinction is an acceleration of the projects accomplished by issuing more
bonds and assuming more debt. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service

Plan in 2026, followed by the Central Extension in 2027, the Southwest Extension in 2028, and
the North Metro Completion in 2030. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service
plan by 2037.
Scenario 3d is a variation of Scenario 3b which tests the impact of a higher sales and use tax
increase at 0.15% (less than one-seventh of a penny). This scenario results in completion the
Central Extension in 2026, the Southwest Extension in 2027, and the North Metro Completion in
2028. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service plan by 2032. Similar to
Scenario 3b, under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not funded with the objective of
completing all the Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an expeditious manner. This scenario
would also allow funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to support Base System

AF
T

priorities and needs.
Scenario 3e assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase and is another variation of Scenario 3b.
It tests a three year delay in the delivery of each of the Unfinished Corridors, allowing both for
larger FasTracks fund balances and for funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to
support Base System priorities and needs. It would allow for the opening of the Central
Extension in 2029, the Southwest Extension in 2030, the North Metro Completion in 2031 and
the NWR Full Service plan in 2035.

Funding, Finance, and Revenue Options
In addition to the FasTracks funding scenarios described in the previous section, other
options are also worth considering. This section presents a wide array of these potential
options. For many, either legislative action or an election under the auspices of TABOR
would be required. RTD staff (with contributions from consultants, stakeholders, and
lobbyists) present these to demonstrate the wide variety of tools available, without
attempting to consider the political viability nor the pros and cons.
1. Federal New Starts and Small Starts grants (Capital Investment Grant Program):

AF
T

For a detailed description of the eligibility of the Unfinished Corridors, please see
the section immediately following entitled “Summary of Federal New Starts or
Small Starts Grant Analysis for Unfinished FasTracks Corridors”.
2. Federal loan/finance options: similar to the scenarios described in the previous
sections, all of these would require repayment and TABOR election authorization.
These options include:
TIFIA (Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act): RTD
previously utilized this funding source for the US 36 BRT project.

•

RRIF (Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing): This funding
source was among those utilized for Denver Union Station.

•

Private activity bonds (originally authorized with the SAFETEA-LU

R

•

D

authorization): These would require a private partner arrangement.

•

Transit GARVEEs (Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles). These are bonds
secured by future transit apportionments, and have been considered by
RTD on previous occasions.

3. Stakeholder Cash Contributions or Loans/Private Equity Contributions or Loans:
with the exception of stakeholder cash contributions, all of these would require
repayment and TABOR election authorization. These options include:
•

Stakeholder Cash Contributions: RTD has previously used this funding
mechanism. Most recently, RTD received a $25 million stakeholder
contribution on the SERE project. RTD has received cash contributions on
other projects but most of the time the contribution is associated with
stakeholder betterments.

•

Stakeholder or Private Entity Loans: This could be a possible funding
source but requires repayment authority through a TABOR election. If
RTD had borrowing authority, it is likely that RTD could issue tax-exempt
debt at a lower cost than borrowing through stakeholders or private
entities. RTD utilized this financing mechanism in the Eagle project.

•

Private Equity Contributions: The private entity will require repayment
and RTD will need to have borrowing authority and would be subject to a
TABOR election. If RTD had borrowing authority, it is likely that RTD
could issue tax-exempt debt at a lower cost than accepting private equity
contributions. RTD utilized this financing mechanism in the Eagle project.

4. Tolled roadway facilities:
There is precedent to direct toll revenues from a highway corridor that is
parallel to a rail project. One recent example is the Metropolitan
Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which is funding the construction

AF
T

•

of the Silver Line to Dulles Airport in northern Virginia (for WMATA).
Tolls not predicated on a parallel facility can be directed to fund transit.
One example is the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority, which issues $400
million in toll-backed bonds each year for transit including SEPTA in
Philadelphia and the Port Authority in Pittsburgh.

•

Congestion pricing in the urban core could potentially be directed to
transit purposes. For example, tolled access to lower Manhattan is slated

R

•

to begin in 2021 with funding directed to MTA. London, Singapore and

D

Stockholm already have congestion pricing in place with funding directed
to transit purposes.

5. VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled) tax on vehicular travel: this option has been
discussed (typically as an alternative to sales tax) on a statewide level during
previous Colorado transportation funding initiatives, but never placed before
voters for consideration.
6. Parking charges: these would be governed by state legislative restrictions and
RTD policies. Potential locations include:
•

RTD park-and-ride lots. The District completed and presented to the
Board an initial examination of daily parking charges for all users in 2016.
The Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan will provide an
opportunity to revisit this option.

•

Municipal parking garages and streets (outside of RTD jurisdiction). This
has not been previously analyzed by the District.

7. Fees collected on other transportation modes/delivery models:
•

Licensing fees collected from private entities predicated on access to RTD
facilities. This could include transportation network companies and
micromobility providers.

•

Fee collected from private companies traveling to and from Denver
International Airport (DEN already collects fees from these entities).

8. Fees for access to anonymized RTD trip data. The District could explore
monetization of data desired by private entities, while simultaneously providing
user privacy and cybersecurity.

9. Property tax (one form of value capture): A special assessment district for value
capture purposes could be established to include commercial properties along a
project corridor. One example is the Dulles corridor, where commercial
properties along the, where commercial properties will generate $750 million to
fund the construction of the Silver Line project.
10. Development impact fees: after establishing boundaries adjacent to a transit

R

corridor, one-time impact fees could be collected on new development to help
find a nearby transit project.

D

11. Marijuana tax: RTD could explore an increased share of revenues collected
within RTD boundaries.
12. State-level transit and rail funds:
•

A potential future physical tie-in between the RTD rail system and a
future statewide passenger rail network could result in funding to
improve or enhance the District’s existing and planned rail infrastructure.

•

CDOT funding: a new statewide funding source, such as a State-wide
ballot measure, could include RTD projects.

13. RTD could explore the sale or lease of air rights over RTD stations. For example,
sale of air rights is a significant revenue source for Union Station in DC.
14. RTD could investigate opportunities to lease rights-of-way to private entities.

Federal-level funding and finance proposals, which were explored, but are not available
under current law or policies:
•

Investment tax credits (RTD sells to a tax-oriented entity, generating revenue to
RTD).

•

Revive PNRS (Projects of National and Regional Significance) funding program:
These are multi-year grants, distributed either competitively or through
earmarks. DUS received a $50 million earmark under this program in SAFETEALU. LA Metro has publicly proposed revival of PNRS.

•

Earmarks: the next infrastructure/surface transportation authorization bill or FY
2021 (not 2020) appropriations bills could include earmarks. While there is no
law against earmarks, the Senate Republican caucus recently adopted a ban on

AF
T

earmarks.
In conclusion, this section has presented an array of creative funding, finance and
revenue mechanisms – some of which have been successfully utilized by RTD in the
past, and many of which have been explored previously, at least preliminarily. While
some of these present challenging levels of complexity and applicability, RTD staff will
actively continue to seek out and evaluate potential regional funding opportunities. This

D

effort will include continuing communication, collaboration and cooperation with the
Metro Mayor’s Caucus, DRCOG, city and county stakeholders and others – all with a view
toward a constructive and productive dialogue designed to implement the Board’s
wishes as stated in the April 16, 2019 Resolution.

Summary of Federal New Starts or Small Starts Grant Analysis for Unfinished
FasTracks Corridors
The 2004 financial plan for FasTracks anticipated Federal Capital Investment Grant
Program funding (New Starts) for the following projects:
•

East (University of Colorado A Line);

•

West (W Line); and

•

Gold (G Line)

RTD was successful in receiving New Starts funding for all three projects. In addition,
RTD applied for and received a Small Starts Construction Grant for the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) in 2016. Federal funding for SERE was made possible based on (1) the
project’s ability to meet Small Starts financial and project justification criteria; and (2) an

AF
T

unprecedented local agency contribution.

At the Board’s request, staff conducted a thorough review of the unfinished FasTracks
corridors to assess the likelihood that these corridors would qualify for Federal New
Starts or Small Starts funding. This exercise, completed in 2016, included a thorough
analysis of FTA project justification criteria (50 percent of overall rating) and local

R

financial commitment criteria (50 percent of overall rating).

FTA rates projects on a five-point scale, from Low to High. You must have at least a
Medium rating for project justification and local financial commitment to qualify for Small

D

Starts or New Starts. The only project that appeared to meet project justification criteria
was the Central Rail Extension, which received a Medium rating for project justification.
North Metro and Northwest Rail received Low ratings for project justification, and the
Southwest Extension received a Medium-Low project justification rating.
In addition, these four projects would not achieve a Medium financial commitment rating
based on current and anticipated RTD financial projections and forecasts. Significant
RTD and non-RTD sources would need to be committed and budgeted to raise the
financial commitment rating above Low. (Note that SERE received an overall financial
rating of High due to significant non-FTA overmatch by RTD and stakeholders).
At this time, only one remaining FasTracks project, the Central Rail Extension, appears a
possible candidate for FTA funding. The other three would be disqualified under project
justification criteria. At this time, all four would be disqualified based on the local
financial commitment criteria. That said, Directors may engage in dialogue with local

Conclusion
In this initial report (the first of an anticipated series of reports), RTD staff has proposed
for the Board’s consideration a series of possible scenarios and options for completing
the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors and implementing the Peak Service Plan as
expeditiously as reasonably possible in a commercially reasonable manner. It remains
clear that, given RTD’s current limited resources, the path forward will require continued
discussions regarding the trade-offs among alternatives. As noted in the Introduction,
the ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and
illustrative, laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive
dialogue with the voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most
promising of these can be further refined and pursued.

AF
T

The scope of work for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp
Plan), authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in May 2019, includes opportunities for
further in-depth analysis and dialogue regarding many of these topics. Between now
and the adoption of the T2 Comp Plan, we will have laid the groundwork and provided
the Board opportunities to address how to:

Balance various existing and anticipated mobility options to meet the District’s
transportation needs; and

•

Proceed forward with completing the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors within a
comprehensive, sustainable framework for the future.

includes: an overview of the original 2004 FasTracks Program; accomplishments to date;
modifications to delivery, costs and schedule; current financial status; as well as a summary of
next steps.
FasTracks Program Overview
The FasTracks Program was created through extensive stakeholder partnerships to provide
much-needed transit improvements to the Denver Metro area. The 2004 FasTracks Plan
(included as Appendix A) envisioned the program as a 12-year, $4.7 billion series of transit
improvements and additions. The plan’s goals included:



Provide improved transportation choices and options to the citizens of the district;
Increase transit mode share during peak travel times; and



Establish a proactive plan that balances transit needs with future regional growth.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

The following map identifies the key elements included in the 2004 FasTracks Plan, including:


119 miles of light rail and commuter rail: construction of new rapid transit in six
corridors and existing rapid transit enhancements and extensions in three corridors;




57 new rail/BRT stations;
18 miles of bus rapid transit (BRT);



Enhanced bus network and transit hubs (FastConnects);



31 new Park-n-Rides and expansions to nine Park-n-Rides (adding more than 21,000
parking spaces);



The renovation of Denver Union Station into a major multimodal center providing access
to nearly every rapid transit line and regional buses, local circulators and intercity
rail/bus service;



Transit facilities and amenities to improve safety, convenience and use of the transit
system; and



Opportunities for transit-oriented development (TOD).

History
Following passage of FasTracks, RTD initiated work on preliminary engineering and
environmental clearances for the FasTracks Corridors. In 2006, as a result of safety concerns
(and partially in response to a deadly 2005 rail accident in California) the freight railroads
mandated that only Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) compliant passenger rail vehicles
would be allowed to operate in their rights-of-way. This eventually led to a change in scope and
technology for the Gold Line from light rail to commuter rail. Concurrently, in 2006 – 2007 RTD
undertook capital and operating cost analyses of commuter rail technologies for the East, North
Metro, Northwest Rail and Gold Line Corridors. Capital cost estimation for these corridors in the
original FasTracks Plan assumed diesel technologies, which have lower up-front construction
costs. However, RTD determined, based on multiple factors including lower forecasted
operating costs, that Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) technology would have lower life-cycle costs
than diesel for the East, North Metro and Gold Line Corridors. The choice of EMU technology
was also influenced by the desires of local governments and citizens, expressed during the
course of the environmental clearances, for electric-powered rather than diesel-powered
commuter rail. This decision resulted in higher capital costs for these corridors based on
infrastructure (such as overhead catenary), vehicle and right-of-way requirements. In 2008, the
federal government’s requirement that FRA compliant passenger railroads install Positive Train
Control systems to enhance safety added an additional capital cost requirement for these
projects that was not included in the 2004 cost estimates for FasTracks.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

In 2007, the FasTracks Program was negatively impacted by decreased sales and use tax
revenues and increased costs of construction materials and was forecast at the time to need an
additional $1.5 billion to deliver the remaining projects in less than a decade. This perfect storm
caused the agency to explore strategic and creative ways to complete FasTracks. The problem
was exacerbated by the country’s slow dive into the 2008 recession. As Denver recovered from
the Great Recession, then Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, and other political and business
leaders supported RTD in using innovative thinking to complete the program. They viewed mass
transit as essential to making Denver a metropolitan force that could compete with cities not
just in the United States, but throughout the world.
RTD began extensive stakeholder outreach and coordination to identify innovative ideas to
complete more of the FasTracks Plan sooner, including determining whether there was support
for an additional tax increase. This outreach included establishing the FasTracks Metro Mayor’s
Task Force to increase the technical understanding of regional stakeholders and elected officials
concerning the FasTracks Program and the agency’s financial plan. This outreach approach
engaged a broad group of elected officials in a multiyear educational/partnering process that
allowed them direct and informal access to a variety of technical and financial resources.

14.A.a

Packet Pg. 133

RTD’s outreach also included extensive interaction with the private sector. RTD immediately
began evaluating whether there were opportunities to implement a Public Private Partnership
(P3) for any of the FasTracks projects. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum, Transformation

Through Transportation (T3), to seek innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon
as possible, enhance customer experience and reduce operational costs. This call for
innovations enticed more than 200 high-level executives from a cross-section of large and small
firms to attend, including engineering, construction and financial firms as well as major
companies not typically involved in transportation projects.
After much research, RTD realized that voters were likely not willing to vote for a tax increase
and decided it was too risky to move forward with an additional ballot initiative given the
economic situation. Therefore, RTD turned its focus to closely collaborating with the private
sector and the public to continue building towards the ultimate FasTracks vision. The
collaborative environment established with regional stakeholders, elected officials and the
private sector resulted in the following major accomplishments for the program:


RTD gained support to move forward with the P3 for the commuter rail line to the
airport (i.e., the Eagle Project), making RTD the first U.S. transit agency to successfully
leverage private-sector investment and federal funding to build a commuter rail system.



RTD received and accepted unsolicited proposals from the private sector that ultimately
resulted in construction of the I-225 corridor and a substantial section of the North
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

Metro corridor.


RTD analyzed the remaining FasTracks projects and determined that the Southeast Rail
Line was a strong candidate for additional federal grant funding. The federal funds,
combined with an unprecedented local contribution provided by the local stakeholders in
the project area, allowed RTD to begin construction on that rail line.



RTD established the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to capture and track any
excess revenues available in a given year so that they could be leveraged in the future
to build the remaining FasTracks projects.

Status
RTD has made significant progress in completing the FasTracks Program to date. Since its
inception, RTD has expended over $5.6 billion on improvements in the region, has stimulated
$2 billion of development around Denver Union Station alone, has provided $1.032 billion of
revenue to small and disadvantaged businesses and has created over 15,000 full-time jobs.
The following table and map provide an overview of the status of completing the FasTracks
Program and the remainder of this report provides a financial overview and the status of each
FasTracks project.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
The 2004 Financial Plan for FasTracks forecast a $4.7 billion capital cost for program build-out
over a 12-year period. The primary revenue source was forecast to be the voter-approved 0.4%
increase in sales and use tax within the District supporting various debt instruments (Bonds,
COPs and a TIFIA loan from the federal government), along with federal grants, “Pay as you go
Cash” and funding support from local jurisdictions. The following table provides the original
funding assumptions for the FasTracks program by source compared to actual and committed
funding sources for the program through 2020.

As described previously, RTD first identified a funding gap for FasTracks in 2007. In a May 2007
report to the Board of Directors (included as Appendix B), staff reported that sales and use tax
collections were trending below original forecasts and that forecasts of future revenues were
also down versus original forecasts. The following chart compares the planned vs. actual sales

To proactively address the funding gap for the FasTracks Program, RTD:


Instituted a more detailed annual FasTracks budget analysis and forecast named the
Annual Program Evaluation (APE).



Conducted extensive public outreach, presenting options for program delivery given
funding constraints.



Applied to the FTA seeking entry into the Public Private Partnership Pilot Program
(Penta-P) for the Gold Line and East corridors, which ultimately led to the successful
award of $1.03 billion in federal funding. The Eagle P3 award resulted in a cost savings
to RTD of $305 million compared with internal estimates, with the savings used to
complete more of the program.



Convened a Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) FasTracks Task Force with representation of
one mayor from each of the FasTracks corridors. This MMC FasTracks Task Force met
regularly, with RTD staff support, over the next several years, asking key questions,
assuring local government understanding of RTD decision-making, and providing RTD
with input.



Several times, over multiple years, RTD considered pursuing an additional election to
increase sales and use tax. RTD finally determined that the economic conditions were
not suitable for an election.



Formed a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of making recommendations
detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement to help
ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force’s recommendations were
approved by the Board of Directors in 2011, with direction to staff to pursue
implementation.



Convened a group of state and local government economic and financial advisors to
review RTD’s sales and use tax forecasting methodology – resulted in having the
University of Colorado Leeds School of Business to prepare all future sales and use tax
revenue forecasts.



Evaluated “Potential Critical Adjustments” (PCAs) for FasTracks, which included possible
changes to the original FasTracks Plan that did not fundamentally alter the length of
corridors, number and general location of station or the types of vehicles.



Held the “Transformation Through Transportation (T3) Industry Forum” to seek private
sector innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon as possible, enhance
customer experience and reduce operational cost.



Revised cost estimates for the Northwest Rail Line, based on inputs from the BNSF
Railway and updated construction costs.



Approved proposal to complete the full I-225 Light Rail Line following a competitive
solicitation that was initially spurred by an unsolicited proposal received by RTD.
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18



Developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) to identify specific cost saving/revenue
enhancing measures that would result in additional short-term funding for the FasTracks
Program.



Developed the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) budget account to identify
and track any additional funds that could be used to complete the FasTracks Program.



Moved forward with constructing the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue in response
to an unsolicited proposal from the private sector.



Received federal funding for the Southeast Rail Extension which, paired with local
financial commitments, allowed RTD to proceed with construction of this project.



Continually worked on scope refinements and budget containment throughout the
FasTracks Program development.

Federal Funding
The 2004 FasTracks financial plan projected that RTD would be successful in obtaining
competitive federal grant funding in the sum total of $815 million for the East, West and Gold
rail lines. RTD was successful in the pursuit of federal funds for each of these projects. In 2016,
RTD was awarded additional competitive grant funding for the Southeast Rail Extension after
determining the potential eligibility of this project under the FTA’s updated rules and criteria.
Through 2018, the FTA has awarded RTD with over $1.4 billion in federal funding for these
projects, exceeding the original 2004 plan of $815 million by approximately $615 million.
RTD has continued to explore viability for additional federal grant funding for FasTracks projects
that are not yet under construction. Based on current federal criteria, only one project – the
Central Rail Extension – would possibly meet the project justification criteria to receive a federal
grant. However, it does not meet the project financial justification criteria primarily because
applying for federal funding would require a substantial local share that is not currently
identified in RTD’s financial plan. Should RTD’s financial position or federal eligibility criteria
change significantly, the Central Rail Extension or other unfunded corridors could be considered
as possible additional candidates for federal funds.
Potential Next Steps
RTD is committed to completing the full FasTracks Program over time and will continue seeking
DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

innovative ideas and working with partners to move the program forward. However, RTD is
facing significant financial challenges. As the following chart depicts, RTD does not anticipate
having any capacity to issue additional debt until 2026.

DRAFT as of 5/29/ 18

Currently, RTD does not meet the required 1.2x net debt service coverage until 2026.
Additionally, the original FasTracks Plan included a voter-approved Taxpayer Bill of Rights
authorization limiting total debt for the program to $3.477 billion in principal and $7.129 billion
in total debt service. Given current outstanding sales tax and appropriation obligations and the
debt limits identified in the voter-approved authorization, RTD will not be in a position to issue
additional debt to fund additional FasTracks projects until 2026 at the earliest. As of RTD’s last
debt issuance, there is a remaining authorization of $381.95M in total repayment outstanding.
That would allow RTD to issue approximately $195M in bonds sometime after 2026
In the meantime, RTD continues to seek opportunities to identify scope refinements and budget
containment with on-going projects and continues to track excess revenues through the FISA,
which as of year-end 2017 has a total balance of $49.4 million. The following table identifies
actual expenditures by project through 2017 as well as total project budgets (total expenditures

In conclusion, RTD remains committed to the full build-out of the FasTracks Program. RTD will
continue advancing FasTracks Projects, including opening of the Gold Line, the Southeast Rail
Extension and the first phase of the North Metro Rail Line. RTD continues to pursue the peak
service model for the remainder of the Northwest Rail line in discussions with stakeholders and
the BNSF. RTD will also continue to pursue all opportunities to identify capital and operations
and maintenance funding for the remaining FasTracks projects, including: reduction of debt;
federal grants; private sector involvement; and project scope review.

Preface
On behalf of the Regional Transportation
District Board of Directors and staff, we
welcome this opportunity to present to
you the FasTracks Plan, our
comprehensive plan for high quality
transit service and facilities in the Denver
metropolitan region. It is the culmination
of an extensive planning and
development process involving the
general public and all the local cities and
counties over the last five years. It
represents our vision for a better
transportation system by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.
We at RTD are dedicated to deliver to
the citizens of the metro region the
highest quality and most cost effective
transit services today and in the future.
Over the last four years, from 20002003, RTD has continued to improve the
services that it offers to the public by
providing:
•

The opening of two new successful
light rail lines, the Southwest Corridor
and the Central Platte Valley Spur on
time and within budget. Ridership on
these lines continue to exceed
projections. RTD’s next light rail line,
the Southeast Corridor, or T-REX, is
under construction in a joint
partnership with the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT)
and is also on time and within
budget.

•

Overall improvements to the RTD Bus
System. These include enhanced
fixed route service as well as service
diversification to include community

Preface-1

based transit systems and call-n-Ride
service. This has been accompanied
by an aggressive bus fleet
modernization program that will
reduce the average age of our bus
fleet from 12 years in 1999 to 5
years in 2004. RTD’s access-a-Ride
paratransit system continues to grow
and is responsive to the disabled
community.
•

An enhanced accident prevention
program that has resulted in a 54
percent reduction in accident rates
between 2001 and 2002. To date, in
2003, accident numbers have been
reduced an additional 32 percent
below last year’s levels. This
reduction was achieved through
comprehensive management and ongoing driver training.

•

Overall prudent financial management
of RTD activities. Between 2000 and
2002 Worker’s Compensation claim
amounts were reduced by 55 percent
by tightly controlling this process
thereby saving millions of dollars.
Enforcement of existing attendance
polices has reduced absenteeism
among bus operators by 5% saving
personnel costs. Beginning in 2001,
RTD reacted early and effectively to
slumping economic conditions
thereby minimizing the impact of
reduced revenues for our customers
and our employees.

These achievements, as well as many
others, led to RTD being named this year
as the best transit agency in North
America by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). This
award is a testimony to the hard work

award is a testimony to the hard work
and dedication of the employees at RTD
who, on a daily basis, put the customer
first.
RTD intends to continue this record of
service and achievement by providing to
the metro area citizens a transit plan that
will give residents transportation choices
on how they will travel. The FasTracks
Plan provides new and expanded rail and
bus rapid transit lines, enhancements to
the current bus system including
suburban-to-suburban bus service, over
thirty new and expanded park-n-Rides ,
and other transit facility improvements
including a major downtown multimodal
center at Denver Union Station. All of
these major components are integrated

to provide seamless travel throughout
the metropolitan area . So, whether you
are traveling from home to work, to
school, to the doctor, or to a sporting or
entertainment event, transit can be your
best option .
RTD wishes to thank all of our
customers, the local communities and
the general public for their participation
in the planning process for the FasTracks
Plan. Your input was invaluable to
development of the final plan
components . RTD will continue to ask
communities to tell us what they want
and we will do everything we can to
carry out their requ st

Executive Summary
1.

Overview of FasTracks

FasTracks is RTD’s twelve-year
comprehensive plan for high quality transit
service and facilities in the region. FasTracks
is a proactive plan that responds to the
growing transportation needs of the Denver
metropolitan region by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.
According to the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Denver
metropolitan region is expected to add more
than 900,000 people and 600,000 jobs by
2025. This growth will place a tremendous
strain on the region’s already congested
transportation system. Weekday vehicle
miles of travel are expected to increase from
58 million in the year 2001 to 95 million by
the year 2025, a 64 percent increase. As
part of its Fiscally Constrained 2025 Interim
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), DRCOG
has noted that this combination of
population growth and vehicle miles
traveled will increase severe congestion by
89 percent even with the transportation
improvements that are scheduled for
implementation. Person hours of delay are
predicted to increase by two times the
current amount. By 2025, we will have
more traffic than our existing transportation
system can handle.
In its 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report,
the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) rated
Denver as the third most congested city in
the United States. The report also states that
“it would be almost impossible to maintain a
constant congestion level with road

ES-1

construction only” and that “peak period
public transportation service during
congested hours can improve the
transportation capacity.” The report
indicates that “Public transportation lines
that do not intersect roads can be particularly
reliable as they are not affected by weather,
road work, and other unreliability producing
events.”
FasTracks also responds to Metro Vision, the
Denver region’s plan for future growth and
development. The second of the six core
elements of Metro Vision states that the
region must create “a balanced multimodal
transportation system” which includes “an
extensive fixed guideway transit system and
bus transit.”
Finally, FasTracks responds to current
sentiment on transportation needs within the
metropolitan area. In a recent survey
entitled 2003 Statewide Customer Survey –
Results on Transportation Issues in Colorado
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT), the lack of
public/mass transportation was identified as
one of the top transportation issues. The
CDOT survey also states that if transportation
funds became available, in the metro area,
the highest priority for spending that money
should be on light rail. FasTracks provides
the opportunity to implement rapid transit by
funding a region-wide system of light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit in the
next twelve years.
FasTracks has three core goals:

Provide Improved Transportation Choices
and Options to the Citizens of the District.
Additional transportation choices add to
the region’s quality of life. Reduced
reliance on a single mode of
transportation by providing additional,
convenient transit options gives
individuals choices on how to travel and
where to live, work and play. FasTracks
provides over 119 miles of new rail
transit, contributes to the construction of
18 miles of bus rapid transit and greatly
enhances the bus network to support
investments in rail, serve suburb-tosuburb trips, and provide local and
regional service.
Increase transit mode share during peak
travel times.
Existing congestion during peak travel
times of the day is frustrating for many
drivers and is only expected to get worse
as the region continues to grow.
Providing viable transit options during
the peak travel times will help provide
relief for frustrated drivers. FasTracks is
projected to increase the percentage of
people taking transit during the peak
hours from 11 to 22 percent in the
region’s major transportation corridors
where congestion is worst.

Key Components of FasTracks

2.

Significant planning efforts and public
involvement have gone into development of
the FasTracks Plan. It anticipates building a
number of major components described
below. Costs are estimated based on the best
data currently available. Transit elements
shown are based on completed planning and
engineering work and environmental studies,
or work that is ongoing at the time of
publication. While specific details of the
plan may change based on unanticipated
economic circumstances over the next
twelve years, and the results of the
environmental, planning, and engineering
work that is still ongoing, RTD expects to
deliver the major transit corridors and related
improvements within the overall budgetary
framework and timeframes set out in the
plan.
•

Rapid Transit - FasTracks will
provide new and expanded rapid
transit in nine major travel corridors
by funding over 119 miles of light
rail and commuter rail and
contributing to the construction of 18
miles of bus rapid transit. The rapid
transit component includes
expansions and extensions to
existing light rail lines, construction
of new light rail and commuter rail
lines, and construction of the stations
and other improvements for bus
rapid transit. (Figure ES-1)

•

park-n-Rides - One of the most
successful elements of the RTD
system is the extensive park-n-Ride
system throughout the District. RTD
has 65 park-n-Rides today with over
21,000 spaces that are served by
both buses and rail. (When

Establish a proactive plan that balances
transit needs with future regional growth.
The Denver metropolitan region is
expected to grow from 2.46 million
(2001) people to 3.39 million in 2025.
This growth requires an enhanced transit
system to help meet the future
transportation needs of the region.
FasTracks responds to this need and
provides opportunities to focus
development near transit to take
advantage of the increased capacity and
convenience of the enhanced system.

access to all parts of the Denver
metro region. As the central
intermodal hub for the region, DUS
will provide access to nearly every
rapid transit corridor included in
FasTracks as well as Regional,
Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski
Train, Greyhound, and the new
Downtown Circulator. Elements of
DUS that are part of FasTracks
include: construction of below
grade light rail access into DUS, atgrade commuter rail access into
DUS, and construction of
components to facilitate transfers
such as underground passenger
waiting areas, concessions, and
restrooms. (Figure ES-4)

completed in 2006, T-REX will add 9
more park-n-Rides, and over 5,000
new spaces.) FasTracks will provide
funding to increase the number of
parking spaces by over 21,000.
These spaces will be added to
existing park-n-Rides as well as 31
new park-n-Rides to serve growing
areas of the metro region. (Figure ES2).
Enhanced Bus Network and Transit
Hubs - FasTracks offers a family of
bus services tailored to individual
markets and linked together to create
a comprehensive and seamless
network. RTD will continue to
operate the full array of bus service it
offers today, and will offer two new
services. Recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the region,
FasTracks includes a comprehensive
network of suburb-to-suburb bus
service linked together with
“FastConnects” or timed transfers at
transit hubs throughout the region.
The FastConnects concept schedules
buses and trains to arrive at transit
stations, stops and park-n-Rides at the
same time, minimizing the time a
passenger has to wait to transfer to
another vehicle. (Figure ES-3). The
second new service offered by
FasTracks is an extensive system of
bus feeder service to rapid transit
stations. This service will provide
neighborhoods near rapid transit
stations a convenient option for
accessing rail or bus rapid transit
lines.

congested highways. Ridership
trends on the RTD’s current light rail
system support the forecasts. Nearly
60 percent of new riders on the
Southwest Corridor use light rail at
least three days a week. Moreover,
78 percent of light rail riders had a
vehicle to use for this trip. More
trips on transit means fewer cars on
the road. One full bus can remove
60 cars, one full light rail vehicle can
remove 125 cars from the road.

The 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report
prepared by the Texas Transportation
Institute reported 36 annual hours of delay
per person in the Denver area in 2001. The
same report also indicated that 60 percent of
the freeway lane miles in the Denver area
were congested during the peak period in
2001. Delay and congestion are projected
to increase significantly in the future.
FasTracks provides a fast alternative to
driving in the major highway corridors.
Travel Times/Speeds - With the FasTracks
Plan, it will be faster to travel by transit than
by auto to key destinations during the peak
times. As shown in Figure ES-5, most transit
travel times are significantly less for rapid
transit than for autos in 2025. With
FasTracks, about 474,000 fewer vehicle
miles would be driven each weekday in the
region in the year 2025. Because of the
reduction in vehicle miles driven, highways
adjacent to the rapid transit corridors will
generally operate slightly faster during rush
hours and through traffic on nearby roads
will also decline.
•

Safety/Reliability - Transit,
particularly rail and bus guideway, is
much more dependable and reliable
in inclement weather and is not
subject to highway incident related
traffic. Additionally, compared to
road systems, transit systems are
significantly safer. Generally, trips
with similar destinations result in
200,000 fewer deaths, injuries and
accidents when made by public
transit than by car, adding up to
between $2 billion and $5 billion
per year in safety benefits.

•

Peak Hour Mode Split – The
FasTracks Plan will increase the
percentage of people taking transit
during the peak hours from 11
percent today to over 22 percent on

ES-8

Economic Growth and Development
There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continues to be a concern to
most metro area residents. FasTracks
promotes smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and supported
by local cities and counties and their
citizens.
•

Transit Oriented Development Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus
stations have been shown to increase
property values. This has occurred
locally at Englewood City Center
Station on the Southwest Corridor.
The Alexan City Center apartments, a
transit oriented development along
the Southwest light rail line recently
sold for $5,000 to $10,000 more per
unit due to their location next to
light rail. In the Southeast Corridor/
T-REX project, which is currently
under construction, approximately
50 acres directly adjacent to the
Belleview Station have been rezoned
from open space to transit mixed
use.

•

Increased Economic Activity FasTracks in the short term will
provide increases in employment

and disposable income through the
creation of many new construction
jobs. This is consistent with the TREX project where over 1,400 local

jobs have been added to the
economy. Regional economic
activity will increase as a result of
FasTracks.

Carbon Monoxide, small particulates
(called PM10), and Volatile Organic
Compounds emitted into the region’s
air. DRCOG also projects a slight
increase in Nitrogen Oxide
emissions, but the overall impact of
the FasTracks plan on the region’s air
quality is positive and will increase
over time as transit ridership
increases.

In the long term, the implementation
of FasTracks will provide the needed
infrastructure to sustain our economy
by creating a livable environment
that will be attractive to business and
development. In Dallas, Texas, the
light rail starter line generated over
$922 million in development,
surpassing the $860 million cost of
the project. Additionally, the DART
system in downtown Dallas
contributed to a 30 percent jump in
retail sales between mid-1997 and
1998, compared to a 3 percent rise
citywide.

Economic Benefits to Individuals and
Businesses – Transit can save
commuters money in transportation
expenditures by reducing the travel
commute times and the cost of
commuting. Studies have shown
that public transportation-intensive
metropolitan areas save $22 billion
annually in transportation costs.
According to DRCOG, by 2025,
548,000 jobs, or 26% of all jobs in
the region, will be within a one-half
mile walk of a rapid transit station
with FasTracks. With a short bus
ride, this job accessibility grows to
46%. Additionally, 12% of all
households will be within walking
distance of a rapid transit station, and
86% will be within a 5 mile drive of
a rapid transit park-n-Ride. Many
cities are finding that businesses are
considering transit service a key
factor in location decisions.

Environmental Benefits
FasTracks will provide environmental
benefits to the region in a number of areas.
•

Air Quality – According to DRCOG,
the FasTracks plan will have a net
positive impact on the amount of

ES-11

Energy Conservation –
Implementation of the FasTracks Plan
will also contribute to energy
conservation. A bus with as few as
seven passengers is more fuel
efficient than the average car with
one occupant used for commuting.
The fuel efficiency of a fully
occupied rail car is 15 times greater
than the typical automobile. For
every passenger mile traveled, public
transportation is twice as fuelefficient as autos and trucks.
Nationally, if 1 in 10 Americans used
public transportation regularly, the
U.S. reliance on foreign oil could be
cut by more than 40 percent.

Development/Refinement of Plan
Concept

Since 1994, RTD has conducted a number of
planning and environmental studies for
major transportation corridors, designed and
built three new rapid transit lines (Central
Corridor, Southwest Corridor and Central
Platte Valley), and initiated construction with
CDOT on the T-REX (Southeast Corridor)
light rail and highway program which will
open in 2006. Additionally, RTD partnered
with CDOT to develop capital cost estimates
for regional transportation improvements,
conducted public outreach, and worked with
financial consultants to examine long term
funding options. A brief summary of these
key inputs is described below.

Corridor Planning and Environmental
Studies
RTD conducted extensive studies for all six
new and three enhanced transit corridors
that are included in the FasTracks rapid
transit component. These included Major
Investment Studies for the East, West, Gold
Line, US 36, I-225 and North Metro
Corridors, an Environmental Impact
Statement for the Southeast and West
Corridors, Feasibility Studies for the
Southeast (Lone Tree) and Southwest
Corridor Extensions, and operational
analyses for the Central Corridor. From
1998-2001, RTD also conducted a Twenty
Year Transit Needs Assessment and System
Plan to insure that financial investments are
being made to maintain RTD’s existing assets
and to insure that individual corridor
recommendations coordinate with future
region-wide service level requirements. The
draft FasTracks Plan adopted by the RTD
Board in the summer of 2001 was built upon
the foundation of the long-term transit needs
assessment and plan that included the
detailed work of the planning and
environmental studies.
Community Outreach/Public Input and
Progress of the FasTracks Plan
A survey to gauge interest in transit-related
improvements for the metro area was also
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation, RTD and the Transit Alliance
(a group of metro area local municipalities
and other business interests) in July of 2001.
The results of this survey indicated a 78%
approval rating for improving transit in the
metro area. Twenty-one open houses were
conducted throughout the RTD District
during September and October 2001 to
gather public input on the plan concept. In
addition, individual meetings were held with
elected officials, Chambers of Commerce
and civic groups in each corridor. In order
to gain additional comments about the
FasTracks Plan, a web site was established

ES-12

and surveys were distributed to members of
the general public. A number of changes
were incorporated into the plan based on
this input.
In December of 2002, the RTD Board
adopted the FasTracks Plan as the vision for
transit in the metro area. By the Spring of
2003, financial forecasts indicated that
lagging sales tax revenues would not allow
RTD to build the FasTracks Plan as originally
proposed (i.e., full build-out of the rapid
transit system within 10 years based on a 0.4
percent sales tax increase). A revised plan
was proposed which scaled back the rapid
transit build-out into two phases. Sixteen
open houses were held in August and
September 2003 to gather public input on
the proposed changes to the plan. To date,
over 347 public meetings and presentations
have occurred.
In general, the public and elected officials
preferred that RTD modify other plan
features in order to build the entire rapid
transit system. As a result, the FasTracks
Plan was revised to include a build-out of the
rapid transit system within a 12-year period
with modifications in rail and bus operations
in the opening years.
Capital Cost Estimates (Methodology, Unit
Costs, Risk Assessment)
The capital cost estimates for the FasTracks
Plan were prepared in conjunction with the
extensive study work that lead to the
definition of the FasTracks Plan elements.
They were also reviewed and revised using
unit prices consistent with past and current
construction costs in the metro area. In
2002, RTD hired an engineering consulting
firm to independently review the FasTracks
Plan rapid transit cost estimates. This
consultant previously validated the
CDOT/RTD T-REX project cost estimates.
The result of their analysis validated the
corridor-adjusted costs within 1.78 percent

of the estimate provided by RTD. Since that
time, RTD has updated the estimates to
reflect current conditions and costs in
coordination with local governments and the
operating freight railroads.
RTD has included in each corridor cost
estimate funds to mitigate impacts to the
local street networks. The construction of
the FasTracks Plan will have an impact on
the local roadway networks wherever a
corridor is built. RTD recognizes that
corridor-specific impacts will be identified as
the preliminary and final design progresses.
At this time, RTD has identified specific
locations in each corridor that will need to
be mitigated for bridges, grade crossings, and
street restoration. In addition, RTD has
allocated 7 to 8 percent of construction costs
in each corridor to cover noise, urban
design, and traffic control/signing and
striping. These additive costs account for
approximately 15 to 20 percent of the cost of
the construction items.
A formal risk assessment was prepared for
FasTracks that evaluated the potential
financial risk associated with the proposed
alignments and facilities and assigned a
monetary value to the costs and the
associated risk. The risk assessment
developed contingencies for the FasTracks
Plan in major categories (i.e., hazardous
materials, schedule delays, quantity
adjustments). The cost assigned to each
category was established based on the cost
estimate for the project and the estimated
cost for each individual component that
might be affected. A percentage risk
adjustment was determined based on past
history. Both a minimum risk dollar value
and a high-risk dollar value were established.
A probability was assigned to each item and
a statistical analysis was performed to
establish the dollar amount of probable risk.
The result of that analysis has shown that the
contingency amounts, provided in the plan

ES-13

cost estimates, are within the risk tolerance
for the plan.
RTD and CDOT staff also collaborated on an
analysis that was released in June of 2003
that explored the construction coordination
that would be needed between the FasTracks
Plan and the state highway system. This
analysis was used to develop a Master
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT that was signed by both
agencies on April 12, 2004. The Master IGA
establishes a coordinated process which
facilitates the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan and preserves the ability to
pursue planned highway and transit
improvements in corridors where both
highway and transit improvements are likely
to occur.
Rail and Bus Operating and Maintenance
Cost Methodologies
The LRT operating and maintenance costs
were based on FY 2002 National Transit
Database (NTDB) cost and statistical data
provided by RTD. Unit costs were developed
for specific costs categories within cost
centers. The cost centers are based on NTDB
categories within the following areas:
vehicle operations and vehicle maintenance,
non-vehicle maintenance and general
administration. The model was validated to
prior years. Specifically, prior year service
statistics were entered into the cost model
and cost results were deflated based on
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rates.
The model was found to generate costs
within a few percentage points of actual
costs.
Bus operating and maintenance costs for
FasTracks were developed using the RTD
bus operating and maintenance cost model.
The RTD bus cost model is an incremental
cost model which uses unit costs based on
actual RTD financial data and scheduled

units of service. The bus cost model
develops unit costs based on the class of
service operated, and allocates these costs to
the service variable (or variables) most
closely associated with the specific type of
cost.
Incremental operating and maintenance
costs for service to FasTracks bus routes were
estimated at a systemwide average
incremental cost of $54.00 per hour. In
addition to the incremental operating costs
described above, the FasTracks Plan includes
the opening of an additional bus
maintenance facility. The bus cost model
also was used to develop an annual
operating cost for that facility, based on the
2002 operating costs for RTD’s major
facilities.
Schedule and Implementation Plan and
Building on Past Successes
RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. Starting with the
CDOT, City and County of Denver and RTD
partnership on the Downtown Express/Bus
HOV lane project in 1994 and continuing
with the three RTD operating light rail lines,
the Central Corridor in 1994, the Southwest
Corridor in 2000 and the Central Platte
Valley in 2002, RTD has completed each
corridor on time and within budget. The TREX project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule to open in 2006 and is within
budget.
Similarly, for the FasTracks Plan, RTD is
confident that its capital project cost
estimates and its schedule and
implementation plan are realistic. RTD has
developed a schedule for implementation
that places each of the corridors into revenue
service within twelve years. In order to
achieve this goal, the logical and sequential
scheduling of all FasTracks elements is

ES-14

incorporated into the schedule. The schedule
was developed based on several factors that
included:
•

Activity in each of the corridors
begins within one year after passage
of FasTracks

•

Prioritization of Facility/Corridor
Interdependence

•

Acquisition of Assets/Right-of -way

•

Ability to Finance

•

Sequencing of Activities

•

Status of Corridor Project
Development Activities

Sequencing of corridor construction will be
established to coordinate with forecasted
revenues so that RTD remains fiscally solvent
throughout the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan. There are other factors that
could positively impact design and
construction schedules for FasTracks. These
include:
•

Revenue receipts higher than
forecasts.

•

Additional federal funds (beyond
current assumptions).

•

Receipt of Senate Bill 1/revenues
(state of Colorado).

•

Lower corridor construction costs.

•

Third party financial partnering to
accelerate the construction schedule.

On the conservative side, RTD has estimated
construction costs and timeframes on a
design-bid-build basis but intends to evaluate
every corridor and project for the possibility
of design-build in order to implement the
most cost effective and efficient means of
construction. The management and
implementation of the Plan will be the
responsibility of RTD.

RTD’s schedule was reviewed by a
consulting firm with expertise in this area.
The consultant prepared a schedule
independent of the one prepared by RTD
staff. The sequencing of the projects
remained consistent with that of RTD. In the
independent analysis, the consultants
established their own logic to develop a
schedule based on the experience of their
personnel and from previous projects
throughout the country. Durations varied
slightly, but completion of each corridor was
within the 12-year period established as the
goal for the FasTracks Plan. This
independent analysis concluded that the
FasTracks Plan can be accomplished within
the 12-year time period.
Financial Plan
The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive $4.7
billion plan for addressing mobility needs in
the Denver metro area over the next twelve
years. In order to finance the plan, the
District will seek voter approval for a 0.4
percent increase in the regional sales and use
tax – this equates to 4 pennies on a $10
purchase. This will bring the total tax in the
District to 1 percent, comparable to other
urban areas in the Western United States
including Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and
San Francisco.
The Plan leverages local funding to support
an estimated $815 million in federal New
Starts funding for various plan
improvements. This is approximately 17
percent of the total cost of the plan and is
reasonable compared to federal funds
received over time by RTD for similar
projects and at other transit properties
throughout the United States. It also utilizes
contributions from local jurisdictions
benefiting from transit in an amount equal to
2.5% of project corridor costs or an
estimated $95 million. Local contributions
could consist of right-of-way dedications,

ES-15

permit fee waivers, cash contributions,
corridor utility relocations as well as any
other direct corridor contributions.
In addition, RTD has incorporated an
estimated $110 million in other federal grant
revenues as part of the financing plan. An
estimated $50 million is expected from FTA
in the form of bus discretionary funds for
Denver Union Station or other bus projects
such as vehicles and facilities. An estimated
$60 million is for federal flexible dollars
through the DRCOG planning process
between the years 2010 and 2015,
consistent with the District’s past receipts,
allowing RTD to meet the implementation
schedule requirements requested by local
governments and adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors.

contributions that are reasonable and

Conclusion
FasTracks is a comprehensive twelve-year
plan designed to implement high quality
transit service and facilities in the region. It
responds to the growing transportation needs
of the Denver metropolitan region by
providing alternatives to traffic congestion.
The Plan has been in development for over
five years with major study activities taking
place to define rapid transit corridor
improvements, bus service and other
elements. In conjunction with those study
activities, RTD has solicited and
incorporated local government and public
input as part of each corridor
recommendation. For the FasTracks Plan,
alone, RTD has conducted 37 public
meetings and 310 individual presentations
on the plan. The final FasTracks Plan
responds to local governments and the
public to build a transit system that serves
the needs of the community.

The FasTracks Plan will provide a number of
direct benefits for citizens in the metro
region. Travel times will be reduced for
those using the transit alternatives outlined in
the FasTracks Plan. Transit, particularly rail
and bus guideway, is much more
dependable and reliable in inclement
weather and is not subject to highway
incident related traffic. Riding a bus or train
is much safer than auto travel.

RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. RTD has completed
each major corridor construction project
(Downtown Express, Central Corridor,
Southwest Corridor and Central Platte Valley
Spur) on time and within budget. The T-REX
project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule and within budget. Similarly, for
the FasTracks Plan, RTD is confident that its
capital project cost estimates and its
schedule and implementation plan are
realistic.
The FasTracks financial plan will allow
implementation over twelve years with voter
approval for a 0.4 percent increase in the
regional sales and use tax. This will bring the
total tax in the District to 1 percent,
comparable to other urban areas in the
Western United States. Other sources of
funding for the plan include federal and local

ES-16

Implementation of the FasTracks Plan will
have a positive effect on the region wide
environment. For every passenger mile
traveled, public transportation is twice as
fuel efficient as autos and trucks. The
FasTracks Plan will lead to an annual
reduction in metro area pollutants such as
carbon monoxide, particulates and ozone.
There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continue to be a concern to most
metro area residents. FasTracks promotes
smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and where it is
supported by local cities and counties and its
citizens. Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus stations
have been shown to increase property
values.
FasTracks in the short term will provide
increases in employment and disposable
income through the creation of many direct
construction jobs and other indirect jobs
during the construction period. This is
consistent with the T-REX project where
1,400 local jobs have been added to the
economy. In the long term, the
implementation of FasTracks will provide the
needed infrastructure to sustain our economy

by creating a livable environment that will
be attractive to business and development.
RTD has taken a number of actions to: 1)
assure the success of the FasTracks plan; 2)
assure accountability to the residents of the
region; and 3) provide for continued
coordination and communication with local
governments, citizens, CDOT and DRCOG.
Key examples of these actions follow:
RTD FasTracks Adoption and Election
Resolution
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution adopting the
FasTracks plan and declaring the
commitment to hold an election on the
FasTracks plan in the November 2, 2004
general election if sufficient signatures are
obtained on a petition, in accordance with
state law. In their resolution, the RTD Board
committed to ensuring “that the residents
and taxpayers of the region are provided
information about the progress of FasTracks
implementation in the event an election is
successful and have an ongoing opportunity
to review progress and provide input in the
numerous decisions that will be required for
construction of each corridor.” To
accomplish this, the resolution directs the
creation of “a citizen’s advisory committee to
monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in
the Plan.”
DRCOG Senate Bill 208
On April 21, 2004, the DRCOG Board of
Directors approved the FasTracks plan and
the individual corridors, the technologies,
and the method of financing, pursuant to
C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 (the “Senate Bill 208”
process), mandated by the state legislature.
In support of this action, DRCOG performed
a comprehensive technical review of the
individual FasTracks corridors and the
FasTracks financial plan.

ES-17

Master Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between CDOT and RTD
On April 12, 2004, CDOT and RTD
executed the Master IGA that establishes a
coordinated process which facilitates the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and
preserves the ability to pursue planned
highway and transit improvements in
corridors where both highway and transit
improvements are likely to occur.
RTD Hold Harmless Resolution
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution entitled
“Regarding Board Commitments for
FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action
confirmed RTD’s commitment to build each
corridor’s specific list of corridor
improvements consistent with and as
described in the FasTracks Plan and within
the fiscal constraints and schedule of the
plan subject to the completion of the
environmental process and conformity with
any federal Record of Decision for a
corridor. It further formalized the
commitment to analyze the Plan annually to
determine current revenue projections from
both local and federal sources. The
resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better
or worse than expected then all the corridors
will be adjusted accordingly.”
Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution
commits "that prior to construction, a
corridor cost risk assessment and value
engineering (will) be conducted to minimize
the potential for cost overruns and schedule
delays. Based on the results of both, project
and financial analyses, modifications to
individual corridor project elements, service
plans, and schedules may be necessary for
all FasTracks corridors. This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled
construction and operation of the remaining
FasTracks corridors, thereby "holding
harmless" those corridors. This information
shall be reported annually to the general

public.” Each annual review will be
conducted by RTD, through the DRCOG
process, and will be reported to local
governments and the public.
Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved
resolution reads as follows: “Construction of
FasTracks committed improvements within a
corridor will not start until there is a firm
commitment of all required funding sources,
be they private, local-match or federal
monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments
concerning permits, design and plan review
proves for timely implementation.”

Program Description

•

FasTracks is an integrated program of transit
improvements which includes:
•

•

•

Construction of rapid transit in six new
corridors, and enhancements and
extensions to existing rapid transit
lines in three corridors. The rapid
transit element includes light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit.
Enhancements to bus service,
including an extensive feeder bus to
rail and bus rapid transit stations and
new suburb-to-suburb bus service
along major corridors.

Transit facilities and amenities
designed to improve passenger, safety,
convenience and use of the transit
system.

The FasTracks Program includes 119
miles of rail and 18 miles of bus rapid
transit.

The major components of the FasTracks Plan
are described in greater detail in the
following sections.

1.1

Rapid Transit Corridors

The FasTracks Plan includes 119 miles of rail
rapid transit in nine corridors and contributes
to the construction of 18 miles of bus rapid
transit. An overview of the rapid transit
elements of the FasTracks Plan is shown in
Figure 1, FasTracks Rapid Transit Corridors.
The recommendations for transit technology,
alignment and operating plans in each of the
corridors were developed through a
combination of Major Investment Studies,
(MISs), Environmental Impact Statements
(EISs) and Corridor Studies conducted since
1997.

A system of “FastConnects” timed
transfer points to enhance passenger
convenience and minimize wait times
for transfers between modes.

A brief history of the process and studies is
summarized for each of the corridors,
followed by a map depicting the major
corridor elements that will be funded as part
of the FasTracks Plan.

•

Thirty-one new park-n-Rides and
expansions to nine park-n-Rides –
more than an 80% increase over
existing and new T-REX spaces.

•

A major downtown multimodal Center
– Denver Union Station – which will
provide access to nearly every rapid
transit line as well as regional buses,
local circulators and inter-city rail and
bus service.

Central Corridor and Central
Platte Valley Enhancements
The Central Corridor light rail line opened in
October 1994 and was the first segment of
light rail in Denver. This light rail line is 5.3
miles in length, and extends from I-25 and
Broadway to the Denver downtown area,
and along Welton Street through Five Points
to 30th and Downing. The
Central Corridor has
fourteen stations and three
park-n-Rides.
The Central Corridor was
connected to the Southwest
Corridor light rail line in
July 2000, and to the
Central Platte Valley (CPV)
light rail spur in April
2002.
The CPV spur is a 1.8-mile
light rail line that serves
four stations and numerous
venues including the
Auraria Campus, Invesco Field at Mile High,
the Pepsi Center, Six Flags/Elitch Gardens
and Union Station.
The Central Corridor and Central
Platte Valley LRT lines will be
enhanced to serve as the spine of the
regional rail network.

A number of rail infrastructure improvements
will be made along the Central Corridor to
improve service efficiency. Improvements
include a partial grade separation at 13th
Avenue and the construction of two
additional tracks between Broadway and
Alameda and between 10th
Avenue and Osage and the CPV
Junction.
FasTracks will also fund a new
circulator system to serve
commuters arriving at Denver
Union Station and needing to
travel to the Civic Center area of
downtown Denver and other
downtown destinations. The
specific route and characteristics
of the downtown circulator are
currently being defined as part
of the Downtown Multimodal
Access Plan (DMAP), currently
underway. Once the study is
complete, RTD will incorporate the final
alternative(s) into the FasTracks Plan. The
performance standards and characteristics
that have been defined for the circulator
include:
•

To handle the forecasted ridership for build
out of the overall rapid transit system, the
FasTracks Plan will modify the existing light
rail stations in the Central Corridor and CPV
to accommodate four-car trains and extend
the light rail north from the 30th/Downing
station to the 40th/40th station where it
connects to the East Corridor. All
improvements will be subject to the results
of the final environmental process.

•

Service frequency that minimizes
dwell times

•

Quick service from one end of
Downtown to the other, with travel
times that are comparable to the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle (Dependent on
RTD’s ability to receive agreement
from the City and County of Denver
for dedicated lanes on the
Circulator’s alignment).

•

Uniform, bi-directional service
throughout Downtown that is visible
and user-friendly

•

Free fare service for RTD patrons

•

Service to office and residential areas

•

Technology that is reliable, provides
adequate capacity, and is
environmentally friendly.

•

Easy and effective transfer at Denver
Union Station.

•

Service that complements and
enhances the 16th Street Mall Shuttle
by providing sufficient capacity and
connecting additional areas of transit
demand.

1-4

In 2003, RTD finished a Light Rail (LRT) and
Traffic Simulation Study to increase LRT
operating capacity through Downtown
Denver. The consultant study concluded
that it would be reasonable to operate 16
trains per hour in the downtown area. This
study also indicated that with signal timing
or physical modifications at two locations
RTD could operate four-car trains through
downtown Denver. FasTracks includes this
provision to increase operating capacity.

East Corridor
northeast along the railroad right-of-way to
Blake and East 40th Avenue. From there, the
alignment follows an easterly course along the
railroad right-of-way that parallels Smith Road
to Airport Boulevard, where the alignment
curves north. The alignment then roughly
follows Peña Boulevard north and
east to the airport terminal.

The East Corridor is 23.6 miles in length, and
connects downtown Denver and the eastern
portion of the metro area to Denver
International Airport (DIA) with five stations.
The East Corridor provides a number of
important transportation functions including
interstate/intrastate
travel along I-70;
regional access from
downtown Denver and
the eastern metro area
to DIA, linkage as an
“inner beltway”
between I-225 and I270, and access to
adjacent employment
areas and intermodal
freight facilities.

The MIS recommended a singletrack commuter rail line from
Denver Union Station to Denver
International Airport, including five
stations and reconstruction of I-70
and widening of I-70 between I-270
and Peña Boulevard. In 2003, RTD
and CDOT initiated an
Environmental Impact Statement for
the East Corridor, which is currently
on-going.

Development trends
indicate that the
corridor will be a major
regional destination for
future employment.
Several areas in the vicinity of this corridor
have a relatively high proportion of transitdependent residents who would benefit from
improved access to expanding employment

The East Corridor will connect DIA,
Stapleton and Downtown Denver.
opportunities. Additionally, this corridor will
serve the substantial residential and business
growth in the former Stapleton Airport area and
the Gateway Area at 40th Avenue and Airport
Boulevard. Congestion along I-70 is forecasted
to be severe by the year 2025, resulting in slow
travel speeds, increased number of accidents,
and incident-related congestion.

The FasTracks Plan
would fund the
transit
recommendations
of the MIS.
FasTracks also
includes funds for
an additional
station at Peoria
and Smith Road to
connect to the
I-225 light rail line, and double-tracking the
commuter rail line to allow for more frequent
(15 minute) service. The transportation
improvements in this corridor are subject to
the results of the Environmental Impact
Statement in progress.

The recommendations for the East Corridor
were developed through an MIS conducted by
DRCOG in 1997. The alignment of the East
Corridor begins northeast of Denver Union
Station (at roughly 20th and Delgany) and runs

I-225 Corridor
The I-225 Corridor is 10.5 miles long, and
connects the Southeast Corridor light rail line
at I-225 and Parker Road to the East Corridor
rail line at Peoria and Smith Roads. The
corridor completes the rapid transit system
linkages in the eastern metro area and
improves suburb-to-suburb travel. The I-225
Corridor also provides light rail access to the
Aurora City Center, the Arapahoe County
Municipal Center, the Aurora Mall and the
future University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center at
Fitzsimons with seven
light rail stations.
Growth along this
corridor has been greater
and occurred much
faster than anticipated,
and the Interim DRCOG
2025 Regional
Transportation Plan
indicates that I-225 is
projected to experience
“pervasive and severe”
congestion in the future.
The corridor does not
have the sufficient
capacity or facilities to
handle increased demand from employment
growth within the corridor or the increased
demand from regional growth.
The recommendations for the I-225 Corridor
were developed through an MIS conducted
by RTD between 1998 and 2001. The MIS
recommended light rail transit from I-225
and Parker Road to Peoria and Smith Roads
and the widening of I-225 to eight lanes.
The light rail alignment of the I-225 Corridor
generally begins at the Nine Mile park-nRide and traverses northerly within the
median of I-225 and then turns eastward into
the Aurora City Center. The alignment
traverses northeast through the City Center,
crosses Alameda Parkway and runs north

1-10

along Sable Boulevard to Ellsworth Avenue
where it turns west toward I-225. The
alignment then runs northward along I-225
I-225 LRT will serve Aurora in addition
to providing a key regional rail linkage
between the East Corridor and
Southeast Corridor.
to Colfax Avenue where it turns west,
crossing over I-225, and turns north along
the proposed Sand Creek
Parkway. At Montview
Boulevard, the alignment turns
west into Fitzsimons. On the
west side of Fitzsimons, it turns
north at Peoria to terminate at
Smith Road.
The FasTracks Plan would fund
the transit recommendations
from the MIS subject to the
results of the final
environmental process and
incorporates the latest planning
efforts by the City of Aurora to
serve the Fitzsimons
redevelopment area.

North Metro Corridor
The recommendations for the North Metro
Corridor were developed through an MIS
conducted by RTD between 1998 and 2001.
The MIS recommended an integrated plan of
transit, roadway, bus/high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lane and corridor preservation to
improve mobility, reduce congestion and
improve access to all parts of the study area.

The North Metro Corridor includes the area
bounded by Pecos Street on the west, I-76
The North Metro Corridor will bring
rail to the northern metropolitan area
as well as preserve additional
opportunities to serve future needs.
on the east, 168th Avenue on the north, and
downtown Denver on the south. The North
Metro Corridor commuter rail line is 18
miles long and connects Thornton,
Northglenn and Commerce City to the
Denver metro area with eight stations and
provides connections to DIA through a rail
transfer at Denver Union Station. The City of
Thornton is planning transit oriented
development (TOD) at many of the proposed
rail stations.
The North Metro area
is forecast to be one of
the fastest growing
areas of the region
over the next 20 years.
Growth rates for both
population and
employment are
forecast to be double
the regional average.
The I-25 and I-76
corridors are forecast
to intensify as
employment corridors,
with the areas
between the two
interstate facilities
filling in with residential development.
Congestion along north I-25 is already
severe, with forecasts indicating increasing
severity and duration of congestion.

The MIS recommended light rail or diesel
multiple unit (self-propelled commuter rail)
transit along the railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue,
preservation of right-of-way for future rapid
transit or rail service to Brighton, additional
park-n-Rides along the rail line and along
I-25, extension of Bus/HOV lanes on I-25
from US 36 to SH 7, addition of Bus/HOV
lanes on I-76 and SH 224, widening of I-25
and I-76, and implementation of grade
separations on US 85.
The FasTracks Plan would fund a
double-track commuter rail line
along the railroad right-of-way to
124th Avenue, new and improved
park-n-Rides along the commuter
rail line and along I-25, eight
stations and contribution towards
right-of-way preservation for
transit service to Brighton.
Additionally, FasTracks would
extend the rail line on a single
track to SH 7 (160th Avenue) to be
consistent with local planning
efforts by the City of Thornton.
All improvements to be
implemented are subject to the
results of the final environmental process.

Southeast Corridor
Enhancements
The Southeast Corridor (T-REX multi-modal
project) is currently under construction by
RTD and CDOT, and remains on-budget and
on-time to open in 2006. The Southeast
Southeast Corridor LRT will be
enhanced to serve growing demand
and extended to serve additional
communities.
Corridor includes 19.1 miles of light rail
transit with 13 stations along I-25 from
Broadway to Lincoln Avenue and along
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road, as well as
reconstruction and widening of I-25.
In 2002, the
City of Lone
Tree
approached
RTD with a
formal request
to evaluate the
feasibility of
joining the
RTD district.
(At that time,
the entire City
was not within
the legal
boundaries of
the District).
The request
was made to better serve the current and
future transit needs of the residents and
developing commercial areas. The City of
Lone Tree and RTD partnered to conduct a
study to evaluate the feasibility of extending
the current Southeast Corridor light rail line
south and east to serve the City’s current and
future developments. The study
recommended the extension of light rail
south along I-25 to a new station at the

1-14

Health One Hospital Complex on the west
side of I-25, a cross-over of light rail to the
east side of I-25 to a new station at the
planned Lone Tree Town Center, and an
extension south to an end-of-line station at
RidgeGate. The City and RTD worked
cooperatively to develop a supporting bus
plan. In July 2003, the RTD Board of
Directors accepted voter petitions from the
City of Lone Tree to hold an election in
November 2003 for the purposes of joining
the RTD District. On November 4, 2003,
Lone Tree voters approved annexation into
the District with support from 73 percent of
voters. The Lone Tree extension
improvements are subject to the results of
the final environmental process.
The FasTracks Plan would fund the 2.3mile light rail extension with three stations
into the City of Lone Tree, upgrade the
remainder of the 13 planned T-REX light
rail stations to accommodate four-car

trains, add 520 spaces to the Lincoln park-nRide, and add bicycle and pedestrian
improvements at Arapahoe and Belleview.

Southwest Corridor
Enhancements
The Southwest Corridor light rail line opened
in July 2000, on-time and within budget.
The 8.7-mile light rail line extends parallel to
Santa Fe Drive from
the terminus of the
Central Corridor at I-25
and Broadway to
Mineral Avenue in
Littleton with five
existing stations. Since
its opening, the
Southwest Corridor has
doubled ridership
projections and has
experienced parking
shortages at the park-nRides, particularly at
Englewood City Center
and at the end-of-line
station at Mineral
Avenue.
Based on the overwhelming success of this
corridor, RTD initiated a study to evaluate
alternatives to accommodate existing and
future demand. The Southwest Extension
Transit Corridor Planning and Conceptual
Engineering, study was completed in
December 2002 and recommended
extending the Southwest light rail line to
Highlands Ranch. FasTracks would fund this
2-5-mile extension into Highlands Ranch,
including a new end-of-line station at C470/Lucent Boulevard with 1,000 new
parking spaces. The implementation of this
extension is subject to a final environmental
process.

1-16

FasTracks includes a new station at Bates
Avenue in Englewood, contingent on a
successful financial and operational
arrangement between the city,
RTD, and adjacent property
owners. This agreement would
commit the city to share in the
cost of the station with RTD and
the developer of the adjacent
transit-oriented development.
Further, FasTracks also includes
an additional 440 parking spaces
adjacent to Englewood City
Center station, and modifications
to existing light rail stations to
accommodate four-car light rail
trains.
Consistent with RTD’s transit
oriented development policies,
RTD will be promoting the construction of a
Southwest Corridor LRT will be
enhanced to serve growing demand
and extended to serve Highlands
Ranch.

US 36 Commuter Rail and BRT will
improve and extend service for one of
the largest transit markets in the
region.

US 36 Corridor and Longmont
Extension
The US 36 Corridor consists of two elements,
Bus Rapid Transit and Commuter Rail. The
Bus Rapid Transit highway portion would
extend 18 miles along US 36 from I-25 to
Table Mesa park-n-Ride in the City of Boulder
and includes 6 stations located in the center of
US 36 for easy loading and unloading of
passengers. BRT service would extend past
Table Mesa along Broadway to CU-Boulder
and north along 28th Street to 30th & Pearl.
The commuter rail portion of this corridor
would extend along railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station in downtown Denver to
the City of Boulder and then on to the City of
Longmont. This 38.1-mile commuter rail
corridor will have seven stations.
US 36 is the major artery connecting the
northwestern communities of
Boulder, Superior, Louisville,
Lafayette, Broomfield,
Westminster and Arvada.
The corridor provides access
to numerous employment
concentrations, including the
City of Boulder, the
University of Colorado, the
Interlocken Business Park,
the Flatiron Crossing regional
mall and downtown Denver.
Travel patterns along US 36
have changed significantly
over the years with the
expansion of urbanized development along the
corridor. Commuter trips are now destined to
multiple locations along the corridor, which
has resulted in significant increases in bidirectional congestion along US 36. Transit
usage is high, with many park-n-Rides and
buses at or over capacity.

lanes along US 36 and implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit service with on-line stations,
widening portions of US 36, a single track
commuter rail line along the railroad right-ofway, and a bikeway along US 36. Subsequent
planning by RTD and the communities resulted
in a recommendation to extend the commuter
rail line to the City of Longmont along the
railroad right-of-way. In 2003, RTD and CDOT
initiated an Environmental Impact Statement
for the US 36 Corridor. This study is currently
on-going.
The FasTracks Plan would fund the transit
recommendations from the MIS, including
funds to upgrade the existing railroad tracks
and build a new adjacent track for the
commuter rail line to Boulder, extend the
commuter rail line to Longmont in
a single track configuration, and
add six commuter rail stations.
Parking will be added in Niwot and
Longmont. FasTracks will also
include a commuter rail station in
Westminster at 71st Avenue and
Lowell Boulevard, and new and
expanded park-n-Rides for both rail
and bus service. For Bus Rapid
Transit, RTD will provide slip
ramps and access improvements to
park-n-Rides from Boulder to
Denver and funding for centerline
Bus Rapid Transit stations,
platforms and a proportional share
of HOV lanes ($66 million in 2002 dollars)
with coordination from CDOT. Also included
is funding ($8 million in 2002 dollars) for the
commuter bikeway. The final transportation
improvements in this corridor are subject to
the results of the on-going EIS.

RTD conducted an MIS between 1998 and
2001 for the corridor which recommended a
set of multi-modal transportation
improvements including extension of HOV

West Corridor
The West Corridor is a 12.1-mile light rail
transit line that extends west from Denver
Union Station in downtown Denver through
west Denver, Lakewood and Jefferson
County and is served by 11 light rail stations.
The line follows the former Associated
Railroad right-of-way (approximately 12th and
13th Avenues), and parallels West 6th Avenue
and I-70, two of the most congested
highways in the region. Significant
population and employment growth is
West Corridor LRT will provide a
connection between Golden, the
Federal Center, and Downtown
Denver.
forecast for the corridor, creating significant
burdens on both the highways and arterials
in the corridor. The West Corridor would
serve a significant number of
low-income, minority and nonvehicle households that are
transit-dependent and provide
access to employment
opportunities in downtown
Denver and the City of
Lakewood. The West Corridor
has been the subject of
transportation improvement
studies for more than 25 years,
and state and local agencies are
in agreement of the need for
additional transportation
capacity improvements.
RTD initiated an MIS for the West
Corridor in 1997 which recommended
light rail transit in the corridor, as well
as bicycle, pedestrian and roadway
improvements. In 2001, RTD initiated
an EIS and preliminary engineering
efforts for the West Corridor. The RTD
Board adopted the recommendations
from the Draft EIS in August 2003 and
RTD published a Final EIS in September
1-20

2003. RTD submitted the Final EIS to
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
in October 2003 and held a Final EIS
Public Meeting to review the
document. The FTA issued the Record
of Decision (ROD) on April 19, 2004.
The West Corridor begins at Denver
Union Station and follows the CPV
Spur to the Auraria West Station. It
then proceeds south to approximately
14th Avenue. From this point, it is
grade-separated from the Consolidated
Mainline by a structure over the freight
rail tracks and the South Platte River.
The alignment then follows the former
Associated Railroad right-of-way
alignment westerly. The alignment
remains on the Associated Railroad
from the South Platte River through the
park along
Lakewood Gulch
westerly to Quail
Street. At Quail,
the alignment turns
south still
remaining on the
existing Associated
Railroad trackbed
then across 6th
Avenue on a
structure into the
Federal Center.
From the Federal
Center the alignment continues in a
westerly direction under 6th Avenue
and Union Street and parallels 6th
Avenue on the north side of the
highway to its final end-of-line station
on the west side of the Jefferson County
Government Center. The FasTracks
Plan would fund all recommendations
from the EIS.

Enhanced bus services in the FasTracks Plan
include:

Bus Service Enhancements

1.2.A Enhanced Bus Services
Bus service will continue to be a major
component of RTD’s transit services.
FasTracks offers a family of bus services
tailored to individual markets and linked
together to create a comprehensive network.
RTD recognizes that basic bus services are
critical to our transit-dependent customers, not
only non-driving elderly and disabled patrons,
but also those in lower income communities
who depend upon transit accessibility for
economic and quality of life factors. RTD will
continue to operate Local, Limited, Express,
and Regional fixed route service, call-n-Ride,
access-a-Ride, seniorRide and Special Event
services. FasTracks adds several new bus
service elements such as an extensive bus

• Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit
Every rapid transit corridor will have a
reconfigured local bus network to take
advantage of connectivity to rapid transit
lines and serve new destinations as a
result of growth through 2025.
Enhanced feeder service to rapid transit
lines is proposed throughout the region,
as illustrated in Figure 1-12, further
enhancing connections at travel origins
and destinations.
• Suburb-to-Suburb Service
The FasTracks Plan incorporates suburbto-suburb bus service, recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the metro area.

Bus Service Enhancements will serve
growing needs and optimize the
efficiency of services provided.
feeder service to the rail and BRT stations,
suburb-to-suburb bus service along major
corridors, and timed transfer points to improve
bus connections and make it more convenient
for passengers to travel throughout the region.
Following RTD policy, all bus service in
FasTracks will take into account community
input, RTD service standards and the results of
the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
process. Communities also have the option of
choosing other RTD services, such as call-nRides instead of fixed route bus service, to
meet their local service needs.
By 2025, RTD will provide an additional
700,000 hours of bus service annually, an
increase of 36 percent over 2003 bus service
levels. Figure 1-11 illustrates RTD’s bus
service enhancements, with new and improved
service highlighted. Figure 1-12 provides an
overview of future transit service frequencies
for the enhanced FasTracks bus plan.

1-22

New suburb-to-suburb service includes
transit connections between major
employment centers and park-n-Rides in
the outlying areas. The suburb-to-suburb
service is designed around a network of
timed FastConnects, or transfer points.
•

FastConnects
FastConnects provides efficient
connections for those transferring from
one transit vehicle to another. This
applies to bus-to-bus, bus-to-rail, busto-BRT, and rail-to-bus transfers.
Service is designed so that buses and
trains traveling to multiple destinations
are timed to arrived at a major
destination or transfer facility at the
same time, minimizing the time a
passenger has to wait. FastConnects
improves the overall efficiency of the
transit network and reduces travel
times for patrons.
The suburb-to-suburb bus service
connections including FastConnects is
shown in Figure 1-13.

Transit Facilities

The FasTracks Plan will include investments
in transit facilities to complement the
proposed rapid transit lines and enhanced
bus service. Facilities include park-n-Rides,
transit centers and FastConnects.
1.3.A park-n-Rides
Park-n-Rides are the backbone of the RTD
transit system. Currently there are 65 park-nRides with
over 21,000
spaces. These
facilities
provide
flexibility for
those who
want to use
transit, but
want the convenience of having direct
access to their own vehicle. FasTracks will
provide funding to increase the number of
parking spaces at existing park-n-Ride
facilities and construct new park-n-Rides to
serve growing areas of the metro region.
FasTracks has identified nine park-n-Rides to
be expanded and 31 new park-n-Rides to be
built along major transportation corridors for
a total of over 21,000 new parking spaces.
FasTracks will increase the number of
parking spaces (both existing and under
construction) throughout the district by over
80%. Figure 1-14 shows the park-n-Ride
improvements provided by the FasTracks
Plan.
1.3.B

Transit centers have amenities such as
restrooms, passenger seating, and
concessions. These facilities serve as
collection and distribution points for buses
and rail within central business districts
(CBDs). RTD transit centers include Market
Street Station, Civic Center Station, and the
Boulder Transit Center at 14th/Walnut Street.
Denver Union Station (DUS), described in
the next section, will serve as the major
transit center hub for the region.
FastConnects are designated points where
extensive transit transfers can occur outside
the CBD. These points may be park-n-Rides,
rail stations, designated shopping centers or
employment centers where bus routes
connect.
At these designated points, transfers between
buses and/or rail are coordinated to
minimize wait times between transfers. The
primary purpose of this concept is to
improve transit service for suburb-to-suburb
travel. The FastConnects concept allows for
seamless transit connections between
suburbs and minimizes the wait time
between connections, dramatically
enhancing transit services. At major
FastConnects such as the Federal Center and
Stapleton, additional passenger amenities
will be provided.

Transit Hubs

Transit hubs are facilities where extensive
transfers between transit can occur (i.e., busto-bus transfers, bus-to-rail transfers, bus-toBRT transfers, and rail-to-rail transfers). In
the FasTracks Plan, transit hubs have been
assigned to two categories: transit centers
and FastConnects.

1.3.C Downtown Multimodal Center
Denver Union Station is the proposed
location for a Downtown Multimodal
Center, a centralized intermodal facility that
provides access to all parts of the Denver
metro region. As the central intermodal hub
for the region, the DUS Vision Plan will
provide access to nearly every rapid transit
corridor included in FasTracks as well as
Regional, Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski Train,
Greyhound, and the new Downtown
Circulator.
DUS is located on a 19.5-acre parcel in the
Central Platte Valley. The DUS Master Plan,
currently under development, has identified
a recommended vision for the facility. The
recommended vision locates all rail access to
DUS underground allowing for the extension
of 18th Street between Wynkoop and
Wewatta Streets. The recommended vision
represents the ultimate buildout of DUS
beyond
FasTracks.
FasTracks
includes some
of the elements
of the
recommended
vision. Elements
not included in
FasTracks are to
be funded through other potential funding
sources such as private development.
Elements of the DUS Vision Plan that are
part of FasTracks include:

•

Construction of below-grade light rail
access into DUS;

•

Improvements to at-grade commuter
rail access into DUS;

•

Construction of components to
facilitate transfers such as
underground passenger waiting
areas, concessions and restrooms;
and
•

Accommodation of
multiple forms of
transportation
including Ski Train,
Amtrak, taxis, the
16th Street Mall
Shuttle, and the
new Downtown
Circulator.

In addition to providing enhanced
connections, Denver Union Station also
provides an opportunity to create a dense,
mixed-use transit oriented development
adjacent to the transit facility. The Denver
Union Station Master Plan identifies an
opportunity for nearly two million square
feet of development on the DUS site.

DUS will be the “Grand Central
Station” of Denver as the center of the
regional transit system in the heart of
the city.

The transportation improvements at DUS are
subject to the results of the Environmental
Impact Statement in progress.

Transit Amenities

The FasTracks Plan incorporates
improvements to increase passenger security,
convenience and access to the system.
Major elements include the following:
1.4.A Passenger Security and
Information
FasTracks will provide an expansion of
RTD’s passenger security system. Emergency
phones and security cameras will be
installed at all stations and major park-nRides. In addition to cameras on RTD buses
and rail vehicles, security provisions include
remote monitoring of rail and bus stations
through RTD’s Security Command Center at
the Mariposa light rail facility. Using state-ofthe-art
equipment,
RTD is able
to transmit
live camera
pictures to a
viewing
center
located
inside the
RTD Security Command Center. This room
is monitored by trained technicians who
review the live pictures for signs of activity
requiring either a law enforcement response
or the rendering of other aid. All cameras
record continuously and these recordings are
kept for periods of up to one month to allow
after-the-fact review of incidents. RTD
places cameras on train platforms and in
parking lots that service light rail stations.
Upon completion of the T-REX project, 256
cameras will be monitored. In addition,
RTD employs a private security firm to
provide on-site monitoring of RTD transit
facilities.

Real time passenger information will be in
place for major rail stations along the
Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte

1.4.B

Bicycle Facilities

FasTracks will provide bike racks at all
stations, bike lockers at major stations and
park-n-Rides, and will accommodate bike
access to rail stations and park-n-Rides from
existing bike paths and bike routes.
FasTracks will also contribute half the cost of
the proposed bike path along the US 36
corridor.

Executive Summary
The Regional Transportation District (the “District” or “RTD”), has developed a comprehensive $4.7
billion Plan, known as “FasTracks” for addressing mobility needs in the metropolitan Denver region
over the next twelve years. The ability to implement the FasTracks plan depends on a variety of
financial assumptions and projections that have been developed using the best available current
estimates of costs, reasonably anticipated federal funding based on current federal law and
regulations, and revenues from other sources including RTD sales tax and fare collections. Over the
anticipated build-out of twelve years specific cost items, federal and other contributions, and RTD
revenues may vary. Based on the extensive analysis behind the financial assumptions used, RTD
expects to deliver the major transit corridors and related improvements within the time frames set forth
previously. RTD cannot guarantee that each separate assumption will be met, and expects that over a
twelve year time-frame, certain adjustments and modifications will be required. This section details the
assumptions used and provides further explanation as to how RTD expects to pay for the FasTracks
Plan.
Unlike typical transit development strategies, which are pursued one corridor at a time and can take
decades to accomplish, the Plan offers a comprehensive, region-wide approach to transit
development.
Under the Plan, 40 miles of Light Rail, 79 miles of Commuter Rail and 18 miles of Bus rapid transit
improvements will be developed between 2005 and 2017.
Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006 and 2020, and by 1.5%
per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase by 30% over
2003 service levels.
In order to finance the Plan, the District will seek voter approval for a 0.4% increase in the regional
sales and use tax. This will bring the total transit tax rate in the District to 1%, comparable to other
areas in the Western United States with urban rail systems.
The Plan also anticipates $815.4 million in Federal discretionary new start grant funding in conjunction
with $110.0 million in other Federal grant funding, and contributions from local jurisdictions benefiting
from transit in an amount equal to 2.01% of total project costs or $95.03 million system-wide.
In addition to Federal grants, the Plan assumes a loan from the US DOT under the Transportation
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (“TIFIA”) program in the amount of $142.7 million.
Table 2-1 summarizes the sources of funds expected to pay for the Plan’s $4.7 billion of project
expenditures:

The Plan – Projected Capital Costs
The District has proposed a $4.7 billion Plan designed to transform urban mobility opportunity in the
metropolitan Denver region within a twelve-year period. Unlike the traditional corridor-by-corridor
approach, usually highly dependent on external funding from the Federal government, the District’s
Plan allows local policy makers and voters to direct the agenda in terms of project delivery and funding
options. The Plan responds to the projected increase in District population to 3.39 million in 2025.
Integral to the Plan is the ability to simultaneously improve mobility throughout the region. This
approach will not only address congestion needs, but will also provide an unprecedented economic
stimulus to the region, providing a measure of protection against recession through 2017.
The Plan includes six new multi-modal corridors involving light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit
improvements. Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006-2020,
and by 1.5% per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase
by 30% over 2003 service levels. Significant expansions to the existing Southwest, Southeast, Central
Platte Valley and Central corridors, parking enhancements and additional buses and LRVs for the
current system are also funded.

Revenues
Sales and Use Tax
Since inception, the primary funding source for the District has been a sales and use tax imposed on
transactions within the District boundaries. Effective January 1, 1974, the District imposed a tax
equal to 0.5%. On May 1, 1983, the tax was increased to 0.6% or six-tenths of one percent and the
tax base was adjusted. The current tax generates revenues of $210.447 million annually (2003).
As seen in Table 2-3, although revenues are down in 2002-2003, the District has experienced sales
tax growth over the past decade up to 12.4% per annum.

In November, 2003, voters in the City of Lone Tree approved annexation into the RTD District. In
February, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors annexed the Park Meadows Mall into the District. The
sales and use tax forecasts assume that RTD will begin collecting sales and use tax from Lone Tree
as of January 1, 2004, and from Park Meadows as of July 1, 2004. This results in an increase of
$4.758 million to RTD's base collections in 2004, and an additional increase of $1.257 million to
RTD's base collections in 2005.
Fundamental to the Plan, is the assumption of a voter-approved increase in the sales and use tax
during the November, 2004 election of an additional 0.4%. This would bring the total sales tax rate to
1%, equal to that imposed for transit in Dallas, Houston, and Los Angeles, Santa Clara, San Mateo
Counties in California, and the total sales taxes for transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area
Counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco.
The 0.4% tax is assumed to be effective on January 1, 2005, and would initially generate an
additional $158.2 million in sales and use tax revenues annually. Both the new incremental tax and
revenue from the existing tax are used to fund the Plan.

sources. Sales tax growth projections from 2004 through 2009 were based on the Colorado
Legislative Council (CLC) forecasts. The sales tax growth rates for the years 2010 through 2025 were
provided by AECOM which based their forecasts on data from the Center for Business and Economic
Forecasting (CBEF). CLC growth forecasts, while for the entire state, are used in the report because
the Denver region constitutes over half the population of the state.
Assumed growth rates are shown in Figure 2-2:

Local Contributions
Beginning with the Central Platte Valley and the Southeast Corridor project, the District has
established a policy of requiring a portion of major project costs to be paid by local jurisdictions.
This Plan assumes that this policy will continue and that impacted jurisdictions will contribute an
amount in aggregate equal to 2.5% of the eligible corridor costs, which equates to 2.01% of total
project costs. On a plan wide basis, the amount of this contribution is estimated to total $95.03
million.
The source of funding for the local contribution is at the discretion of each local jurisdiction. Local
contributions could consist of right-of-way dedications, permit fee waivers, cash contributions,
corridor utility relocations as well as any other direct, project-related corridor contributions. Generally
throughout the system, the financial benefits from transit development in terms of assessed
valuations, enhanced development potential, reduced travel times and improved congestion accrue
to the local communities.
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution entitled “Regarding Board
Commitments for FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action confirmed RTD’s commitment to build
each corridor’s specific list of corridor improvements consistent with and as described in the
FasTracks Plan and within the fiscal constraints and schedule of the plan subject to the completion of
the environmental process and conformity with any federal Record of Decision for a corridor. It further
formalized the commitment to analyze the Plan annually to determine current revenue projections
from both local and federal sources. The resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better or worse than
expected then all the corridors will be adjusted accordingly.”
Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution commits "that prior to construction, a corridor cost risk
assessment and value engineering (will) be conducted to minimize the potential for cost overruns and
schedule delays. Based on the results of both analyses, modifications to individual corridor project
elements, service plans, and schedules may be necessary for all FasTracks corridors.This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled construction and operation of the remaining FasTracks
corridors, thereby "holding harmless" those corridors. This information shall be reported annually to
the general public.
Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved resolution reads as follows: “Construction of FasTracks
committed improvements within a corridor will not start until there is a firm commitment of all required
funding sources, be they private, local-match or federal monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments concerning permits, design and plan review proves for timely
implementation.”

Federal Funding
Both the Southwest and the Southeast corridor projects were undertaken with assistance from the
Federal Transit Administration in the form of New Start Grant funds. Under Federal procedures, once
a project is qualified for funding, the FTA enters into a “Full Funding Grant Agreement” or FFGA. The
Agreement sets forth the maximum amount of the Federal contribution, and the percentage of federal
funding. In the case of the Southwest Corridor, the federal New Start percentage was 68% and in the
case of Southeast the Federal percentage was 60% of the project costs.
The Plan assumes that only three corridors, the East, West and Gold Line, will seek federal
discretionary funding through an FFGA. The total amount of Federal funding is assumed to be
$815.4 million in Federal New Start Grant funds and $110.0 million of other Federal grant revenues.
Of the $110.0 million, the Plan includes $50 million in federal assistance from FTA in the form of bus
discretionary funds for Denver Union Station or for other bus projects such as vehicles and facilities.
In addition, the Plan assumes $60 million in federal flexible dollars through the DRCOG planning
process between years 2010 and 2015 consistent with the District's past receipts. The New Start
funding is assumed to equal to 49% of the project costs for each of the corridors.

The District has the option to focus Federal participation in other corridors, or to seek Federal funding
for multiple corridors in response to Federal policy initiatives or funding availability in the future. The
Federal transit program is currently subject to reauthorization. As with prior reauthorizations, the
level of federal match is subject to change by the Congress. Although the statutory local match has
been at 20% for some time, the practical match for competitive projects has been historically near the
40% level. Congress may change the statutory match in subsequent reauthorizations. Federal
receipts are assumed to be capped at a reasonable appropriation level based on past RTD receipts
of New Start Grant Funding and current Federal funding practices. Therefore the financial plan has
accounted for instances when the Federal funding is received after the year in which the costs are
incurred.

Interest Earnings
During the construction period, the District will accumulate balances of both sales tax revenues as
well as bond proceeds awaiting expenditures. In developing the Plan, debt issuances were
scheduled every two years to allow the District to take advantage of federal arbitrage rules generally
allowing local issuers to keep positive interest earnings if all bond proceeds are expended within a
designated two-year test.
The Plan assumes investment revenues will be earned at a rate equal to 4.0%. Thus, with the
exception of the variable rate debt, we have not assumed any net positive arbitrage on bond
proceeds. Any such earnings would act as either additional revenues or as an offset against higher
borrowing costs.
Sales tax cash balances have been managed to ensure a projected minimum of $25 million in the
Transit Development Reserve at the end of each year.
Between 2005 and 2017, investment earnings are projected to total $234.34 million.

Farebox Revenue Forecasts
Base System
Base system farebox revenues were based on the forecast contained in RTD’s 2004 Adopted
Budget. This forecast was based on the 2003 Amended Budget forecast of farebox revenues,
adjusted for the fare increase that occurred on January 1, 2004, and the additional service provided
as of January 1, 2004 with the annexation of the city of Lone Tree into the RTD District.
Farebox revenue forecasts for the base system for the years 2005-2025 assumed growth based on
population growth and service growth. Farebox revenues were assumed to increase with the rate of
population growth each year, due to ridership increases associated with population growth.
Additional increases were tied to increases in service, with farebox revenue assumed to increase at
75% of the systemwide average revenue per service hour with each increased hour of bus service
provided. These adjustments were initially applied in constant 2004 dollars.
FasTracks Corridors
For the FasTracks corridors, RTD prepared travel forecasts for the horizon years of 2015 and 2025.
Both forecasts assumed the full build-out of the FasTracks rapid transit system. Although some lines
open later than 2015, these forecasts allowed RTD to understand ridership growth as a result of
population and employment growth between those horizon years.
Second, RTD combined the construction schedule with the forecasts. Passenger fare revenues were
assumed to start six months after operating costs are incurred. This reflects the fact that each
corridor will incur operating costs for six months of testing and start-up, before passenger fares are
collected.

Third, existing average fares paid by class of service were applied to the ridership forecasts for each
corridor in constant 2001 dollars. Based upon the forecast boardings by station, RTD estimated the
percentages of riders on each corridor expected to be paying local, express, regional, and skyRide
fares. Table 2-4 shows the 2001 average fare paid by class of service.

Applying the average fare paid by service class to the forecast boardings by station and distance
from downtown Denver, the average fares per boarding shown in Table 2-5 were generated for each
corridor:

The travel forecasting model produces daily ridership estimates. The fare recovery rates are applied,
then the daily fare totals are annualized. The annualization factor was adjusted to ensure that it did
not overestimate fare revenues for existing years of 2001 and 2002, and also cross-checked for
reasonableness. The Federal Transit Administration allows annualization factors of up to 300x daily
ridership in the Federal New Starts process. FasTracks was calibrated at 288x daily ridership from
the model, well under the allowable standard.
Fare Increases
The initial farebox revenue projections were developed in constant year dollars, and adjusted to
incorporate fare increases to keep pace with inflation. RTD fiscal policies state that RTD’s six-year
Transit Development Program (TDP) will include periodic fare increases to permit fare revenues to
keep pace with cost increases, as measured by the Denver-Boulder Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).
Over the past 15 years, the timing of these increases has ranged from annually, as in the years 20022004, to an eight-year period between the 1989 and 1997 fare increases.
The 2004-2009 TDP, as adopted by the Board of Directors in August 2003, assumed fare increases
in 2006 and 2009 to keep pace with inflation. These fare increases were assumed to yield an 8%

increase in fare revenue after any ridership loss caused by the fare increases. The FasTracks
farebox revenue forecasts assume that these fare increases will be implemented, and that similar
fare increases will be implemented every third year after 2009. Therefore, the constant dollar
revenue forecasts were adjusted to nominal dollars by assuming an 8% revenue increase every third
year, beginning in 2006.

Debt Financing Requirements
Not surprisingly, a plan to accomplish $4.7 billion in transit development over twelve years requires
significant debt financing.
Historically, the District has utilized two primary debt-financing techniques: Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPs). This section describes a possible scenario for
utilizing these methods of financing, along with other borrowing methods including commercial paper
and federal loans. Provided RTD keeps within voter approved ballot authorizations for debt and
repayment, RTD may use any combination of legally available financing methods and the amounts
set forth in the discussion below are subject to change.
The District currently has $273,415,000 in sales tax bonds outstanding. In August 2001, a
commercial paper program, secured by sales tax revenues on a junior lien to the fixed rate sales tax
bonds was implemented in the amount of $118.5 million. Of this amount, $92.5 million has been
issued.
Table 2-6 shows the debt service requirements for the existing bonds, and estimated debt service
requirements for the currently authorized bonds.

Of the $118.5 million authorized commercial paper, it is estimated that $92.5 million will be issued,
with interest debt service on the CP estimated to be $3.1 million annually and the principal scheduled
to be retired between 2006 and 2008.
The District has used COPs, which are a form of lease purchase debt for financing buses and rail
vehicles. COPs are not secured by a pledge of the sales tax revenues themselves, but represent a
lease secured by the equipment and the District’s commitment to appropriate payments in each
annual budget.

Sales tax revenue bonds are provided as the “backbone” of the financing program. This is because
senior lien sales tax bonds provide the strongest security, and thus lowest long-term borrowing costs
to the District.

Bond issues are staggered in two-year increments in order to reduce costs associated with issuance
and to provide the opportunity for the District to take advantage of arbitrage earnings opportunities.
Bonds are assumed to be issued on a fixed rate basis, but this is not required. An assumed TIC
(True Interest Cost) of 6.354% representing current rates plus a margin in excess of 100 basis points
was used in the Plan. For Plan purposes, all bonds were assumed to be issued on January 1 of their
respective years of issuance and have a thirty year maturity.
An additional $213.5 million in debt was assumed to be issued as COPs. COP debt service is not
covered by TABOR restrictions.

In the Southeast Corridor Plan, the District addressed the problem of lagging Federal grant receipts
through the creation of a commercial paper program. Commercial paper allows the District to provide
short term, interim financing of the Federal cash flow and thus keep the project on schedule.
While it is currently impossible to predict the ability of the FTA to meet its cash flow requirements in
the 2007-2017 timeframe, it is highly probable that some form of interim financing will be required.
As with the Southeast Corridor Plan of Finance, a Tax Exempt Commercial Paper Program (CP) is
recommended as an interim funding vehicle to ensure delays in the receipt of Federal Funds do not
delay the construction of the corridors.
Commercial paper is a commonly used financing tool that allows issuers to “ramp-up” their debt for a
term ranging from one day to 270 days. This flexibility makes it possible for issuers to keep the debt

outstanding for only the time it is needed, until permanent funds are received. In recent years, nearly
every transit agency undertaking a new start project with federal funding as identified the need for an
interim funding vehicle such as commercial paper. Commercial paper may be issued using any
legally available technique for rate determination.
In the case of the FasTracks Plan, $815.4 million of commercial paper is assumed. This will fund
expected Federal commitments with the funding schedule varying for each corridor. In other words,
the Plan allows federal support to lag the project cash flow requirements without delaying the
construction schedule.

TIFIA Loan
TIFIA, or the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 provides a new source
of project financing to eligible projects. Under the provisions of TIFIA, the US DOT can provide direct
loans, credit enhancement or lines of credit.
To date, TIFIA has approved financing instruments totaling $3.59 billion for 11 projects. Transit
projects that have utilized TIFIA include Washington Metro, the Tren Urbano project in Puerto Rico,
the Staten Island Ferries, Miami Intermodal Center and the New York Penn Station renovations.
Eligible projects must meet some specific federal criteria. These include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Project must be at least $100 million
TIFIA support limited to 33% of project costs
Project adheres to federal project requirements (labor, civil rights,etc.)
Repayment must be from project revenues or non-federal tax sources
Project sponsors senior debt must be investment grade

In the case of the Plan, we have recommended a loan in the amount of $142.95 representing 33% of
the North Metro project costs. (The District may choose to program a different corridor for federal
participation depending on project delivery strategy at the time of implementation).
The advantage of the TIFIA program is it allows the District to borrow on a subordinate basis to its
other debt. The financing rate is based on the 30-year Treasury bond rate, which is currently 5.07%.
(The basis of the rate will be related to a spread over the SLGS rate as Treasury phases out the 30year bond but will be comparable). For purposes of this plan a 6.00% TIFIA rate was assumed.
Repayment of the loan may be deferred to accommodate senior debt requirements and amortized
over 35 years. Loans may also be repaid early without penalty. While the interest rate is higher than
traditional tax-exempt debt, it is low compared to other deeply subordinate debt options and it
provides excellent flexibility.
The current federally adopted selection criteria for TIFIA projects include the following eight elements:
(1) The extent to which the project is nationally or regionally significant, in terms of generating
economic benefits, supporting international commerce, or otherwise enhancing the national
transportation system (20 percent);
(2) The creditworthiness of the project, including a determination by the Secretary that any
financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, to ensure
repayment (12.5 percent);
(3) The extent to which such assistance would foster innovative public-private partnerships and
attract private debt or equity investment (20 percent);
(4) The likelihood that such assistance would enable the project to proceed at an earlier date
than the project would otherwise be able to proceed (12.5 percent);
(5) The extent to which the project uses new technologies, including Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) that enhance the efficiency of the project (5 percent);

(6) The amount of budget authority required to fund the Federal credit instrument made available
(5 percent);
(7) The extent to which the project helps maintain or protect the environment (20 percent);
(8) The extent to which such assistance would reduce the contribution of Federal grant
assistance to the project (5 percent).
The TIFIA program, like the FTA program is subject to reauthorization, and its availability to
provide support to the Plan is dependent on its reauthorization.

TABOR Requirements
The Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), or Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution,
approved by Colorado voters in November 1992, restricts the ability of the District to enter into a
multi-year fiscal obligation without voter approval unless there are adequate present cash reserves.
TABOR also requires voter approval in advance for: (i) any increase in the District’s revenues and
spending from one year to the next in excess of a specified growth rate, (CPI plus a growth factor
based on net increase in the value of new taxable property) (ii) any new tax or tax increase.
The Plan is premised on voters approving a ballot issue in the November 2004 election the wording
of which was established by the Colorado legislature. It would give the District the necessary
authority to issue debt, increase the current tax rate by 0.4% and keep the revenue to build the
system. A portion of the tax increase may remain after the system is built, as operating costs for the
expanded system may be higher than for the current system.
While the increase in the authorized tax rate is fairly straight forward, the authorization for debt must
estimate both the principal amount of debt issued and the expected interest rate for transactions
extending through 2013. COPs have not been treated as debt subject to TABOR approval by the
Colorado courts and they are not included in the voter authorization.
There are three elements of the financial plan subject to the TABOR requirements: fixed rate bonds,
commercial paper and the proposed TIFIA loan. All of the estimated principal and interest for these
items are included in the amounts the voters will be asked to approve. How the principal and interest
is allocated among these different financing mechanisms is subject to change. The total amount of
principal and debt service the voters will be asked to approve is shown in Table 2-10.

As with any long range capital improvement plan, the actual implementation of the Plan is dependent
on project costs, inflation factors, revenue trends, and interest rate environment in the future. These
factors can never be predicted over a thirteen year horizon with exact precision.
For this reason, the Plan reflects significant contingencies. For example, the project cost estimates
contain a price contingency. Interest rates have been assumed to be over 150 basis points higher
than the Colorado municipal market data tax exempt current market rate of 4.81%. Variable interest
rates have been assumed to be more than 200 basis points over the current Bond Market
Association (BMA) index rate of 1.02%.
The FasTracks cost estimates also include contingency factors to account for unforeseen changes in
project scope or unit cost increases beyond general rates of inflation. The contingency was applied
to the items with the greatest risk factors for unforeseen cost changes, with factors varying by the
assessment of potential risk. Table 2-11 shows the overall contingency factors by cost element.

Contingency Factor
25%

Thus, the FasTracks cost estimates used in the cash flow already include a total of $573 million in
uninflated dollars for contingency.
The Plan also automatically assumes that Federal grants will be received two years after initial
eligibility. To the extent Federal funding is provided on a more-timely basis, some of the debt
assumed in the Plan will be unnecessary.
Should the District be faced with a significant economic recession, or find project costs are
substantially higher than are currently estimated, and that such costs exceed the contingency budget,
the District has several options to address this situation. These include delaying projects, modifying
the scope of certain projects, seeking additional Federal or local funding or seeking additional voter
approved funding options. Prior to taking any of these actions, the Board will hold full and complete
public hearings and provide sufficient notice to the stakeholders in the region.

The FasTracks Investment
• RTD has completed 75% of the FasTracks program
– 7 transit corridors, plus 1 opening in 2020
– Denver Union Station redevelopment

• The original FasTracks budget was $4.7 billion
• RTD has actually invested more than $5.6 billion after enduring
much higher construction materials costs and much lowerthan-projected sales tax revenues (approximately $1 billion)
due to the Recession
• Established the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) in
2013, capped bus service increase in 2013
