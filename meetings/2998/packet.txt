Subject:

Agreement with Denver at I-25 & Broadway
Station to Facilitate Denver’s Transportation
Project

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: May 12, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents, including
Intergovernmental Agreements, necessary to effectuate Denver’s transportation project, which includes
transit infrastructure improvements and the disposition and acquisition of real property at I-25 &
Broadway Station (the “Station”) to and from, respectively, the City and County of Denver (the “City” or
“Denver”).
This action addresses the following General Manager’s goals for 2020:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management: Oversees operating and FasTracks budgets, ensures
compliance with local, state, and federal reporting, and development of financing plans
for future projects.
Task Goal #1 – Strengthen Transparent Public Communication/Collaboration
BACKGROUND
For many years, the City and the Colorado Department of Transportation (“CDOT”) have planned to
alleviate congestion and improve safety on southbound Broadway by constructing a new on-ramp for I25 South. Rather than turning left and crossing northbound traffic to access the highway, drivers
heading south on Broadway will turn right just north of the highway, onto a ramp that will “wedge”
under the highway, between the existing off-ramp and southbound lanes, and over Broadway. The
wedge ramp (the “Project”) is part of a larger project called South Broadway Station Multimodal &
Safety Improvement Project (“SBSMSIP”). The purpose of SBSMSIP is to create a South Broadway
corridor that provides safe and efficient mobility for all modes (pedestrian, bicycle, transit, and
automobile). The goals of SBSMSIP include improving multimodal connections to I-25 & Broadway
Station, increasing safety at five high-crash intersections, and decreasing congestion and improving
operations for all modes of transportation.
The City has completed extensive community outreach for SBSMSIP and has received financial support
from the Denver Regional Council of Governments (“DRCOG”) and CDOT, including the use of Federal
funds. The City expects to complete the Project by 2025.
To execute the Project, which is just one component of SBSMSIP, the City requires land and other real
property rights owned by RTD at I-25 & Broadway Station. The Station is one of RTD’s busiest, with
significant bus and light rail service and more than 1,000 parking spaces, which are very highly utilized.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The three parcels of land that the City plans to acquire from RTD for the Project are shown in the Site
Map as “A,” “B,” and “C”. In exchange for the RTD real property interests, the City will transfer to RTD
the parcel of land it owns at the Station, which sits under the highway and is shown as Parcel D on the
site map. In addition, the City will construct approximately 200 parking spaces (the “Improvements”) on
the dirt lot in the RTD Park-n-Ride under I-25 (the “PnR”), where approximately 200 transit spaces are
currently located. The Improvements to the dirt lot will be a substantial benefit to RTD and its patrons,
and will meet RTD standards for paving, lighting, security, safety, and other RTD requirements. The City
will also provide RTD with approximately 200 temporary RTD parking spaces during construction at one
or more locations approved by RTD. The temporary parking will also meet RTD standards.
RTD will enter into a Common Use Agreement with the Colorado Department of Transportation, which
will accept and maintain the Wedge Ramp after it is constructed.
DISCUSSION
This action would give the General Manager and/or his designee the authority to negotiate and execute
all documents, including but not limited to, an intergovernmental agreement between RTD and Denver
incorporating the required conditions below and providing for the disposition and acquisition of real
property at I-25 & Broadway Station to and from, respectively, the City and County of Denver.
The execution of these documents will only be authorized to take place if the following conditions are
met:
•

Denver will provide RTD with a minimum of 200 parking spaces at locations acceptable to RTD,
both during construction and in the final condition of the Project, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by both parties.

•

Denver will improve the PnR impacted by the Project. Such Improvements include, but are not
limited to, paving (concrete is expected), curb & gutter, traffic control devices, striping, lighting,
camera coverage, emergency telephones, pedestrian pathways, and ancillary improvements.

•

The value of the real property interests provided by RTD, and any expenditures on the Project by
RTD, shall be commensurate with the real property interests provided by Denver and the value of
the Improvements. RTD and Denver may consider maintenance, congestion mitigation, and air
quality improvements.

•

At all times during construction and in the final condition of the Project, RTD buses will have two
points of full movement access into and out of I25 & Broadway Station in locations approved by
RTD.

•

Denver must receive RTD approval for all phases of design of the portion of the Project that
impacts RTD Property or relates to transit safety, security, and operations (as determined by
RTD).

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Accepting the Recommended Action would have a minimal impact on RTD’s ongoing operations &
maintenance costs for the PnR. RTD would be gaining the asset improvement at a value to be
determined.

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 48
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 48 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and FlexRide services at a price not to exceed $3,616,009. Costs by sub-fleets are as follows:
Access-a-ride
Flexride

(37)
(11)

$74,957 ea
$76,600 ea

$2,773,409
$842,600

This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI).
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 48 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 37
2014 model year Startrans buses used for Access-A-Ride service, seven 2013 model year Eldorado
buses used for the FlexRide service and provide four expansion buses for the Wagon Road (2) and the
Platte Valley (2) FlexRide service.
DISCUSSION
The 2013 and 2014 model year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 6 years old and
have accumulated an average of 180,000 miles and 230,000 miles respectively. They require intensive
maintenance to keep them in service.
The new cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with the
disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The buses will be equipped with an extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized
wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for the FlexRide buses and three wheelchair access areas for

Packet Pg. 10

1.B.2

the Access-a-Ride buses. These designs exceed ADA requirements. The buses will also be equipped
with a security camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2020 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.

Broomfield CMAQ Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the City and County of Broomfield to provide the expanded Broomfield FlexRide
service. This service will be funded through the grant and the local match. No RTD money is required.
This Agreement is for the period 2019 - 2023. Federal Funding years 2020-2023.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, the City and County of Broomfield applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for an expanded Broomfield FlexRide service. This grant was approved with funding available
2016-2019. The City and County of Broomfield contributed the entire local match.
In 2019, the City and County of Broomfield applied for a new CMAQ to keep the extended service and
possible expansion to the peaks and Saturday service. The extended service continued the operations of
the additional bus and expanded service area. The CMAQ approved account for $1,440,000 grant
funds and $360,000 in local funds. The City and County of Broomfield will contribute the entire local
match.
In the August 2019 service change package, the RTD Board approved continuing the service if the grant
was approved.
Considering the current operator shortage this additional service will not require the hiring of additional
employees as Via Mobility has been operating the expansion service and continues to operate it with
existing staff. Any additional vehicles during peaks will not be added if it requires an additional operator
during the operator shortage.
DISCUSSION:
Prior to the original grant, the Broomfield FlexRide did not cover the entire City and County. This grant
continues to provide additional coverage in the City and County of Broomfield.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the expanded Broomfield FlexRide were included in the 2020 budget. All
funds expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - April 2020 (4183 : Service Availability April 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.48% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in April 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement overall year-to-date as compared to the same period in 2019. Lost service for
personnel related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

April 2020 – 587.83 hours
April 2019 – 113.18 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1531.75 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 1904.75 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in April were bus bridges, several late season
snowstorms, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.48% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 1,822 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 14,576 hours of service being provided
by a “6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 1,720 shifts, or approximately 14,250 hours of service, with operators working a
“6th day”. Mandating for the month of April was down substantially due to the
implementation of reduced services levels in conjunction with the pandemic service change.

•

Further reduces by $3,000 the amount allocated to each Director’s travel expense budget;
Reduces by $1,000 the amount allocated to each Director’s local expense budget.

If approved, when combined with previous reductions, the expense budgets for each Director other than

expense budgets would be set at $3,500 for local expenses and $2,500 for travel expenses.
ALTERNATIVES

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. _____, SERIES OF 2020

WHEREAS, RTD’s Board of Directors consists of 15 elected members who serve their
constituents on a daily basis throughout the community, at committee meetings, study
sessions, and Board meetings, and at the legislature; and
WHEREAS, Each fiscal year moneys are allocated to Directors’ expense budgets to allow for
reimbursement of their individual local and travel expenses; and
WHEREAS, The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on both farebox revenues and
sales and use tax revenues; and
WHEREAS, Though RTD has received a significant amount of funding through the federal
CARES Act, that amount is not enough to offset lost revenues, and further agency-wide
budget reductions for fiscal year 2020 are now warranted; and
WHEREAS, Social distancing requirements, broad travel restrictions, and event cancellations
both locally and nationwide have diminished Directors’ opportunities to travel within their
districts to conduct business and meet with constituents and to travel outside of the state
in the exercise of their duties; and
WHEREAS, At the same time, remote meetings have offered the Directors the ability to
conduct business from home, thus minimizing or eliminating the need to travel to and from
the Blake Street Offices to participate in, and formally vote during, Board and committee
meetings during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
WHEREAS, Due to a projected revenue shortfall in 2020, the Board of Directors approved
Resolution 012, Series of 2019, which reduced the amounts allocated to the Directors for
fiscal year 2020.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that for fiscal year 2020 only, in light of ongoing
financial hardships impacting the agency, the Board hereby reduces the following budget
lines:

Introduction
The following data was collected in response to inquiries
regarding RTD costs, investment, and revenue based on
District geography. It is important to keep in mind that:
• RTD operations are not segregated by county and most
routes operate across multiple counties
• Both costs and revenue are provided and consumed by
residents of other counties and residents outside the District
• RTD’s network is designed with Denver as a primary service
hub which results in a larger share of expenditures being
allocated to the City and County of Denver

Information

DISCUSSION
With the onset of the COVID-19 virus, there was a significant reduction in sales and use tax revenue
and fare box revenue. We have prepared an analysis which is attached regarding three different
possible scenarios regarding revenues for 2020, (Best/ Mid/ Worst Case). These projections have
been prepared with limited information and will most likely change over the coming months as actual
revenue is realized. However, due to the nature of our industry, it is critical that staff make
assumptions so that additional actions that might need to be taken to reduce expenditures occurs
sooner rather than later.
Transit as been fortunate in that Congress passed the CARES Act to assist transit agencies with
operating costs and specifically revenue replacement. The attached analysis takes the CARES Act
funding into account. CARES Act funding is 100% federal and doesn’t expire.
In addition, through the amended budget solicitation process, we have additional expenditures that
have been identified. The largest of these is under administrative. We discovered that we had not
booked the appropriate amounts for the represented health and welfare programs and the lump sum
contribution to the represented pension.
We then identified the overall shortfall under the three revenue scenarios. In addition, we have
identified funding sources to address these shortfalls that the Board may want to consider. In one
of the scenarios, there are some funds projected to be available for use in 2021. Even though there
appears to be funds available at this time, it still might be prudent to consider some additional
reductions as revenues in 2021 are expected to be less favorable than what was presented at the
March 31st Board study session.
Exhibit A details the proposed increases for the administration and operations. Exhibit B details the
proposed increases and decreases in capital projects. Exhibit C details the reductions in both
administration and operating.
In addition, we have calculated the amount that could be saved on a daily basis through the use of
furlough days.
For example, if every employee took five (5) furlough days between now and
st
December 31 you could estimate a savings of $3.7 million ($740,000 x 5).

Packet Pg. 40

2.C.2

A furlough is a mandatory temporary leave of absence from which the employee is expected to
return to work or to be restored from a reduced work schedule. Furloughed employees may be
required to take a certain number of unpaid hours off over a number of weeks, take a specified
number of unpaid days or hours throughout the year, or take a single block of unpaid time off. A
layoff is generally considered a separation from employment due to a lack of work available. The
term "layoff" is mostly a description of a type of termination in which the employee holds no blame.

(1) Variance is due to lower parts, suppliers and purchased transportation.
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted evenly across year but not yet started.
(4) Variance is due to timing of project expenses not yet incurred, many of which are grant-funded.
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs.
(6) Variance is due primarily to timing of outside counsel costs related to litigation.
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects.
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules, other outside services and special events.
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of hosting services charges for MinuteTraq.
(11) Variance due to timing of grant fund draws, particularly the Eagle P3 FFGA and preventive maintenance grants typcially drawn late in the year.

POLICY REFERENCE
Investment Policy
DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2020 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a steady pace during the first two
months of the first quarter of 2020. The U.S. unemployment rate remained low and general inflationary
pressures remained tame. In March, social distancing in response to the novel coronavirus began a sharp
decline in economic activity and cause long term interest rates to move lower.
In response to the corona virus outbreak causing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job
losses, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee reduced the target range for the federal funds rate
to 0.00 to 0.25 percent. The Committee stated that it expects to “maintain this target range until it is
confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum
employment and price stability goals.” This drastic reduction in short term interest rates will likely lead
to lower than expected investment income for RTD in 2020.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance. The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return (yield plus change in market value) on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the
District’s unrestricted portfolio and investment benchmarks were as follows:

Live Program Update

Board Meeting Date: May 12, 2020
Information

BACKGROUND
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program transitioned to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

Packet Pg. 71

2.D.2

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of May 5, 2020, 9,076 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 5,679 have been approved,
2,300 have been denied and the remaining 1,097 are pending. Of the 2,300 denied, 1,531 were denied
because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a better discount,
452 were denied because their address was out of District, 49 were denied because it was a duplicate
application, 41 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 77 were denied because they
did not respond to requests for additional information, and 150 were denied because they did not meet
the income threshold. Of the 1,097 pending applications, 1,026 lack an uploaded photo, 69 are pending
for eligibility determination by a benefits program that would income-qualify the applicant for LiVE, and 2
are pending because the applicant needs to provide additional information.
We saw a significant drop in applications when the social distancing measures related to the COVID-19
pandemic went into effect. The number of approved applications per week decreased by 59% from an
average of 231 per week in the first two weeks of March to an average of 95 in the following three
weeks and have remained stable since. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 situation, we are seeing a higher
percentage of applicants who apply for LiVE at the same time as they apply for other benefit programs,
or shortly thereafter.
In addition to going live on July 29, 2019, the following actions have been completed:
• LiVE fares are available through RTD’s mobile ticketing application.
• LiVE fares are available on LiVE MyRide smart cards. The cards can be ordered through the
MyRide portal and have been made available for purchase at RTD sales outlets as well as
King Soopers and Safeway stores.
• LiVE airport upgrades are available on buses and from Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).
• Order forms for LiVE 10-ride tickets have been made available to organizations in the RTD
nonprofit program.
• RTD Operations staff and Security staff have been trained on the LiVE fares and eligibility
requirements.
• Marketing, training, product readiness and communications activities have been deployed.
• Step-by-by step instructions for applications as well as other materials are available
through the RTD LiVE web page. A LiVE Program handout has been created, printed, and
uploaded to the web page. The instructions and handout are available in English and
Spanish.
• The LiVE application process in PEAK is available to applicants in both English and
Spanish.

RTD customer service is answering LiVE program questions and referring customers to the
appropriate parties for assistance.
Denver Human Services is verifying income for those not categorically income-eligible
through public assistance programs.
Denver Human Services is providing LiVE eligibility customer service by phone and e-mail.
RTD staff are performing quality control, making any needed adjustments for uploaded
photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions. Community partners can request
printed LiVE handouts through this email address.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
Denver Human Services has provided information about the LiVE Program and application
at community events and to community partners and caseworkers.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has identified requirements for PEAK enhancements related to the LiVE
application and application processing.
RTD would like to provide some application help to eligible riders who have barriers to
applying. We envision an application outreach worker helping interested individuals apply
at rotating locations throughout the District, for example homeless shelters. RTD and
Denver Human Services have agreed to pursue this option.
Negotiated the scope for enhancements to the LiVE application and application processing
in PEAK with the State’s software vendor. These enhancements will include revised
verbiage in the LiVE application based on feedback. Due to the pandemic’s impacts on the
RTD budget, this project was put on hold.
RTD kicked off a broader marketing campaign about all fare discounts, including LiVE,
starting with in-vehicle advertising and social media posts.
We worked with Denver Human Services to adjust procedures due to the COVID-19
situation. The LiVE eligibility technicians are processing applications and provide customer
service remotely while the Denver Human Services offices are closed to the public. In
addition to the online application on PEAK, interested individuals have the option of
applying by phone until the offices re-open.

On-Going:
•
•
•

RTD is working with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to work out
remaining “bugs” from the initial implementation in PEAK.
RTD is evaluating next activities for the marketing campaign about the discounts offered
by RTD, in accordance with the LiVE/All Discounts Communications Plan.
RTD outreach staff are pursuing alternative channels of communication since in-person

outreach is not currently an option.
Creation of new LiVE informational materials based on feedback by customers, Denver
Human Services, and community-based organizations. This includes a comprehensive
questions & answers document and short videos with basic information, how to apply,
and how to use the program.
On-going communications with organizations in the RTD Nonprofit Program about program
rules, the application process, feedback, and changes due to the COVID-19 situation.
RTD is working with homeless services providers to determine if a temporary LiVE ID card
issued by such organizations would be feasible. This would eliminate the wait time
between the LiVE application and the ability to use the discounted tickets for individuals in
emergency situations.

Finalize and execute the amendment to the intergovernmental agreement with the City and
County of Denver to add the services of an application outreach worker.
Finalize questions for the survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program.
RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
The team will use participation and usage numbers as well as feedback from customers,
partner organizations, and RTD staff to consider further enhancements to the program.
This will include re-assessing which fare products are available for LiVE.
