Purpose of the Plan
Define strategies to get more transit patrons biking
to and parking at RTD facilities, because:
•

Demand for Bike-on-Bus and Bike-on-Rail is
growing, little opportunity for capacity increase

•

Over 50% of RTD customers live or work
within 3 miles of their transit stop

•

Satisfaction ratings and lease rates for bike
lockers are low

•

Census indicates nearly 3% of Denver
residents commute by bike (doubled since
2005)

Recommendations to Board

Packet Pg. 34

Attachment: NAMS Update Presentation 05.13.14-accessible (1936 : NAMS Update)

1.B.2.a

• The following NAMS prioritized list of
improvements reflects the general consensus
of the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) on
April 18, 2014.
• An overarching theme serves as a basis from
which consensus on the priorities is
grounded:
– The Northwest area remains committed to
Northwest Rail, as envisioned in FasTracks.
Given the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s
implementation, Northwest stakeholders want to
see mobility benefits sooner.

Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: NAMS Update Presentation 05.13.14-accessible (1936 : NAMS Update)

General Principles

1.B.2.a

General Principles (continued)
• Projects on this prioritized list should not be
considered absolutely sequential:

– Nothing should preclude the pursuit or
acceleration of any of these priorities should
viable opportunities or partners become available.
– More than one priority can be pursued
simultaneously.
– RTD should be proactive, aggressive and
creative in monitoring these projects for any
significant developments that help a project move
forward (e.g. public or P3 funding opportunities,
BNSF plans).

North Metro Extension
• North Metro Rail Extension (SH 7 to
Longmont)
– Estimated cost combined with projected low
ridership yields annual cost per boarding
almost 6x higher than Northwest Rail.
– It is recommended by the Study Team and
accepted by the NAMS PAC not to proceed
with any action on this corridor at this time.
Corridor should be re-evaluated in the future
if population densities or other conditions
change.

RTD and FasTracks
Overview
RTD oversees a 47-mile rail transit system that services 46
stations on five corridors including:
• The 5.3-mile Central Corridor and 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley (CPV) Spur in central Denver
• The 8.7-mile Southwest Line to Englewood, Sheridan,
and Littleton
• The 19.2-mile Southeast Line to Lone Tree and Aurora
• The 12.1-mile West Line to Lakewood and Golden
The FasTracks program, approved by district voters in a
2004 ballot initiative will:
• add 122 miles of rail service
• 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
• approximately 60 new stations along six new corridors
• extend three existing light rail lines

Grand Opening / image courtesy RTD

Construction cranes dominated the skyline in
2013, as the result of an apartment boom in
the metro area. Development in 2013 centered
on the hub of the FasTracks program: Denver
Union Station which is scheduled to open in
spring 2014. Significant development has also
occurred around other existing and future
stations as construction of FasTracks corridors
continues at a rapid pace.
2013 marked a productive year for FasTracks.
The W Line was the first line to open in April,
successfully shuttling passengers between
Denver Union Station and the Jefferson County
Government Center. RTD also entered into
a contract with Regional Rail Partners to
construct the North Metro Rail Line to 124th
Avenue Station in Thornton by 2018.
The US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line will
launch in 2016 with a dedicated lane for
buses, new park-n-ride facilities, and stations.
The East Line, Gold Line, and Northwest
Commuter Rail Line to Westminster are on
schedule to open in 2016. The I-225 Light Rail
Line connecting the East Line to the Southeast
Line through Aurora will also open in 2016.
Construction of revitalized Denver Union
Station, the nexus of the entire transit system,
is wrapping up for a May 2014 opening.

RTD and TOD
Transit-oriented development is typically
higher density and incorporates a mixture
of different uses that generate transit ridership. Multiple TODs contribute to creating
transit-oriented communities where people
can live, work, reduce transportation costs,
and improve overall health through increased
muli-modal activity. RTD plays a proactive role
in facilitating transit-supportive development
around transit station and strives to realize
the following goals:
• Promote multi-sector, cross-jurisdictional
partnerships
• Encourage sustainable development that
supports the transit system
• Ensure a hierarchy of multi-modal access
• Protect and enhance RTD’s transit assets
RTD achieves these goals by developing transit
stations that are accessible to multi-modal commuters; establishing partnerships with public or
private sector developers, and by supporting
local jurisdictions in developing TOD station
area plans. RTD’s TOD group conducts research
to support transit-oriented development, shares
information with both the public and private
sector, and provides planning assistance in order
to help local jurisdictions connect transit service to economic and community development.
Currently RTD is working with local jurisdictions on both planning and development projects. The following table highlights the Station
Area Master Plans scheduled and underway.

2013 was an active year for the RTD TOD Pilot
Program. RTD along with D4 Urban have continued working on the the development partnership
at Alameda Station, which will break ground in
2014 and ultimately provide 275 residential units
and updated transit amenities. Also in 2013,
RTD, the City of Arvada, and the Arvada Urban
Renewal Authority chose Trammell Crow to develop a nine acre site adjacent to the future Olde
Town Arvada Station along the Gold Line. This
partnership is now working to design a parking garage that will address commuter parking,
business parking, and allow for more developable
space to be dedicated to TOD. Groundbreaking
on the parking structure is also expected in 2014.
Depot Square at Boulder Transit Village broke
ground in August of 2013. The Boulder Transit
Village development is above an underground
RTD bus facility that anchors one end of the
US 36 BRT line. This project will rehabilitate
the historic Boulder Train Depot and create a
mixed-use development that includes a hotel
and 71 permanently affordable apartment units.

The Denver Union Station neighborhood will be a world class
transit-oriented community at the heart of Downtown Denver.
The region’s investment in the station is on track to catalyze
millions of square feet of new development.

Denver Union Station is on schedule to open May 9th, 2014. The redevelopment project
includes a $500 million investment in transit infrastructure, redevelopment of the
Historic Union Station Building, and substantial private transit-oriented development
adjacent to the station.
The new 22-bay bus concourse will replace
the existing Market Street Station in 2014, and
commuter rail will arrive with the East Line,
Gold Line, and Northwest Rail in 2016. Beginning in 2014, Amtrak service will return and
Union Station will serve as one terminus of the
Free Metro Ride that provides an additional
downtown link with Civic Center Station along
18th and 19th Streets.
The Denver Union Station project was originally laid out in the 2004 Denver Union Station
Master Plan. A supplement to the original plan
was adopted in 2008 and included more concrete plans for redevelopment. The Denver
Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA), City
and County of Denver, CDOT, and RTD have
actively collaborated on the planning, design
and construction of the project.
Station Area Planning
In addition to the Denver Union Station
Master Plan, the immediate station has been
zoned Transit-Mixed Use by the City of Denver, allowing for a wide variety of residential,
commercial, and civic uses.

City of Arvada selected Trammell Crow from
a field of 10 competing firms to develop 9
acres of publically owned land near the station.
Throughout 2013, the public-private partnership has worked to design a parking garage
that will replace the surface parking originally
planned for the station during the EIS process.
The parking garage will free additional area
