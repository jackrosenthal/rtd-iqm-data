UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A. Award of Three Year Contract to Synamon Systems (Network Security Consultant)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to award a three year contract to Synamon Systems, an SBE firm, in the
amount of $456,000 to provide network security support. The contract is being
brought to the Board because this is a Personal Services Contract per RTD Resolution
No. 27, Series of 1983.
B. May 2012 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve moving the proposed May 2012 Service Changes (Attachment A) on to
public review and comment.
C. 2012 FasTracks Financial Plan Adoption
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors direct staff to perform additional technical/financial analyses for Options 2 and 3
described below prior to taking formal action to approve the 2012 Annual Program
Evaluation (APE):

XIII.



Option 1 (Base Case): Delay completion of Northwest Rail 3 - 5 years to match RTD’s
cash flow requirements (results of technical/financial analyses of this option presented
during January 17, 2012 FasTracks Monitoring Committee meeting);



Option 2: Delay completion of Northwest Rail 3 - 5 years to match RTD’s cash flow
requirements, but accelerate select capital projects and increase funding for bus service
for Northwest Rail and U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit Corridor Service Areas. Would require
delaying all other partially-funded FasTracks corridors by approximately 6 months;



Option 3: Remove Northwest Rail from the FasTracks plan and commit remaining
Northwest Rail project funds, capped at $894.6 million (YOE), for expanded/enhanced
Bus Rapid Transit in the Northwest Corridor area to be completed by 2020.
