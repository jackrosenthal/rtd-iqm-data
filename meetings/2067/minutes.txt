scope of performance, reorganization, compensation, and job descriptions. Dee has been
a valuable asset to the HR department and has made a great impact. Dee will be
relocating to Oklahoma to be close to her daughter and grandchildren.
General Manager Washington added that Dee was the first person he met when he was
recruited to RTD. Dee was extremely professional and helped him in his transition from

military to a civilian career life.
Chair Pro Tem Cohen read into record the name of the other retirees and expressed
appreciation to the hard work and the caliber of employees that we have at RTD who
makes RTD great. The collective amount of years that they represent speaks to the
dedication and quality of our staff and this agency.
V.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
Marolyn Rittenhouse, Denver, explained that she was very concerned with the 3 minute wait
policy for buses especially since many buses are consistently late. Ms. Rittenhouse added
that this past Friday she had to walk one mile to make an appointment on time. This current
policy could leave people out in the cold if the bus is only running on one hour schedules.
Chair Pro Tem Cohen requested the General Manager to have a member of staff to talk
further with Ms Rittenhouse.
Adam Dempsey, Aurora, wanted to remind the Board that a number of seniors at Windsor
Gardens have expressed interest also in the 3-minute rule and he could identify with their
issues. A lot of seniors are going to try to use the 105 which would mean that they would be
walking across 8 lanes of traffic with only 35 seconds. He stated that a slight modification to
the route would help these seniors from a safety perspective and provide access to public
transportation that they rely upon for getting to the grocery store, Dr, etc. Mr. Dempsey
provided maps of the proposed route to use so that the residents of Windsor Gardens can still
get to where they need to go without the dangers of crossing multiple lanes of traffic.

GENERAL MANAGER OVERSIGHT & PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT UPDATE
Chair Pro Tem Cohen read into record on behalf of the Chair of the General Manager
Oversight and Performance Management Committee, Director Bagley, who was out sick,
a public statement pertaining to the General Manager Evaluation for 2011. A copy of that
readout is available in the minutes notebook located in the Board office.
Director Daly indicated a desire for a change to be added to this readout. In the 3 rd line of
the second item, paragraph 3 which states “however, in light of a number of external
factors such as the economy, budgetary cuts, hiring freezes, drastic service cuts, and
reduced sales tax revenue, and in consultation with the General Manager, the Board did
not offer a merit raise for 2012”. He asked to add the impact of the ATU negotiations

(i.e. extension of the ATU contract) to this statement.
Director Daly also noted that the numbering on the readout document skipped line 3 and
went to line 4. A correction has been made to this document.
Following the readout from Chair Pro Tem Cohen, the independent firm of RubinBrown
LLC provided the financial analysis on the cost of the General Manager’s contract.
Director McMullen commented on this being the most transparency and open process of
the General Manager’s contract since he became a member of the Board.
