REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION No. _____ SERIES OF 2014
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEES TO THE RTD PENSION TRUST AND DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Pension Plan and Trust for salaried employees hired by RTD
before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Defined Contribution Plan and Trust (the Trusts) for employees hired on
or after January 1, 2008; and,
Whereas, RTD Board Directors and salaried staff serve as trustees for the Trusts; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008
providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension
Trust Fund and the Finance Chair will screen applications from the middle management salaried Employee
Class and the senior management salaried employee Class and will bring recommendations back to the Board;
and,
Whereas, on December 16, 2008 the RTD Board of Directory by Resolution No. 19 Series of 2008
amended Section 7.01 of the RTD Pension Trust regarding appointment of Trustees and provided that each
Trustee who is a member of the Board of Directors of RTD shall serve a term concurrent with his or her elected
term, and one senior management and one middle management Trustee shall each serve a three year, and one
senior management and one middle Trustee shall each serve a two year term; and
Whereas, on November 10, 2010 Resolution No 27 series of 2010, the Board made additional
modifications to state that for reappointment of trustees who have served satisfactorily and in whose education
the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications for renewal and the
application process established by the RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when
the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts; and,
Whereas, the Board of Directors may establish shorter terms as may be necessary to maintain staggered
terms; and,
Whereas, the terms for Scott Reed and Lou Ha expired on 12/31/2013 each of whom has been
previously recommended by the screening committee; and
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
1.
The RTD Board of Directors wish to re-appoint Scott Reed to serve as a senior management Trustee on
the Boards of the Trusts with a new two-year term that will expire on 12-31-2015.

2.
The RTD Board of Directors wishes to re-appoint Lou Ha to serve as a middle management Trustee on
the Boards of the Trusts with a new two year term that will expire on 12-31-2015.

Long-Term Funding


Effective with the 2013 Fiscal Year, the funding policy was changed from a
percent of payroll (9% cap) to the recommended contribution amount up to
a $3.1M annual cap




Current funding policy is more prudent given the Plan’s decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll

If all actuarial assumptions are met each year, including a net investment
return of 7.50% per year, and annual contributions equal the recommended
contribution up to a $3.1M annual cap:






The recommended contribution is projected to decrease from $4.4M in the 2014
Fiscal Year
The recommended contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1M cap through the
2019 Fiscal Year and fall below the cap thereafter
The Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2031

Packet Pg. 9

Long-Term Funding (Continued)


Per the investment consultant, the estimated 2013 return on investments
through December 31st is 20.7% (net of fees)




If the net return in 2013 is 20%, the Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in
2018 (13 years earlier), and RTD can expect to pay the $3.1M contribution cap
through the 2016 Fiscal Year (3 fewer years), if all other actuarial assumptions
are met

Due to the Plan’s size and nature, future investment returns have a
significant impact on projected liabilities – we will keep the Board apprised
of the impact of the Plan’s investment performance on future costs

GASB 67/68


GASB 67 (financial accounting for the Plan) is effective for the Plan’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2014



We will roll forward the January 1, 2014 valuation results to December 31, 2014
Under GASB standards, the long-term investment return assumption must be
sufficient to pay projected benefits and the Plan’s assets must be invested using a
strategy to achieve this investment return




Based on the Plan’s projections and new funding policy, the Plan’s assumed net
investment return of 7.5% satisfies the new GASB standards

GASB 68 (financial accounting for the Employer) is effective for RTD’s Fiscal
Year ending December 31, 2015




RTD may early adopt GASB 68 if desired – to show consistent reporting for the
Plan and Employer
We will provide the applicable disclosure information for 2014 (GASB 27 or GASB
68) along with the GASB 67 information for the Plan in February 2015

• The scheduled contribution is 11% of pay
• New agreement does increase contributions over time

Ã Actuarially recommended contribution increased by $1.8M
• This ARC keeps increasing as payments are “missed”

Ã 47.5% funded on an actuarial basis
Ã Total active participant count decreased by 42
• From 1,720 to 1,678
• New hires will “bend down” the normal cost, so more funding can go to the unfunded

accrued liability

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 7, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 7, 2014

Board Meeting Date: January 14, 2014

Subject:

TMD Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to approve an amendment to the Transportation Management & Design,
Inc. (TMD) Contract 10DO024 to exercise the remaining two option periods and to increase the contract
amount by $215,368 from $384,682 to an new Not to Exceed (NTE) total of $600,000. TMD provides
service planning by task order over a five year period and the anticipated NTE total dollar amount will
exceed the General Manager’s authority of $500,000 in 2014.

BACKGROUND
Transportation Management & Design, Inc. (TMD) has been selected twice by Request for Proposal
(RFP) in the last 10 years to perform a variety of service planning studies for projects which require more
time or specific expertise than RTD Service Development staff has available. These projects have
included, for example, the Southeast and West Corridor preliminary service plans, the Union Station
operating plan, Boulder County services review, On-Time performance assessment/recommendations and
the DUS-Cherry Creek-Glendale service enhancement feasibility study.
DISCUSSION
The last tasks under this contract will be in 2014 for the development of preliminary service plans for
the Gold Line, I-225 and East corridors in preparation for their opening in 2016. RTD has found TMD’s
analysis and recommendations to be thorough and well documented, allowing RTD staff to propose the
needed changes in a timely and responsive process we would otherwise not be able to accomplish
expeditiously.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has included funding for this action in the adopted 2014 operating budget
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager to approve the exercise of option with TDM and increase the
contract Not to Exceed (NTE) by $215,368.00. Individual task orders, each with a specific NTE
amount will be released for each project. The total Contract NTE amount will not exceed
$600,000.
2. Further modify the NTE increase. This is not recommended because it will delay the implementation
of these services.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager to exercise the option or to increase the NTE dollar amount
with TDM. This is not the recommended action because RTD would not have the opportunity to
continue with these important service-related studies.

Date: January 9, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 8, 2014

Board Meeting Date: January 14, 2014

Subject:

Purchase of up to 59 Buses for US 36 Bus
Rapid Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract 12FK002 with Motor
Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 59, 45-foot heavy duty intercity buses to replace the
existing Neoplan intercity coaches at a price not to exceed $35,036,000 and to authorize the use of
existing COP proceeds to finance the cost of such acquisition. Funding for 18 vehicles is provided in the
2014 FasTracks capital budget for the US 36 BRT project, and funding for the remaining 41 vehicles will
be provided through a budget transfer.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize transfers of $9.351 million from the
articulated bus replacement project and $14.996 million from the transit bus replacement project to
cover the cost of the remaining 41 vehicles. Funding for these projects will be restored in the 2014
Amended Budget.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the purchase of 48 MCI intercity buses on May 22, 2012 and six
(6) additional MCI buses on November 27, 2012 as replacements for the 1998 model year 1900 Series
MCI buses.
The procurement was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) advertised on January 27, 2012.
Proposals were received on April 20, 2012, and MCI was determined the most responsive and
responsible proposer. The RFP allowed RTD to purchase additional MCI intercity buses for a five year
period with each successive year pricing being based on the initial base pricing plus a price adjustment
set by the US Department of Labor Producer Price Index (PPI).
DISCUSSION
In 2013, RTD staff conducted several vehicle workshops with the US 36 corridor stakeholders to
identify the most appropriate vehicle for use in the US 36 BRT service. This process included exercises
to define vehicle attributes that relate to desirable service characteristics, demonstration vehicle displays
and tours, and a survey of existing passengers and their vehicle preferences. Based on workshop
findings, observations of the demonstration vehicles, and the passenger survey results, RTD staff
recommends utilizing intercity buses for the BRT service due to their ability to provide the best
combination of power, speed, reliability, and ride quality. This recommendation is also consistent with
the vehicle preferences indicated by the passenger survey results.
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) will use a dedicated fleet of 59 buses to operate high frequency, rapid
transit service between Denver Union Station and Table Mesa park-n-Ride in Boulder. Currently, RTD has
a fleet of 43 intercity coaches in revenue service for the “Route B”-series routes that will make up the
core of the future US 36 BRT operating plan. These vehicles are scheduled to be replaced as part of the

Packet Pg. 36

2.B.2

Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). In addition, 16 more buses will be needed to meet the
frequency and capacity requirements for the BRT. Revenue service is scheduled to begin in 2016.
RTD currently operates eighty-four (84) 2001 Model Year 2800 Series Neoplan buses. These buses
have exceeded their Federal Transit Administration (FTA) service life of 12 years or 500,000 miles. The
buses are approaching 13 years in age and have accumulated, on the average, over 600,000 miles of
service each. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer,
Neoplan Corporation, went out of business several years ago. Replacement parts are difficult to obtain,
and many of the parts are simply no longer available. The requested buses will replace many of the
aged and soon-to-be obsolete Neoplan buses and additional buses will be acquired to supplement the
existing fleet to meet the needs of the US 36 BRT operating plan.
RTD staff is making the recommendation to exercise the option on the MCI buses at this time due to the
standard 18-24 month lead time needed for the manufacture and delivery of new vehicles. Exercising
this option now will allow RTD to take delivery on the new vehicles in time for the US 36 BRT opening
day in 2016.
The MCI buses will be 45' long and have 57 passenger seats. The buses will be equipped with a
wheelchair lift and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. The clean diesel engines
will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with the passenger counting system and the security digital
camera system per the current standard on all new RTD buses.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
In 2013, the District issued COPs to fund upcoming bus acquisitions, including the acquisition of the
buses for US 36 BRT service. Funding is available in the COP project funds to finance these vehicles.
RTD staff is requesting approval to exercise the purchase option for up to 59 intercity coach buses in an
amount not to exceed $35,036,000. The capital budget for these units was included in the 2016 SBP
and FasTracks Financial Plan with the expenditure of COP proceeds from Base and FasTracks to fund the
acquisition. The requested budget transfer will advance the funds for replacement of 41 Neoplan buses
into the 2014 Base budget. The amounts programmed in the 2014 budget for the purchase of
articulated buses and 40-foot transit buses will be transferred in the amount of $9,351,000 and
$14,996,000 respectively to the Base System intercity bus capital budget. This budget transfer from the
articulated buses and 40-foot transit buses will be restored in the 2014 amended budget process.
The acquisition of 18 additional vehicles needed for US 36 BRT service is included in the 2014
FasTracks capital budget for the US 36 BRT project. FasTracks will be funding a total of 18 vehicles
to cover the additional cost of branding the entire fleet of vehicles for US 36 BRT service.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, MCI has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE
plan.

Packet Pg. 37

2.B.2

ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of Contract
12FK002 with Motor Coach Industries (MCI) for the purchase of up to 59, 45-foot heavy duty
intercity buses to replace the existing Neoplan intercity coaches at a price not to exceed
$35,036,000. Funding for 18 vehicles is provided in the 2014 FasTracks capital budget for the
US 36 BRT project, and funding for the remaining 41 vehicles will be provided through a budget
transfer. It is further recommended that the Board of Directors authorize transfers of $9.351
million from the articulated bus replacement project and $14.996 million from the transit bus
replacement project to cover the cost of the remaining 41 vehicles. Funding for these projects
will be restored in the 2014 Amended Budget.
2.

Do not authorize the change order and re-solicit proposals. This is not recommended as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the
project.

Date: January 9, 2014

From:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager

Date:

January 9, 2014

Board Meeting Date: January 14, 2014

Subject:

Contract
Amendment,
Contract No. 13-DO-002

Central

Parking,

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to amend the existing contract with Central Parking to include the West
Line parking facilities in the contract, to extend the term of the contract through December 31, 2018, to
change termination provisions, to modify financial arrangements, to agree that RTD has an obligation to
reimburse Central Parking for unrecovered expenses at the end of the contract term, and to provide for
upgrade to smart pay stations and stationary cameras at selected facilities.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under conditions enacted
by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to: (1) out-ofDistrict patrons every day; (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours; and (3) reserved parking in
exchange for a flat monthly fee. Approximately 15% of RTD parking patrons pay for parking.
The program was implemented with a public-private-partnership (P3) in order to avoid the necessity of
using RTD funds that were needed for the provision of transit services. Central Parking was selected
from submissions in response to a competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) process. Under the contract,
Central Parking provides all operating expenses and infrastructure investments, collects all revenues,
recovers expenses and investments from revenues, retains 2.5% of Net Revenue and remits 97.5% of
Net Revenue to RTD. To date, RTD’s portion of Net Revenue has been applied to the recovery of the
original investment for start-up costs and equipment of approximately $890,100. The remaining balance
on the original investment for start-up costs and equipment is approximately $244,036.00.
In November of 2012, the Board authorized the inclusion of West Line parking facilities into the Parking
Management Program and approved an amendment to the existing Central Parking contract. During the
intervening time since then both RTD and Central Parking have worked diligently to reach agreement
upon and execute the amendment, but unexpected and unavoidable delays occurred and the amendment
has not been executed. Staff is bringing forward a revised contract amendment described in detail
below.
DISCUSSION
The parking management program required significant investment to implement which has nearly been
recovered. Current revenue exceeds $1,000,000 per year and as the result of negotiations we have
been able to reduce operating expenses by about 18%. These factors make it possible to make some
equipment upgrades to improve the system and the user experience. The upgrades include: (1)
replacement of the existing pay stations with new, more user-friendly pay stations that independently
identify out-of-District patron license plate numbers instead of relying upon patron selections; (2) install
stationary cameras where the majority of extended parking sessions occur, giving the program more
accurate control of entry, departure and dwell time; and (3) recover an estimated $1,300,000 in Net

Packet Pg. 39

2.B.3

Revenue for the RTD General Fund over the next 5 years while retiring all of the past and current
financial obligations.
The contract is a cost recovery contract meaning that all expenses are recovered from the parking
revenues. There were a number of months during the first 3 years in which Central Parking
accumulated operating deficits in the total amount of $355,100.00. The current contract language
does not provide a means by which to retroactively apply monthly surplus revenues to the recovery
of previous monthly losses. During negotiations, Central Parking sought a means by which to
recover these deficits. At the same time RTD sought substantial reductions in the annual cost of risk
management, which, in the parking industry is a significant annual operating cost. The outcome of
this negotiation is that the risk management cost has been reduced by approximately $400,000 over
5 years and the operating deficits will be recoverable by Central Parking.
The proposed Amendment to the Central Parking contract that will enable these initiatives is detailed
below:
1. Extend the term of the contract through 2018 with two, two-year extensions at RTD’s option.
2. Add the West Line parking facilities to the program, with the exception of the Jefferson County
Government Center-Golden Station which cannot be included in the program until the parking
usage level reaches 90% (by IGA with Jefferson County); and incorporate an equipment upgrade
plan that provides for the change out of pay stations at all 38 managed facilities, and for
installation of stationary cameras at 9 SkyRide served facilities (an estimated $1.1 million
investment).
3. Establish $7.69 as the fixed annual cost of risk management per space chargeable by Central
Parking to RTD (previously this cost exceeded$12.00 per space).
4. Eliminate the current termination clause in favor of Central Parking and establish RTD’s right to
terminate the contract at RTD’s convenience.
5. Authorize Central Parking to recover $355,100.00 in operating deficits as a last priority on a
monthly basis from revenues available after all other monthly operating expenses and scheduled
expenses have been covered.
6. As an incentive to maximize revenue and reduce operating expenses, after operating deficits have
been recovered, Central Parking’s management fee will be increased from 2.5% of Net Revenue
to 7.5% of Net Revenue.
7. At the end of the contract term, 2018, or later if extended at RTD’s option, RTD will be obligated
to pay for any unrecovered investments or losses incurred by Central Parking directly pursuant to
management of this contract.
8. Provide for an estimated $1,300,000 in Net Revenue to the RTD General Fund over the next 5
years.
If the contract is terminated under its terms and Central Parking’s original investments for start-up
costs and equipment costs have not been fully recovered by Central Parking from parking revenues,
RTD is obligated to pay those amounts to Central Parking that are deemed fair and reasonable. As of
January, 2014, the total of the unrecovered start-up and equipment costs is $244,036.00, having
been reduced from the original total of $890,100.00.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action will (1) reduce the risk of a financial obligation to the General Fund
by eliminating the only existing contractual provision that could allow Central Parking’s termination of

Packet Pg. 40

2.B.3

the contract before its term expires; and (2) result in an estimated $1,300,000 in Net Revenue to the
RTD General Fund over the next 5 years.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the recommended action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to amend the existing
contract with Central Parking to include the West Line parking facilities in the contract, to extend
the term of the contract through December 31, 2018, to change termination provisions, to
modify financial arrangements, to agree that RTD has an obligation to reimburse Central Parking
for unrecovered expenses at the end of the contract term, and to provide for upgrade to smart
pay stations and stationary cameras at selected facilities.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Instead, direct the staff to solicit proposals for the
management of the parking management program. This action is not recommended because it
would delay implementation of the program on the West Line and desirable equipment upgrades
to selected facilities and potentially result in an obligation to the General Fund.
3. Do not adopt the recommended action. Instead, take no action. This alternative is not
recommended because it would delay implementation of the program on the West Line and delay
the opportunity to upgrade equipment and realize the resulting revenue improvement.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. With the
opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse, a service plan has been developed rerouting existing bus
service from the former Market Street Station to the new underground Bus Concourse facility at Denver
Union Station. Additionally, the MetroRide is a new service proposed for the downtown Denver area.
The Metro Ride would provide distribution/circulation service along 18th and 19th during peak periods.
Service changes not associated with or included in the Denver Union Station Service Plan are also
proposed to maintain system on-time performance, provide necessary maintenance intervals for LRT
infrastructure maintenance and provide the appropriate level of service according to customer demand.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of Union Station Service Plan and propose
adjustments as appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Service Reductions
Route 16L – West Colfax: service reduction midday based on ridership performance
Light Rail: “late night/early morning” trip reduction to increase time for LRT right of way maintenance
activities.
Service Improvements
Route 0 – Broadway: move the starting point of service from 18th and Blake streets to the new Union
Station bus concourse
Route 15L – East Colfax: move the starting point of service from Market and 16th streets to the new
Union Station bus concourse

2.C.1.a

Route 0 – Broadway
It is proposed to move the starting point of service from 18th and Blake streets to the new
Union Station bus concourse via 18th and Wynkoop. Some early morning trips would not
start or end at the bus concourse. Sunday through Friday northbound trips after 1:15 a.m.
would end at 18th and Larimer streets. Monday through Friday, southbound trips before
4:40 a.m. would start at 17th and Larimer streets. No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 3 – Alameda Crosstown
Midday trips extended to Alameda Station to address passenger capacity constraints
currently experienced when the service frequency of the western segment is reduced from
peak levels. Additional schedule adjustment will also be made. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Schedule adjustments to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Schedule adjustments to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 15L – East Colfax
It is proposed to move the starting point of service from Market and 16th streets to the
new Union Station bus concourse via 18th and Wynkoop. The City and County of Denver
has proposed to change one-way traffic to two-way traffic on 18th Street between
Wynkoop and Blake streets. If 18th Street is available for southbound traffic to Blake
Street, this route would be realigned for use in both directions. The route is proposed to be
extended from 15th Street via Blake Street, Auraria Parkway, Colfax Viaduct, Federal
Boulevard and West Howard Place to the Decatur-Federal Station. Eastbound trips would
start from West Howard Place, then via Decatur Street, West Holden Place, Federal
Boulevard, Colfax Viaduct, Auraria Parkway, and continue to the existing route on Market
Street. Please see attached map for further details. Costs are estimated to be $555,000
annualized, utilizing 2 additional peak vehicles.
Route 16 – West Colfax
The route alignment is to be revised to serve the growing concentration of apartment residents in
North Capitol Hill. Eastbound buses would turn from West Colfax Avenue onto Court Place, 17th
Avenue, Logan Street, 20th Avenue, 21st Street, to 21st & California Streets. Returning
westbound, they would proceed to Stout Street, 22nd Street, Pennsylvania Street, then west on
Colfax Avenue on the existing route. Please see attached map for further details.
Cost is estimated to be $462,400 annualized.
Route 16 Limited – West Colfax
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue alternate weekday trips between Civic
Center Station and Oak Street between 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Half-hourly trips through
to Golden would continue with minor adjustments for improved schedule adherence.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Access-a-Ride 3rd Quarter Performance Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership decreased by 4% through the 3rd quarter of 2013 compared to the same period
of 2012. Productivity decreased from 1.26 to 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 19%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased service without an increase in resources.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased slightly (approximately 2%) compared to
the third quarter of 2012. Access-a-Ride is approximately 9% under budgeted revenue hours through
the third quarter of 2013.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the third quarter of 2013 improved as compared to the same period in
2012. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue
meeting and exceeding this standard of performance.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the 3rd quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in
2012. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.
