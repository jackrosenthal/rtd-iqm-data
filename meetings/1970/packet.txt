BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Request for Increase to ACS Smart Contract
(Howerter/McMurphy)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract notto-exceed amount by $2,349,912 to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.
BACKGROUND and DISCUSSION
Smart Media System changes will be required in order to configure the system to utilize RTD’s new fare
structure that will be a result of the Fare Study currently under way. In addition, changes to the public
facing web portal are required so as to create a web portal that is easy to use and navigate by RTD’s
customers. Once the web portal changes are made, RTD needs to ensure that all pages and functionality
of the portal are ADA compliant so that persons with disabilities can easily navigate the web portal.
In Q3-2015, RTD will begin issuing Stored Value Cards, which in essence are debit cards for use on the
RTD system. Because some cards will be purchased via the Smart Card Web Portal, RTD needs to be
very confident that the highest levels of cyber security have been implemented on our system to protect
credit card and personal information. This is the first time that RTD has undertaken this type of payment
vehicle that is open to the public. Xerox will be working closely with RTD to ensure that the web portal
and back-end systems meet the high standards of RTD’s Cyber Security requirements.
With the 2016 opening of the new rail lines, approximately 140 new platform validators will be installed,
along with the 138 platform validators already in operation. An increased inventory of spare parts will
need to be on hand and managed in order to expedite and correct any hardware issues that may be
encountered on our light rail platforms. The spare parts must come from Xerox the company from which
RTD purchases the platform validators currently in use.
Based on these considerations, additional funds are needed to facilitate enhanced security, web portal
enhancements, additional cards, nine SMV installations on SE, additional APOS units, file compression
and recharge selection software, and ADA Compliance enhancements, as well as the creation of a
validator spare parts inventory.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for these additional SMT Program Activities will be provided via the Unrestricted Funds Balance.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager or his designee to
issue a change order to Xerox, Inc. to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2) Do not accept the Recommended Action. The SMT Web Portal may be at a higher risk due to the
lack of enhanced security. The web portal may also be unusable by some constituents due to its
lack of accessibility to those with disabilities. Spare parts to fix the platform validators would
eventually become unusable and/or unavailable. Without the Services of Xerox, the Smart Media
system changes required as a result of the Fare Study may not be timely implemented.

Subject:

SMT Program Schedule

The schedule to deploy and operate the next elements of the SMT program is attached.
This set of steps and milestones are consistent with previously briefed information to the
Board of Directors. It is important to note a few key caveats to the associated milestones:
•

With the deployment of the ECO and College Pass elements of the system, system
administrative capacity limitations surfaced. To rectify the problems there were
root cause analysis, alternative solutions architected, a preferred solution selected
and finally software development to mitigate the system limitation. The success of
future deployments is challenged without correction of these limitations. The
software to correct the problem is completed, the vendor has done their testing and
RTD is just starting the acceptance testing process. Once it’s determined the
system software meets the defined objectives, it will be moved to production later
in November. These steps are necessary to advance the next phases of the
deployment.

•

We continue to be involved in the conversations regarding possible changes to the
RTD fare structure and possible impacts to the timeline. We will advise the Board of
should any impacts to the timeline be identified.

Thanks,

2015
Salaried
(Howerter/Sprague)

Benefit

Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2015 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2015 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 16 through
December 1, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2015 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2015 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2015 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2015. The
administrative cost will increase by 10% in 2015. The Cigna Plans are expected to have
approximately 460 employees enrolled. 2014 claims are running 10% above expected claims YTD
and 2015 claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2014 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 3 Plan Options: a fully insured HMO; a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and an
HDHP. The Kaiser plans are expected to have approximately 200 employees enrolled. This plan has
proposed a 5% blended increase over 2014 and Kaiser has requested removing the HMO (High Plan)
due to low enrollment (10 people).

-

Cost-sharing, the employee contributions for the plan, will be increased for employees by 10%.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 1% renewal rate increase, with a two-year Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Delta is a self-funded plan and has projected a 5% increase in expected
claims exposure.
Life & Disability
- The rate guarantee with Lincoln National expired and an RFP was conducted. It is recommended that

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

the Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Accidental Death & Dismemberment, and Voluntary
Insurance be moved from Lincoln to Cigna. This move results in a reduction in annual premiums of
12% or approximately $55,000.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. Based on
utilization, Anthem has proposed an 8% renewal increase. There are no carrier/plan changes and no
costs increase with the Business Travel Accident Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be an 8% increase over
2014 projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are slightly below the medical
trend of 10%. With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit
budget increase is projected to be 8.4% over 2014.
The major cost impacts in 2015 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 10%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2014 are essentially flat. This is the fifth year we have achieved strong cost
containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2014 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $9,699,223. The projected increase of
8.4% results in an increase of $812,341 or a total projected cost of $10,511,564 in 2015. The increase
meets the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). RTD’s benefit costs are at or below the
average for Metro area companies, which are experiencing 8-15% cost increases according to the
Denver Chamber of Commerce.

1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2015 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2.

Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2015. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay the
employee enrollment period.

3.

Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit plans
to the salaried employees.

Certification of the 2015 contribution for the
RTD Salaried Employees' Retirement Plans
(Howerter)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB
Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the RTD
Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan
Trust (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment, at
a percent of each participant’s eligible compensation.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9 percent of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012 the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan would
be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a result of
the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The recommended fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million
to the DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to
maintain a “fully funded” status for the plan in the future. The actuaries have updated the DB Plan
projections to reflect the final 1/1/2014 valuation assumptions for the DB Plan. The 2014 Actuary
Recommended Contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1 million fixed annual contribution amount
through the 2019 Fiscal Year and fall below the fixed annual contribution amount thereafter. The DB
Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2028 assuming that the $3.1 million contribution were to
continue after the actuary’s recommendation drops below the $3.1 million fixed contribution if all other
actuarial assumptions are met each year. The Plan remains on target to achieve this goal.
As stated above an actuarial evaluation of the DB Plan is completed annually to monitor the funding
status of the plan. The actual 2015 Actuary Recommend Contribution is $5.7 million based on current
projections. Should the Board approve contributing a higher amount to the DB Plan and continue to fund
at the amount calculated to be the Actuary Recommended Contribution the DB Plan would be fully
funded in 2024.
In summary, the Board could continue to approve a fixed contribution amount of $3.1 million and be
fully funded in 2028 or fund the DB Plan at the Actuary Recommended Contribution amount of $5.7
million and be fully funded in 2024.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.3

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2015.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust at the recommended amount of $3.1 million and
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust rate at 9% of each participant’s eligible
compensation as planned in the SBP.
2.

The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan Trust at amounts other than $3.1 million and 9% respectively.

3.

Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Proposed 2015 Fiscal
(Howerter/Scarpino)

Policy

Statement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2013
for the 2014 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that the Strategic Budget Plan
includes the current practice of including fare adjustments every three years to account for inflation
and that the Board at its discretion may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time of
the development of the SBP. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2015, the following changes are proposed.
Fund Balance Policies #1 is amended to read as follows: “RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance
in the Base System and in the FasTracks operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures
of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue.”
Under Budget Policies #1 it is stated that the budget is prepared using Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles with certain exceptions, to which is added the “exclusion of the non-cash
portion of long-term unfunded pension accruals.” This is to reflect the appropriation of only the cash
outlay of the pension obligation.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2015
Recommended Budget.

Packet Pg. 16

1.B.4

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2015
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare increases adjustments to
establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public; and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will
make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure
consistency with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two
objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier
to use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and

operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, or to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions
as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund
and an undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base

System, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding
depreciation. For FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at
an amount approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses
excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue
sources that would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to
include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30
million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project



goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed
the expected useful life of the asset.
2. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a
policy of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be
followed.
3. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. Debt financing will not be issued to support current operating expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be
possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 15, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

October 15, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

2015 Budget Update (Howerter/Scarpino)

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2015 Requested Budget was presented at the Board Study
Session on September 30, 2014. Public notice will be given in the October 11-12, 2014 weekend
editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the 2015 Requested Budget
will be made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2015 Requested Budget at the Board Study
Session. The 2015 Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2015 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2015 Requested Budget
previously presented at the Board Study Session. Major revisions and areas of focus follow:


Sales/use taxes are not revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented.
Both versions incorporate the CU-Leeds School September forecast. The Recommended
Budget will not be revised further for sales/use tax because the CU-Leeds School
December forecast will not be received before final budget adoption. For 2015, sales/use
tax is budgeted to increase 5.9% over the 2014 projection. The 2014 projection is
projected to increase 7.8% over 2013 actuals.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $483.6 million are
$0.850 million lower compared to the first draft Requested Budget. The District-wide
Appropriation of $1.394 million is $0.129 million higher than the first draft Requested
Budget.



Diesel fuel is now locked at $2.95/gallon for 2015, down from the budgeted per gallon
price of $3.12. The favorable impact to the budget is approximately $1.7 million. The
lock provides budget certainty for planning purposes.



Gasoline remains budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was budgeted in
2014 for no incremental change.



The capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but will
be included in the Recommended Budget.



Due to the favorable effect of the fuel lock and other budget adjustments, the combined
unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected at $7.9 million, consisting of $4.8 million

Packet Pg. 27

1.C.1

for the Base System and $3.1 million for FasTracks. The Base System unrestricted fund
balance is line with the SBP.
The 2015 Requested Budget and Fund Balance Report showing the operating and capital sources and
expenditures of the District for the Base System and FasTracks is included as Exhibit I. The
following tables are a summary of the attached Exhibit I. The 2015 Requested Budget column below

Robust growth in 2014 essentially borrows from growth in 2015 when
year-over-year growth expected to be slower
Colorado unemployment rate to continue to decline (below 5% by 2017),
personal income to grow strongly (peaking at 7% in 2016), retail sales to
outpace inflation in 2014/2015
Retail sales will slow beginning in 2016 implying more cautious spending
and saving behavior

• Diesel fuel cost at $2.95 per gallon vs. $3.12 in 2014
• Unrestricted year-end fund balance for Base System projected at
$4.8 million, in line with SBP
