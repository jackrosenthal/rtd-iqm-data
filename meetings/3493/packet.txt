BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September 2023
service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights
Jessie Carter II, Senior Manager, Service Planning and Scheduling
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 26 service change recommendations for September 2023 provide opportunities for bus and rail
operators to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board-adopted Reimagine RTD System
Optimization Plan (SOP), several service change recommendations reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible customer value.
The Board-adopted guidance for service change recommendations continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to enhance
service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and environmental justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, all service changes that exceed the
established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2023 service
change recommendations include one major service change out of 26 total changes. Thus, an analysis is

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis
report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. On May 24, 2022, the Board approved and adopted
the Title VI Program Update and required policies. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change recommendations for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in
the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major
service changes will be subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies:
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends changes to 26 bus routes and two rail lines in the forthcoming September 2023
runboard. Of these 26 changes, one service has recommended additions to service 25% greater than
that of baseline service, thus meeting established thresholds for a major service change. Those routes
are shown in bold in the table below.
Modified Services (eight services)
(Additional trips, expanded service spans,
increase reliability)
Seasonal Adjustments (12 services)

Methodology: Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line
level, route/line block group and network level to identify potential disparities in service changes based
on race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes
with a major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of
the population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income
populations.

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major
service change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a
greater increase in service (were positively impacted more) compared to non-low-income
populations. Low-income areas benefited 1.19% more compared to non-low-income areas.
Therefore, no disproportionate burden is found. Additionally, minority populations received a
slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less) compared to non-minority
populations. Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas. This difference
meets the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a system-level disparate impact was found with
the recommended change.

Conclusions:
Although only one major service change resulted in a potential disparate impact at the route and network
level, Title VI concerns are minimal when comparing the service changes between the May 2023 and
September 2023 runboards. Additionally, low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations.
Moreover, the Route GS reinstatement increases access to key public service destinations. Overall, the
minor changes (modified services) have positively impacted equity populations slightly more than nonequity populations.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. Staff will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change recommendations and will recommend adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Service Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2023

1.D.1.a

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of service changes between the May 2023 and September 2023
runboards to ensure changes have not inequitably impacted minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts, and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 26 bus route/patterns in the forthcoming September 2023 runboard. Of these changes,
one service meets established thresholds for a major service change. The route listed below has proposed service
adjustments that were greater than 25% of baseline service or services being eliminated.
Service Reinstatement (one service)

GS – Golden / Boulder: Reinstate service on the GS (Golden
/ Boulder) with four trips in each direction.

Findings

Alterations to the proposed September 2023 service changes include reinstatement of the GS route between
Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder. This route serves a high concentration of low-income
populations.
When considering the demographics within the service areas of this route with a major service change and as a
proportion to the district overall, low-income equity populations received a greater increase in service (i.e., were
more positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas had a +1.19% benefit
above non-low-income areas. Minority areas received a lower increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations.
Finally, a potential disparate impact was identified, but no potential disproportionate burden at the route and
network level.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver
metropolitan area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit
service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental
justice.

Service Equity Analysis: September 2023

1.D.1.a

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs
receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes proposed to occur between the May 2023
and September 2023 runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase via reinstatement
of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed individually at the
route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts on the communities RTD
serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include adding new routes/lines, eliminating existing routes/lines and changing the alignment and trip
frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service changes needed to
meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit
system.
RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles
•

•
•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services and the ability to

Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color, or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes depending on service type, route alignment, and frequency.
Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all routes within each class.
RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in ridership and operational
performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify underperforming services and
recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised
Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish performance metrics to identify underperforming

services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity
analyses examine the impact of the proposed major service changes on minority populations and low-income
households at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes
but is not limited to eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households at or below 150% of the
Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2017 to 2021 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis include route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts on district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2023 runboard analyzed whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a route’s/line’s quarter-mile service area. These proportional
differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and route/line
proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for the population within the district is derived from the Census Bureau and is based on
150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services guidelines), based
on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status was based on the
non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of the total population. The service area was based on the collection of
block groups within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population was determined using a quarter-mile catchment area centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area was then used to calculate the percentage overlap of the census
block-based population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contained 100% of the underlying block
group, 100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block
group was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculated the net change in service hours for each route/line modification to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change at or above 25% from baseline was flagged as a major service change
for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Three public meetings were conducted May 15-16, 2023. The comments collected on service changes during
these meetings are summarized in the table below. In addition to the general outreach, the Transit Equity Office
reached out to 14 community-based organizations and schools surrounding the routes/lines to inform and
encourage community members to attend the open houses. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates,
number of attendees and the common themes of attendees’ comments pertaining to the three major service
changes described in this analysis.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analysis

Proposed service changes for the September 2023 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in service
were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
network using 2017-2021 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to individually review the routes/lines. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of Disparate Impact (for minority populations) or Disproportionate Burden (for low-income populations). It was
flagged for a finding of potential impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

As RTD continues to adapt to changes affected by the pandemic, 26 bus routes will undergo service changes.
Of these, five routes will see a total increase of bus service by over 45 total weekday revenue service
hours. Changes to Route GS exceeded the major service change by being a reinstatement of previously
suspended service; it accounts for 12 of the additional daily revenue service hours.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups, and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions or Eliminations: a service reduction of 25% or more
Major Service Increases/Restructuring: service increases of 25% or more related to new or
restructured service

Major Service Change Reductions/Eliminations
No major reductions/eliminations.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route had major service changes, which included service increases of 25% or greater. This includes the
reinstatement of service to Route GS, considered a major service change, and is therefore included in the review.

Route- and Line-Level Analysis

Having identified the service changes that meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route or line individually to determine potential Disparate Impacts (DI) and
Disproportionate Burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service
increases, the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority
and low-income populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse
effects of the reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the District’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts
In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each major service change route were reviewed for
potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The

narrative analysis of each line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs, education, health
care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route GS - Boulder/Golden

Proposal: Reinstate route pattern with four northbound trips at 7:02 a.m., 8:22 a.m., 3:37 p.m. and 4:39
p.m., between Federal Center Station and Downtown Boulder Station. It is also proposed to reinstate
four southbound trips at 7:10 a.m., 8:19 a.m., 4:36 p.m. and 5:13 p.m., between Downtown Boulder
Station and Federal Center Station.
As shown in Table 5, a lower percentage of the district’s minority population stands to benefit from the
proposed major service increase as compared to the non-minority population (1.07% vs. 0.44%,
respectively). This difference exceeds (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.96%).
Therefore, a potential route-level disparate impact is found, requiring further examination (i.e., access
to key public service destinations, community engagement, and network-level analysis). However, a
higher percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit from the proposed Major
Service Increase as compared to the higher-income population (1.68% vs. 0.55%, respectively). This
difference does not exceed (falls below) the 10% disparate impact threshold (0.50%). Thus, there is no
disproportionate burden at the line-level.

1.D.1.a

Network Analysis

In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a network-level analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analysis. A network-level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts and identify structural issues in areas requiring further review.
Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations were established, subsequent equity
analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service changes of 25% or greater
(additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major service changes experienced
service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes with major service changes are
later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group levels (block groups within route
service areas).
The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service was increased by over 43 weekday revenue hours.
Of the over 25,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, lowincome populations represented a higher population share than district averages. Of this cumulative
figure, over 12,000 would receive service improvements for equity populations.
At the network level, equity routes and non-equity routes 1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service changes serves above-average low-income
populations.

In the review of Route GS at the network level, there is a potential disparate impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2023 to September 2023 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at or
above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups, whereas non-low-income and
non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.
Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.3%) and
minority population (36.9%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in annual trips for
equity versus non-equity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for
potential adverse impacts.

Based on the existence of the route within the May 2023 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops
or rail stations. 2017-2021 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the district 2. Using the 2017-2021
5-Year ACS Estimates, the total population residing within these block groups was calculated, as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the district-wide lowincome and minority rates that set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average. While
the percent minority figure of 36.9% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.049 million)
the low-income population percentage of 14.3% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure (3.005
million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine 3. The
thresholds summarized in Table 6 yielded 831 (38% of all) block groups above the district average for lowincome population, and 830 (38%) block groups above the district average for minority populations.

The proposed major service change was examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
on underlying populations. Table 7 summarizes the change in service for the block group population within onequarter mile of bus stops with proposed major service changes proportionally compared to the population in the
district. This comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be impacted by proposed service
changes compared to the overall equity composition of the district. No major changes were proposed for rail
services with the September 2023 runboard.

1.D.1.a

For system-level bus service changes, minority populations stand to benefit slightly less than non-minority
populations (0.44% vs. 1.07%, respectively). The difference meets the Disparate Impact Threshold of 0.96%.
Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the proposed major service changes. Lowincome populations stand to benefit more than non-low-income income populations (1.68% vs. 0.55%
respectively), with low-income areas benefitting 1.19% more than non-low-income areas. Therefore, no systemlevel disproportionate burden is found with the proposed major service changes.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above-average low-income and minority block groups within the district
and highlight the bus route with a major service change (orange). Route GS is currently suspended and is
proposed to be reinstated with four trips in each direction/peak period.

Summary of Findings
The network changes proposed between May 2023 and September 2023 include modifications to service that
include schedule adjustments, changes to summer schedules and trip availability, additional trips and longer
service spans. The major service change increase was entirely invested in bus service. No major rail service
changes or service reductions were included.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

Of the 26 total services with proposed changes, one had a potential disparate impact finding.
Route GS has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.52% less of a
benefit than non-minority populations.

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether an alternative would
serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that no alternatives
would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or a disproportionate burden on low-income
customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals.
Alterations to the initial proposed September 2023 service changes 4 include the reinstatement of Route GS,
which serves low-income populations at a rate higher than the district average.
In addition to the systemwide-level findings below, RTD’s ongoing pandemic response, the substantial ridership
decline, personnel impacts, resource allocation (human and capital), and recovery uncertainty serve as
justification for maintaining the September 2023 service changes proposal.

Systemwide-level Findings:

16

•

Of the over 25,000 people with access to bus stops within the service area of the bus routes with a
major service improvement (Route GS), low-income groups represented a higher share of the
population than district averages, indicating targeted service increases to low-income populations

•

When considering the demographics within the service areas of the bus route with a major service
change and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a greater increase
in service (were positively impacted more) compared to higher income populations

•

Low-income areas benefited +1.19% more compared to higher-income areas

•

Minority populations received a slightly lower increase in service (were positively impacted less)
compared to non-minority populations

•

Minority areas benefited 0.52% less compared to non-minority areas meeting the Disparate Impact
threshold, therefore a system-level disparate impact was found with the proposed change

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Service Change

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the September 2023 Service Changes as revised and summarized
in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the September
2023 Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to select
new work assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan
for RTD’s transit network.
Current weekday ridership averages just over 175,000 boardings on the transit network. With the
coming fall/winter school year ridership demand is anticipated to increase. Efforts to increase staffing
levels have continued resulting in positive increases in both recruitment and retention. However, rail and
bus operations staffing levels remain lower than budgeted headcount, which limits the capacity to
increase service, as proposed in the Board-adopted Systems Optimization Plan (SOP).
DISCUSSION
The changes herein include a mix of service improvements and adjustments aimed at further
implementation of the SOP and adapting service to ridership demands. Notable plans herein include
adopted SOP proposals: restructuring the Route 16/17 – West Colfax/ Golden service, reintroduction of
select trips on the Route GS – Boulder/Golden service and service level improvements consistent with
the SOP on Routes 65, 73 and 105. Along with routine schedule adjustments to improve service
reliability, the service plan will reinstate school related services that were paused for the summer of
2023.
Following the guidelines contained in the Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence
and recognizing the RTD’s workforce challenges, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time

Packet Pg. 46

1.D.2

performance, maintaining compliance with the agency’s Collective Bargaining Agreement with the
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, and adjusting service levels to match autumn/winter ridership
demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
A summary of the list of service proposals is provided below, which are detailed in Attachment A.
Supplemental information related to the proposed changes is included in Attachments B, C, D, E and F.
Summary of Public Hearings
Three public hearings were conducted:
Monday, May 15, 2023, at noon (virtual),
Monday, May 15, 2023, at 5:30 p.m. (1660 Blake Street, Rooms T & D)
Tuesday, May 16, 2023, 5:30 p.m. (virtual).
These meetings have been recorded and are available for review. Written communications and public
comments collected during this public comment period have been summarized and listed in Attachment
G of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose revision to these initial

Route 16 – West Colfax/17 – Golden
Current on-time performance: 11.4% late, 84.7% on time
Current ridership: 28 boardings per hour weekdays, 26.5 boardings per hour Saturdays,
23.6 boardings per hour Sundays
Per the Systems Operations Plan (SOP), splitting Route 16 into two distinct service
patterns, identified as Routes 16 and 16G
The new Route 16 pattern operates between 16th/Lincoln and Oak Station. The 16G
pattern will provide service between Oak Station, Federal Center Station and
10th/Washington in Golden.
The results of the introduction of the new patterns will reduce service midday between
Oak Station and Downtown Golden on weekends. Conversely, this proposal improves ontime performance on the West Colfax alignment, by reducing distance between
terminals/recovery areas. The change also aims to improve network connectivity with
increased transfer opportunities at Oak and Federal Center Stations. (See attachment B)

RTD - Blake Street
Rooms T&D
5:30 p.m.

Anakin Skywalker Wondering if the Route 44 is proposed to run from Wheat Ridge●Ward
Road Station to Civic Center Station? Would it be possible to extend the Route 44 to I25●Broadway Station?
Michael Thein Ramps for the B line at Westminster Station are too steep. No person in a
manual wheelchair can make it up that grade. The shelterboard times at 72nd●Federal stop
need updating.
Kirk Miller Decatur●Federal Station ADA ramps are poorly placed and are so spread out that
people miss their bus connections. The lighting for the tunnel is poor creating a safety
concern, leaving those with mobility extremely vulnerable. RTD should reevaluate the
ramps. The long steep ramps are not preferred, if that is RTD’s preference then a bar should
be provided for those with manual wheelchairs to pull themselves up the ramp. Would prefer
switchback ramps, it is easier for those with manual wheelchairs to maneuver and gives
them a break. E-Scooters are blocking access to stops and stations, RTD should partner with
them to have better parking locations. 120th Avenue access is difficult and unsafe for
passengers to maneuver.
Natalie Bororca Daughter lives in Erie, she lives in Denver, it takes 90 minutes to get to her
daughters via the JUMP. Would it be possible to extend the JUMP to Wagon Road PnR,
even just hourly, would shorten her commute to Erie. Is it possible to extend FlexRide to
Erie?
Micki Conte The website changes are not ideal, few things are missing including the 3L. It
showed the Route 10 running out to Aurora, but now she can’t find it again.
Extra trash cans have disappeared from the Colorado and Alameda eastbound far side stop,
they need to be emptied. FlexRide used to her doctor’s off Havana, but now she doesn’t
have a way to get to the doctors because the buses don’t operate when she can go to the
doctor. There is no way for her to catch the Route 40 for the 3:48 a.m. trip on the A Line
to DEN.
Rachel Hicks lives in Littleton and takes the Route 66 to the Route AT to work at the airport.
Two-years ago staff shifted the trips to meet, and she loves RTD for that change. Now the
proposal to remove the last two trips in the evening prevents her from being able to get
home from the airport. The airport has mandated that the restaurants remain open longer
now.

September 2023 Virtual Public Meeting Transcript

Brandon Figliolino:
Excellent.
I think we are ready to go.
Yes, so good evening.
My name is Brandon Figliolino.
I am the Manager of Community Engagement here at the Regional Transportation district
and I am joined by my colleague Maux Sullivan, Lead Service Planner and Scheduler for the
East team, and we are here to talk to you tonight about service changes that are proposed
for the September 2023 run board.
Brandon Figliolino:
We have a lot happening at RTD right now.
First and foremost, we are in the final stages of our fare study and equity analysis.
We have a proposed fare structure that is out for review from the public.
If you want to learn more about the proposed changes to our fair structure, you can visit
our website at www.rtd-denver.com/fare.
Study.
We have a survey that is open now through May 24th.
Please look at the website and offer your feedback.
Uh, the board of directors will review the final draft in July and if adopted, the changes
would go into effect in the first quarter of 2024.
We also have another campaign going on called respect the ride respect the ride is our code
of conduct.
Brandon Figliolino:
We've rephrased it to be respect the ride guide, just reminding people to be safe and
courteous on trains and buses and at stations.
We have proposed changes to that respect the right guide that are also on our website and
we encourage you to review those changes and provide feedback.
Our goal is to make them easier to understand the norms that we have for one another as
we operate and ride trains and buses.
So please offer your comments now through June 2nd and now I will pass it off to my
colleague mode to talk about the proposed service changes.
Maux Sullivan:
Thanks, Brandon, and good evening.
Thank you for joining us on so.
In terms of a minor service adjustments, as we always do in the fall, we're going to bring
back our school tripper service.

Maux Sullivan:
So again, those routes impacted would be the DASH, JUMP, SKIP, NB1 and NB2 and the
225 and then these are the next are service minor service adjustments.
So, these are routes where maybe they're on-time.
Performance wasn't meeting our standards or there's an issue with the respite time at the
terminals for the operators.
So, these routes you'll see maybe just minor adjustments on the schedule for if these are
any of your routes that would be the route 8, 19, 21, 24, 51, 66, 76, FF! and the P and
again and you know where when you pick up the bus, it might be a little bit earlier or later
than you're used to.
So just minor schedule adjustments and then similarly minor schedule adjustments for rail
that will impact the E&W lines.
And then we have a couple changes that we're also doing in conjunction with the system
optimization plan.
If you're unfamiliar, this was adopted by the Board of Directors in July of 2022.
It's a 5-year plan for us to kind of institute service by kind of rebalancing our service to meet
our demands and based on the resources we have available.
So again, we have a few changes that are consistent with what was outlined in that board
approved plan and the first is we're kind of splitting the Route 16.
So, it'll be the route 16 and 17 if you're familiar with the system optimization plan, you may
know this as the 16 and 16G.
We've decided to use the route name 17 instead, but anyway it's so the first part of this is
splitting the Route 16 so that it'll still serve between downtown Denver.
So, 16th Ave and Lincoln St and then Oak station.
Maux Sullivan:
And so that'll be there will be 15-minute frequency on that portion of the route for the 16
and then in terms of the 17, so next slide.
The 17 will connect to the 16 at Oak Station.
It will also serve the Federal Center station as well as Golden at 10th St and Washington
Ave, so there is a map on the screen, but this information can also be found on our website,
rtd-denver.com/servicechanges and this the 17 will also operate on a 15-minute frequency
during the weekdays and peaks. and then the Route 65
Will it be expanding the service span on that route so weekdays 5:00 AM to midnight and
then on the weekend it'll operate between 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM and then for the Route

These are just a couple trips on some select routes to handle the increased demand from
the students either traveling to or from school on those routes.
So that's route 11, 20, 24, 30, 51, 65 and 73.
And then similarly next slide up in Boulder or up in the North region, we add frequency.
When CU students return to campus and for BVSD and then also add service on the NB1
and NB2 so that it goes to Eldora for when Ski season starts.

73 just a minor rerouting to make it a little bit more of a direct service into the Bellevue
station.
There are, if you're familiar with the system optimization plan.
There is also a recommendation to increase frequency.
However, due to our limited resources at that time will be changing the frequency at a later
date.
We're not able to make that change right now, but we are changing the routing for
September. We're proposing changing the routing.
So, and then the 105 as the system optimization plan states will be all trips will terminate
in the South of that route at Southmoor Station.
So that's that'll be a discontinuation of the routing into DTC, which is always had really low
ridership.
And we're also increasing the service on Sunday, so it'll be 15-minute midday service on
Sundays and then the Route 120E and 120W will now connect into Wagon Rd.
Park and ride, so to provide a little bit more of a direct connection there at the park and ride
to other services.
The Route 121, which services Peoria St, will have 15-minute frequencies added on
Saturdays South of Peoria Station.
Excuse me?
And so, every other trip will continue the 40th Ave and Airport Blvd.
And then we are bringing back the GS.
So, we're excited about that.
We know there's been a lot of requests about that.
Umm, so there will be 4 northbound trips, 2 in the morning and two in the afternoon, and
then four southbound trips.
So, 2 in the morning and two in the afternoon.
And that is all the proposed changes for September and the last day to submit comments.
So, you can either provide comments here or email us or call us.
The last day is Friday, May 19th, and if you'd like to submit via email, you can email us at
service.changes@rtd-denver.com or you can call us at 3032992004 or I'll turn it over to
Brandon and as he can kind of facilitate any questions or comments you may have now, and
these changes are proposed are slated to go into effect September 3rd.

Brandon Figliolino:
Scott, you have a question?

Maux Sullivan:
You know, defer to Tegan our rail lead for that question.
Tegan Rice:
Umm, so we are shutting down the L line for the usual events that are coming up right now,
including the Colfax Marathon, which I believe is Saturday, and we have Jazz Fest and
Juneteenth coming up with all of these downtown events.
Tegan Rice:
Who already have permits to shut down the streets, it's been difficult for us to get permits
with the city of Denver to do the needed switch repairs.
M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
Ohh.

Tegan Rice:
Uh, so I do not have a date yet as to when that rail replacement and switch repair is going
to occur.
M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
OK.
Thank you.
Tegan Rice:
Sure.
Brandon Figliolino:
Are there any other questions or public comments this evening?
Oops, I did not mean to raise my own hand.
Well, seeing no other questions, you can, uh, drop us a line anytime.
As most said, you can email service.changes@rtd-denver.com if a question or comment
comes up.
You can also give us a ring and leave a voicemail at the 299 2004 number.

M Scott Ramming PhD PE:
I'm curious.
It's not necessarily a service change, but I had recalled seeing some information that the
line would be closed for a few weeks, 4 worked on the rails, or I guess the maybe the switch
you're Downing station and but more recently I only see about the E, H, R line closure.
I don't know if you're trying to finish that up before taking on another quarter to.
So, I'm just curious if anyone has any information about when that might be.

Access-a-Ride Call Center Contract

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with First Transit, Inc. for the provision of Access-a-Ride call center services for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of five years, at a not-to-exceed cost of $22,908,556.35.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Director, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Access-a-Ride
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a non-commuter fixed
route system also provide paratransit service for persons with disabilities who are unable to use RTD’s
fixed route system for some or all trips.
The current Access-a-Ride contractual structure consists of one call center contractor, one eligibility
certification contractor, three service-provider contractors that utilize RTD-owned vehicles, and one
service-provider contractor that utilizes vehicles the contractor owns.
Current Solicitation
On April 21, 2023, RTD issued a request for proposals soliciting technical and price proposals to provide
Access-a-Ride Call Center services as described herein. The solicitation was made available on the RTD
external website for public download and was announced via transit industry-related publications.
Proposals were due on June 1, 2023.
DISCUSSION
Two proposals were received in response to solicitations for the provision of Access-a-Ride call center
services. Proposals were received from CXperts and First Transit, Inc. A panel of subject matter experts
assessed the proposals using pre-determined objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall
evaluations of the proposals, the panel recommends that a contract for Access-a-Ride Call Center
services, in an amount not to exceed $22,908,556.35 over five years, be awarded to First Transit, Inc.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP)

July 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
July 25, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) as is
required by 49 CFR Parts 674 and 673 and 4 CCR-723-7, Rule 7345.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dan McClain, Chief Safety Officer/Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) PTASP Rule requires each operator of a public transportation
system that receives federal funds under FTA's Urbanized Area Formula Grants to develop a PTASP that
includes the processes and procedures necessary to implement a Safety Management System (SMS).
While the FTA retains regulatory authority for compliance with PTASP requirements, pursuant to federal
and state law, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) is the established State Safety Oversight
Agency with authority and primary responsibility for enforcing program standards. CPUC regulations
require the agency to update its PTASP annually and the CPUC is the entity with authority to approve
the PTASP and certify to the FTA that it meets current FTA requirements.
DISCUSSION
The revisions to the 2024 PTASP as compared to the 2023 Board-approved version are:
• Joint Labor-Management Safety Committee and GM/CEO approval prior to Board of Directors
review and approval as required by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL)
• Three-year rolling average and target for safety performance indicators as reported to the National
Transit Database as required by the BIL
• Incorporation by reference of the Emergency Operations Base Plan as required by 49 CFR 673
and 4 CCR-723-7, Rule 7345
• Notable continuity with
o The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, including mission, vision, values, and strategic priorities
o Current agency structure
o Line management accountability
o Cross-organizational coordination
In approving this PTASP and associated exhibits, the agency complies with federal and state regulatory
requirements.

1. POLICY
Policy

The first element of the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) is Safety Policy. This, in its most
simple form, is the safety policy developed, approved, and signed by the Regional Transportation District
(RTD), a multimodal agency comprising bus, light rail, commuter rail, and special services in the Denver
metro area. This element also describes the agency’s commitment to safety; its objectives, safety goals,
and the organizational structure established; and plans written to obtain these goals and objectives.
In August 2021, the RTD Board of Directors adopted a new strategic plan that looks toward the next five
years of the agency’s future. The document — against which all initiatives, projects, and priorities are
measured — serves as a blueprint for success and outlines the intentionality the agency will bring with its
redefined mission: We make lives better through connections.
The strategic plan was developed by General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson and RTD’s
executive leadership team in concert with the agency’s 15-member Board of Directors. It establishes four
strategic priorities — community value, customer excellence, employee ownership, and financial
success — that serve as functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure overall performance.
Development of the PTASP was completed in accordance with the strategic plan; Title 49 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Parts 672, 673, and 674; and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) State Safety
Oversight (SSO) Program Procedures and Standards.
The agency has adopted a Safety Management System (SMS) approach to administering safety throughout
the organization. SMS is flexible and scalable and consists of four elements:
SMS Element

Description

Safety Policy

Definition of safety policies, procedures, and organizational structure

Safety Risk Management

Formal process for management of hazards to an acceptable level of risk

Safety Assurance

Establishment of process measures, assessments, and controls to assess the
effectiveness of risk control strategies

Safety Promotion

Safety training and risk communication practices to promote a culture of safety

1.1.2

Authority

RTD is a special transportation district and political subdivision of the state of Colorado and is authorized
under Colorado Revised Statutes Title 32, Article 9. As such, the district has its own taxing authority and
operates within the counties of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and
Weld. The agency is governed by its elected Board of Directors and managed by the GM/CEO, who
develops and implements a comprehensive and integrated PTASP. To that end, the GM/CEO, by signature
authority of the district’s Safety Policy Statement, has authorized the RTD chief safety officer (CSO) to
develop and implement a PTASP as an operating document of the agency for the operations of light rail,
bus and paratransit.

The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) recognizes the CPUC as the state safety oversight agency for RTD.
CPUC is FTA’s certified state safety oversight agency (SSOA), working cooperatively to regulate RTD’s light
rail transit, by ensuring compliance with state and federal requirements, regulations, and guidance,
as applicable.
The FTA functions as both a funding administrator and as a federal regulator as defined by 49 CFR Parts
670, 672, 673, and 674. The FTA conducts regular reviews of the SSOA, to determine the SSO’s and RTD’s
compliance to the FTA’s general requirements. RTD’s light rail service is regulated by the FTA and CPUC.

1.1.3

Policy Statement

As the accountable executive for all operations and activities, I will ensure that resources are available to
make the SMS robust and successful. Executive leadership will take steps to prevent workplace incidents,
injuries, and illnesses and will provide support of safety program initiatives. The agency will consider

1.D.4.a

All employees are expected and encouraged to participate in safety activities, including reporting hazards,
unsafe work practices, near misses, and accidents immediately to their supervisor or a safety committee/
department representative.
Disciplinary action will not be taken against an employee who acts to prevent an injury or who reports any
accident, incident, near miss, concern, or hazard to any level of management. All employees are required
to abide by the standards and procedures set forth in the SMS policy and the PTASP. Behaviors such as
illegal activity, negligence, acts of willful misconduct, or undue care and attention shall be considered
outside the scope of this policy.
The SMS Program is managed under my authority by the CSO, who has direct access to me. All levels of
management and all employees are accountable for the delivery of the highest level of safety performance,
starting with the General Manager and CEO.

1.D.4.a

The overall consideration in the development of the agency’s PTASP is to provide safe and reliable
movement of customers throughout the transit system. Customers and the general public must be
confident that the RTD transit system is a safe system. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to design,
construct, operate, and maintain a system that aims to reduce recognized hazards as much as practicable
with the safety of employees, customers, and the general public in mind. The agency’s objectives will be
met by drawing information from system observation, local and state codes, federal guidelines, and specific
agency requirements into an SMS to ensure a safe transportation system.
The agency will track the following safety performance measures as required by the National Public
Transportation Safety Plan:
●

Fatalities (total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Injuries (total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

Safety Events (total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode)

●

System Reliability (mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode)

Integrating Safety into All Aspects of RTD

The objective of the SMS is the continual improvement of processes and operations to maximize safety to
the highest practicable level. This effort is undertaken by providing continual opportunities for employees
to be reminded of safety, incorporate safe practices into their operations, and supply each employee with
multiple means to identify potential hazards.
The agency accomplishes this through safety training, safety moments at meetings, safety committee
meetings, weekly safety messages, safety campaigns, identification and mitigation of hazards, and
proactive reviews and inspections to identify potential hazards.
Within different departments, multiple means of incorporating safety concerns or representation
are presented. As examples:
● Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is a part of Planning Department
meetings to plan for safety in new projects at the earliest opportunity
●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative participates in Transit Oriented Development
meetings to identify and raise safety concerns

●

In new construction projects, safety is considered in the Design and Construction Meeting, System
Safety Working Group, Activation Committee and/or other processes where relevant

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative is in the Technology Advisory Group
regarding the selection and implementation of new technology programs

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative works with Communications for signage,
vehicle wraps, handouts, billboards, advertisements, and social media to maximize safety
messages to the community

●

Safety is incorporated into training in divisions, such as Roadway Worker Protection, Safety
Management System, and Security/Incident Command Structure training

●

Safety and Environmental Compliance representative reviews procurements that involve safetysensitive products or services and ensures proper safety language is in all contracts

1.3 Overview of Management Structure
RTD Board of Directors and Executive Leadership

RTD was created by the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 for the purpose of providing a public mass
transportation system for residents of the district. The agency began operations in 1972. A 15-member
elected Board of Directors is the legislative body for the agency and determines all questions of overall
governance and policy. The Board of Directors appoints the GM/CEO, who is ultimately responsible for safety.
The GM/CEO has full charge of the acquisition, construction, maintenance, and operations of the system
and facilities of the agency, and of the administration of business affairs. The GM/CEO supervises executive
leadership, including chief officers and AGMs. Included among these officers is the chief operations
officer (COO), who is responsible for bus, rail and paratransit operations. The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division has the responsibility for agency safety. The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division reports monthly to the GM/CEO.
The following activities ensure that safety goals and objectives are achieved:
●

Perform timely review of accident and incident investigation summary reports to identify trends and
recommend corrective action to minimize loss

●

Review reports of system standard operating procedures (SOPs) and rules for compliance with
established guidelines

●

Review summary reports regarding periodic equipment and facility inspections, and system
hazard analysis

●

Promote safety awareness by incorporating customer and employee involvement

1.3.2

Management — Key Role in Safety Overview

The SMS will be incorporated into every aspect of transit services, by rail and bus service managers. Safe
operations of the bus and rail divisions are the responsibility of the AGMs. Each department has an AGM or
chief officer, who, along with senior managers, managers, and supervisors, is responsible for implementing
policies and procedures for safe operations. The AGMs of the rail and bus divisions have charged their
management teams to effectively manage safety; to develop safety programs, plans, procedures, training,
policies and rules to govern safety; and to fully comply with the PTASP. Bus and rail maintenance facilities
are staffed with a Manager of Maintenance responsible for the safe operation of their employees within
the facility and are supported by Shift Supervisors and maintenance workers. The agency models policies,
procedures, and processes for occupational safety and health on Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) regulations.
Supervisors’ responsibilities place them at the forefront of safety efforts. A significant portion of their duties
is monitoring, ensuring, and emphasizing safety performance and rules compliance and promoting a strong
safety climate. All employees are charged with adhering to safety, but supervisors are the key to improved
safety-related behavior and positive safety outcomes. Supervisors have the responsibility to monitor safety
compliance of their employees and ensure employees understand their job functions and the associated
safety requirements.
Safety and health are managed at all levels of staff. All employees are trained in safety and job duties, and
are given responsibility for their own safety, as well as the safety of the individuals with whom they work.
All employees have the responsibility to halt an operation or stop work if it is deemed to be unsafe. System
safety processes emphasize open and consistent dialogue between leaders and subordinates to increase

1.3.5

Climate/Geography

The Denver metro region normally has a semi-arid continental climate with four well-defined seasons.
Summers are characterized by hot, dry weather, but the high temperatures are usually not oppressive
since the relative humidity is generally low and the nights usually cool. August is the hottest month, with
temperatures reading 90-100 degrees Fahrenheit. Winters are cold but usually not severe. The average
annual snowfall is less than 65 inches at Denver International Airport, but much higher amounts fall in
foothill locations. Precipitation is generally light during the summer and early fall but may be heavy in the
spring when storms from the Pacific Ocean move through the area more frequently than any other season
of the year.
The agency’s transit services extend throughout the Front Range area at a width of approximately 60
miles between Pine Junction and Denver International Airport. The north-south coverage area ranges from
Longmont to Lone Tree, a distance of 70 miles. Service areas include the foothills situated along the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from approximately 4,850 feet above sea level to greater
than 9,000 feet above sea level in the foothills.

and Changes

1.D.4.a

1.5 Continuous Improvement

A Leadership Safety Committee has been established that meets regularly throughout the year to review
the current performance of the agency against the safety performance targets and the strategic plan
objectives and to take action to address any safety deficiencies that are identified.
The agency will use the management review cycle (annual PTASP update), along with performance data
for the SMS to identify and prioritize continuous improvement of each process. Leadership, from the
accountable executive to managers, is involved in this management review cycle. This method is consistent
with SMS principles and allows for the resourcing and prioritization of SMS efforts.

1.6 SMS Documentation and Records
Documentation and recordkeeping pertinent to each component or subcomponent of SMS is described
in the relevant section of the SMS. This subcomponent will also include changes for the management of
new or revised safety requirements from regulations or otherwise, such as the introduction of minimum
standards for safety. In addition, this subcomponent includes safety data and analyses, delivered to and
used by management for safety-related decision-making.
All documents included, attached, or referenced, describing the programs, policies and procedures used
to implement this PTASP, will be maintained for a minimum of three years. All documents will be made
available to the FTA, federal entities or the SSOA upon request.

Packet Pg. 95

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Continuous improvement is defined by the FTA as a process by which a transit agency examines safety
performance to identify safety deficiencies and carry out a plan to address the identified
safety deficiencies.

1.D.4.a

1.7 Emergency Preparedness and Response
Emergency Preparedness and Response

The ability to respond quickly and in an organized manner is vital to the continuation of transit service
during a special event, emergency, or recovery from a catastrophic incident, including, but not limited to,
the following:
●

Earthquake

●

Fire

●

Flooding

●

Hazardous material spill

●

Medical emergency

●

Severe weather

●

Pandemic

●

Transit-related accidents

●

Acts of violence

●

Acts of terrorism

The Emergency Operations Base Plan (EOBP) provides a flexible framework for districtwide emergency
management (See Exhibit for Plan). Each mode (light rail, commuter rail, fixed-route and on-demand
bus) will develop and update its specific emergency response plan. These plans detail activities and
responsibilities for personnel. This plan, along with the safety program documents and SSP, describes
coordination of the following emergency preparedness/management activities:
●

Incident management – management of an emergency event or incident is based on the principles
of National Incident Management System (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS
principles allow emergency response agencies to communicate with field supervisors and/or
Transit Police Communications

●

Coordination with external agencies – the Chief of Police and Emergency Management is
principally responsible for the coordination of incident management resources with various
emergency service agencies to provide for effective interaction between RTD and those agencies.
Liaising with law enforcement agencies is primarily the responsibility of the CSO, with assistance
from the Chief of Police and Emergency Management with assistance from the CSO

●

Emergency response planning and mitigation – the agency establishes a Fire Life Safety
Committee (FLSC) for each new rail extension or significant transit facility project. The
committee comprises safety and security staff; RTD operations, maintenance, and engineering
representatives; and police, fire, emergency medical, and other area emergency response agency
representatives. The committee reviews transit system designs and recommends fire protection,
life safety and security measures, and procedural response and training needs related to the new
extension or facility project

●

Emergency planning – As a critical transportation provider in the Denver metropolitan area, the
agency is a member of the Regional Emergency Management and the Continuity of Operations
Plan (COOP) and Urban Area Security Initiative. It is the agency’s intent to collaborate with regional
emergency management agencies responsible for emergency preparedness, response, recovery,
and mitigation planning and coordination among the counties and cities in the metropolitan
area, emergency response agencies, utility companies, and other critical groups. The agency,
with assistance from the FLSC, has developed emergency management operating plans and

15

Packet Pg. 96

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.7.1

procedures to address a wide range of emergency incidents and events, including criminal activity,
earthquakes, fire at transit stations and along the rights-of-way, hazardous materials releases,
medical emergencies, severe weather, terrorism, transportation mishaps, and other emergency
situations occurring within the transit system
●

Emergency preparedness exercises – A minimum of one emergency tabletop or field exercise will
be planned and conducted annually to ensure the adequacy of emergency plans and procedures.
These may include readiness of personnel to perform under emergency conditions; effective
coordination between RTD and emergency response agencies; and coordination of regional
emergency exercises that are facilitated through use of Tera software or other means. All exercises
are followed by after-action analyses and reports to document lessons learned and actions needed
to improve the agency’s emergency operations capabilities

●

Emergency response training – Frontline RTD transportation and maintenance personnel
will undergo emergency response training to ensure full understanding of their roles and
responsibilities during an emergency incident. The level of training will be based on their
anticipated role during the incident. At a minimum, training is provided on the emergency plans
and procedures that the employee may be required to implement. Training to familiarize fire,
rescue, and other emergency service personnel with special transit system requirements is
coordinated through the FLSC, Transit Police and Emergency Management Department, and Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division staff, with assistance from the Bus and Light Rail Divisions,
as appropriate.

1.7.2

Public Health Emergency Management and Response

The agency will identify mitigations or strategies to minimize the exposure of the public, personnel
and property to hazards and unsafe conditions, and consistent with the guidelines of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or a state or local public health authority, will minimize exposure to
infectious diseases and comply with the CDC and state and local public health orders during public health
emergencies or pandemics.

Risk Management

Effective risk management helps the agency serve its customers, employees, and the district by ensuring
that the agency provides excellence in:
●

Community Value

●

Customer Excellence

●

Employee Ownership

●

Financial Success

Executive leadership is committed to:
●

Understanding risk in the context of the frequency (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen to guide agency actions that support delivery on the agency’s
objectives within fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints

●

Transparency regarding the tradeoffs between risks, costs, and performance inherent in all decisions

●

Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk

●

Optimizing limited resources to meet objectives

2.1.1.1

Localized Hazard Management

Chiefs/AGMs play a key role in the hazard management process and ensure that the process has been fully
integrated within their departments. Chiefs/AGMs also ensure that the following elements of the hazard
management process are present in their departments:
●

Ensure employees can report hazards to management in person or using the electronic hazard
reporting form via the intranet

●

Ensure hazards are placed on a local hazard log for tracking and documentation

●

Represent management, or select designee to represent management, on a local/site committee

●

Ensure each hazard has been assigned to a specific individual/point of contact

●

Participate in assigning hazard ratings, in accordance with the Risk Assessment Matrix

●

Ensure employees receive appropriate hazard management training

20

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

The second element of the PTASP is risk management process, which addresses how the agency
identifies, assesses, tracks, and mitigates hazards and risk in the agency and on the transit systems for
light rail, bus and paratransit. Tolerable risk levels, performance targets, and mitigation measures are
established.

Packet Pg. 101

1.D.4.a

Local Hazard Logs

Local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors, along with TSSs, ensure that local hazard logs are
used to track hazards at the departmental level within RTD. These logs are to be maintained within the
department and are reviewed by the local safety committee on a monthly basis. Hazards placed on the
local log receive their initial and final hazard ratings using the Risk Assessment Matrix. These individuals
may give hazards their initial rating when hazards are received and final ratings when they are closed.
This same group may also present hazards to the local safety committee for hazard ratings or employ the
Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for assistance in rating hazards. Hazard ratings may be
changed with new information or as a result of data analysis.

2.1.1.3

Hazard Management

When a hazard is identified as needing mitigation that requires cost or changes beyond that of the local
safety committee or department abilities, the hazard will be elevated to the corresponding Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs and be reviewed by the SSWG. The SSWG represents key
department managers that can make decisions, employ multiple disciplines, and can influence higher level
budgeted solutions.

2.1.1.4

Safety and Environmental Compliance Division Hazard Logs

TSSs are responsible for the maintenance of Safety and Environmental Compliance Division hazard logs.
They ensure that hazards meeting defined criteria are entered into the appropriate category within the
hazard reporting system for accurate record keeping. Hazard rating should be developed with input from
the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division, local site senior managers, managers, and supervisors.
The following are specific hazards that are identified and mitigated at the agency level:
●

Unacceptable or undesirable hazards (high and serious hazards)

●

Hazards identified from reviews from outside agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Hazards identified from accident investigations

●

Hazards where corrective action will cost more than an estimate of $25,000

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

2.1.1.5

Corrective Action Plan (CAP)

CAPs are used for hazards that meet certain criteria:
●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, 2B (high risk), or 1C, 2C, 3A, 3B (serious risk)

●

Findings of noncompliance from internal safety reviews or safety reviews or audits by regulatory
agencies (CPUC, FTA, OSHA)

●

Corrective action resulting from accident investigations

●

High-potential events as determined by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division

1.D.4.a

●

Hazards with a Risk Assessment Code of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk)

●

Findings from regulatory agencies resulting in non-conformance (CPUC, FTA)

●

Accident investigations requiring corrective action

For testing or reviews of industrial hygiene that potentially exceed Permissible Exposure Limits for hazards
that do not meet the Unacceptable Risk Assessment Codes of 1A, 2A, 1B, or 2B (high risk), SSOA staff will
review and preliminarily approve the CAP before safety risk mitigation activities are implemented.
If an emergency corrective action must be taken immediately to ensure safety, the SSOA must be notified
of the issue immediately, and the agency must follow up with the SSOA for subsequent review and
approval of the corrective action within five business days.
The SSOA will review and provide final approval of all CAPs on a quarterly basis.
CAPs are assigned a specific tracking number by the Electronic Hazard Reporting System and are linked
with their associated hazard. CAPs must contain at a minimum:
●
●

The action(s) to be taken to minimize, control, correct, or eliminate the risks and hazards identified
A person of responsibility for the corrective action

●

A proposed completion date

●

Plan approval when applicable

2.1.1.6

Corrective Action Plan Development

CAPs are developed by department managers/designee in conjunction with the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will facilitate the CAP process is
followed and properly track CAPs until closed.

2.1.2

Hazard Process Overview

The hazard process includes all facilities, light rail, and bus systems. The hazard management flowchart
lays out an overall description of how hazards are identified, evaluated, analyzed, controlled or eliminated,
tracked, and reported to leadership and CPUC.
●

TSSs are the primary points of contact for the hazard management process

●

Safety committee members for rail and bus will be able to identify, evaluate, and analyze hazards

●

The TSSs will assist in entering identified hazards into the electronic hazard reporting system

●

The TSS facilitate development of mitigations for each unacceptable and undesirable hazard entry,
identify a point of contact or owner of the hazard, and place this information within the hazard
reporting system for tracking purposes

●

CAPs may also be identified as a result of an incident and investigation

22

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

In the following instances, CAPs must receive prior approval by the CPUC before mitigation activities
may begin:

Packet Pg. 103

●

Safety committee members also participate in the evaluation and control or elimination of the hazard

●

Hazards must be mitigated at the lowest level possible. However, when a hazard is identified as
having a mitigation that involves multiple departments or requires cost or changes beyond the
safety committee or department abilities or budgets, the hazard is elevated to the SSWG. The
SSWG will represent key department managers, have the capability to employ multiple disciplines,
and can influence higher level budgeted solutions.

●

Recommendations/results from contractor or internal review, testing, or industrial or environmental
sampling results requiring corrective actions will be placed in the hazard log for follow up and
possible need for retesting for compliance with Safety or Environmental requirements. If mitigation
or control of a hazard is not achieved through the SSWG, the hazard mitigation process may be
elevated to the Leadership Safety Committee.

2.1.2.1

Hazard Identification

Identifying hazards is the responsibility of all employees and contractors. The continuous identification,
monitoring, and mitigation of hazards is key to an effective safety program.
Hazard identification methods include, but are not limited to:
●

Observation, inspection, and interaction with all employees and contractors

●

Review of reports from safety committee members, customers, and customer service and field personnel

●

Evaluation of accidents, incidents, and near misses, to include data trends and projections

●

Conducting Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) of a design or new construction

●

Conducting safety certification, system integration testing, pre-revenue testing, system
modification, configuration management verification, and inspection processes

●

Conducting Operation Hazard Analysis (OHA) of revenue operations

●

Review of internal and external safety reviews, inspections, observations, defects, findings,
observations, violations, and reviews

●

Review of controller logs, daily operating clearances/bulletins, and training feedback

●

“Lesson learned” inputs

●

Review of applicable regulatory codes and standards

●

Review of NTSB, FTA, OSHA safety recommendations, guidance, initiatives, and alerts

●

Review of Nonconformance Reports, Corrective Action Reports

●

Review of data and information provided by the SSOA

The Hazard Management Flow Chart (in the attached document as Exhibit E.6) will be followed by
employees in identifying and correcting hazards at the employee/supervisor level. Actions will be taken to
move the hazard to the safety committee and beyond if necessary.

1.D.4.a

Hazard Investigation, Assessment, and Analysis

The agency is currently developing and refining a database where events and observed hazards can
be tracked and analyzed for leading indicators of potential hazards. This will allow management to be
proactive in correcting hazards.
Safety concerns are identified and corrected at the lowest level as soon as practicable. Safety concerns
that are not eliminated at this level are reported to a supervisor or a TSS. Reported concerns will be
assessed by a TSS and/or safety committee to determine if a safety hazard exists and assign an initial
hazard rating. Hazards will be evaluated and risks will be ranked to ensure prioritization for elimination or
control as described in the ORM framework.

2.1.3.1

Causal Factor, Analysis and Event Evaluation

Hazards are investigated following the Event Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedure
to determine causal and contributing factors of an event, or hazard, for purpose of preventing recurrence
and mitigating risk. Hazards originating from events are reviewed by TSSs, managers and supervisors, and
respective safety committees. A third-party expert may assist with an investigation if deemed necessary.
The level of investigation and the methodology used will be determined based upon
risk assessments.
HIGH risk hazards (1A, 1B, 2A, 2B) that receive an unacceptable initial hazard analysis made by
management, a safety committee, or a TSS receive immediate attention/control. A high rating requires
corrective action. Hazards that receive a high rating will be elevated from the local hazard log to the
electronic hazard reporting system.
SERIOUS hazards (1C, 2C, 3A, 3B) that are undesirable may require corrective action and decisions by
management. Hazards that receive a serious hazard rating will remain on the local hazard logs no more
than 45 days before being moved to the appropriate Safety and Environmental Compliance Division log.
MEDIUM (1D, 1E, 2D, 3C, 4A, 4B, 5A) hazards may be acceptable with review and documentation by
management.
MODERATE (2E, 3D, 4C, 5B) hazards are acceptable with review.
LOW (3E, 4D, 4E, 5C, 5D, 5E) hazards do not require review and are acceptable.

2.1.3.2 Hazard Reporting Threshold to Colorado Public Utilities Commission
The agency will notify CPUC of all identified hazards in the light rail system during monthly/quarterly
reporting. The agency will notify CPUC in a timely manner of all hazardous conditions that affect the
immediate safety of the light rail system. At a minimum, the agency notifies CPUC not later than 24 hours

2.1.3.3 Operational Risk Assessment Matrix

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.a

Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. To ensure risk assessments are consistent, it is important to use a standard definition.
Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe, Serious,
Limited, or Negligible.

25

Packet Pg. 106

Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a transit
system’s operating experience, evaluation of safety historical data, or the analysis of reliability and failure
data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the risk assessment matrix is used to determine the risk
index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, or Low. The required action to
mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures and/or mitigation actions.

The required resolution action is based on the determined risk level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation actions
that exceed funding levels authorized at each level will be elevated to the next higher level for action.

2.1.4

Hazard Control and Tracking

Safety critical hazards that have been identified must be controlled or mitigated so that the hazard does
not continue to pose a danger. This may be done in a temporary manner if the hazard is controlled. The
process of controlling and tracking hazards is recorded on the hazard log, which is generated from the
electronic hazard reporting system. The portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system are
discussed monthly with the CPUC.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.a

Depending upon the risk ranking, hazard log entries may require a mitigation plan or CAP, tracking number,
brief description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard/risk rating (IHR/IRR) using the Risk
Assessment Matrix.

Hazard log entries with their associated CAP are reviewed regularly by the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division, safety committees, and CPUC. They are periodically reviewed by senior
management. CAPs may be tracked and sorted from the hazard log. When a CAP is closed, the hazard
log will reflect this action and a closed date.
Individual CAP files are stored by tracking number.

2.1.4.1

Hazard Resolution

Hazard resolution refers to the methods and processes to identify mitigation strategies necessary to
reduce the likelihood and severity of the consequences associated with an identified hazard to the lowest
level practicable. Hazard resolution is not synonymous with hazard elimination. In a transit environment,
some hazards are impossible to eliminate and others are highly impractical to eliminate. Reduction of risk
to the lowest practical level can be accomplished in a variety of ways, from protective and warning devices
to special procedures. The hierarchy of controls will be followed to achieve a tolerable risk level:
1.

Elimination – remove the hazard

2. Substitution – replacement of material or a process with another that is considered
less hazardous
3.

Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk

4.

Administrative Controls – training, signage

5. Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

2.1.5

Hazard Tracking

Each CAP developed for hazards or findings from investigations or deficiencies will be submitted to
CPUC for review and approval. The CAP form is automatically assigned a tracking number and placed
on the hazard log with its identified hazard. Upon completion of the corrective action, the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will submit to CPUC as required. The completed CAP is formally
adopted by receiving CPUC’s signature. The hazard log will then be updated to show the status of the
identified hazard with its CAP as “CLOSED.”

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

CAPs include:

The agency will monitor all CAPs and provide CPUC with quarterly updates on the hazard log.

27

Packet Pg. 108

Internally, the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division will coordinate with the appropriate
department to develop a mitigation plan and fill out the appropriate form for the identified hazard. The form
will be assigned a tracking number by the electronic hazard reporting system and placed on the hazard log
with the corresponding hazards for tracking purposes.

2.1.6

Ongoing Reporting to Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)

A TSS will review the current status and identify any issues with the resolution action and dates. The
portions of the hazard log applicable to the light rail system, at a minimum, are provided monthly to the CPUC.
All hazards identified and rated as unacceptable hazardous conditions will be separately tracked and
reported to CPUC with a determination of an unacceptable hazardous condition, along with the CAPs for
each unacceptable hazardous condition found.
The CPUC notifies the agency in writing of its acceptance or rejection of the CAP and in accordance with
procedures specified in the CPUC program standard. The CAP form requires a CPUC electronic or wet
signature approval, indicating the assigned resolution and completion of the CAP.

2.1.7

Pre-Job Safety Briefings

Employees who perform infrequent tasks (less than once every three months) or high-risk job tasks (e.g.,
working at heights, energy isolation, confined space, hoisting and rigging) are required to discuss job tasks
and identified hazards that are associated with those tasks or job steps during pre-job briefings.

The agency operates over an eight-county district along Colorado’s Front Range area. These activities
have the potential to affect local waterways, soil, air, wildlife, vegetation, and human health. RTD’s Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division strives to exceed all state, federal, and local municipality regulatory
requirements to limit the district’s impact to the local environment. The following management procedures
detailed below are in place to ensure this goal is met.

2.2.1

Management of Hazardous Materials

For any hazardous chemical used or stored in the workplace, the agency must submit an annual Tier II
chemical inventory report to their State Emergency Response Commission, Local Emergency Planning
Committee, and local ﬁre department via the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Tier II Submit
software by March 1 of each year. The information is made available to the public under the Emergency
Planning and Community Right to Know Act. Tier II Submit software is updated yearly by the EPA and
completed by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division.
Over 2,000 listed hazardous materials and 600 extremely hazardous chemicals are subject to reporting
under EPA rulemaking. Reporting requirements have been limited by quantity.
Common hazardous materials used by the agency that are subject to reporting include:
●

Diesel fuel

●

Gasoline

●

New and used oil

●

Antifreeze (ethylene glycol)

●

Lead acid batteries (sulfuric acid)

The agency uses many hazardous chemicals contained in soaps, solvents, brake cleaners, paints, and
aerosols. These materials are described in the product specific Safety Data Sheet (SDS) forms.
Secondary containment, oil water separators, illicit discharge monitoring, stormwater best management
practices, and leak detection systems are utilized to help identify and remediate spills.

2.2.2

New Chemical Product Approval Program

A new product approval process is in place to ensure that all materials arriving on-site have been approved
by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for use. The process starts when the division or
group requesting a new product contacts the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division by email with
a copy of the SDS and a completed Product Approval Evaluation Form. If the material is acceptable for
use, the SDS will be placed into the electronic storage database for employees to view via intercompany
websites (e.g., Trapeze or the Hub). If the requested material is not approved, an alternative product that is
less harmful to human health or the environment may be suggested.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.2 Environmental Management and
Hazardous Material Program

All employees and contractors directly responsible for safety as well as each employee who works with
hazardous materials receives training on proper storage/handling of chemical products, appropriate use of
personnel protection equipment, compliant disposal of unused materials, and how to locate SDSs.

29

Packet Pg. 110

1.D.4.a

Management of Hazardous Waste

District Shops is a small quantity generator of hazardous waste. All other facilities are categorized as very
small quantity generators of hazardous waste. Hazardous wastes can be generated by:
●

Discarding a hazardous material (e.g., oil-based paint, solvents, thinner contaminated rags)

●

Using a product (e.g., batteries, ﬂuorescent lamps, HID lamps, electronic waste, aerosol dregs)

The EPA and Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division regulate the generation of
hazardous wastes.
Hazardous wastes are to be stored in closed containers and accumulated in satellite accumulation areas
or the Central Accumulation Storage Building at District Shops. Waste containers are labeled and located
near where the waste is generated. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible
for properly identifying hazardous waste, labeling waste containers, performing internal inspections,
inventorying monthly generation amounts, mitigating spills, training employees, preparing off-site
shipments for disposal, recordkeeping, and collaborating with regulatory agencies during audits.
Personnel that add or remove hazardous waste from containers are required to receive compliance training
that is equivalent to their job duties and measured through routine performance-based internal inspections.
Safety and Compliance personnel that arrange hazardous waste shipments are required to receive training
in EPA’s Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) site compliance and maintain Department
of Transportation (DOT) ground shipper certifications prior to receiving authorization to sign uniform
hazardous waste shipping manifests. Electronic manifests, individual site information, and notifications
are stored electronically on the EPA information system RCRAInfo. Safety and Environmental Compliance
personnel have access to the RCRAInfo database and use this tool to submit and view required compliance
documentation to the Colorado Hazardous Materials and Waste Management Division.

2.2.4

Underground and Aboveground Storage Tank Management

The agency is the owner of 32 regulated storage tanks throughout the district ranging from 1,000 to
48,000 gallons of diesel, gasoline, antifreeze, and lube oil. Storage tank systems are regulated by
the Colorado Division of Oil and Public Safety (OPS). Common components of tank systems include
underground piping, secondary containment, leak detection systems, overfill protection equipment, and
automatic tank gauging. These components are monitored daily for functionality, regulatory compliance,
product inventory, and release detection. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division collaborates
with the Capital Programs Department to arrange OPS required compliance testing, inspections, and
certifications for tank systems.
Spill Prevention Control and Counter Measure Plans (SPCC) that are certified by a licensed Professional
Engineer (PE) are in place at RTD facilities that store over 42,000 gallons of petroleum products in
underground storage tanks (UST).

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

2.2.3

Each of the six facilities that utilize underground storage tank systems to fuel vehicles has onsite
B-operators (Facilities Maintenance Supervisors) that oversee day-to-day operations and maintenance,
an A-operator (Manager, Facilities Maintenance Operating Facilities) that direct B-operators in their work,
and a listed facility contact (Manager, Environmental Compliance) that collects required compliance
documentation and is the liaison between the agency and OPS for audits, site characterization reporting,
and general inquiries at all six facilities. All three of these positions require OPS approved A- or B-operator
training through an approved training provider.

30

Packet Pg. 111

Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel are required to download and store compliance
documentation from the InSite360 Veeder-Root remote monitoring system at a minimum of every
30 calendar days. Abnormalities in the tank system are reported to the local B-operator and the tank
compliance contractor for resolution. Compliance reports that are run include tank tightness testing, liquid
sensor reports, and alarm history.

2.2.5

Stormwater Management

To comply with the provisions of the Colorado Water Quality Control Division (WQCD), the agency has
historically held a number of stormwater discharge permits for operating maintenance divisions, rail
corridors, stations, construction activities, and the Tunnel 16 Groundwater Treatment Facility. These permits
authorize the discharge of stormwater from these locations to the local waterways provided that the
agency and its contractors follow the requirements listed on each set of Colorado Discharge Permit System
(CDPS) issued documents. Common CDPS requirements include:
●

Illicit discharge detection and elimination procedures are in place

●

Construction site runoff controls are in place before and after project completion

●

Good housekeeping activities are continually practiced, monitored, and improved if needed

●

Internal training is conducted annually to help employees recognize and report illicit discharges

●

Proper storage and containment systems are in place for hazardous materials

●

Conducting internal inspections and collaborating with facility personnel to correct findings

●

Numeric or practiced-based effluent limitations are being met

●

Annual reporting is completed accurately and submitted to WQCD

●

Monthly submissions of Discharge Monitoring Reports through EPA’s NetDMR System

CDPS issued permits historically held by the agency include:
●

COR900000 Light Industrial Activity (operating facilities)

●

COR070000 Non-Standard Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (rail corridors/stations)

●

COG318000 Discharge from Long-term Remediation Activities (Tunnel 16 GWTP)

●

COR400000 Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities (East Metro
UST replacement)

2.2.6

Stationary Source Air Emission Management

Operating maintenance divisions that use boilers, paint booths, outdoor fueling stations and parts washing
units that exceed Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment established thresholds are
regulated by the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division (APCD). The Safety and Environmental Compliance
Division is responsible for gathering fuel, natural gas, and paint consumption throughput from these
sources and must be prepared to submit inventoried data to APCD upon request. Air Pollution Emission
Notifications must be submitted prior to operating systems that exceed APCD thresholds and renewed
every five years or before that time if significant alterations have occurred or will occur.

2.2.7

Industrial Hygiene

The agency is in a continual cycle of renovation, repair, construction, and demolition of current facilities.
Safety and environmental considerations for these projects include:
●

Identification and abatement of asbestos and lead paint, and other contaminants present in
building materials that are to be disturbed

●

Proper identification, monitoring, and disposal of contaminated groundwater and soils

●

Removal of hazardous wastes that a previous facility owner may have left behind

The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division uses a third-party environmental consulting firm in
most cases to identify, mitigate, and prepare required reports for these activities. These environmental
consulting services can often be very expensive and time consuming. Identifying and addressing the need
for these environmental services at the inception of new projects is helpful in avoiding project delays, cost
increases, and non-compliance issues with regulatory agencies.
The agency’s facilities and properties may encounter industrial hygiene (IH) issues throughout their life span
that include:
●

Mold evaluations

●

Presence of air contaminants

●

Environmental site assessments

●

Site characterization reports

●

Visual emission opacity readings

Facilities throughout the district require routine IH evaluations that include:
●

Laboratory testing of 27 individual oil water separators at six different facilities

●

Preparation of monthly discharge monitoring reports (Tunnel 16 GWTF)

●

Groundwater sampling and annual reporting to OPS for the Platte Bus Maintenance Facility

Compliance Division. On-track safety training is provided to contractors via the Litmos learning system.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division is responsible for reporting spills that exceed state and
federal established thresholds to the appropriate regulatory agency.

2.2.9

Management of Petroleum Contaminated Debris

Due to the large amount of petroleum contaminated rags, wipes, pads, and absorbents that the agency
historically generates at local maintenance facilities, it has been a long-standing best management
practice to separate most of this material from normally occurring trash throughout the facilities. Operating
facilities are equipped with specialized containers (mini-boxes) that are lined with thick cubic-yard-size
polyurethane tote bags that are manifested, sealed, and picked out of the mini-boxes by boom trucks and
taken separately offsite to avoid comingling with normal outgoing refuse. The contents of the mini-boxes
are profiled through a vendor-supplied customer database that also stores shipment details. The debris is
verified to be non-RCRA hazardous waste through periodic sampling and analytical lab reporting through
which the RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance Division contracts. Pickup requests are called in by
local Storeroom Supervisors or RTD Safety and Environmental Compliance personnel.

ASSURANCE

The third element of the PTASP is Safety Assurance, which describes how the agency will monitor,
measure, and review its processes to ensure it remains in compliance with established standards.
These processes, safety performance targets, and reports provide assurance to leadership that the
organization and system are functioning at an acceptable level of safety. The reviews, inspections, rules
checks, and compliance verification procedures are described, required schedules set, and acceptable
measures established.

3.1 Internal Safety Review Process
Internal safety reviews (ISR) and inspections are critical components of an integrated system safety
program. As such, internal safety reviews are conducted semiannually to ensure compliance with the
SMS and that the plan is effectively implemented. Facilities are inspected monthly for occupational safety
issues and local fire codes. Written reports of each review are prepared and distributed once the ISR is
completed. Senior leaders will discuss safety reviews, evaluate the effectiveness of the SMS, recommend
corrective action if necessary and ensure timely implementation and follow up. An internal light rail review
report is compiled each year in January and submitted to the CPUC by Feb. 15. The report documents
the review findings for the year, including the results of internal reviews performed during the previous
year; a summary of required corrective actions taken, if any; and provision for follow-up to ensure timely
implementation and to determine effectiveness of the SMS. The annual audit report will be accompanied
by a formal letter of certification signed by the GM/CEO indicating that the agency is in compliance with
its SMS. If areas of deficiency are identified, the GM/CEO will identify the activities the agency will take to
achieve compliance. Documentation of inspection and reviews are maintained.
As part of the ISR program, all departments are subject to review. The CSO is responsible for and has
complete authority to conduct ISRs. Two reviews are conducted annually, one in the summer and one in
the winter. Within a three-year period, all PTASP elements are reviewed for compliance with the plan and
CPUC requirements. The sixth review cycle, which is in the last quarter of the third year, is reserved to
review and revise the audit process to ensure that all elements are completed and that the program meets
CPUC requirements.
The agency will notify the CPUC of an upcoming review cycle at least 30 days prior to the start of the
safety review.
An opening conference may be scheduled with the departments subject to safety review. At the opening
conference, checklists are distributed, discussed, and reviewed for accuracy, and a schedule is set.
The actual ISR consists of interviews with key personnel, documentation review and observation of
activities to assess compliance and understanding of rules, training and procedures. After completion
of the onsite activities, the checklists are completed, and a written draft report is developed. The draft
report may include recommendations or findings. Recommendations are defined as suggestions to
make improvements, while findings are defined as documented deficiencies in the implementation of
established programs, rules or procedures. The draft report is distributed for review and comment to
the affected parties. A final report is completed and distributed to all parties. Recorded findings require
the development of a CAP. The annual ISR report prepared and submitted to the CPUC will include an
evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of the SMS.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

Recommendations from previous review cycles will be reviewed and evaluated in subsequent cycles.
Findings will be tracked under the CAP process of placing all findings on a tracking spreadsheet and the
subsequent quarterly corrective action plan progress reports will be filed with the CPUC.

Collect, Analyze, and Report Safety Management System Data,
and Maintain Records

SMS data is collected through a variety of sources including near miss information, accident investigation
reports, ISRs, safety committee meetings, occupational injury reports, incident reports, use of an accident
matrix, system monitoring including testing and inspection records and the hazard management program.
This safety data will be analyzed and used for development of key safety performance indicators and
targets. The agency reports the following to National Transit Database (NTD):
●

Fatalities – total number of reportable fatalities and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Injuries – total number of reportable injuries and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

Safety events – total number of reportable events and rate per total vehicle revenue miles by mode

●

System reliability – mean distance between major mechanical failures by mode

These safety performance measures are used to select improvement targets for these four measures
and for light rail, bus and paratransit to encourage improvements and monitor the safety performance of
delivering transit services. In addition, the agency selects additional performance measures and targets,
both leading and lagging, to ensure continual improvement of the SMS. The agency communicates safety
performance information internally using various methods of communication, including electronic message
boards, committee meetings, newsletters, and team/crew meetings to keep employees informed of SMS
initiatives, risks and performance.
The agency will make its safety performance measures improvement and targets available to applicable
state agencies (e.g., the Colorado Department of Transportation) and metropolitan planning organizations
(currently Denver Regional Council of Governments). To the maximum extent practicable, the agency will
coordinate with the external entities in the selection of external entity safety performance targets.
The safety data collected will be analyzed for potential safety impacts. Identified areas of concern are
reported to appropriate personnel in the form of specific project reports and memos. Records of system
safety data are maintained in the office of the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for a minimum
of three years. Certain information, such as safety certification backup documentation, is maintained by the
document control process managed by the Capital Programs Department. In addition to safety, the Safety
and Environmental Compliance Division maintains data and documentation of activities required by
the SMS.

3.1.4

System Modifications or Major Repairs

New fixed facility equipment modifications and retrofits are reviewed and approved by the RTD
engineering group and the technical support staff. Review may also take place by the RTD Infrastructure
Change Review Committee. Non-infrastructure changes will follow the non-infrastructure change process.

New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Review

New equipment, system expansions, and modifications are reviewed and approved by the Capital
Programs Department and Bus Operations, Rail Operations, and Safety and Environmental Compliance
divisions. This review is conducted to ensure that new equipment, expansions, and modifications safely
and operationally integrate into the existing system.

3.1.5.2 New Equipment, System Expansion, and Modification Acceptance
Operational readiness of new equipment and system expansions is verified through the equipment
acceptance and safety and security certification process. The Bus Operations and Rail Operations divisions
perform rigorous equipment and integration testing as part of the vehicle and equipment acceptance
process. Once complete, new vehicles and equipment are formally accepted by the Bus Operations
and Rail Operations divisions. This information is presented and approved by the Safety and Security
Certification Program and described in section 3. The Safety and Security Certification Program provides
an identification, design, review, and verification process for system expansions and modifications.
Certification process completion is verified by sign-off from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division.

3.1.5.3 Exceptions to Established Design Criteria
The agency has a process to request variances to design criteria. All variances go through three levels
of review. Level 4 and above exceptions to design criteria are approved only by the acceptance of the
CSO and the GM/CEO. If appropriate, the design criteria may be amended or modified to accommodate
acceptable modifications. The AGM of Capital Programs is responsible for the maintenance and distribution
of the design criteria. The design criteria will be reviewed prior to new corridor construction.

3.1.5.4 Procurement Procedures
Procurement of equipment and materials is controlled by the Procurement Standards Manual. Each
procurement requires the development of detailed specifications assembled by the requesting manager.
Levels of review are built into the procurement process depending upon the scope of the procurement.
As the scope of the procurement increases, so does the level of review. Minor procurements require
authorization from the Contracting and Procurement Division and the division manager of the requesting
division. Major procurements, such as light rail- or bus construction-related projects or procurement of
buses or light rail vehicles (LRVs) vehicles, are subject to the following review process.
The Operations Department and technical support staff develop detailed specifications through the
design process. These specifications are subject to several internal reviews at varying levels of design and
personnel from other transit agencies, where relevant. In addition to procurement specifications, the safety
and security certification review process described in Section 3 governs light rail construction.

Management of Change (MOC) Infrastructure changes will be managed through the Infrastructure Change
Review (ICR) process, which is managed by the Capital Programs Department. The MOC process is
managed by the CSO and the chief engineer. MOC per federal requirements is currently beginning to be
integrated into procedures. The ICR process coordinates physical changes, before they are implemented in
the existing operating environment. Formal Project Management Plans are prepared for large projects.
Representatives from each involved department and personnel from the Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division are represented in the ICR and MOC processes. When changes are made to existing
structures or facilities, it is critical that affected personnel, the public or other groups be notified of changes
that might have potential safety or security impacts. Affected personnel are invited to participate in project
meetings and coordinate any changes. Additional training may be required. Operations and maintenance
procedures, bulletins or SOPs may need to be developed. Engagement and Communications Department
personnel assist with communications to outside agencies or affected groups. An essential element of
communications must take place after the project is completed. Any observed negative or hazardous
impacts of physical changes must be reported to the chief engineer or CSO, as soon as possible, so that
hazards may be assessed and included in the hazard resolution process.
MOC process applies to existing bus and light rail services systems, vehicles, facilities, and equipment that
may not require formal safety certification, but may have safety impacts.

3.2.1

Safety and Security Certification

Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel develop and implement safety and security
certification programs to ensure that safety and security concerns and hazards are addressed prior to
the initiation of light rail passenger operations for new corridors, system extensions, rehabilitation, or
modification or replacement of equipment. The agency uses the FTA Handbook for Transit Safety and
Security Certification to develop the requirements for each safety and security certification program. An
individual safety and security certification plan is developed for each new corridor. For minor extensions
or projects, safety and security certification is addressed through the preparation of safety and security
certification forms applicable to the scope of work. If equipment is procured as part of a new maintenance
facility. LRVs undergo a formalized commissioning acceptance process owned by the manufacturer under
the supervision of Light Rail Operations.
The safety and security certification program has the following goals:
●

Verify that acceptable safety and security levels are met or exceeded

●

Document the verification of safety and security standards

●

Provide consistency for project certification

With these goals in mind, the objectives of the program can be more narrowly defined. The program
objectives are to identify and verify:
●

Safety and security requirements of the system design

●

Safety and security requirements for construction and system equipment installation

●

That safety and security requirements are met or exceeded for system testing

●

That safety and security requirements are met for changes or modifications to SOPs, training
manuals, rule book, and system elements

Quality Assurance

Capital projects have a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) function built into the design and
construction of the project. Specific personnel are responsible for QA/QC activities. In general, QA/QC
activities in large projects follow standard industry practice and are subject to review by the FTA and
others. Quality control during construction projects is a requirement of the contractor and submitted in the
quality plan prior to initiation of construction. The agency retains qualified inspectors and testing firms to
provide quality assurance by document submittal reviews and periodic testing of materials throughout
the project.
Received goods are required to be compared to items ordered, lot numbering or other certifications
as required on safety critical items. Where applicable, receiving personnel ensure that lot number
documentation is provided before materials are received or accepted. Periodically, purchasing personnel
or TSSs will randomly sample hardware, slings, lifting devices, and other devices for compliance with
specifications. Items will also be functionally tested periodically to ensure they meet standards.

3.3 Rules Compliance
Reports and Data Analysis

The results of various operational tests, including periodic efficiency checks, are compiled, and reviewed at
least quarterly by the general superintendent of Light Rail Transportation, or designated manager. A written
form of the review will be retained by Light Rail Operations and available upon request of the Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division and during ISRs. An annual report completed by the Manager, Service
Delivery, summarizing the previous year’s results of the operational tests, including a trend analysis of the
available data. The annual report is retained by Light Rail Operations and provided during ISRs and on
request from the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division for further review and trend analysis.

3.3.1.1

Enforcement Violations

Rule violations are addressed through the agency’s management process, which includes coaching,
retraining, and formal discipline that may result in termination. Additionally, all accidents and incidents are
reviewed by supervisors and the Safety Division to determine if rules have been violated. The Safety and
Environmental Compliance Division will determine if revisions, changes, or additions are necessary to the
rules and SOPs.

3.3.1.2 Risk Management
A TSS may incorporate violation trends or deficiencies for any rule or procedure into the risk management
program for resolution. Risks unresolved by the Rail Safety Committee (RSC) or the Bus Safety Committee
(BSC) are directed to the SSWG for further tracking, review, resolution, and/or correction. Noncompliant
review findings determined to be hazardous are documented in the hazard log. A date of observation,
description of the hazardous condition, corrective action required, and implementation date are tracked until
the hazardous condition is corrected. (See section 2 for further information.) The Safety and Environmental
Compliance Division conducts ongoing and regular observations and reviews to determine the
effectiveness of the rule compliance program.

3.3.2

SMS Policies, Procedures, and Processes

The agency has adopted policies, procedures, processes, training materials and employee rule books to
establish requirements and expectations for safe operations, maintenance and construction for the agency.
These are reviewed periodically and updated as necessary according to the following guidelines: prior
to revenue service of a system expansion, new bus route, or new corridor; or as recommended by the
ISR process. A committee consisting of controller/supervisors, operators, and TSSs performs the review.
Recommended SOP changes are reviewed and approved by the chief/AGM of the affected
division/department.

3.5 Inspections and Reviews
Maintenance

Maintenance and service of all vehicles, equipment, and facilities is established using manufacturer
manuals, codes, standards, and established procedures as guidelines. Maintenance is performed at a level
of readiness that ensures safe, efficient, and reliable service. The agency maintains data to track scheduled
maintenance of vehicles and equipment.
Safety critical equipment that does not meet established requirements is withdrawn from service.
Vehicles or equipment involved in an accident are removed from service if there is reason to suspect that
equipment failure contributed to the cause of the accident. Vehicles or equipment are returned to service
only after they are determined that no defects could have contributed to the accident and if the equipment
is deemed safe for service. The agency has established procedures to ensure rapid deployment, recovery,
and return to service in the event of an emergency.
Effective maintenance is an indispensable prerequisite to safe and efficient operations. The Bus and Light
Rail divisions have standards that make safety and reliability the primary objectives of the system. These
goals are met through the incorporation of preventive and repair maintenance programs for all aspects of
the system. The Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) Maintenance Plan addresses incorporates the following principles:
●

Preventive maintenance programs will be cost-effective in minimizing service failures

●

Changes in preventive maintenance programs may be expected periodically as experience is
gained on the equipment maintained

●

Preventive maintenance goals and policies will not be altered due to time constraints or as a costreduction measure in times of financial stress

●

Effective maintenance procedures require much record-keeping and information storage/retrieval

●

The technical sophistication of the LRV, and the tracking of a large, expensive inventory, place a
heavy responsibility on the information capabilities of the light rail vehicle maintenance group

The Bus Fleet Maintenance Plan addresses the following areas:
●

Maintenance division goals and objectives

●

Contingency bus fleet

●

Maintenance management system

●

Preventative maintenance program

●

Wheelchair lift preventative maintenance program

●

Quality control program

●

3.6 Drug and Alcohol Program
Drug and Alcohol Program

The agency maintains an employee drug and alcohol program in compliance with DOT and FTA
regulations. The program includes criteria for random testing of safety sensitive personnel and testing for
cause, either accident related or from observed behavior. The Human Resources Department manages this
program, which is subject to frequent review by the FTA.
Drug and alcohol testing and information about drug and alcohol abuse is included in the Drug and Alcohol
Policy. Training on this policy is required for each new hire and provided during orientation. The program
is administered by the manager of substance abuse and office services, who verifies compliance with the
program and oversees training. Revisions to the program are distributed to all employees. If necessary,
follow-up training is provided.
Compliance with and knowledge of the program are accomplished through direct supervision of
employees and refresher training if necessary.
GENERAL POLICY STATEMENT
The agency is dedicated being a trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to its
community and customers and to providing a healthy, safe, and satisfying work environment for employees.
The agency and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 agree that employees must be able to
work in a drug- and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect
the rights and privacy of all employees. The employer has the right and duty to protect its employees,
customers, and the public from the adverse effects of drug and alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the
employer to restrict employees’ on-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol abuse
and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug testing
results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective employee
assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work not under the influence of alcohol or controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees’ rights and privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, the agency has implemented this policy to:
●

Detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing

●

Encourage employees to obtain treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems

●

Deter drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through education, training, and discipline

●

Enforce the goal of a drug- and alcohol-free work environment through appropriate discipline

Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only of
the abuser, but also the abuser’s family, friends and the public at large. Employees should be aware of
the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

3.6.1

Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations covering persons in safety-sensitive
job classifications.
Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol use may contact the manager of
substance abuse and office service.

52

Packet Pg. 133

To the extent that any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may
be amended or revised in the future, the regulations shall take precedence. Employees are expected
to review, be familiar with, and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and
testing. All existing and new employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and
consequences of prohibited drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment and the signs
and symptoms that may indicate prohibited drug use.
Compliance with this policy, including participation in the drug and alcohol testing program, is a required
condition of employment.

3.6.2

Applicability

3.6.2.1 Categories of Employees
This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive employees, volunteers and contractors
and are referred to in this policy as “employees” unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all
employees while on agency property to perform their duties or while performing any work-related
business. Visitors and vendors are expected to adhere to this policy while on agency property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform “safety sensitive
functions” for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Part 40 as amended and Part
655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other specific requirements set forth in this
policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to perform, or
immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of public transportation.
The following are safety-sensitive functions:
●

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in revenue service

●

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle

●

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service

●

Operating a non-revenue-service vehicle when required to be operated by a holder of a
Commercial Driver’s License

●

Carrying a firearm for security purposes

●

Supervising any function listed in the items above

The agency reviews the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions and determines which job functions may require
the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job classifications

The BSC and RSC coordinate ongoing safety efforts within the transportation, facilities, and maintenance
functions of the Bus Operations Division and Light Rail Division. The committee meets monthly to update
and mitigate hazards within their facilities and on their systems.
BSCs are formed for the District Shops, Platte, East Metro, and Boulder divisions. The BSCs and RSC are
chaired by the Safety and Environmental Compliance Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. The committees
consist of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following areas,
which may include, but is not limited to: Street Operations, Bus Operations, Bus Maintenance, Facilities
Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area (e.g., Treasury).
RSC consists of up to any manager within the division, and one or more employees from the following
areas, which may include, but is not limited to: Operations, Vehicle Maintenance, Field Supervisors,
Facilities Maintenance, Health and Wellness, Transit Security, and any other unique area.
The ATU 1001 appoints bargaining unit employees to the BSC and RSC as needed to serve as safety
representatives from the ranks of each department.
Committee members are granted an opportunity to speak, and to present safety issues to the BSC or RSC,
through an open communication process. Minutes are maintained and distributed to the members and the
transportation managers through various physical and electronic means.
The minutes contains a risk register with open item list of issues brought forward at BSC meetings,
submitted through the Hazard Management System, or placed in the safety suggestion boxes posted at
each division. The risk register will include the month/year the item was brought forward to the committee;
an initial, perceived, and final hazard rating (Risk Assessment Code); and the estimated month/year the
corrective action will be completed. There also is a log of closed/completed items, as well as informational
items for employees. Most safety issues are resolved within the parameters of the BSC. Issues not resolved
in the BSC, or safety critical hazards, will be elevated to the next higher-level safety committee, the Joint
Labor-Management Safety Committee, or ultimately to the Leadership Safety Committee.
Safety Committee actions include the following:
●

Reviewing facility and operations system safety issues identified by members, staff, reviews,
or inspections

●

Assigning responsibility for correcting hazards

●

Reviewing open items for completion

●

Reviewing effectiveness of mitigations

●

Ensure safety and regulatory rule compliance (e.g. FTA, CDOT, OSHA)

4.1.2.4 Fire and Life Safety Committee (FLSC) (Large Scale Projects Only)

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_2024 (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

4.1.2.3 Bus Safety Committee (BSC) and Rail Safety Committee (RSC)

The FLSC serves as a liaison between project safety and local police, fire, and emergency response
agencies. Safety and Environmental Compliance Division’s delegate, usually a TSS. Members include local
police, fire, and emergency medical services staff, and supervisors within the Safety, Bus Operations, and
Rail Operations divisions.

The FLSC coordinates inspections and drills to verify the fire and life safety and security emergency
response, and familiarization and compliance with the system. Drills are initiated during the activation
phase and continue during revenue operations, per federal requirement, to maintain an effective
interagency rapport.

4.1.2.5 System Safety Working Group (SSWG)
The SSWG comprises subject matter experts from all departments who collaborate to review, implement,
and execute a system process required to complete a project or event that has been identified. This group
reviews systems or issues with the perspective of looking for hazards, identifying risk to:
●

Design or engineer problems out of the system

●

Correct through SOP

●

Mitigate with personal protective equipment

●

Eliminate the risk/hazard

The SSWG may not change the scope of the project but may make decisions that relate directly to the
remediation of specific hazards. To this end, it is best for the SSWG to be included in the scope phase of
the project plan.
The SSWG defines the job-specific Certified Items List (CIL) and creates and maintains the Preliminary
Hazard Analysis (PHA). If the SSWG determines that the residual risk of a hazard cannot be reduced below
the medium risk level, then the SSWG presents its findings to Leadership Safety Committee in accordance
with the Operational Risk Management Policy and Framework.

4.1.2.6 Investigation Team
This team comprises staff from various departments that have a role in the development of a CAP or
mitigation singular resulting events, occurrences, accidents, and incidents. This process will follow the Event
Notification, Reporting and Investigation Policy and Procedures.

4.2 Training and Certification Program
Employee Safety Training, Certification, Verification, and Performance Testing

Employees receive formal training and certification for the work they perform according to their job
classification. The categories of safety-related work requiring training and certification are Rail and
Bus Operators and Maintainers. The specific programs are discussed below. However, each training
and certification program contains classroom and hands-on training and written exams. Certification
documentation, including tests and test scores, is maintained in employee files and is subject to review
during the internal safety review program.
Except for the on-track safety training program required of contractors working on or near RTD rail
property, the agency does not train or certify contractors or employees of contractors. The on-track safety
training program is required of contractors prior to issuance of an access permit to work near or on RTD
rail property. The program is usually instructed in a train-the-trainer format allowing contractors to train
their own personnel. Compliance with this program is verified through in-field observation and examination
of contractor training cards. The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division maintains a log of all
contractors trained under the program.
Regarding performance testing (to include operational tests and efficiency checks), any operating or
maintenance rule is subject to verification and compliance. Compliance with rules, training, and certification
requirements is verified in several ways. Rail and bus operators are frequently observed in the field
by supervisors and Safety and Environmental Compliance Division personnel; however, a supervisor
must discuss an observed rule violation with the operator as soon as practicable. In addition to ongoing
monitoring and observation, rail and bus operators are subject to formal ride checks in which supervisors,
usually anonymously or covertly, observe operators according to predetermined criteria or a checklist.
These ride checks are documented, reviewed with the operator, and maintained in the operator’s
employee file. These records are subject to verification during the ISR process. Any trend or issue
discovered during system monitoring, observation, and ride checks is reported to divisional leadership and
the CSO for inclusion in the operational risk management risk register.
Bus, rail, and facility maintainers also receive direct supervision, including observation and verification of
their maintenance activities. Each piece of work that is assigned to a maintainer is reviewed and approved
for correctness by their immediate supervisor through the work order process. When a Maintainer
completes a work assignment, the direct supervisor verifies and approves the work through observation
and signature approval on the work order. The maintainer will enter in the enterprise asset management
system that the work is complete, and the direct supervisor will verify and approve the work, then accept
that the work was properly completed in the enterprise system. Maintenance activities are also observed
during the ISR process. Supervision is assessed during the ISR program by the review of documentation
and compliance with schedules. If issues are discovered, they are reported as recommendations or
findings in the review report. Review findings are referred for inclusion in the hazard
management program.

4.2.2

Operator Certification

All employees and contractor personnel who foul or have the potential to foul the tracks (within 10 feet
of centerline of track) must receive OTST prior to beginning their work. Contractors are responsible for
ensuring that their employees complete OSHA-required training prior to performing projects.

4.3.4

Contractor Safety Coordination and Construction Safety

All contractor work on or near agency light rail property is controlled by access permits. Prior to issuing an
access permit, the contractor is required to meet with staff from Capital Engineering and Rail Operations
to describe and coordinate their work. After this initial coordination, the contractor applies for a permit,
which is reviewed and approved by Light Rail Maintenance of Way, Rail Transportation and Safety and
Environmental Compliance prior issuance by Light Rail Maintenance of Way. The contractor is bound
to the requirements of the permit. All contractors working with the agency are also bound by contract
specifications for the work they are to perform.
Key documents guiding the management of construction safety are: the Construction Safety Guidelines,
and the Safety and Security Certification process. The Construction Safety Guidelines presents the
requirements for construction projects and follows OSHA construction requirements and regulations.
Contractors are required to follow OSHA construction safety requirements and requirements of contract
specifications and access permits.
The Safety and Environmental Compliance Division conducts construction safety oversight to monitor
contractor workplace safety and conformance to OSHA standards. Oversight includes contractor safety
orientation prior to project commencement, field monitoring, and site safety inspections. Periodic safety
meetings are conducted between the agency and contractors to ensure safe project construction.

Controller

Task to be completed
If an operator complains about ingesting smoke from drugs on a
train, have them stop the train at a station and open all doors (to the
platform side) to ventilate the car.
Instruct the operator to ask passengers to board another car in the
consist. Have the operator deboard so they can get fresh air. The
train and operator can hold at a station for 3-5 minutes to allow the
train time to clear the air.
Start a supervisor to the location.
Make sure the operator makes an onboard announcement that the
train will be delayed at the station for several minutes. They do not
need to explain why.
After 3 minutes, ask the operator if they feel safe to continue. If they
feel safe to continue, have them continue in-service to their last
stop. Have a supervisor meet them there to further evaluate them
and see how they are doing.
• If they feel unsafe to operate, follow the protocol for
relieving an operator in the field or have the responding
supervisor operate the train out of service to a storage
location.
• If the operator is relieved, have them fill out an OJI form.
• If the train is removed from service, park the consist and
open the doors for 30 minutes to allow it to air out.
Remind the operator to NOT contact the person smoking on the
train. Ask them to get a description of the person and inform
security.
Ask the operator if they need medical attention. Document yes or
no. If no, document that they declined medical assistance. If yes,
determine if they want EMS to respond, if they should be
transported to an authorized worker’s comp facility, or if they decide
to seek medical treatment from an authorized worker’s comp facility
on their own.
Make a log entry using code 9704 (OJI Relief) so we can track the
number of times this happens.

Event Investigation
•

Note: Events required to be reported to the CPUC and the facts discovered
during the investigation are considered privileged and highly confidential

•

Investigate and gather facts to identify causal factors of events to reduce or
eliminate systemic causes and to prevent future events

•

The manager has accountability to own/delegate, coordinate and ensure an
event investigation occurs

•

The investigation owner, as defined by event type in the Event Investigation
and Notification Determination Table, may delegate investigation to the
appropriately trained individuals to conduct the investigation. The
Investigation Owner may have to coordinate with other functional groups to
ensure resource availability.

•

The investigation owner or designee will schedule a post event meeting within
72 hours of the event, to include:
•

General Superintendent or designee

•

Assigned Transit Safety Specialist

•

Business Program Manager or designee

•

Investigator

•

The purpose of the 72 hours post event meeting is to determine whether all
necessary information has been gathered to complete a causal analysis
including contributing factors It will also determine the level of post event
investigation necessary and establish future meetings to ensure appropriate
Corrective Action Plans (CAPs) are developed and implemented. It will also
determine the level of investigation necessary and establish future meetings
to ensure appropriate CAPs are developed and implemented

•

The next step in the process is to determine whether there is a need to identify
other suitable persons from within the agency to assist in the investigation
process
•

Note: basic, medium, and high-level investigations shall be conducted
if the event/incident meets any of the criteria defined in Section 2.3
and the attached Event Investigation and Notification Determination
Table (Appendix 1)

Event Investigation Methodology
•

The higher of the actual or potential event severity determination level is used
to determine the type of investigation methodology to be applied

•

The Investigation Owner must specify the level of investigation required in
accordance with the Event Investigation and Notification Determination Table,
and it is the responsibility of the investigation team, to use that methodology

•

There are three levels of investigation methodology to be used as follows:
o Basic Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of moderate or low
using the basic reporting framework through the application of the “5
Whys” methodology
o Medium Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of medium using
the event investigation methodology, “5 Whys” methodology or
Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT)
o High Level Investigation: Investigation level to be completed for an
event with an actual or potential consequence level of high or serious
using SCAT or Why Tree which is defined in the event investigation
training program

identify and eliminate the failures that prevent a business from
achieving its goals (e.g. zero injuries, on-time performance, reliability,
meeting cost objectives, etc.)

•

Once the causal factors determination has been completed and the causal and
contributing factors determined, the next step for the investigation team is to
develop CAPs to address the causal factors discovered and identify
opportunities to strengthen systems and processes. In doing this, it is
important for the investigator/investigation Team to:
o Organize conclusions sequentially, preferably in chronological order or
in logical sets
o Base conclusions on the facts and results from subsequent analysis of
the facts
o Include only substantive conclusions that bear directly on the event
o Keep conclusions as succinct as possible
o Link conclusions to applicable management systems
o Recommend effective mitigations for CAPs based on the hierarchy of
control to eliminate the hazard or change behaviors
o Collaborate with responsible and affected parties

•

It is the responsibility of the Investigation Team to document their conclusions
and CAP to strengthen systems and processes

The Investigation Team is to identify and recommend corrective and preventative
actions. The aim is to eliminate hazards, change behaviors and, where this cannot
be achieved mitigation methods or controls must be in place to reduce risk to an
acceptable level. In determining corrective actions, it is essential for the
Investigator/Investigation Team, to consider the effects of hazards such as:
•

Probability

•

Severity

•

Cost

Impact on the agency

When the investigation is completed, a copy of the investigation report must be
provided to the Investigation Owner and impacted groups for review.
Note: Depending upon the nature of the event, legal review may be required
before authorization is granted to communicate the findings and outcomes of the
investigation to entities external to RTD.
2.8

Investigation Review
Once the investigation is completed by the Investigation Team, it is the
responsibility of the investigation owner to:
•

Review the quality and content of the investigation with a member of
the safety team

•

Identify and determine whether the causal factors have been
established

•

Determine whether the recommended corrective or preventative
actions address the identified causal factors, appropriate to the risk

•

Determine whether other parties need to be involved in the review

•

Review the recommended corrective or preventative actions and
ensure tasks are assigned to the appropriate personnel with
reasonable timeframes in an action tracking system

Note: It is essential that when corrective actions are assigned, a realistic due date
is set in consultation with the person(s) to whom the action is assigned.
2.9

Document and Communicate the Findings
•
•

Once the investigation report has been reviewed by the Investigation Owner,
it is critical that the corrective actions are communicated broadly to the
agency to facilitate the continuous improvement process
It is the responsibility of the Investigation Owner to broadly communicate the
findings of the investigation by considering the following points:
o What happened
o Effects on people involved
o Causes/lessons learned
o With whom to communicate (locally, division, agency wide, industry

Introduction
Implementing the Operational Risk Management (ORM) framework will improve how Denver Regional
Transportation District (RTD) manages risk and represents a shared commitment to an effective
process through a formal, continuous, top-down, data-driven, organizational-wide approach to
manage risk, assure effectiveness of risk controls, and promote ORM in the agency. The ORM process
applies to all risks for the agency, except financial and legal risks, which are covered by the internal
audit function. This framework outlines the tasks for implementing a formal, documented process for
ORM throughout the agency.
This effort demonstrates RTD’s commitment to improving the maturity of its approach to ORM, which
will unify the agency’s management systems and other activities to achieve agency objectives
effectively and efficiently.
Element II of the RTD Transit Agency Safety Plan (TASP) is Risk Management, which describes how
RTD identifies, evaluates, tracks, and mitigates risks and risk in the organization and on the transit
system. The risk management element and the processes undertaken by the agency are identified
and described in sufficient detail to be effectively undertaken throughout RTD. The acceptable risk
level and performance targets are established and documented.
Similar to a Plan – Do – Check – Act (PDCA) process, ORM is designed to be a continual effort to proactively identify and mitigate risk and to improve the data-driven, decisionmaking process within the agency. The management of identified risks is a
vital component of the RTD Operational Management System.
Risk is “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” internal or external to the
RTD system. An unacceptable risk is a condition that may endanger or
seriously harm human life, significantly destruct property or result in system
loss. This includes harm to customers, employees, contractors, equipment,
and to the general public. These risk conditions must be mitigated or
eliminated. Risks may be observed in the operating environment, through
procedures, during system modifications, while undertaking capital projects,
from investigations and audits, or operational changes.
The ORM Framework applies to all RTD employees and obligates everyone to constantly observe risks
in their work areas and report them to their safety committee, through a reporting process or to their
supervisor.
Decisions on risk should be informed to pursue the strategic priorities in the 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan:
•
•
•
•

Community Value
Customer Excellence
Employee Ownership
Financial Success

Principles/Goals
An integrated ORM Framework applies to the entire organization and demonstrates the inclusion of
risk in decision-making as defined in the Operational Risk Framework.
RTD employees understand risk as “the effect of uncertainty on objectives” and incorporate a
probabilistic approach in decision-making.
The Leadership Team (LT) commits to develop, implement, and utilize a uniform, evidence based,
ORM process that will effectively and efficiently achieve a common purpose, mission, and framework.
The LT is committed to:
•
•
•
•
•

Understanding risk in the context of the probability (likelihood) and severity (consequence) of
events that can or do happen
Using ORM to guide agency actions that support delivery of the agency’s objectives within
fiscal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical constraints
Being transparent about the potential tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance inherent
in all decisions
Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and processes in the
identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk
Making best use of RTD’s limited resources to meet its objectives

Any exceptions to this commitment must be documented as out of compliance and signed by the
General Manager and CEO with copies to the Chief Safety Officer. A copy of the ORM policy is
provided in Appendix A.
The continuous identification, monitoring, and mitigation of risk is key to an effective ORM. The RTD
ORM will be an ongoing process with the continual improvement goals of:
•
•
•

Increasing staff understanding of the process
Increasing use of ORM to make data-driven decisions
Improving quality and consistency of risk evaluation across the agency

1. Identify Risk
Identifying risks is the responsibility of all RTD employees and contractors. Risk identification should
be an ongoing process. Identification methods include, but are not limited to the following:
•
•

Observation, inspection, and interaction of all RTD employees and contractors
Reports from safety committee members, customers, customer service, and field personnel

Risk reporting by RTD employees is conducted through multiple methods. These include:
•
•

Directly reporting to their supervisor, safety committee or union representative
Submitting directly on the Hub, which is the agency’s intranet (click on blue safety person
link)

2. Evaluate Risk

Risk evaluation attempts to define what the risk means to employees, customers and/or the system.
The primary purpose of the risk evaluation process is to determine the elements of and reasons for
the risk with the purpose of eliminating or controlling it. The factors contributing to the risk should
be fully understood and evaluated by the employees or safety committees. Training will be required.
This understanding and evaluation will assist in determining the potential controls to put in place and
the effectiveness of the mitigation efforts.
As part of evaluating accidents and incidents, root cause analysis using the “Five Whys?”
methodology can be used to understand root causes and determine the most effective solutions to
mitigating risks.
Part of the evaluation of risk is to determine potential controls to mitigate the risk. There are five
basic steps to mitigating risk:
•
•
•
•
•

Design for minimum risk
Incorporate control devices
Provide warning devices
Develop procedures and training
Acceptance of residual/remaining risk

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.b

Packet Pg. 251

Potential controls, in order of effectiveness, are:
•
•
•
•
•

Elimination – remove the hazard
Substitution – replace of material or a process with another that is considered less hazardous
Engineering Controls – isolate people from the risk
Administrative Controls – training, signage
Personal Protective Equipment – clothing protecting the person

The costs associated with the potential controls must also be estimated or evaluated.

2.1

Assign Risk Owner

The RTD employee responsible for most closely mitigating, monitoring, and measuring the risk will be
identified and added to the Risk Register. The employee should be well informed of the risk, be at
the lowest /closest level of responsibility and have the authority to coordinate funding and or other
resources.

2.2

Safety Committee Structure

When a risk is identified, the local safety committee (e.g., Light Rail, Bus, Commuter Rail,
CyberSecurity, Safety & Environmental) will initiate the review and action. The local safety
committee will screen submittals for the difference between non-substantive complaints and
identification of true risks. The local safety committee will maintain the risk register, assign the risk
owner and work to evaluate, assess and mitigate (if required) the risk. If the risk requires mitigation
that exceeds the funding authority at this level, the risk will be elevated to the next higher-level
safety committee, the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee or ultimately to the Leadership
Safety Committee.
The Leadership Safety Committee is comprised of senior leaders of significantly affected
departments. The Leadership Safety Committee will meet monthly to review, assess progress, and
reallocate priorities of existing risks. Members include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

General Manager and Chief Executive Officer

3. Assess Risk

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.b

Assessing risk is the process of determining the severity of risk and the probability of the risk being
realized. In order to ensure that risk assessments are consistent, it is important to utilize a standard
definition. The detailed severity and probability definitions for various events and departments are
provided in Appendix C.
5

Packet Pg. 252

Severity is a quantitative or subjective measure of the worst credible mishap resulting from personnel
error, environmental conditions, design inadequacies and/or procedural efficiencies for system,
subsystem or component failure or malfunction. Severity is categorized as Catastrophic, Severe,
Serious, Limited, or Negligible.
Probability is defined as the likelihood of the number of times that a specific event will occur during
the planned life expectancy of a system. A risk probability may be derived from the analysis of a
transit system’s operating experience, evaluation of RTD safety historical data, or the analysis of
reliability and failure data. Probability is categorized as Frequent, Probable, Remote, Improbable or
Highly Improbable.

Using the determined severity and probability, the RTD risk assessment matrix is used to determine
the risk index. The risk ratings will be labeled as High, Serious, Medium, Moderate, and Low. The
required action to mitigate the risk will then be evaluated to apply the appropriate control measures
and/or mitigation actions.

RTD has adopted a system for assessing the level of risk to determine what action(s) must be taken
to correct or document the risk. This assessment system has been incorporated into the formal
system safety analysis, which enables the safety committees, as decision makers, to understand the
amount of risk involved in accepting the risk in relation to the cost (schedule, cost, operations) to
reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The required resolution action is based on the determined risk
level.
Risks that have been evaluated and ranked will be mitigated at the lowest feasible level. Mitigation
actions that exceed funding levels authorized at each level, will be elevated to the next higher level
for action.

5. Monitor Results
5.1

Risk Register

The safety team will assure local risk registers are used to track risks at the departmental level within
RTD. These registers are to be maintained within the department and are reviewed by the local
safety committee on a regular basis. Risks placed on the local register receive their initial and final
risk rating using RTD’s 25 box risk assessment matrix. Management may also present risks to the
local safety committee for risk ratings. Risk ratings may be changed when new information is
received or as a result of further data analysis.
All risk register entries require a mitigation plan (if risk resolution is required), tracking number, brief
description, projected completion date, and an initial hazard rating/initial risk rating (IHR/IRR) using
the RTD Risk Analysis Matrix. Risk Register format example is provided in Appendix D.
If requested, or required for complicated risks, a CAP will be developed by risk owner/department
managers in conjunction with the safety committees. The committees/risk owners will ensure that
the CAP process is followed and properly tracked until it is closed. CAP's may be tracked and sorted
separate from the risk register. When a CAP is closed the risk register will reflect this action with a
closed date.
CAPs include the following information:
•
•
•
•
•

Element of activity identified as deficient
Planned activities to resolve deficiency
RTD department responsible for implementing corrective action
Scheduled completion date for implementation
Estimated cost of implementation

5.2

Monitor and Measure

A regular schedule of reviewing the effectiveness of mitigation actions will be established. For risks
without mitigation measures, a similar evaluation schedule should be established to determine that
the risk remains low.
In addition to the risks, the ORM process will be regularly evaluated to determine effectiveness,
compliance, and potential improvements. Audits (internal and external) are an excellent means of
conducting this evaluation.

6. Report Outcome
RTD risks will be reported in compliance with regulatory requirements and as part of the feedback
loop to increase data-driven decisions and to enhance the confidence in the ORM process.

6.1

Public Utilities Commission (PUC) State Safety Oversight Agency
(SSOA)

Report to the PUC SSOA on a monthly basis those issues and risks required for reporting within the
PUC’s jurisdiction. This reporting will provide status of mitigations and progress towards closing out
CAPs.

6.2

Employees

Report to strengthen the Employee Reporting System and enhance RTD employee confidence in and
use of the ORM process. Reporting can include posting of risk registers with updated mitigation
status.

6.3

Joint Union/Management Safety Committee

Report to the Joint Union/Management Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety
committee, and on mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

6.4

Leadership Safety Committee

Report to the Leadership Safety Committee on high risks from each local safety committee, and on
mitigation actions requiring additional funding.

Effective risk management helps RTD to serve its customers, employees, contractors
and the District by ensuring that the agency achieves its success outcomes in
alignment with the following strategic priorities:

The Leadership Team is committed to:
•

Understanding risk in the context of the frequency (likelihood) and severity
(consequence) of events that can or do happen, in order to guide agency
actions that support delivery on the agency's objectives within fiscal, ethical,
regulatory, and other practical constraints

•

Being transparent about the tradeoffs between risk, cost, and performance
inherent in all decisions

•

Using clearly defined agency strategies, objectives, operational plans, and
processes in the identification, evaluation, mitigation, and acceptance of risk

•

Making best use of RTD's limited resources to meet its objectives

The Leadership Team implements these principles by:
•

Using the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan as its guide

•

Considering the effect of uncertainty on objectives (risk) in decision-making
and planning

•

Determining the root causes of the risks

•

Utilizing a uniform method of identifying, evaluating, managing, transferring,
and accepting risk

•

Including evidence-based input to make unbiased decisions

•

Proactively using evidence-based, repeatable processes

•

Effectively responding to risk in proportion to the expected frequency and
severity in action and investment

•

Actively reviewing results versus expectations to ensure continual
improvement

•

Sharing data across departments and using it ethically and competently

•

Creating a positive risk management culture to promote effective risk
management

Executive Summary

In 2016, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) mandated that every federally funded
transit agency in the United States must have a Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan in
place by October 2018. This iteration of RTD’s TAM Plan is the first required revision to the
TAM Plan under the prescribed schedule.
Thus the 2022 TAM Plan is the first required plan update since the introduction of the TAM
final rule. Each TAM plan has a four-year horizon, conforming to section 625.29 of Title 49.
TAM requirement nine mandates agencies to continually improve asset management
capabilities and to detail efforts to improve in the TAM Plan (Table 2). For this iteration of the
TAM Plan, the most notable improvement in asset management maturity has come by way of
actions from the General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson (GM/CEO) and Chief Financial
Officer Doug MacLeod (CFO). Together they have affirmed, through policy and
communication, the intention to make the agency Asset Management Plan (AMP) the sole
funding mechanism for non-emergency asset renewals and replacements. Further, the
GM/CEO and CFO have indicated that the AMP itself shall be improved by refining Asset
Information Maturity (AIM) to provide data and resulting information for decision-making. By
asserting that the AMP is the sole mechanism for asset renewals and replacements and
communicating that this process shall be a data-driven exercise, the GM/CEO and CFO have
the effect of making good asset management practice a required part of receiving funding for
renewals. As such, it is expected that RTD will have better alignment between the letter and
spirit of TAM regulation and agency practice. This work is also part of RTD’s Strategic Plan
and assures that TAM practice is aligned to agency goals and considered in the landscape of
objectives.
Though progress towards improving RTD’s asset management maturity and capabilities is
proceeding, it is apparent that RTD cannot achieve ISO 55000 certification within its current
capability and resources within the four-year timeframe of this plan. Though ISO 55000 has
been a central theme of prior agency TAM Plans, more fundamental issues concerning AIM
and Asset Management System (AMS) maturity need to precede an intention to seek ISO
55000 certification. It is the intention of the agency to utilize aspects of the ISO 55000
framework to design, implement, maintain, and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced AMS, based on plan-do-check-act principles.
RTD’s Accountable Executive, the GM/CEO, established an Asset Management Accountability
Team (AMAT) that has been charged with the responsibility of developing an AMS that is
compliant to regulation and advances the Strategic Plan. AMAT is made up of the Chief
Financial Officer (CFO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), Chief Administrative Officer (CAO),
and Assistant General Manager (AGM), Capital Programs. Though it has been communicated
in many forums that RTD would pursue ISO 55000, including prior TAM Plans, consensus and
commitment to the pursuit of ISO 55000 certification was not reached among the AMAT
members. As a result, the agency has been unable to identify a roadmap to certification and
decide upon a target date for improvements to be completed.

AMAT has been able to identify subordinate objectives, including an Asset Information
Maturity (AIM) improvement roadmap to address the information needs for a compliant AMS.
As such, AMAT has established three progressive improvement goals within AIM to guide
activities. These are:




Incremental improvements to AMP
Develop and use whole-life cost (WLC) models in decision-making
Create an “Optimized AMP” that utilizes cost, performance, and risk in data-driven
asset investment decisions

Led by the Safety Division, the agency has also made progress in developing an Operational
Risk Framework (ORF) that will be incorporated into the AMS. The ORF was developed to
satisfy requirements for the agency’s Safety Management System (SMS) and will serve as a
critical common link between the AMS, SMS, and potentially other management systems and
agency activities. The ORF is based on the ISO and American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) standards for risk management frameworks. It defines risk as “the effect of
uncertainty on objectives,” and utilizes the dimensions of frequency and severity to classify
hazards and identify the required actions to mitigate or accept risks according to the defined
and documented risk appetite of the agency. This important milestone will shape the
agency’s approach to asset management and will be incorporated into the AMS via the AIM
improvement efforts. It is expected that the ORF will become an important aspect of the
decision support tools required under section three of the TAM standard to produce the list of
prioritized investments required in TAM section four. (Table 2)
At the level of the Asset Stewards, those identified as having asset responsibility in the
agency, and the Asset Management Division (AMD), those responsible for administering
aspects of the AMS described in Appendix E other incremental improvements to the AMP
have been achieved, including improvements in equipment inventory highlighted in section
2.3.2 of this plan Initial work toward WLC models has been completed. In particular, one
WLC model is indicated to have been used in evaluating asset investment requests. The
organization has not made substantive progress toward developing cost, performance and
risk measures that are used as inputs in the TAM required decision support tools and
investment prioritization process. (Table 2)
A TAM plan is the cornerstone of asset stewardship. It is the public case for investment in the
assets to justify the use of tax dollars and fares to meet community requirements. It aims to
demonstrate the best use of funding to deliver services now and into the future. While the
agency has identified the need to take a different tack on developing a TAM-compliant AMS,
the agency is still committed to honoring the letter and spirit of the TAM regulation and the
laws from which the regulation is derived. This document communicates this commitment for
the agency, its planning partners, regulators including the FTA, and the communities that
RTD serves. Accordingly, this document summarizes:

RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be the trusted
leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to customers and community (RTD, 2021).
The communities RTD serves should know how the agency invests taxpayer dollars and how
decisions are made regarding the best use of limited resources. This is accomplished in part
through transparency in decision-making processes to sustain the condition and performance
of the assets.
The following table summarizes the agency’s response to each aspect of the TAM regulation.

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and
processes does RTD
use to prioritize
funding around those
assets described in its
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD prepares and updates a six-year Mid-Term Financial
Plan (MTFP) that includes projected capital construction and improvements,
service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs. The Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the input of asset
renewal and replacement needs into the MTFP. In RTD’s Financial plans,
approximately $120M annually is planned to fund asset renewal and
replacement needs for at least the period of this plan.

1.D.4.b

What is the result or
output of those
decision support tools
and processes?

The result of the decision support tools and processes described is the Asset
Management Plan. The prioritized AMP is the result of the prioritization process.
The funded/unfunded AMP is the intersection of the prioritized list of needs and
the funding allocated to replacements and renewals. The funded items are
included in the MTFP and budgets, while the unfunded items are retained in the
AMP and considered in future process iterations.

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding
principles for asset
management efforts at
RTD?

RTD adopted an asset management policy in June 2014 and most recently
updated in August 2022. The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD
manages assets henceforth - it is therefore forward looking in nature and
represents the agency’s vision and shared commitment for good asset
management. The AMS applies to the entire organization and directs the short,
medium, and long-term plans for assets to achieve the agency mission of
making lives better through connections.

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How is RTD going to
execute the TAM Plan?

RTD has identified a framework that is intended to move the agency from a
system reliant on judgement, perception and intuition to one that will be data
driven. A focus on improvements to asset information and incremental
improvements to the AMP to achieve that desired state. Processes around the
AMP are well defined and are completed annually.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

What activities does
RTD perform to
maintain its TAM
system?

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities: those ongoing asset
management activities performed as part of ‘business as usual,’ and those
activities specific to improving the AMS. TAM activities are the subset of these
activities targeting specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources are
needed to execute
TAM plan activities?

Personnel from across the agency are involved in asset management activities,
including GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division (AMD),
and Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications,
Planning, and General Counsel departments.
The AMD’s in-house expertise enables the agency to employ robust asset
management practices. A reduction-in-force associated with the COVID-19
pandemic resulted in the loss of some positions within the AMD, and a shift in
emphasis from ISO 55000 certification to more fundamental AMS improvements
has somewhat changed the structure of the AMD.

The current TAM plan provides the baseline for evaluating the agency’s future
plans. RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting
maturity targets in its Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP).
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements of
TAM and the agency’s strategic needs through the following measures:
 Measures identified in the Strategic Plan
 Assessments of adherence to the AMP process
 Regular AIM assessments and associated AIM improvement plans

1 Introduction
1.1

Background

On June 29, 2012, Congress passed the MAP-21 act. In accordance with section 20019 of this
law, the FTA established mandatory standards for all transit providers. The final implemented
regulation was published in the Federal Register on July 26, 2016, with an effective date of
October 1, 2016 (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016). As illustrated
in Table 2, RTD is a Tier I Agency, meaning all TAM requirements apply to the agency.
The FTA requirements for a TAM Plan are as follows:

Asset Management Policy

An Asset Management (AM) Policy is a documented commitment to achieving and
maintaining a state of good repair for all capital assets. The FTA has defined state of good
repair as “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at a full level of
performance” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database, 2016).
RTD’s Asset Management Policy was updated on August 11, 2022. The policy describes a
forward-looking commitment to good asset management practice, intended to pursue
investment optimization across the entire asset portfolio to maximize its value. Asset
management performed according to this policy will result in assets that are in a state of
good repair.
The latest version of the Asset Management Policy is included on pages 13 and 14 of this
document. This document is included as evidence of compliance with TAM requirement five
(5), and is the documented executive-level expectations for asset management in the
agency.

2 RTD and its Assets

The Regional Transportation District provides transportation services to 3.08 million people
located within its 2,342 square mile service area, such services include bus, rail, paratransit
services, demand-responsive microtransit services, and special event services. Though
operating a reduced schedule, RTD used these assets to provide over 46 million revenue
miles across all modes in 2021.

2.1

The RTD Story

The Colorado General Assembly created RTD in 1969. Efforts in early years
focused on regional transportation planning. In 1973, voters approved a 0.6%
sales tax initiative to finance a multi-modal transit system. At this time, RTD
acquired privately owned bus companies, improved service frequencies, and
expanded routes in several counties throughout the metro area. By 1976,
ridership had grown to 35 million boardings annually.

RTD celebrated its first light rail opening in October 1994. With a fleet of only
eleven light rail vehicles, the 5.3-mile line attracted hundreds of thousands of
customers when it began operations. Now, eight light rail lines service 57 stations
along seven individually constructed corridors.
In November 2004, voters approved the FasTracks ballot measure for the regionwide expansion of transit service. The 0.4% sales and use tax continues to fund the
FasTracks program, which has grown to include 122 miles of new commuter rail and light
rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit corridor, and numerous rail and bus stations. The program
consists of six new rapid transit corridors and three existing corridor extensions.

2.2

Service Area

The agency’s service area is composed of eight counties including all of Boulder, Broomfield,
Denver and Jefferson counties, large areas of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas counties, and a
small portion of Weld County.

Figure 4: RTD District Map

In 2000, RTD provided approximately 77 million passenger trips. (U.S. Department of
Transportation, 2000) By 2019, passenger trips grew to 105 million, a 30% increase in
boardings. Over the same period, per the Colorado State Demographer’s Office, the
Denver/Boulder region increased from approximately 2.4 million residents to approximately
3.2 million residents, a 31% increase (2019). Unsurprisingly, due in large part to the COVID19 pandemicthe agency experienced a severe decline in ridership in 2020, resulting in

approximately 52 million boardings for the year. (U.S. DOT, 2021) In 2021, the agency
reported approximately 49 million passenger boardings in as of yet unpublished National
Transit Database (NTD) submission. While ridership appears to be recovering, it is unclear
when utilization of RTD’s assets by customers will return to pre-pandemic levels.

2.3

RTD Assets

RTD is an asset-intensive organization. RTD’s Statement of Net Position notes that capital
assets total nearly $9.3 billion, excluding accumulated depreciation (Regional Transportation
District, 2021), of which most is within the scope of TAM as detailed in this section.
As assets are operated, their condition degrades over time, and their risk of failure increases.
Failures, including those having an impact on safety, can manifest in a variety of ways. Asset
condition is therefore a leading indicator for safety risks, and understanding asset condition
today, and how quickly it might degrade in the future, is an important aspect of good asset,
safety, and risk management. Organizations that understand their assets’ deterioration rates
can also make more informed decisions on renewal frequencies and their approach to
preventive maintenance. RTD’s commitment to improve AIM to support decision-making is
expected to include data on the frequency and severity of assets in accordance with the ORF.
For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD has categorized its assets in accordance with FTA
guidelines: revenue vehicles, equipment, facilities, and infrastructure, using the flowchart
depicted in Figure 5 below, adherence to which ensures repeatable results and an
improvement in inventory data quality.

RTD’s revenue vehicle fleet is composed of 1,454 buses, 201 light rail vehicles and 66
commuter rail vehicles. The operation and maintenance of bus vehicles is shared between
the agency and third-party contractors. The light rail vehicle fleet is exclusively operated and
maintained by the agency. The operation of sixty-six commuter rail vehicles is shared
between RTD and a third-party, Denver Transit Operators (DTO) and all maintenance
activities on the commuter rail vehicles are performed by DTO.
Transit vehicles in the agency’s rubber tire fleet include:






Standard 40’ fixed-route transit buses with a seated capacity of approximately 40
passengers, including battery electric bus (BEB) assets
Fixed-route articulated buses with 33% greater capacity than standard buses
Regional intercity coaches, such as those used for Flatiron Flyer service, built for
longer trips at highway speed, which are typically 45 feet long and have a seated
capacity of 55 passengers
Cutaways which are made by second stage manufacturers, using the chassis of fullsize vans, used to provide on-demand service for eligible customers with disabilities
(Access-a-Ride) and in areas where ridership does not support fixed route service
(FlexRide)

In service RTD buses have been procured from a variety of manufacturers including: Gillig,
BYD, New Flyer, MCI, Goshen, Eldorado, and StarTrans. Approximately 50% of standard and
articulated fixed route buses are operated and maintained by RTD, with the operations and
maintenance for the remainder outsourced3 to two external partner companies, First Transit
and TransDev. All intercity coaches are operated and maintained by RTD. All cutaway buses
are operated and maintained by third parties (Via Transportation, MV Transportation and
Evergreen Senior Center).

Light rail vehicles (LRV) are electrically powered using a 750-volt direct-current overhead
catenary system. Individual vehicles can be coupled together to form up to four cars per
consist, with a designed seated capacity of approximately 64 per car. LRVs can carry up to an
estimated 236 passengers per car utilizing the standing room. All light rail vehicles are
manufactured by Siemens and are acquired, owned, operated and maintained by RTD.

All of the Hyundai Rotem commuter rail vehicles maintenance is outsourced to DTO. RTD will
assume responsibility at the end of the contracted period of performance of 30 years.
Condition assessments will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes
additional responsibility for the vehicles.

Figure 11: Commuter Rail Vehicle (Hyundai Rotem)

RTD has historically managed its revenue vehicle inventory based on age: the vehicles are
procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years through a
preventative and repair maintenance program, and then replaced. This approach is adopted
for revenue vehicles maintained by third parties, including buses and commuter rail vehicles.
Table 3 below presents the total number of revenue vehicles for which RTD has capital
responsibility, along with their Useful Life Benchmark (ULB), which is the expected duration
in years that an asset will remain in service according to RTD’s standards and the expected
condition based on its age. The condition range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the vehicle
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. A vehicle that has
reached the end of its useful life benchmark is scored at 2.5 and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog. (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016). The percentage of
vehicles in backlog within each type is also presented. Table 3 also presents the total initial
capital cost4 of the vehicles in each sub-fleet. In the AMP, and certain budgeting and financial
tools, costs other than the total initial capital cost are used, such as the expected
replacement value in the plan year.
RTD’s bus fleet has been a focus of renewals, though some buses are now considered to be
in backlog. Based on a combination of funding availability and subject matter expert
judgements, some transit buses will continue to be operated in backlog.
Regarding the ULB for LRVs, RTD is presently re-evaluating the 40-year ULB that was
approved by FTA. There are several factors that differ from what was expected when the 40year ULB was proposed. Several key components have gone out of production or will soon
go out of production. The cost of some parts that are custom replacements for parts that
have ceased production by the original manufacturer is quite high and would lead to
increases in the WLC of the LRVs that are not manageable. Until that formal evaluation can

4 In the future, RTD intends to determine the WLC (e.g., capital expense and operating expense) of its assets and this will be
considered for inclusion in a subsequent generation of the TAMP.

take place and be submitted for review by FTA, RTD will continue to use the approved 40year ULB until such time as the process for restoring the 31-year ULB has been completed.
RTD’s LRVs vary in age, and only the oldest trains model year 1993 (eleven units) and 1996
(six units) SD-100 series would be evaluated for retirement in the near future with a shift
from the approved 40-year ULB to the standard 31-year ULB utilized by most agencies. This
represents only seventeen vehicles of the total 201 vehicle fleet and would not be expected
to affect RTD’s ability to deliver light rail service within the scope of the period of the TAM
Plan. This approach of using WLC modeling for making asset renewal decisions is a first for
RTD and is expected to set the tone for future asset renewals in the future.

Equipment

Significant improvements in equipment asset information have been made since the last
iteration of the TAM plan. The TAM Systems guidance was helpful in improving the agency’s
understanding of current and future expectations of equipment information in the TAM
framework. (U.S.DOT, 2020) While the present TAM requirements indicate equipment
inventories must contain assets that cost $50,000 or more, RTD’s Accounting department
defines an asset as an asset of $5,000 or more with at least a one-year useful life. Capital
asset tags are assigned to equipment assets noted as being an asset in the Fixed Financial
Assets (FFA) register managed by Accounting. Additionally, assets in the equipment class
have importance significant enough to be managed in Trapeze Enterprise Asset Management
(EAM) system. Assets managed in this way are deemed to have special importance to
continued service delivery. At least one of the three criteria above must be met in order for
equipment to be considered an asset in the AMP. Presented in this plan are those assets
included in the AMP and which need to be described in sections three and four of the TAM
requirements. Were the agency to only report on the decision tools and the prioritized list of
investments with the $50,000 threshold, the explanation of what has and will occur would be
incomplete. Given a desire to ensure alignment of agency activities, and to provide
transparency in agency processes, the equipment inventory information presented in this
TAM Plan is guided by the requirements for the AMP, which staff believes to exceed the
requirements outlined in the TAM regulations.

1.D.4.b

In order to improve the AMP, the AMD worked closely with asset stewards across the agency
to conduct physical inventories of assets. This is viewed as a step forward in improving

Transit Asset Management Plan 2022

information maturity for assets in this class. Expanding both the number of items included
and the quality of the information therein. It is expected that this effort will facilitate
improved management of equipment assets in the future. In addition, RTD will be able to
share more information on equipment assets with its planning partners in the TAM Plan.
Equipment information will continue to include non-revenue vehicles in a manner conforming
to the three NTD categories, which are automobiles, truck and other rubber tire vehicles, and
steel wheel vehicles. Asset information for non-revenue vehicles has been more mature than
for other equipment assets, so no change in how the non-revenue vehicle assets has
occurred for this iteration of TAM reporting. These assets have long been included in the AMP
process.
The inventory of non-revenue vehicle equipment is found in Table 5. This provides detail on
the 48 automobiles, four steel wheel non-revenue vehicles, and 377 rubber tire non-revenue
vehicles in this equipment group. Additional information includes the initial capital cost of the
assets along with the useful life benchmark (ULB), and a score representing the condition of
the equipment based on its age. The score range is from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates the asset
is significantly beyond its useful life benchmark and 5 is considered new. An asset that has
reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is considered in
backlog. RTD uses the FTA definition for non-revenue vehicle backlog, which is the
percentage of vehicles that have met or exceeded their useful life benchmark. A non-revenue
vehicle that has reached the end of its ULB is scored at 2.5, and from that point onwards is
considered in backlog (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2016).

RTD has historically managed its non-revenue vehicle equipment inventory based on age; the
equipment is procured, maintained in a state of good repair for a specified number of years
through preventative maintenance and repair, and then replaced.5 As such, condition scores
for non-revenue vehicle equipment are age-based. However, the agency has departed from
planning for age-based renewals of assets in this category while an examination of the
utilization and utility of these assets is underway. Until such time as a new means for
evaluating the utilization and performance of assets in this class, and particularly vehicles
used primarily for administrative purposes, it is the expectation that few renewals will take
place within this class of equipment and vehicles will be knowingly operated in backlog.

Non-vehicle equipment is purchased from a variety of manufacturers and is owned, operated
and maintained by RTD. Non-vehicle equipment consists of various types of machinery used
indirectly in the provision of public transportation services. There is a broad range of assets
reflected in Table 6, from in-plant equipment, to parts management equipment, to
landscaping equipment. A more detailed equipment asset inventory can also be found in
Appendix H. Non-vehicle equipment information gathering exercises are expected to continue
uncovering assets for inclusion into the AMP and TAM Plan within the four-year horizon of
this plan.
Non-vehicle equipment represents a wide variety of assets and are not managed in a uniform
way. While the efforts to improve inventory have yielded results, additional information on
non-vehicle equipment assets will need to be matured in order to develop an effective
management strategy by equipment type. Additional information on ULBs and/or EULs will
also need to be developed to ensure the accuracy of equipment lifespan estimates collected
from third-party resources to ensure that RTD is using the equipment in a manner similar to
those used in establishing the ULB. Strategies other than age-based approaches will require
additional maturity, such as collecting and utilizing data on engine hours in replacement
planning. Within the period of this plan, it is expected that the inventory will further increase
and that an age-based approach to management will be the most common method employed
for asset replacement.

Facilities

For the purposes of this TAM Plan, RTD owns:





Five administration facilities where RTD administration functions occur
Nine maintenance facilities where maintenance work occur
121 public facilities, which includes stations, buildings and other structures where
customers can board or alight from an RTD transit vehicle
114 conveyances such as elevators and escalators, installed within facilities (these are
treated here separately based on NTD reporting requirements)

Administration, maintenance, and public facilities for which RTD has capital responsibility are
operated and maintained by RTD, although some services, such as cleaning and snow
removal, may be contracted to third parties. Conveyance manufacturers include Kone and
ThyssenKrupp, and conveyance maintenance is outsourced to third parties.

Figure 16: Bus Maintenance Facility

RTD has historically managed its facilities and their related equipment on a reactive basis,
i.e., the practice has been to maintain or replace the assets when they fail. The more critical
facility elements, such as underground storage tanks, can have redundancy built in to
minimize service interruptions when they fail to perform as designed.
Since 2015, RTD has performed in-house assessments to determine the condition score of
individual elements of each facility for which RTD has capital responsibility. As such, facility
condition scores are assessment-based. This is based on the Transit Economic Requirements
Model (TERM) scale and is utilized for both TAM and NTD reporting.

6 The agency has not yet been able to determine an appropriate estimated useful life (EUL) for all equipment types. Further
refinement of EULs is expected.

Figure 19: Conveyance (elevator)

Conveyance inspections are outsourced to third parties in accordance with applicable
legislation and regulations but are not used to determine condition. These assets are
managed on an age-based approach consistent with regulatory standards. Both preventive
and reactive maintenance activities are performed by third parties, and the activities
delivered under these contractual agreements are monitored by RTD staff to ensure contract
adherence and acceptable performance of the assets.
Table 8 presents the total number of facility assets for which RTD has capital responsibility,
along with their EUL and a score representing the condition of the asset. The table provides
backlog for each asset, for which RTD uses the FTA definition for facilities backlog, the
percentage of facilities with a condition rating below 3.0 on the FTA Transit Economic
Requirements Model (TERM) scale (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2018).

Infrastructure

RTD’s rail infrastructure can most easily addressed in three parts, directly operated light rail,
third party operated commuter rail, and directly operated commuter rail.
RTD owns light rail infrastructure including grade crossings, catenary wire segments, track,
relay cases, switches, and substations, as well as light rail vehicle bridges, and commuter rail
alignments operated and maintained by a third party.

Figure 20: Light Rail Vehicle Bridge

Light rail infrastructure is purchased or constructed
by a variety of manufacturers and is owned,
operated, and maintained by RTD. RTD has
historically managed light rail infrastructure assets
based on age but did perform condition
assessments of select light rail infrastructure for
three years. In doing so, RTD determined that agebased condition scores provided similar levels of
accuracy as assessment-based condition scores,
and so has stopped performing condition
Figure 21: Track Infrastructure
assessments. As such, light rail infrastructure
condition scores are age-based (Regional Transportation District, 2017).
Seventy-seven light rail vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by RTD. Seven light rail
vehicle bridges are owned and maintained by third parties. Light rail vehicle bridges are
inspected once every two years by an independent third-party contractor per state law.
Defects noted in inspections are then addressed through a combination of in-house and
contracted resources, as determined by RTD staff. Though inspection data is obtained from
the third-party the inspection methodology does not conform to the TERM scale. Condition
assessments for bridges owned and maintained by third parties are not recorded in the
TAMP. As a result, the agency relies on age-based scores to communicate the condition of
assets to planning partners.
All commuter rail infrastructure is delivered under the FasTracks program. The operation of
the A, B, and G lines, as well as all commuter rail electrical power substations is outsourced
to DTO. RTD will assume ownership for these commuter rail infrastructure assets at the end
of the contracted period of performance (30 years from inception). Condition assessments
will not be performed on these assets until such time as RTD assumes capital responsibility.
In 2020, RTD opened a directly operated commuter rail line, the N Line. This directly
operated commuter rail infrastructure added to the diversity of RTD’s rail assets and is noted

separately from light rail assets and in more detail than the third-party controlled assets in
the inventory.
Tables 11 and 12 present the total number of light rail infrastructure assets for which RTD
has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and age-based condition and backlog scores.
Table 13 presents the total number of light rail and directly operated commuter rail vehicle
bridges for which RTD has capital responsibility, along with their EUL and assessment-based
condition scores.
Table 14A represents the number, EUL, and age-based score for key directly operated
commuter rail assets.
Table 14B represents the original directly operated commuter rail assets as reflected in the
Fixed Financial Assets records.
Table 15 represents the directly operated commuter rail track by type, noting the differences
in EUL between the types and relevant age-based scores.
Tables 16 and 17 represent the FTA performance measure for infrastructure which is the
percentage of guideway directional route miles (DRM) with performance restrictions by light
rail and commuter rail by class, respectively. However, RTD anticipates that the guideway
under performance restriction measure may not be an adequate measure of condition for rail
infrastructure assets in the future (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2017).
There are many reasons why rail infrastructure assets would be placed under a temporary
performance restriction such as routine maintenance, the presence of inspection personnel in
the right of way, or police activity at or near crossings. These reasons provide no indication
of the condition of the assets. Additionally, track assets that are in very poor condition but
that exist in a high-density urban environment may not have a performance restriction
because the design speed is low in such areas. The age of these assets along with physical
inspections will likely be more useful for investment decisions; consequently, RTD also
provides age-based condition and backlog scores for light rail infrastructure assets.
RTD’s first light rail line opened in 1994; assets of that era, with an EUL of 25 years, are
currently shown in backlog in Table 11. However, this may not reflect the true condition of
the assets. Major repairs to assets, such as replacement or refurbishment of components,
renews the life of those assets, such improvements have not been reliably recorded in a
system of record. The Asset Management Division is working with Light Rail Maintenance of
Way and Capital Programs Department to improve asset information and to begin recording
major repairs of assets in a system of record for reporting, compliance, and planning
purposes.
Tables 11, 12, and 13 also present the total initial capital cost for each light rail asset type.

performed to improve the inventory quality, but there are incongruences between different
information resources. The costs are commensurate with the level of the capital program,
which are not easily disambiguated to the level of the asset counts by type. To present the
best currently available estimates, directly operated commuter rail assets are presented
separately in tables 14A and 14B. While the information presented in this plan is believed to
be accurate, further refinements are expected to support improvements to the AMP for these
assets.

3 Current Capital Investment Decision Process

The capital improvement component of RTD’s fiscal policy states that “On an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update a six-year Mid-Term Financial Plan including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the
capital and operating programs.” (Regional Transportation District, 2016)
The MTFP also provides the basis for the agency’s application for federal transit funding
through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional
Council of Governments (DRCOG). The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the
region that receive federal funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the
qualifying MTFP projects are included in the TIP.
The current renewal and replacement capital investment decision process begins with the
agency AMP. The AMP is a process, as well as a product (Fig. 22) The AMP begins with
information from systems of record, primarily Trapeze EAM and the Fixed Financial Assets
list, but also includes ad-hoc resources such as manual inventories in spreadsheets and

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.b

Packet Pg. 299

Capital Programs initiatives not tied to specific assets. This collection of information is used to
create an “Initial AMP” which is prepared for asset stewards. The asset stewards then assess
the age-based information and apply their judgement to determine whether to accept or
modify the results of the initial AMP, this is known as the validated AMP. This stage is also
where asset stewards augment information on “fact sheets” that are prepared by the AMD
using the information from the system(s) of record with additional information which will
assist other stewards in appropriately prioritizing the funding requests among other requests.
The prioritized AMP is the result of the annual evaluation of information from the validated
AMP requests by a panel of asset stewards. Each fall the Asset Management Working Group
(AMWG) is convened where asset stewards use the information available to them in the
validated AMP stage to prioritize requests. This results in the prioritized list of investments
shown in Table 20. The prioritized AMP is then compared to available funding for asset
renewals and replacements. Funded requests become part of the budget in the MTFP and the
remainder of the renewal and replacement requests remain in the AMP process for
consideration in future iterations of that process. The AMP process is illustrated in Figure 22
and the relationship of each AMP cycle to the MTFP is shown in Figure 23.

4 List of Prioritized Investments

The output of the current capital investment decision process is a list of prioritized capital
projects. For 2022-2028, the requested renewal and replacement needs are shown in Tables
20A-20G. For ease of presentation, each year of prioritized investments is presented
separately.
Reflecting the annual budget cycle only items in the approved budget are truly funded,
though funds are planned for asset renewals and replacements in the scope of this TAM Plan.
As the agency’s AMP is focused on the renewal and replacement of existing assets, only the
prioritized renewal and replacement needs are reflected in the TAM Plan. Other investments
such as those required to comply with laws, regulations, and legal judgements are
considered obligatory and are addressed outside of the AMP prioritization process.

5 Improving Asset Management Capabilities at RTD

As an agency with a 53-year history, RTD has not experienced the decaying infrastructure or
immediate funding shortages that many legacy and larger transit systems have. Historically,
RTD has had the necessary funding in place and the professional expertise to maintain its
transit assets in a state of good repair while meeting the growing demand for service.
However, as mentioned in the executive summary, RTD’s backlog of existing assets is
growing and will experience swells of assets achieving their respective EULs, such as those
from pre-FasTracks expansion activities including the original light rail alignment known as
the Metro Area Circulator (MAC) or Central Corridor, the Southwest light rail alignment, the
Southeast rail alignment that was a component of the T-REX project, and the Central Platte
Valley (CPV) extension. The asset renewal and replacement needs are expected to be $453M
for the 2022-2028 planning period (Figure 25). Presently the AMP records reflect a funding
need of over $187 million for 2022, which is largely accounts for the backlog for assets in the
scope of TAM. (Figure 26) The actual funding needs are likely higher due to assets out of
scope of TAM, assets that have yet to be recognized in the AMS, and uncertainty around the
infrastructure and facilities needs that result from a lack of controlled and available asset
information on which to formulate data-driven plans. The known unfunded needs by asset
type are summarized in Figure 27.
RTD’s asset management maturity improvement initiative was not initially driven by a
growing set of decaying assets, but rather by the expansion of the asset base in recent
years. Beginning with the T-REX project and continuing with the current FasTracks project,
over the past 16 years RTD has invested over $6.4 billion on new rail and bus rapid transit
service.
The funding for the most recent expansion projects did not make sufficient provision for the
long-term maintenance and capital renewal of the new assets. Without a solid, long-term
renewal plan in place, with funding earmarked, the risk of a growing backlog of renewal
projects without adequate funding is too great to be unaddressed. In 2022, the agency
identified funding needs over a long-range planning horizon and determined that funding of
at least $120 million annualized would be required to address the state of good repair needs.
A growing backlog for any transit agency increases risks to safety, service, and future
sustainability; it feeds a pattern of expensive reactionary repair and remediation tasks. The
AMP process and available funding are tools to ensure the future viability of the assets and
position the agency for providing value to the customers and community the agency serves.
RTD is preparing an AMP that addresses future funding needs for existing assets, prioritizing
renewals over enhancements. The original cost of assets is less useful to the agency than
projected future costs. Therefore, RTD’s efforts emphasize creating accurate and increasingly
precise estimates of the investments that are needed over the coming budget planning cycle.
Improvement in AIM will facilitate the agency’s ability to forecast costs, estimate performance
consequences, and understand risk to achieving strategic objectives.

The AMP will determine which assets are included for renewal or replacement in the
investment prioritization process. The projected funding needs over the period 2022-2028 are
illustrated in the graphs that follow.

Strategic Asset Management Plan

RTD aims to comply fully with MAP-21 requirements for transit asset management and
beyond. It has developed an overall Strategic Asset Management Plan (SAMP) to summarize
its strategy to improve asset management over the next period.
From 2004, with the publication of BSI PAS-55, and then ISO 55000 in 2014, organizations
have been able to exploit a standardized good practice framework for implementing an
aligned AMS. This approach to utilizing an existing asset management framework is a best
practice and is still a focal point for the SAMP.

Transit Asset Management Plan 2022

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.b

Packet Pg. 309

Typically, organizations begin with a focus on asset information, particularly the inventory of
all their assets and assessing asset condition. This information supports clearer planning,
because this allows the organization to fully assess its assets and their condition. The
intended result is not just a clear plan to cover all the assets but is rather a prioritized and
optimized plan based on understanding the risks to objectives and using this to make the
best use of limited resources.
RTD has invested heavily in developing improved inventories and processes to deliver the
AMP, with a particular emphasis on improving inventory information which includes what the
assets are, but also their in-service date, EUL, and cost to round out information needed for
generating an AMP. As discussed elsewhere in this plan, information improvements to
facilitate decision-making for assets is also addressed in the goals set by AMAT and reported
in the SAMP.
The current strategy is to focus on continued improvement of the AMP through AIM
improvement initiatives, utilizing principles of good asset management and tools derived from
ISO 55000 standards, though the agency will not seek certification within the four-year scope
of this TAM Plan. The SAMP is due to be revisited and it is expected that the adjustments
from being focused on ISO 55000 certification to an approach more centered on fundamental
activities that improve the AMP by enhancing AIM.

5.2

Key Annual Activities

RTD identifies two types of asset management activity: those ongoing asset management
activities that RTD performs as part of “business as usual,” and those activities specific to
furthering the development and improvement of the AMP. TAM activities are the subset of
these targeting the specific TAM elements, and these are shown in a third section below.
“Business as Usual” Asset Management Activities
As an asset-intensive organization, RTD already performs a number of asset management
activities on a routine basis, and these will continue to improve through the TAM Plan
horizon.
This section summarizes those “business as usual” activities, using the Institute of Asset
Management’s Conceptual Model for Asset Management (2015) to categorize into six main
blocks. This should not be interpreted to imply these ongoing activities are all necessarily well
aligned or integrated at present.

Figure 31: The Institute of Asset Management (IAM) Conceptual Model for Asset Management

The Planning department periodically conducts demand analysis for its
transit service and uses this to support long-term strategic planning for
system optimization, expansion and enhancement. At present, strategic
planning for capital renewals and maintenance volumes is not formally performed, though
RTD anticipates the need to enhance its capabilities in this area through the development of
asset class strategies and an AMP (see next section for details). Although not yet a “business
as usual” activity, in undertaking the development of this TAM Plan, RTD has embarked on
asset management planning.
RTD’s current approach to capital investment decision-making is
described in Section 3, and this activity is performed annually to
develop the MTFP. Operations and maintenance decision-making is
performed within each asset owner group but does not currently formally consider or align
with agency objectives.
Ongoing activities include capital project processes for asset
acquisition, which is split between the Capital Programs Department for
commuter rail and facility assets and the Operations Department for
rail, bus and rail infrastructure assets. Maintenance delivery occurs for
each major asset class and includes preventive and corrective maintenance, along with
condition assessments where warranted. Some asset classes have a larger focus on
preventative maintenance, while others have more emphasis on corrective maintenance and
maintain assets when they fail. Most maintenance delivery is performed by staff, with some
being outsourced. Asset operations are a significant part of RTD’s ongoing activities, and
includes bus, rail, equipment and infrastructure operations, some of which are also
outsourced. Improved asset information and a focus on aligning to strategic objectives will
facilitate more effective resourcing strategies that ensure the resources to meet strategic

objectives are allocated. RTD also performs shutdown and outage management of its assets
to enable maintenance access. As assets develop operating faults, the agency implements its
fault and incident response plans in accordance with agreed methods.
RTD uses several asset information systems to manage its Asset
Information, including Trapeze EAM for asset inventory and
maintenance management, and the Oracle Enterprise Business Suite
for related financial information. Other systems including Bentley
Optram and Railroad Software have been added to address the specific requirements of light
rail maintenance of way and directly operated commuter rail maintenance of way (commonly
referred to as North Metro). However, these systems have not been fully integrated into
organization processes.
There are several basic data and information management processes in effect, including
regular reporting to the NTD, and regular data quality assessment and cleansing processes
for Trapeze EAM information. The Asset Management Division employs a data science and
analytics team to support designated asset stewards with collection, management, and
analysis of non-physical data. This group also performs data assurance tasks on corporate
data and performs all FTA TAM report preparation activities.
The RTD data science and analytics team also administers the asset information maturity
(AIM) process, having designed the framework, administered assessments, and provided
significant consultative guidance in the development of AIM improvement plans and
professional support in the execution of many analytics tasks within the plans.
RTD applies procurement and supply chain management principles for
its outsourced asset management functions. These include the capital
delivery of its FasTracks program, along with some ongoing operations
and maintenance of the assets the program delivers. The operation
and maintenance of approximately half of RTD’s bus services is outsourced to two service
providers, and the maintenance of certain facility assets, such as elevators, is also
outsourced.
RTD’s Finance department uses standard accounting practices to
perform asset costing and valuation, including their valuation and
deprecation of assets over time. Integration of the ORF into AIM
improvement plans, in the renewal/replacement requests and more
broadly into other operational plans is expected within the period of this TAM Plan.

Asset Management System Activities

In addition to the ongoing asset management activities described above, RTD also has
activities defined as part of its 2021–2026 Strategic Plan. The strategic plan identifies the
objective to “[d]esign, implement, maintain and continually improve a functioning, effective,
adequately resourced management system for all physical assets, based on plan-do-checkact principles,” and to “[c]reate and manage the asset management plan to provide a

prioritized list of the agency's asset needs for annual budgeting and the mid-term financial
plan.” (RTD, 2021)
These strategic objectives presently require improvements in AIM to enhance the AMS and
AMP, and therefore much of the AMD’s resources are aimed at delivering information
maturity improvements over the scope of this TAM Plan.

5.2.2.1 Design an Asset Management Organization

This includes the implementation of an AMS that meets the agency’s strategic needs: the
framework to define and manage the key elements, including a policy, strategy and risk
management framework, with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

5.2.2.2 Asset Management Planning

This includes the development of asset class strategies and an AMP as key elements of an
investment planning process.

5.2.2.3 Improve Rigor and Control

This implements improved control over core asset delivery and financial activities and
includes improved information to aid in accurate and precise financial planning to meet the
agency’s strategic needs, not limited to those items with a particular asset management
focus in the strategic plan.

5.2.2.4 Assurance and Performance

In order to deliver on the AMAT goal of achieving an Optimized AMP, an improved
performance management framework aligned to measure those things most critical to
delivery of the agency’s strategic plan will be required. It is not anticipated that a unified
organization-wide asset performance framework will be delivered within the scope of this
four-year TAM Plan. However, improved asset performance measures may be a component
of AIM initiatives in the coming years.

5.2.2.5 Enhance Asset Information

This is centered on the development and implementation of an AIM framework, including
definition of RTD’s information requirements and the strategies employed for meeting them,
along with clear governance for asset information. Without changes in organizational
structure, it is not anticipated that a unified, organization-wide asset register will be delivered
within the scope of this four-year TAM Plan.

5.2.2.6 Learning and Communication

This is to support the embedding of asset management awareness, culture and
competencies, and includes a training needs analysis and a program of appropriate asset
management training, as well as communication to raise awareness of asset management
throughout the organization, and the development of an appropriate asset management
culture.

Staff resources from across the agency are involved in RTD’s asset management activities,
including the GM/CEO, the Leadership Team, the Asset Management Division, and the
Operations, Capital Programs, Finance, Administration, Communications, Planning, and
General Counsel departments.

Business as Usual Asset Management activities

The resourcing strategy for the “business as usual” annual asset management activities will
continue with the current strategy, i.e. resourcing the activities through the agency
departments that currently perform or are involved in them.

Asset Management System Activities

The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan requires the establishment of a functioning, effective,
sufficiently resourced management system for assets. The resourcing strategy is to establish
clear accountability and responsibility for the Asset Management System, with the authority
to direct and allocate resources being granted to the accountable group. The diagram below
illustrates the accountability structure and other contributors.

Figure 32: ISO 55000 Contributing Resource Groups

In late 2011, RTD assigned two employees the task of building an Asset Management
Division (AMD). The Division would eventually be responsible for improving the management
of assets and building an agency-wide AMS.
To ensure the most accurate, non-biased information possible, the Leadership Team
determined the AMD should be independent of the asset delivery functions.
According to Chris Lloyd, asset management leadership and culture expert: “Strategic Asset
Management calls for risk-based decision making, cross-functional working, and long-term

thinking. It needs clarity on competence requirements and accountability and honesty about
performance” (Johnson and Lloyd, 2012).
The AMD was recently placed in the Finance department to facilitate greater alignment to
supporting the agency’s financial planning needs through delivery of the AMP processes and
products. More details are in Appendix F.
The AMD staff possess a wealth of asset management expertise, as a number of its
employees transferred from other areas of the agency, bringing with them significant
knowledge of agency operations, experience in maintenance of many asset classes, physical
asset business analysis, and/or data science. External hires provided additional subject
matter expertise, knowledge, skills, and abilities.

TAM Activities

The resourcing strategy for the TAM activities is not only to define an accountable executive
for all TAM requirements but to assign TAM responsibilities to the AMD. Supporting resources
from other agency departments will be utilized and consulted or informed on an as-needed
basis. Details of both the accountable executive and the AMD are in Appendix E.

6 Evaluation Plan
6.1

TAM Plan Evaluation

The TAM Plan will be evaluated on degree of compliance when RTD receives each triennial
audit.
However, the plan is intended to do more than meet compliance. It is a statement of
intentions and commitment to deliver the culture, policy, and procedural changes necessary
for the improved efficacy and efficiency of transit agencies that is implied in the regulations.
This TAM Plan provides a baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans produced by the agency.
RTD intends to regularly review its asset management maturity, setting maturity targets in its
SAMP. This document will also serve as a basis of comparison to peer agencies, allowing RTD
to learn from other TAM Plans to identify where improvements can be made.
RTD will annually evaluate its performance against the previous cycle’s TAM Plan
improvement goals and agency objectives with documentation and explanation of progress
(Regional Transportation District, 2021).



Accountable Executive – A single, identifiable person who has ultimate
responsibility for carrying out the safety management system of a public
transportation agency; responsibility for carrying out transit asset management
practices; and control or direction over the human and capital resources needed to
develop and maintain both the agency's public transportation agency safety plan, in
accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5329(d), and the agency's transit asset management plan
in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 5326.
Asset Information Maturity (AIM) – This consists of a framework, an assessment,
AIM plans, and updates to the Asset Management Accountability Team on progress
towards stated objectives in plans. The framework that includes a six-stage model
indicating relative maturity that are mutually exclusive based on the availability of
information, the quality of data in its utility for decision-making/planning, the
presence or absence of a documented plan/procedure for the development and
utilization of data suitable for decision-making/planning, whether or not documented
plans/procedures are followed and monitored for adherence, and whether a ‘plan-docheck-act’ cycle of continuous improvement is applied to tune information and plan
quality to achieve organization objectives. The inventory consists of 24 items based
on ISO 55000 clauses 7.5 and 7.6 regarding information and its control. The plans are
signed documents available on the RTD intranet.
Backlog – State of Good Repair backlog is representative of the reinvestment cost to
replace any transit assets whose condition is below the midpoint on TERM’s 1 (poor)
to 5 (excellent) scale, or 2.5 for assets using age-based replacement or renewal
strategies including rolling stock, equipment, and infrastructure. For facilities,
condition inspections resulting in a score of 3 or less on the TERM scale shall be
considered to be in backlog.
Base System – Base System refers to RTD’s assets not included in the FasTracks
system. The Base System is supported in part by a 0.6% sales and use tax. Base
System funding and FasTracks funding are tracked separately.
Capital Responsibility – Transit agencies are required to report condition
assessments for assets that they own or jointly own with another entity, that they are
responsible for replacing, overhauling, refurbishing, or conducting major repairs on
that asset, or for which the cost of those activities is itemized as a capital line item in
the agency's budget.
CDOT – Colorado Department of Transportation.
Consist – A set of railroad vehicles forming a complete train.
Contracted Service – A contract for services is a formal, legally binding agreement
between RTD and a private company to provide service delivery.
Data Driven Decisions - The process of making organizational decisions based on
actual and verifiable data rather than intuition or observation alone. The approach
includes problem solving where a well-defined set of actions are driven by decisions
which are further driven by insights (extracted from data) using sound methods.
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) – Denver’s metropolitan
planning organization (MPO). https://drcog.org/

Direct operated and purchased services – Direct operated services are those
services provided by RTD staff using RTD assets. Purchased Services are those
operated under contract on behalf of RTD using outside staffing. See also Contracted
Service.
Estimated Useful Life (EUL) – The Estimated Useful Life indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is agency-defined as opposed to FTA
established Useful Life Benchmarks. At the end of useful life of the asset, major
renewal or replacement is expected.
FasTracks – FasTracks is a ballot initiative that levied an additional 0.4% sales tax
for expansion of the RTD system. FasTracks introduced commuter rail service as well
as a Public Private Partnership (P3) to the system.
ISO 55000 – The international standard covering management of assets of any kind.
Prior to the establishment of this standard, a Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS55) was published by the British Standards Institution in 2004 for physical assets. The
ISO 55000 series of Asset Management standards was formalized in 2014 and is
composed of three parts:
o ISO 55000:2014 Asset management – Overview, Principles and Terminology
o ISO 55001:2014 Asset management – Management Systems – Requirements
o ISO 55002:2014 Guidelines for the Application of ISO 55001
Leadership Team (LT) – Agency leaders who hold the title of Chiefs and/or Assistant
General Managers that lead departments and/or operating modalities
MAP-21 – MAP-21, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (P.L. 112141) was signed into law by President Obama on July 6, 2012.
Mid-Term Financial Plan or MTFP – A portion of RTD’s total budget not already
committed to specific capital projects and not apportioned to ongoing operations and
maintenance that is evaluated and prioritized through a process described in Section 3
of this document.
National Transit Database – A federal reporting program for transit agencies
receiving Federal Transit Administration (FTA) funding, which serves as a primary
repository for all transit-related data and statistics in the United States. The
performance data from the NTD is used to allocate FTA funding and to report on
public transit performance to Congress and researchers.
State of Good Repair – “The condition in which a capital asset is able to operate at
a full level of performance.” (Transit Asset Management; National Transit Database,
2016)
TERM – Transit Economic Requirements model is a tool used by the FTA along with a
numeric code that represents the categorization of assets, as indicated in the TERMLite model.
Useful Life Benchmark (ULB) – The Useful Life Benchmark indicates the expected
duration in years that the asset will remain in service under normal operating
conditions and maintenance. This metric is established by the FTA as opposed to the
agency-defined Estimated Useful Life metric. At the end of useful life of the asset,
major renewal or replacement is expected.

Appendix B: SGR Master Condition Rating Definitions for
RTD
RTD follows the FTA guidance on condition ratings. This rating is based on how close an
asset or component is to replacement or major overhaul. Scores will not have a greater
granularity than a half point.
An asset is in a State of Good Repair if the score is greater than (2.5). Refer to individual
asset group Inspection Standards Documents for confidence in reliability and specific
examples.
Confidence in Reliability = Remaining Useful Life
5.0) New or like new, 95% to 100% confidence in reliability; no visible defects, no damage, cosmetically
looks new. An asset is only new once, after rebuild some old parts are not new and therefore the highest
score after rebuild is (4.5).
4.5) The inspector is 90% to <95% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
4.0) The inspector is 80% to <90% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Shows minimal
signs of wear, no major defects, and some minor defects with only minimal signs of deterioration.
Cosmetic defects/minor wear.
3.5) The inspector is 70% to <80% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
3.0) The inspector is 60% to <70% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Some
moderately defective or deteriorated components; expected maintenance needs. Cosmetically ‘fair’ but
all devices are functioning as designed.
Small repairs or minor refurbishment.
2.5) The inspector is 50% to <60% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
2.0) The inspector is 40% to <50% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset near
overhaul or retirement, but in serviceable condition. Asset has increasing number of defects or
deteriorated component(s).
Significant or multiple repairs needed.
1.5) The inspector is 30% to <40% confident in the reliability of the component/asset.
1.0) The inspector is less than 30% confident in the reliability of the component/asset. Asset is in need
of major repair or refurbishment, multiple minor defects or major defects. Evidence of corrosion may be
apparent; major or numerous minor areas of damage or structural issues.
Safety concern, critical damage, close to or time for overhaul or replacement.

their time between tasks associated with the AMP process and AIM initiative
o FTE requirements for other RTD resources necessary for TAM activities are not
defined in this generation of the TAM Plan
Technology resources: the technologies are used to support asset management
across the agency. RTD’s aim is to use the tools it already owns, rather than invest in
new ones at this time.
o Hardware and software necessary to support:
 Multiple source software systems – e.g. Trapeze EAM, Oracle EBS
 Data warehouse – provides aggregation and integration of data
 Analysis and reporting tools – Power BI, Access, Excel, SPSS and
others
Financial resources
o Financial resources necessary to support asset management ‘business as
usual’ activities, TAM and ISO implementation. Beyond these, RTD has not
defined any requirement for further resources for this generation of the TAM
Plan.

Appendix E: Asset Management Roles and
Responsibilities
1. Accountable Executive – a single position with ultimate accountability for Asset
Management and the Asset Management System within RTD. This is the General
Manager and Chief Executive Officer.
2. Asset Management Accountability Team (AMAT) – this group has formal
accountability delegated from the Accountable Executive for the delivery, embedding,
review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System. The group is
comprised of the Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Administration
Officer, and Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs.
3. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) – reporting directly the Accountable Executive, the
CFO chairs AMAT. This position is critical to developing an asset management culture.
In this role the CFO ensures the alignment of asset management initiatives to
strategic objectives. By having a robust understanding of agency needs, this
individual can guide the agency in the development, implementation and maintenance
of an AMS that enhances agency capabilities. This individual also ensures adequate
resourcing for the AMS overall, and the AMD.
4. Asset Management Division – the AMD is responsible for the design, delivery,
embedding, review and continual improvement of the Asset Management System’s
(AMS) products, processes and information. The AMD manages the AMP and AIM
initiatives. The Asset Management Senior Manager reports to the Chief Financial
Officer.
5. Other RTD resources – as needed, other RTD resources will be utilized, consulted
or informed regarding the AMS. This could include operations, maintenance, finance,
safety, human resources, communications, IT, capital programs, legal, and
procurement staff. The AMAT will allocate these resources directly when within their
reporting line or via a request to other members of the Leadership Team when they
are not.
6. External resources – RTD will also utilize external expertise to develop the internal
asset management competencies of both the AMD and other RTD resources involved
with the AMS. The alternative to this is to be continually reliant on an external entity
to supply expertise indefinitely. By having actions guided by both an established asset
management framework and interactions with consultants, RTD intends to cultivate
an AMD capable of acting as an internal consulting service to the agency. The
intention is to ‘own the process, not the product’ as it relates to functions and
competencies that will become annual activities for the AMD. Additional external
resources will also be utilized to deliver aspects of the AMS, specifically the operations
and maintenance of approximately half of the bus fleet and a large portion of the
commuter rail system.

Light Rail System Description

The RTD light rail system was designed as the first piece of a planned regional rapid transit system. In 1989, the Colorado
Supreme Court declared that the Denver metro area Regional Transportation District was eligible to collect a use tax that
enabled the District to accumulate funding of $67 million for construction of a rail system.
The project was approved by DRCOG (Denver Regional Council of Governments) in 1991. Construction on the initial 5.3-mile
rail system and a functional operations facility began without federal funding or an increase in local taxes in October 1992.
Safety Certification and Construction of the light rail system was completed by the end of September 1994, and the system
opened for revenue service with 11 light rail vehicles on October 7, 1994. Additional lines, facilities, and vehicles were added
in subsequent years with voter support, as detailed below.

I 5.1.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the light rail system is regulated by timetables. Light rail transit currently carries roughly 40,000
customers daily. Trains operate as one-, two-, three-, or four-car consists. Revenue service is generally available 21 hours
per day.
The Regional Transportation District’s objective is to operate the light rail transit system safely, reliably, and efficiently and
to integrate light rail operation with bus service for the greatest convenience to the public. This is the means by which the
integration of transportation services could assist the region in meeting clean air standards, alleviating traffic congestion,
and improving the overall quality of life of the area.
Light rail service operates on the existing 5.3-mile Central Corridor, the 8.7-mile Southwest Corridor, the 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley Spur, the 19-mile Southeast Corridor, the 12.1-mile West Rail Corridor, the 10.5-mile I-225 Corridor, and the 1.6mile Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). The system has six operating lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.

I 5.1.2

Organizational Structure

The light rail transit safety specialist’s office is located at the Elati Light Rail Operations and Maintenance center. Thus, the
lines of communication between safety and light rail operations are effective. Key positions with light rail operations are:
•

Assistant General Manager, Rail

•

Deputy Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations

•

Senior Manager, Rail Operations, Planning & Systems

•

Business Program Manager

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Transportation

•

Manager of Rail Service Delivery

•

Manager of LRV Operator Training

•

Manager of LRT Operations

•

General Superintendent of Infrastructure

•

Manager of Light Rail Maintenance of Way

•

General Superintendent of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

•

Manager of Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance

Light Rail Corridors

Central Corridor
Passenger service on the Central Corridor Light Rail system began October 7, 1994. The system is operated by Denver’s
Regional Transportation District as part of a fully integrated mass transit system, which includes local bus routes, express
bus routes, regional bus routes, shuttle bus routes, and demand-response service for disabled customers.
The Central Corridor comprises 5.3 miles of trackway with 13 stations, including three ark-n-rRde locations. The Central
Corridor operates at grade level except for one fly-over structure for grade separation at Kalamath and Santa Fe. An initial
fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) were procured for the operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service,
six additional LRVs were ordered.
The Central Corridor begins at I-25 and Broadway on the southwest end and terminates at 30th Avenue and Downing
Street. The corridor provides direct connections between the I-25 and Broadway Station transfer facility, Broadway
Marketplace, Auraria Campus, Colorado Convention Center, and the 16th Street Mall (Market Street, Civic Center, and Union
Station transit stations), Five Points, and many major hotels and businesses in between.
Major attractions within a short walking distance of the Central Corridor stations or the 16th Street Mall shuttles include the
Denver Center for the Performing Arts complex, federal courthouse, 17th Street Financial District, U.S. Mint, Tabor Center,
State Capitol, Denver Art Museum, Denver Public Library, History Colorado Center, Larimer Square, and Coors Field.
Light rail vehicles are operated manually. Automatic block wayside signals, traffic signals, radio communication, operational
procedures, and train orders govern operators regarding all vehicle movement. Appropriate street traffic signals, speed limit
signage, and wayside signals assist the operator in selecting proper movement sequence and speeds. City operations are
by line of sight. All city street crossings are governed by coordinating adjacent street intersection traffic signals, while the
at-grade crossings at 13th Avenue and at Bayaud are governed by gates with flashers and warning bells. The crossings at
13th Avenue and at Bayaud are jointly used and maintained by Union Pacific Railroad and RTD.
Station platforms are unattended and utilize automated fare equipment for ticket sales and ticket validation. Transit Security
Officers (TSO) monitor the proof of payment honor system. Roving rail supervisors, contracted security officers, and local
police departments provide platform security.
A 2.5-acre yard and the Light Rail Mariposa Facility is located adjacent to the Southern Pacific Railroad switching yard near
6th Avenue at 655 Mariposa Street. Powered switches on the double track mainline provide access to and from yard leads
at either end of the storage yard, allowing access from ladder tracks into the shop. The Light Rail Mariposa Facility includes
a yard for vehicle storage and a maintenance facility for vehicle maintenance and system support maintenance. Central
Control is located on the second floor of the facility and is the operational governing authority for all mainline vehicle
movement. Central Control personnel (controller/supervisors) direct, control, and monitor revenue-service operations
using radio, telephone, and public address communications. Mainline operations are controlled by a schedule timetable
and directed by Central Control in accordance with established operating schedules, rules, and procedures. Controllers
implement all corrective actions necessary to maintain service schedules and to minimize adverse impacts of equipment
failures, emergency situations, or weather-related problems. In addition, some unit repair, facility maintenance, and nonrevenue maintenance occurs at RTD’s District Shops location.
The corridor begins on the south end with I-25 and Broadway Station. I-25 and Broadway station provides a major bus and
light rail transfer point and is a junction for the Southwest, Southeast and Central corridors. From Broadway proceeding
north a short distance is Alameda Station. After leaving Alameda Station, trains pass through Bayaud crossing and then
ascend the Santa Fe/Kalamath flyover structure, returning to grade as the alignment passes the Mariposa facility before
entering 10th and Osage Station. From 10th and Osage, trains pass through the 13th Avenue crossing and then either travel
downtown (Central Corridor) or to the Central Platte Valley (CPV) Corridor. Continuing northeast on the Central Corridor
is Colfax at Auraria Station, which allows direct access to the Auraria Campus via a plaza and a bus transfer point. After
leaving Colfax at Auraria Station, the double track alignment proceeds across Kalamath Street and Speer Boulevard,
crossing a bridge structure over Cherry Creek along Stout Street to Convention Center Station near 14th and Stout streets.

At 14th Street, the inbound track turns east and then north to travel along California Street. The outbound track runs along
Stout Street between 14th and 19th streets. Two passenger stations are located on Stout, one at 16th Street and one at
18th Street. The inbound track along California Street travels in an automobile traffic contra-flow direction from 14th to 19th
streets, servicing the 16th Street and California passenger station located on the 16th Street Mall, then continuing on the
single track northeast bound to the next passenger station, at 18th Street on California.
The alignment turns southeast on 19th Street, where it joins the track to Welton Street and where the double track travels
east on Welton Street to the 20th Street and Welton Station, located between 19th and 20th streets on Welton. The double
track alignment continues as it crosses over to the south side of Welton near 20th Street to 24th Street. Between 24th
and 25th streets, the double track configuration transitions into single track. The single-track alignment is retained as it
continues northeast on Welton and proceeds to the 25th Street and Welton Station, located near 26th Street. Traveling
northeast along the alignment, the trackway approaches the 27th Street mini station located between 27th and 28th
streets, then transitions back into a double track configuration as it enters the 30th Aand Downing northern terminus station.

Southwest Corridor
The Southwest Corridor opened for revenue service in July 2000. It is an 8.7-mile extension of the Central Corridor light
rail system from I-25 and Broadway in Denver to the end-of-line station at Mineral Avenue and Santa Fe Drive in Littleton. It
includes five light rail stations: Evans, Englewood, Oxford•City of Sheridan, Littleton•Downtown, and Littleton•Mineral. Each
station location has an associated Park-n-Ride, with the exception of Oxford.
The Southwest Corridor is a double track alignment operating in high-speed territory at a maximum speed of 55 mph. The
corridor consists of mixed-use operations including three freight railroad mainline tracks, two light rail tracks, and Santa
Fe Drive on the west side of the corridor. The entire corridor is grade-separated with the exception of a pedestrian-freight
spur crossing at the Evans station. Traditional active grade crossing equipment and signals including warning bells, lights,
and gates control this crossing. The light rail tracks parallel the freight mainline tracks throughout the corridor. To enhance
patron use, the light rail corridor resides on the east side of the freight rail corridor from I-25 and Broadway to Tufts Avenue,
and on the west side of the freight corridor from Tufts Avenue to Mineral Avenue. Two flyover structures accommodate
grade separation between freight railroad and light rail tracks: one near Tufts Avenue, where the east/west transition
occurs; and one near Iowa, where the light rail tracks cross the Iowa freight spur track.
Leaving the I-25 and Broadway station southbound, the tracks cross over Mississippi Avenue on a bridge and continue
south to cross over Iowa Ave on another bridge. Shortly after crossing Iowa Avenue, the alignment rises on the Iowa flyover
structure to pass over a freight rail spur track coming from the mainline on the west side of the light rail tracks. Once the
trackway returns to grade, the tracks pass under Evans Avenue and enter the Evans station. Continuing south from Evans
station, the mainline right of way passes the Elati Operations Facility and yard before crossing a bridge over Dartmouth
Avenue and into Englewood Station. Trains leave Englewood Station southbound and cross the bridge over Hampden
Avenue and continue to Oxford Station. From Oxford Station south, the alignment passes over Oxford Avenue and then
climbs the Tufts flyover structure that transitions light rail from the east side of the freight track mainline to the west side.
Descending off the flyover, the alignment passes over Belleview Avenue on a bridge before entering a below grade cut and
Littleton•Downtown Station. Continuing south from the station, the track climbs from the cut to grade and continues to the
end-of-line Littleton•Mineral Station.
An additional 14 light rail vehicles were added to the existing fleet to accommodate the extension. The light rail vehicles
are Siemens Duewag SD100 and SD160 models, the same used for the Central Corridor. The Mariposa maintenance facility
was expanded to accommodate the fleet size increase. All operational characteristics for the Southwest Corridor are similar
to the existing operational characteristics of the Central Corridor. Since service origination of the Southwest Corridor, 18
additional SD 100s have been placed into revenue service.

1.D.4.b

Central Platte Valley
The Central Platte Valley (CPV) corridor is approximately 1.8 miles in length, linking the existing Central Corridor light rail
line at Colfax Avenue to Denver Union Station. This is a double track alignment along the entire corridor, including the CPV
junction.
Packet Pg. 350

The CPV corridor begins at approximately Colfax Avenue and Rio Court (the location where the existing Central Corridor
light rail lines curves to the east under the Colfax Avenue viaduct). The alignment generally follows Curtis Street from Colfax
Avenue to west of 5th Street, on the western edge of the Auraria Campus. At this point, the alignment turns north and
parallels 5th Street and enters Auraria West Station. From there, the alignment crosses Walnut Street and enters Empower
Field at Mile High Station. From there the alignment parallels the Consolidated Mainline (freight), to the Ball Arena•Elitch
Gardens Station, then continues north and ends at Denver Union Station. Stations are located at the new administration
building of the Auraria Campus (Auraria West); near the existing “Sports Walk” that serves Empower Field at Mile High
Station near the stadium; at the pedestrian bridge serving Ball Arena and Elitch Gardens; and Denver Union Station.
The alignment has two at-grade crossings: 5th Street and Walnut Street, which include active warning devices for control
and safety considerations to mitigate impacts to traffic and pedestrians in these areas.
During major events, such as professional sports games and concerts at Ball Arena, Coors Field and Empower Field at Mile
High, special service will be provided with trains running as frequently as every four to five minutes between the event
venue and the Southwest and Southeast Corridors. Some of these special event trains may terminate at the I- 25/Broadway
station while other will continue to the Littleton•Mineral and RidgeGate Parkway end-of-line stations.

Southeast Corridor
The Southeast Corridor began revenue service in November 2006. It consists of 21 miles of double-tracked light rail
transit, beginning at the existing Broadway station and ending at RidgeGate Parkway Station. This includes an alignment
along I-225 in the median, from I-25 to Nine Mile Station at Parker Road. There are 16 stations: Louisiana•Pearl; University;
Colorado; Yale; Southmoor; Belleview; Orchard; Arapahoe at Village Center; Dry Creek; County Line; Lincoln; Sky Ridge;
Lone Tree City Center; RidgeGate Parkway; Dayton; and Nine Mile. All facilities, including RTD trains, stations, pedestrian
and bicycle facilities, and other design elements, are in full compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
With the Southeast Corridor expansion, the Elati Light Rail Operations facility and yard were constructed at 2701 S. Elati
St. This was a necessity to accommodate the more than doubling of light rail vehicles and associated support needs that
accompanied the system expansion. North and south yard leads were cut into the existing Southwest corridor mainline
track just north of Dartmouth on the south and a short distance south of Evans station on the north. In January of 2006, the
Elati facility became the new operations center and the Mariposa facility became a heavy maintenance and repair shop,
while still maintaining the Control Center on the second floor.
The Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) opened for revenue service in May 2019. This extended double track rail service 1.6
miles from the former end-of-line station at Lincoln to the new end-of-line station at RidgeGate Parkway. Two additional
stations, Sky Ridge and Lone Tree City Center, are located on the extension.

Broadway to Colorado
The Southeast Corridor alignment begins with a wye connection south of the existing Broadway station, allowing vehicles
from the Southeast Corridor to access both the Southwest Corridor and existing light rail line to central downtown.
Following the wye tracks, the alignment rises above grade to pass over Broadway on an aerial structure. After crossing
Broadway, the alignment turns to the south along the southbound I-25 on-ramp and drops down to match the grade of I-25
and into Louisiana•Pearl station. This allows the LRT alignment to pass under the cross streets, maintaining a 17-foot vertical
clearance above the top of rail. Through the Narrows (Broadway to University), the alignment parallels I-25 between I-25’s
collector distributor road and Buchtel Boulevard. The tracks generally pass behind the abutment of the highway bridges
through a separate light rail bridge structure and enter University Station.

Colorado to Evans
At Colorado, the alignment follows the Colorado Boulevard off-ramp and travels under Colorado Boulevard in a short tunnel
section. After passing under Colorado, the alignment remains below grade in an open trench section, enters Colorado
Station and again parallels I-25. After leaving the station, it passes under Evans in a tunnel section.

Evans to Union
After passing under Evans, the alignment rises to return to the highway grade, running adjacent to the highway into Yale
Station. At Yale Avenue, the alignment runs along the edge of the Yale ramps and passes over Yale on an aerial structure.
South of Yale, the alignment follows along the west side of I-25 to Hampden Avenue. At Hampden, the alignment enters a
very short tunnel section under Hampden, returns to the I-25 grade on the south side of Hampden, and enters Southmoor
Station.
Continuing south, the alignment passes under Quincy and then travels along the western edge of the I-25/I-225 freeway
interchange. Special track work at this location allows for a wye connection to the light rail alignment located along I-225.
These connecting tracks are primarily at-grade and pass below the I-25/I-225 interchange.

Union to Arapahoe Road
Proceeding south from the I-225 wye connection, the alignment passes under Union Avenue along the west edge of I-25.
After passing under Union Avenue, the alignment continues south into Belleview Station. After leaving the station, it travels
along the ramps and over Belleview on an aerial structure. Continuing south from Belleview, the alignment runs adjacent to
I-25 to Orchard Station, where it again shifts out along the ramps and then over Orchard Road on an aerial structure. South
of Orchard, the alignment returns to the west edge of the highway into Arapahoe at Village Center Station. From the station
continuing south, the alignment rises to pass over the three west side ramps and Arapahoe Road on a long aerial structure.

Arapahoe Road to RidgeGate Parkway
South of Arapahoe Road, the alignment continues adjacent to the I-25 shoulder to Dry Creek Station. From Dry Creek
Station, the alignment travels adjacent to the ramps and over Dry Creek on an aerial structure. After passing Dry Creek,
the alignment returns to the I-25 shoulder to County Line Road, where it rises up to pass over two ramps and County Line
Road on an aerial structure. After passing County Line Road and the ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange, the
alignment runs along the west edge of I-25 into County Line Station. South of the station, the alignment enters the C-470/
E470 interchange.
Through the C-470/E470 interchange, the alignment travels under the ramps in short tunnels and over C-470, around the
western side of the interchange ramps and then adjacent to I-25, where it continues south into Lincoln Station. After leaving
Lincoln Station, the alignment continues south and passes over Lincoln Avenue on an aerial structure and then turns east
into Sky Ridge Station. The lone at grade crossing on the Southeast Corridor, Trainstation Circle crossing, is at the south
end of Sky Ridge Station. The alignment then crosses over I-25 on an aerial structure and turns south into Lone Tree City
Center Station. From the station, it continues over RidgeGate Parkway on an aerial structure and into the end-of line-station.

I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road
The alignment along I-225 begins at the I-25/I-225 interchange, where it connects to the I-25 alignment through a wye
connection, allowing light rail vehicles to connect to both the northbound and southbound lines on the I-25 alignment. After
the wye connection, the alignment travels in the I-225 median at the highway grade. The alignment continues in the I-225
median into Dayton Station. From Dayton Station, the alignment continues east into Nine Mile Station at Parker Road.

1.D.4.b

The corridor operates with similar characteristics as existing corridors, including traction power substations and signal
systems. A SCADA system is included in the Southeast Corridor project and is retrofitted into the existing system.
Additionally, an automatic trip stop system was added to stop trains if they bypass a red signal.
Packet Pg. 352

West Corridor
The West Rail Line is a 12.1-mile light rail transit corridor that began revenue service in April 2013, extending from Denver
Union Station to the Jefferson County Government Center. The alignment runs through Denver, Lakewood, and Golden.
The West Rail Line has 12 stations: Auraria West, Decatur•Federal, Knox, Perry, Sheridan, Lamar, Lakewood•Wadsworth,
Garrison, Oak, Federal Center, Red Rocks College, and Jefferson County Government Center•Golden.
The alignment is double track from Denver Union Station to Federal Center Station and is single track from Federal Center
Station to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station. Total travel time from Denver Union Stationto Jefferson
County Government Center•Golden is 35 minutes. The corridor operates similarly to existing RTD light rail corridors.
Starting from Denver Union Station, the alignment travels to the Ball Arena•Elitch Gardens Station, Empower Field at Mile
High Station, and Auraria West Station.
Departing from the Auraria West Station, the alignment passes through the Central Corridor and CPV junction and curves
south under Colfax Avenue, where it crosses over the Consolidated Main Line (CML) on an aerial structure. The alignment
turns to the west on this structure before returning to grade and passing under I-25. From the I-25 viaduct, it continues west
through the Zuni Street at grade crossing and over the South Platte River on a bridge structure. After it crosses the river, it
passes through the Decatur Street at grade crossing and into Decatur•Federal Station.
From Decatur•Federal Station, the train continues west on the alignment under the Federal Bridge, following Lakewood
Gulch through the Knox Court crossing into Knox Station. Leaving Knox Station, the alignment curves south towards 10th
Avenue, following Dry Gulch and continuing west to the Perry Street crossing and Perry Station. The alignment continues
west through a gated crossing for the bike path at Wolff Street and into Sheridan Station under Sheridan Boulevard.
Departing Sheridan Station, the alignment curves north to run alongside 13th Avenue and west through Harlan crossing into
Lamar Station. Traveling west through the Lamar, Pierce, and Teller crossings, the track then ascends an aerial structure into
the next station, Lakewood•Wadsworth. Leaving Wadsworth station and descending the bridge, the alignment continues
west through Carr Street and Estes Street crossings and into Garrison Station.
Continuing west, the alignment passes through Garrison Street and Independence Street crossings, passes over the Kipling
Street Bridge, then proceeds through the Oak Street crossing into Oak Station.
From Oak Station, the alignment curves south at Quail Street and Collins Avenue crossings and follows Simms Street to the
8th Avenue crossing before passing over 6th Avenue on the 6th Avenue Bridge. It then continues south through the North
Avenue crossing and turns west into Federal Center Station. Some trains turn back here to return to Denver Union Station,
utilizing the pocket track, while others continue to the Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station.
Departing Federal Center Station and continuing to Jefferson County Government Center•Golden Station, the alignment
curves north and becomes single track prior to passing through the 4th Avenue crossing. The alignment continues to 6th
Avenue, turns west and proceeds through the Union Boulevard tunnel, and continues west along the south side of 6th
Avenue into the Red Rocks College Station, where it splits into double track.
Departing Red Rocks College Station, the alignment becomes single track again and continues west along 6th Avenue. The
alignment curves north and then back west as it crosses the Indiana Street Bridge flyover to the north side of 6th Avenue,
where the alignment continues. It goes through the tunnel under I-70, passes over Colfax on an aerial structure, then
proceeds through the Ulysses Street and Earl Johnson Road crossings before entering one of three tracks at the end-of-line

I-225 Rail Corridor
The I-225 project added 10.5 miles to the light rail system within the city of Aurora, providing key regional connections to
the East and Southeast rail lines. Construction on the full line began in 2013. This light rail line opened for service to the
public in February 2017 as the R Line, and it features eight stations: , Florida, Iliff, Aurora Metro Center, 2nd Ave•Abilene,
13th Ave, Colfax, Fitzsimons, and Peoria. This corridor extends light rail service north from Nine Mile Station to Peoria
Station, where customers can connect to commuter rail to access Denver International Airport.
Packet Pg. 353

I 5.1.4

Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)

The RTD Light Rail System includes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. The SCADA system
provides two types of general functions: control over certain system elements from the Central Control Center, and system
monitoring and status information to the Central Control Center. The SCADA system allows light rail controllers certain
capabilities such as remote control to power down sections of the alignment and control over power track switches. It also
provides information to light rail controllers on the status of certain elements of the light rail system and train information.
SCADA information includes train locations, switch alignments, power status, signal status, and a variety of additional
system information.

I 5.1.5

Light Rail Vehicles

The RTD light rail vehicle fleet consists of two models from Siemens: the SD 100 and the SD 160. The vehicles are very
similar and have two main differences. The SD 160 has an AC propulsion system and sliding plug doors, whereas the
SD 100 has a DC propulsion system and bifold doors. An initial fleet of 11 light rail vehicles (LRVs) was procured for the
operation of the Central Corridor. Shortly after opening for service, six additional LRVs were ordered. As ridership grew, so
did the system beyond the Central Corridor, triggering orders of new LRVs. The SD 100 model is the original RTD vehicle,
and there are 49 of these vehicles in the fleet. The SD 160 was originally ordered for the Southeast Corridor extension: 68
were delivered, with an additional 55 vehicles ordered for FasTracks, the first of which arrived in August 2009. An additional
29 SD 160 vehicles were ordered in July 2018. RTD now has a total fleet of 201 vehicles. The LRVs are 6-axle, singlearticulated, double-ended, bidirectional, high-floor vehicles. They are approximately 80 feet in length, 8 feet and 9 inches
in width, and 13 feet high, and they operate on a standard railroad track gauge of 4 feet and 8 ½ inches. They are powered
by 750 volts of direct current from an overhead wire and capable of speeds up to 55 mph. Each vehicle can seat 48 to
56 passengers and accommodate up to 61 additional standing passengers at normal loads. Additional standees may be
accommodated at a crush load capacity. Exhibits shows the vehicle layout and critical exterior measurements to maximize
the level of comfort with which customers are afforded for their trip. In addition, light rail vehicles are equipped with HVAC
and good lighting configuration.

I 5.1.6

Operations

The Operations Control Center, which underwent a major remodel to accommodate the system expansion and SCADA,
governs the operation, control, and dispatch of light rail vehicles. Control maintains contact with the train operators by
means of a radio located in each light rail vehicle cab. Light rail operators also carry a portable radio to be used in case they
have to leave the cab or there is a radio failure. Controllers/supervisors rove throughout the system during operations. Their
role is to provide support and coordination between Central Control and light rail vehicle operators during an emergency
or upset in the system that may require a manual block operation, bus bridge, evacuation, or accident response and
investigation.
Current operations consist of six lines: D, E, H, L, W, and R.. The D Line extends from Littleton•Mineral Station to 18th and
California Station. The E Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Denver Union Station.. The H Line extends
from Florida Station to 18th and California Station. The L Line is a downtown loop between 14th and Stout streets and
30th•Downing Station. The W Line extends from Jefferson County Government Center•Golden to Denver Union Station.
The R Line extends from RidgeGate Parkway Station to Peoria Station. Typical headways vary from 5 to 15 minutes during
peak operations with increased service operated for special events. Early morning or late night headways on weekends
and holidays are typically 30 minutes.
In the case of an accident or a breakdown of the system, the Control Center controls train movement using a manual block
system. When necessary, bus shuttles are used to move passengers around a trouble area.

Commuter Rail Service

The owner of RTDC, which is the Regional Transportation District (RTD), has a concession agreement with Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) LLC for the operation and maintenance of the current RTDC commuter rail lines and vehicles. Denver
Packet Pg. 354

Transit Operators (DTO), under this agreement, is responsible for performing all services connected with the operation and
maintenance of the concession agreement. The lines operated by DTP comprise the East Corridor (University of Colorado A
Line), Northwest Electrified Segment (B Line), and Gold Line (G Line).
Revenue service began in September 2020 for an additional commuter rail line, North Metro (N Line). RTD employees
perform all operations and maintenance on the N Line.
Denver Union Station is the hub for multiple transportation modes in the Denver metro area. Services operating on the
East Corridor, Northwest Electrified Segment (NWES), Gold Line, and N Line terminate at Denver Union Station, which
also accommodates Amtrak and other heavy rail. The N Line operates out of Denver Union Station. DTO is responsible
for dispatching all commuter rail trains in and out of Denver Union Station and for maintaining the infrastructure within the
station.
The East Corridor (A Line) is a 22.8-mile segment running from Denver Union Station to Denver International Airport with
six intermediate stations. The Northwest Electrified Segment (B Line) extends 5.5 miles north from Denver Union Station
to Westminster. Two B and G Line stations share a portion of the track. The Gold Line (G Line) is an 11.2-mile line that runs
west from Denver Union Station to Ward Road in Wheat Ridge with six intermediate stations.
The Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF), located at 5151 Fox St. in Denver, is the central control center for Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). This facility has a rolling stock maintenance shop, warehouse, administrative offices, and storage
yard, including a car wash.
The North Metro (N Line) has six stations, four of which have pedestrian crossings. This 13.8-mile corridor includes six
highway grade crossings and 11 bridges.
Commuter rail is regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and is subject to FRA rules, regulations, and
inspections. Hours of operation are generally 3 a.m.–1:30 a.m.

I 5.3

Bus Operations System Description

The Regional Transportation District was created by an act of the Colorado General Assembly in 1969 and became an
operating unit on July 1 of that year. The purpose of creating this agency was to provide a regional approach to public
transportation.
On January 1, 1974, RTD began collecting a half percent sales tax and became fully operational. RTD initially inherited 321
buses from Denver Metro Transit.
Many of these vehicles were over 20 years old. Total bus mileage was 9 million miles per year, with fewer than 20 million
customers annually.
Only one maintenance and storage facility existed for buses. There was little or no maintenance capacity for buses in the
small system operating in the District. These systems served several local areas and there was a private Denver-Boulder
bus line.
RTD began building a modern bus fleet and its needed support facilities. In 1975, the six fragmented bus systems that had
provided service to different areas of the District were integrated into a single, unified system. New and improved service
became the focal points for future growth.
The improved service included the extension of routes; new local and express routes; more frequent service; new nighttime
service on many routes; increased service to the mountain areas of the District; exclusive bus lanes; and the inauguration
of special service for the elderly and disabled. Meeting special needs made RTD the first transit system in the nation with a
comprehensive bus program to serve the needs of the elderly and disabled. All of these factors led to a significant increase
in ridership.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

1.D.4.b

To support and encourage new customers, RTD also launched a program to establish Park-n-Ride facilities. Additional bus
maintenance and storage facilities were acquired to accommodate the growing bus fleet.
Packet Pg. 355

The 16th Street Mall bus service became operational in 1982. This was the first step in a unique transit concept, which would
pull 50 percent of the buses off downtown streets during peak hours and provide opportunities for additional suburban
service.
In 1994, RTD partnered with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to add High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV)
lanes from I-25 to US 36, allowing regional and express routes running along US 36 and I-25 to downtown Denver to
bypass congestion around the Turnpike Tangle.
In 2016, RTD began operating the Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service along US 36 and the I-25 HOV lanes,
seamlessly connecting Boulder and Denver. Later that year, RTD began operation of 36 BYD K10MR all-electric buses on
the 16th Street Mall, making it one of the largest electric bus fleets in the nation. The District has evolved into a transit
system that has a service area of 2,342 square miles. It serves 40 municipalities in all or part of eight counties. The system
comprises 148 routes. The fleet currently has 1,011 buses, of which 434 are leased to private carriers. There are currently
four maintenance and storage facilities Districtwide, 77 Park-n-Rides, and six transfer stations.

I 5.3.1

Scope and Service

Regular service of the fixed route bus transit system is regulated by timetables and varies between peak and off-peak
hours, weekends, weekdays, and special events. The bus system transports an average of 200,827 weekday boardings.
Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station are the main transfer stations in the downtown Denver area.

I 5.3.2 Organizational Structure
The bus transit safety specialist’s office is located at RTD headquarters, at 1660 Blake St. in Denver. Key positions within
bus operations are the assistant general manager of bus operations, deputy assistant general manager of bus operations,
general superintendent of bus transportation, , general superintendent of bus maintenance, and general superintendent of
street supervision, Manager of contracted service, and business program manager. All of these key positions have regular
contact with the bus transit safety specialist.

I 5.3.3 Bus Transportation Operations
Dispatch governs the operation, control, and dispatch of buses and other RTD vehicles. Dispatch maintains control with
bus operators by means of two-way radios, standard telephones, and Global Positioning System (GPS). Street Supervisors
also carry portable radios in the event of a system failure. Street Supervisors rove throughout the system during operations.
Their role is to provide support and coordination between dispatch and bus operators during an emergency, accident
response and investigation, rerouting, or other bus-related issues.
Bus transportation Operations is responsible for providing safe, reliable, and efficient service to all areas served by our
mass transit system. This is accomplished by scheduling bus service from three operating divisions with732 full-time and 93
part time bus operators. Service is provided seven days a week over approximately 21 hours of each day.
Street supervisors monitor service and performance of bus operators to ensure the safe, efficient, on-time delivery of
scheduled bus service. The district also provides continuous evaluation of routes, schedules, bus stops, shelters, and
facilities to determine the effectiveness and condition of service and amenities.
Effective, two-way radio communication is provided to all revenue and non-revenue vehicles. Information is received and
relayed to the proper sources to provide assistance and coordination for bus operations. Communication is provided
through the radio system, telephones, and a state-of-the-art tracking system.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
In recognition that disasters can occur at anytime and can have far-reaching impacts, RTD has
developed the following Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) to guide response activities and
ensure effective and efficient coordination. It enhances the District’s ability to help prevent,
prepare for, respond to, recover from, and mitigate against all hazards that threaten RTD and
its customers, employees, resources, equipment, and surrounding environment.
RTD’s Service Area is vulnerable to a number of hazards, discussed later in this document and
with hazard-specific plans in Annexes F-J. The EOP includes information for the preparation,
response, recovery and mitigation for an all-hazards approach to emergency management. In
addition, the Continuity of Operations Plan (2023) identifies systems to maintain the operations
of RTD despite disruption and may be a useful reference during emergencies. Further, the
Cybersecurity Incident Response Procedure (CIMP, 2022) outlines how RTD will respond to a
malicious attack upon our information technology infrastructure and is included in this
document as Annex J. The Commuter Rail Division also maintains the RTDC Passenger Train
Emergency Preparedness Plan (2022), included in this document as Annex B.
The EOP utilizes emergency management principles such as a whole community planning
process and will incorporate partnerships with local government and private partnership. This
also extends to include individuals with access and functional needs, such as mobility
challenges, low English proficiency as well as any age-related need.
RTD will activate the EOP when the District must respond to an emergency that requires
coordination across lines of service and with external agencies such as municipalities, counties,
the State of Colorado, or the Federal government. In addition, RTD may activate the EOP to
coordinate support for a pre-planned event.
It addresses the roles and responsibilities of agencies within RTD, as well as partner agencies,
and provides a link to federal, state, local, territorial, tribal, and private organizations and
resources that may be called upon to assist and participate in response to incidents that occur
throughout the locations that may default to this EOP aligned with Colo. Rev. Stat. § 24-33.5707.

Introduction

Packet Pg. 394

1.D.4.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The purpose of the Emergency Operations Plan is to establish the necessary framework to
support a coordinated response to all incidents across the agency and RTD service area as it
relates to RTD service including federal, state, local and special district entities as well as
private sector organizations. It assigns roles and responsibilities for all RTD departments and
division for preparedness and response activities before, during, and after an emergency. It
also provides for the systematic integration of additional emergency resources but does not
replace other federal, state or national emergency operations plans or procedures. Further, it
does not remove responsibility for each line of service within RTD to develop their own
procedures, policies and standard operating procedures for how to address emergencies.
The EOP is comprised of a base plan and supporting annexes, appendices, policies and
procedures. The base plan establishes the structure and provides guidance for a timely and
coordinated response, internal communications, information gathering, information sharing,
decision-making, and roles and responsibilities for coordinating incident operations. The
annexes, appendices, procedures, and policies provide the tools that support the
implementation of the base plan. The EOP is drafted to be adaptable to any situation in which
RTD responds to an emergency regardless of the level of severity and outlines how to prevent,
prepare for, respond to, recover from and mitigate the potential hazards identified within the
service area.
Further this plan prescribes the activities to be taken by RTD’s leadership to protect the lives of
customers and employees, property and environment in the event of a natural, human-caused,
or technological emergency, including terrorism.

Scope
This plan applies to all operations of the Regional Transportation District within its Service Area.
This includes all staff, operations, and property owned by the District.
Each department and division listed in the EOP is responsible for understanding its own
emergency authority and procedures when implementing the provisions of the EOP.

Purpose

Packet Pg. 395

1.D.4.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in the General Assembly of the State of
Colorado in 1969 by Chapter 231 Laws of Colorado 1969 which is currently codified as Sections
13-9-101 through 13-9-164 inclusive of the Colorado Revised Statutes to provide public
transportation to the Denver/Aurora Metro Area. Currently RTD operates in 8 counties with
coverage of the entirety of Denver, Broomfield, and Jefferson Counties and partial coverage in
Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas, and Weld Counties. These counties contain 40
municipalities. The service area cover 2,342 square miles populated by over 3.08 million people.
RTD’s mission of making lives better through connections is accomplished by provision of bus,
light rail, commuter rail, and paratransit services. Rail operates on fixed alignments with RTD
owning or leasing right of way. Three of four commuter rail alignments are operated by Denver
Transit Partners. All light rail, and the N-line of commuter rail are entirely operated by RTD. Bus
service is provided through fixed route, bus rapid transit, and on-demand service, accomplished
with about 50 percent of buses operated through contractors. Fixed routes are reviewed every
6 months to make adjustments for changing landscape and efficiency. Paratransit is entirely ondemand with all service delivery provided through contractors. There are 9,750 bus stops along
140 bus routes, 113 miles of rail track servicing 78 stations along 12 rail lines, and 96 Park-nRide facilities. Denver Union Station (DUS) is the central hub of the system, with all rail
alignments but the L-line terminating there. Amtrak also uses a rail platform at DUS.
The District also supports the RTD Police Department, which enforces local laws as well as
protects the safety of RTD customers and employees. This is the only traditional department
within RTD with traditional first response responsibilities.
The Service Area contains Denver International Airport, which is the third busiest passenger
airport in the world and a critical resource for the provision of emergency supplies. The airport
is serviced by the A-line commuter rail service, which connects the airport to DUS. In addition,
the service area contains interstates 70, 76, 25, and 225. Major thoroughfares also include E470, US 6, US 36, US 285, and US 287/I-70 Business Corridor.
BNSF railway and Union Pacific railroads are the main freight rail operators in the Service Area,
at times running parallel to RTD rail.
RTD also participates in the North Central Region/Urban Area Security Initiative (NCR/UASI) to
coordinate preparedness activities with the surrounding counties and municipalities.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD’s Service area is vulnerable to a number of natural, technological, and human-caused
threats and hazards. A high-level threat and hazard identification and risk assessment was
conducted utilizing available information about past events, future trends due to changing
climate, and assessment from representatives across the agency about predicted impacts. The
assessment from representatives was derived from a survey asking respondents to rank hazards
by likelihood, impact, and resilience. Information from all sources were aggregated and a matrix
created to rank hazards into high, moderate, and low significance to RTD. Those of interest are
presented below:

Critical Facilities and Infrastructure Summary
The sole energy provider for RTD’s service area is Xcel Energy. Power is provided for facilities
both public and private and for the provision of power for rail service.
Light rail alignments are served by 64 substations along the alignments which convert power
from 13,200 V AC to 850 V DC, which is the power provided through the Overhead Catenary
System (OCS). Where possible these substations are fed by diverse energy grids and there is
resiliency to lose 1-2 substations at a time.
Commuter rail alignments are served by 2 substations, Sundown and Argo. These substations
supply power at 25 kV through the OCS. The entire commuter rail system is able to function
under the power of one of the substations.

1.D.4.b

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Planning Assumptions

13

•

RTD is not the primary agency with jurisdiction at its locations throughout the service
area and will collaborate with local police, fire, and emergency medical personnel to
conduct critical life-safety response operations to save lives, reduce or treat injuries,
and to protect property and the environment

•

RTD, the communities within RTD’s service area, and the State have effective prediction
and warning systems in place allowing RTD to anticipate certain emergency situations
that may impact RTD.

•

When anticipating or in response to an emergency situation, the GM/CEO and Chief of
Police and Emergency Management are responsible for taking action, including the
activation of this plan, to mitigate impacts, save lives, protect property and the
environment, assist survivors, and restore services and facilities.

•

RTD officials, management staff, represented employees and partners are familiar with
the EOP, understand their roles and responsibilities under the EOP, maintain
appropriate plans, policies, and procedures to carry out those responsibilities, and
maintain a state of readiness. Day to day functions which do not contribute directly to
the emergency operation may be suspended for the duration of an emergency/disaster.
Resources that would normally be required for those daily functions may be redirected
to tasks in support of the emergency response.

•

RTD will use its own resources in response to an emergency or disaster. Once district
resources are exhausted (or near-exhausted), requests for assistance will be made.

•

A large-scale emergency or disaster may overwhelm available district resources, leading
to the need for support from local/mutual aid jurisdictions, private sector partners, state
agencies, and the federal government.

•

When resources of RTD are fully committed and mutual aid from communities within
RTD’s service area is exhausted, the Colorado Department of Homeland Security and
Emergency Management (CDHSEM) may coordinate the provision of additional
assistance to address unmet needs.

•

Disaster support from federal agencies may take at least 72 hours to arrive.

•

Facilities required to file Tier II reports develop, coordinate and provide copies of
emergency plans annually to the relevant jurisdiction’s LEPC, Fire Department and/or
other state departments and agencies as applicable and required by codes, laws,
regulations or requirements.

•

In the event that an evacuation of the Community, or any part thereof, is ordered, the
majority of the evacuees will utilize their own transportation resources to evacuate.
However, a percentage of the population does not have access to transportation and
will require transportation assistance.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
•

Individuals with pets will bring their pets with them when they evacuate. Those with
livestock or other farm animals will take appropriate measures to safeguard their
animals via sheltering or evacuation as appropriate.

•

RTD and its response partners will need to provide additional/enhanced assistance to
individuals with access and functional needs, including but not limited to children,
elderly, individuals with disabilities and/or chronic conditions.

Concept of Operations
The concept of operations describes the sequence and scope of emergency response. Transit
Police and Emergency Management has the primary responsibility for coordinating emergency
management activities in the name of RTD. These activities support the following properties:
•

Minimize injury and loss of life

•

Minimize property damage

•

Minimize adverse environmental and economic impact

•

Maintain the highest level of service possible to maintain consistency throughout
emergency conditions

•

Provide for the needs of survivors

Plan Activation
The EOP and its associated annexes will be executed in whole or in part as directed by the
GM/CEO, the Chief of Police and Emergency Management, or their designees in response to an
existing or an impending emergency. This plan may also be activated under the following
circumstances:

•
•
•
•

At the time of an actual disaster
When a community that RTD serves has declared a local state of emergency
When the Governor of Colorado has declared an emergency for areas within RTD’s
service area
When a Presidential Declaration of an Emergency or Disaster is issued for areas within
RTD’s service area

Phases of Emergency Management
RTD’s Emergency Management Program addresses all phases of emergency management for all
types of incidents, including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery
Prevention
From the National Preparedness Goal 2nd Edition published by FEMA:
Prevention includes those capabilities necessary to avoid, prevent, or stop a threatened
or actual act of terrorism. Unlike other mission areas, which are all-hazards by design,
Prevention core capabilities are focused specifically on imminent terrorist threats,
including on-going attacks or stopping imminent follow-on attacks.

1.D.4.b

Packet Pg. 399

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD Transit Police Department has primary responsibility for the prevention of terrorist or other
criminal activities as it relates to the District and it’s operations. This is accomplished by close
coordination with Federal, State and Local law enforcement agencies to share information about
potential threats to the District and within the Service Area as well as conducting active video
surveillance. Each individual within RTD contributes to this by reporting indicators of terrorism,
violent extremism, or other malicious actors to RTD Transit PD.
Protection
The Protection mission area relates to the ability to secure and protect people, critical
infrastructure, and vital interests against man-made and natural events. This can include
activities such as the securing of facilities, the RTD Information Technology Network, or
hardening of the supply chain.
Mitigation
The goal of mitigation is to prevent future loss by reducing or eliminating risk. Mitigation
activities like the recovery and preparedness phases of emergency management and can occur
before or after an emergency. The goals of pre-emergency mitigation activities are to reduce
the chances of an emergency happening or reducing the damage suffered from unavoidable
emergencies. The goal of post-emergency mitigation is to reduce the impact of future hazards
and is a part of the recovery process.
Response
Response is the actual provision of emergency services during a crisis including the coordination
and management of resources to support emergency response operations. These activities help
to reduce casualties and damage, and to speed recovery. Response activities include resource
and logistical coordination, addressing immediate life safety issues, stabilization of the incident,
and public information.
RTD responds to emergencies by activating the EOP, activating the Emergency Operations
Center, coordinating with public, private, and NGO partners as needed, coordinating and
managing resources in support of emergency response, and preparing for recovery activities.
Recovery
Recovery activities may be both short-term and long-term, ranging from conducting damage
assessments, removing debris, essential utilities such as water and power, restoration of IT
infrastructure and services, and restoration of revenue service to repairing or replacing
damaged vehicles, facilities, or railway. Recovery may also incorporate mitigation measures
designed to prevent future occurrences of a given hazard. Recovery begins as soon as possible
after an incident occurs and may commence during the response phase.

Direction, Control and Coordination
National Incident Management System
RTD’s emergency management organization is structured in accordance with the National
Incident Management (NIMS) and the Incident Command System (ICS). NIMS integrates
existing processes and methods into a unified national framework for incident management.
This framework forms the basis for interoperability and compatibility that enable a diverse set of
public and private organizations to conduct effective incident management operations.
It does this through a core set of concepts, principles, procedures, organizational structures
(Incident Command System, multi-agency coordination, and joint information systems),
terminology, and standards requirements applicable to a broad community of NIMS users. To
ensure interoperability and compatibility, NIMS is based on an appropriate balance of flexibility
and standardization. It provides a consistent and flexible national framework within which
government and private entities at all levels can work together to manage domestic incidents,
regardless of their cause, size, location, or complexity.
Incident Command System
Emergency management and incident response in RTD is coordinated using the Incident
Command System (ICS). ICS enables effective incident management by integrating a
combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating
within a common organizational structure. ICS is used to organize both near-term and longterm operations for a broad spectrum of emergencies, from small to complex incidents, both
natural and manmade. ICS is used by all levels of government – federal, state, regional and
local – as well as by many private-sector and NGOs.
In ICS, the Incident Commander (IC) is able to appoint individuals into leadership positions to
support specific areas of the response:

available to the IC.
All activity undertaken under the EOP shall be coordinated using the Incident Command System
(ICS) and the National Incident Management System (NIMS) in accordance with Homeland
Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 5.

Incident Command
Single Incident Commander - Most incidents involve a single incident commander. In these
incidents, a single person commands the incident response and is the decision-making
authority. The on-scene Incident Commander has tactical control of and authority over all
resources at the scene.

Attachment: PTASP_Manual_Exhibits_2024 - Draft (4793 : 2024 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP))

General Staff:

First Responders will establish Incident Command when they are on scene. The RTD Incident
Command Structure will ALWAYS defer authority to First Responders while they are on-scene,
but will establish consistent communication in a liaison function to provide information about
26

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 411

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
RTD vehicles, facilities, and response procedures. Information is to be shared freely with first
responders as it becomes available. When possible, the individual who would assume Incident
Command after First Responders leave should be the liaison with First Response Incident
Command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring on an RTD revenue vehicle, the operator or
conductor will begin the event as the Incident Commander. They will notify their appropriate
dispatch or control center and their street/field supervisor of the event. When the supervisor
arrives on-scene, they may chose to leave the operator as Incident Commander, or to take over
as Incident Command. An appropriate transfer of command must always take place when a
new incident commander assumes command.
In the event of an emergency/disaster occurring at an RTD owned facility, the highest ranking
operational staff present will begin the event as the Incident Commander. They will notify their
appropriate dispatch or control center and their facilities maintenance manager of the event.
When the Facilities Maintenance Manager arrives on-scene they may choose assume Incident
Command, or to leave the current Incident Commander in charge. An appropriate transfer of
command must always take place when a new incident commander assumes command.
The Incident Commander will have the authority to request resources to facilitate response,
including (but not limited to):
• On-scene presence of Emergency Management Specialist
• Trained individuals to staff command staff and general staff roles (Public Information
Officer, Liaison Officer, Safety Officer, Operations Chief, Logistics Chief, Planning Chief
or Finance/Administration Chief)
• Activation of the Mobile Command Post
• Trained staff to fill any necessary operations, logistics, planning, or communication
roles
• Activation of the Emergency Operations Center
• Vehicles, parts, and other materials to maintain or restore safe conditions or safe
operation
All street supervisors for bus service, all field supervisors for rail and all sworn police officers will
be expected to maintain the following trainings from FEMA or an appropriate local training
agency:
• IS 100
• IS 200
• IS 700
• IS 800
• ICS 300
These trainings will give the supervisors the competency to work within Incident Command
Structure and integrate with other local response agencies to preserve life safety, reduce
damage to property and reduce impact to the environment. From time of this policy being
adopted or from promotion to a relevant supervisor position, individuals will have six (6) months
to complete all trainings.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Unified Command
A Unified Command involves two or more individuals sharing the authority normally held by a
single incident commander. A Unified Command acts as a single entity. It is important to note
that in Unified Command the command representatives will appoint a single Operations Section
Chief.
An example when Unified Command may be used would be an intentional, malicious derailment
of a train, where Transit Police and Rail Supervisors will work together to make decisions
regarding the response.
Transfer of Command
Responsibility can be transferred during an incident for several reasons. As the incident grows
a more qualified person may be required to take over as Incident Commander to handle the
ever-growing needs of the incident. Or this may occur in reverse; when an incident reduces in
size, the command can be passed down to a less qualified person, but still qualified to run the
now-smaller incident. Other reasons to transfer command include jurisdictional change if the
incident moves to a different location or area of responsibility, or the normal turnover of
personnel due to extended incidents. The transfer of command process always includes a
transfer of command briefing, IC to IC, with the objective to give a complete picture of all
events and considerations which may impact the response and decision-making abilities of the
new IC. This briefing may be oral, written, or a combination of both. A Transfer of Command is
posted and announced on all radio and communication networks, especially with notification to
the EOC.
Incident Coordination and/or Response Structures
Various types of operational support facilities are established in the vicinity of an incident,
depending on its size and complexity, to accomplish a variety of purposes. RTD may operate
one or more of the following incident coordination and/or response facilities during an
emergency or disaster:
•
•
•
•

Incident Command Post
Emergency Operations Center
Staging Area
Evacuation Transportation Hubs

Incident Command Post
An Incident Command Post (ICP) is the field location where the Incident Commander operates,
onsite response is directly coordinated, and onsite resource needs are identified and
communicated. There is only one ICP for each incident or event, but it may change locations
during the event. The ICP may be located in a vehicle, the Mobile Command Post, or within a
building. The ICP will be positioned outside of the incident scene and the potential hazard zone
but close enough to the incident to maintain a visual presence and command status. The onscene Incident Commander has tactical control of and authority over all resources at the scene.

responsibility or authority of the Incident Commander but instead supports incident command
while mobilizing resources, tracking costs, planning for future needs, providing decision making
support and Liaising with the Leadership Team/Policy Group as needed. Like Incident
Command, the EOC is scalable and flexible.
RTD has designated a primary and secondary EOC, which can be activated as necessary:
Primary EOC:

District Shops
Mezzanine Training Rooms
1900 31st St
Denver, CO 80216

Secondary EOC:

711 Building
Ste 10
711 W 31st Ave
Denver, CO 80202

The EOC may also be activated in a virtual or hybrid stance using RTD’s Microsoft Teams
platform. Identified and trained EOC representatives will be invited to the Virtual EOC (VEOC)
Channel and will participate in the discussions as activated on an event by event basis.
The Emergency Management Specialist will serve as the EOC Manager and has the authority
and responsibility for managing the EOC and the district’s emergency management organization
during an emergency or disaster. The EOC Manager has the authority to make all routine
decisions, and is charged with advising the Leadership Team and the GM/CEO when major
decisions need to be made. The EOC Manager serves as a liaison with the local jurisdictions’,
State, and Federal emergency management agencies.

EOC Goals
The following are the general goals for the emergency operations center. These goals can be
adjusted by the EOC Manager in coordination with the GM/CEO, Chief of Police and Emergency
Management, and the incident commander, when the EOC is activated.
• Obtain and maintain situational awareness of the incident and ensure responders
have a common operating picture.
• Establish an incident planning cycle.
• Manage resources (people, places, things) including tracking the status of
requests, the status and utilization of resources, and planning for the
demobilization of resources
• Procurement of emergency supplies
• Establish a seamless transition from response into recovery operations.
• Assess and document impacts from events for recovery process

Packet Pg. 414

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Activation Level Three (Watch): The EOC activates to activation level three (AL-3) when
only Public Safety staff are needed to closely monitor a developing incident or threat. At AL-3,
the EOC will begin gathering situation awareness information, but emergency coordination is
largely left to the routine processes and procedures maintained by each department or division.
Activation Level Two (Partial): The EOC is activated to activation level two (AL-2) when
some, but not all, EOC positions are needed to manage an emergency. The EOC Manager is
responsible for determining which positions are needed to meet the District’s needs. The
following are examples of triggers for when an AL-2 activation may be appropriate:
•
•
•
•
•

A request for EOC activation from an Incident Commander.
An incident resulting in 10 or more serious injuries or fatalities.
A credible threat of terrorism or mass violence as determined by RTD PD, local
Jurisdiction PD or the Colorado Information Analysis Center.
A forecast from the National Weather Service of a Blizzard Warning or a prediction of
major flooding.
A significant disruption in service requiring off-scene coordination of resources to
provide information or resources.

Activation Level One (Full): The EOC is activated to activation level one (AL-1) when all EOC
positions are needed to manage an emergency. The following are examples of triggers for when
an AL-1 activation may be appropriate:
•
•
•
•

A request for EOC activation from an Incident Commander.
An incident resulting in 30 or more serious injuries or fatalities.
Significant civil unrest.
A forecast from the National Weather Service for historic flooding or historic winter
weather.

EOC Staffing
The Emergency Operations Center will be staffed utilizing a hybrid ICS/departmental model.
Representatives are expected to be knowledgeable individuals with authority to make
emergency-related decisions for their line of service. Lists of EOC representatives will be
maintained by the leadership of each discipline expected to maintain staff prepared to report to
the EOC and be able to provide this list to the Emergency Management Specialist every 6
months and upon request.
Each mode of transit, Bus, Light Rail, Commuter Rail and Paratransit, shall have at least three
(3) trained EOC representatives. This allows for relief if the EOC must be activated on a 24-hour
basis as well as providing coverage if one of the two primary EOC representatives are unable to
report for duty for any reason.
The following lines of service must also have trained EOC representatives, with the exact
number noted below:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

RTD Police- Three (3) representatives
Safety and Environmental Compliance-Three (3) representatives, to be trained to fill
roles such as safety officer and safety EOC liaison
Safety, Security and Compliance- Two (2) representatives
Information Technology-Three (3) representatives
Cybersecurity-Two (2) representatives
Communications-At least two (2) trained Public Information Officers
Capital Programs and Facilities-Three (3) representatives
Planning-Two (2) representatives trained as Planning Section Staff
Operations Service Delivery-Two (2) representatives trained as Planning Section Staff
Finance-Two (2) representatives
People-Two (2) representatives
General Counsel-Two (2) representatives

Depending upon the event triggering the activation, additional roles may be assigned outside of
a representative’s normal work. This is to be expected in emergencies, especially those where
an on-scene ICS structure is not in place.
EOC Activation
The EOC will be activated at the request of the GM/CEO, Chief Operations Officer, Chief of
Police and Emergency Management, the Emergency Management Specialist, or Incident
Commander or any of the above position’s designees. Upon request, the Emergency
Management Specialist/EOC Manager will determine the appropriate level of activation and
required representatives.
Notification of EOC Activation will be sent to trained representatives and Leadership Team using
ReadyOp over text and call. Only one representative will be asked to go to the EOC unless
otherwise noted.

•
•
•

Whole System Service Suspension
Office Closures
Shutdown of the entire RTD Information Technology Network
Reappropriation of staff
Financial Expenditure above $25,000
Collaboration with Labor Representation
Long-term Relocation of RTD Facilities or Staff

Members of the Policy Group are not required to staff the EOC and will be requested to appoint
another representative to the EOC in the event they are present, to allow proper delegation and
accomplishment of EOC objectives.
EOC Table of Organization
Below is a sample of what role each department’s representatives may be asked to fill in an
emergency. This is not prescriptive and may be adjusted depending upon the event triggering
the activation. Leadership of each section may or may not be assigned based upon complexity
of staffing or the event.
Representatives working in the EOC will be asked to liaise between their departments and the
EOC and while staffing the EOC are acting outside of their steady-state role and hierarchy.

Information Collection, Analysis and Dissemination

Situational Awareness
There are five elements that are the backbone of good situational awareness:
•
•
•
•
•

Define your information requirements
Determine how to gather information
Decide who will analyze that information
Determine how that information will be shared
Choose the technology that will help communicate and manage the information

During the initial period of an emergency, efforts should be focused on gaining an
understanding of the situation and establishing incident priorities. A well-defined, operational
information collection capability is essential. Information collection provides situational
awareness to leadership and promotes informed decision-making. The community has
designated a process to collect, analyze and disseminate information during an emergency to
both internal and external response partners as well as the public.

Information will be collected from a variety of sources. The Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) Manager or his/her designee at the EOC will be charged with collecting information. The
following list contains examples of potential sources of operational information:
• Revenue Vehicle Operators, Via Communications Centers
• On-scene responders (Street/Field Supervision, Facilities Staff, etc)
• RTD Departments
• City, County, and State Situational Awareness Reports
• City, County, and State Virtual EOC’s
• Special districts and non-governmental partners
• Television, radio and print media
• Social media
• Survivors of the emergency and the general public
• Subject matter experts
Information Analysis
After information has been collected, it must be analyzed to determine its credibility and
operational relevance. The EOC Manager or his/her designee will analyze information that is
received and prepare intelligence reports for leadership.
Dissemination
Message dissemination is categorized into internal messaging and public messaging. Internal
messaging refers to messages crafted for responders, employees, contractors, and partners,
while public messaging refers to messages crafted for public dissemination.
Internal Messaging
EOC Manager or his/her designee in the EOC will assist in conveying information as necessary
to responders, RTD departments and other partners. Additionally, EOC Manager or his/her
designee will maintain and update the Incident Action Plan (IAP), which will contain critical
information and intelligence updates.
Within 2 hours of an emergency event, the EOC Manager will brief the Policy Group/Leadership
Team with details for the event and response.
Public Messaging
Various methods of public information dissemination are available. The decision to use a
particular medium will be based on the urgency and the intended audience. Some methods of
distribution include:

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
News conferences

Social media updates

To ensure one consistent and accurate voice, all public information releases will be coordinated
through EOC Manager or his/her designee.

Communications
Communications are an important component of response and recovery operations. The ability
of emergency management/response personnel from different disciplines, jurisdictions,
organizations, and agencies to work together depends greatly on their ability to communicate
with each other. To effectively transmit and receive information, emergency response partners
supporting the community must have access to all available forms of communication. This
section outlines the types of equipment/systems available for internal, external and public
communication. Operational communications systems and capabilities, and effective
communications, are essential to the success of any emergency operation. The community
maintains and operates the following communications systems to ensure effective and
operation communications between municipal personnel and with other jurisdictions.
Communications between community agencies occur through the use of several types of
communications equipment including radios, cellular and landline phones, email, and satellite
phones. In addition, the State uses WebEOC to provide situational awareness.
The radio system RTD uses is supported by the State of Colorado and is utilized by first
responders across the region and state. This is an 800 MHz system and has redundant towers
in the Denver Metro Area. All radio talk groups have access to MetroNET, which is the mutual
aid channel in the Denver Metro Area. RTD’s system is segregated into Bus Operations, Rail
Operations, Police, and some single channels available for support services such as Treasury
Maintenance. There is only one encrypted channel available and it is on the police talk group.
Bus Operations is set up to facilitate on-demand communication, where all other channels are
push-to-talk. The radio system is maintained by Information Technology’s Mobile
Technologies group.
In addition, RTD’s Emergency Management Specialist sends Situational Awareness Updates
for events which may require emergency coordination.
Alert and Notification

RTD utilizes Service Alerts to alert the customers and public about disruptions to the system.
This is predominantly sent via app alerts and emails for registered users on selected routes of
importance to the individual. The organization also communicates with the public via news
releases and conferences.

communication systems: Computers with Microsoft Teams, cameras, microphones, and
Outlook, telephones, and radio.
RTD conducts periodic communications tests to ensure that its systems are operational and its

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Disseminate public warnings after receiving written approval from the EOC Manager or
his/her designee

During non-emergency times, information regarding emergency plans and actions to be taken
by the public, in the form of public information / education materials, will be provided to the
public via newsletters, brochures, RTD website and RTD social media.
During an emergency, the potential for dissemination of false or misleading information is high.
This can lead to operational difficulties for responders and confusion among the public.
Misleading information can be produced from several sources. RTD will establish a media
monitoring and rumor control section in the EOC and staffed by Communications Staff.
Finance and Administration
Employee Reassignment

During an emergency, certain employees may be reassigned to complete alternate duties that
differ from their regular day-to-day responsibilities. In general, RTD job descriptions for nonrepresented employees include an ‘other duties as assigned’ or ‘other duties as required’ clause
that can be activated for emergencies. This may require approval of the Policy Group when not
previously identified in this document.
Worker’s Compensation
Employee wellbeing is a top priority of RTD, affected through the Employee Ownership strategic
goal for the agency. Worker’s compensation claims are administered according to Colorado
Statutes C.R.S. 8-40-101, et seq. Department administration will coordinate with Human
Resources to manage incidents and ensure staffing levels are appropriate. If incidents arise
requiring a change in policy or procedure, those will be coordinated by the EOC Manager and
Policy Group.
Insurance and Financial Liability
RTD is generally self-insured for tort liability up to the limits specified under the Colorado
Governmental Immunity Act and has additional insurance policies in place to support the
financial recovery of the organization. For this reason, it is important to coordinate with the Risk
Management Division to ensure proper record-keeping and investigative processes are followed.
These policies include excess workers compensation, commercial crime, fiduciary, cybersecurity,
excess liability, commercial property and railroad liability insurance.
Timekeeping
Tracking employee time spent on emergency operations can be an important aspect of
determining disaster costs and opportunities for reimbursement by the federal government
through FTA or FEMA. RTD maintains the same timekeeping policies during regular operations
and emergency operations, but salaried employees should use Workday to log any applicable or

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
Represented employees will use Kronos or TIES for their timekeeping needs, according to their
steady state timekeeping policies. If for some reason, Workday, Kronos or TIES are unavailable,
employees are to track hours manually and Finance shall make appropriate adjustments as the
systems become available.
Records Retention
Records retention during emergencies is conducted using the same policies and procedures in
place during regular operation. The Records Management Procedure and Records Retention
Schedule Policy, created and maintained by the Information Management & Governance
Division can be found on the HUB. Records to be retained during and after an emergency
include personnel hours, equipment costs, expenditures/procurement, costs incurred by RTD,
etc. in compliance with RTD policies and procedures and C.F.R. Title 44, Emergency
Management Assistance.
Documenting Response and Recovery Operations
RTD will use Incident Action Plans (IAP) and Situation Reports (SitRep) to document response
and recovery efforts. Other documentation will be used to record cost recovery information,
requests for aid, budget control, legal advice, operational efficiency and other relevant areas of
response and recovery activities.
After Action Reporting
Training exercises and any real-world activations of this plan shall be followed by a written After
Action Review and Report. After Action Reports should contain at a minimum:
•
•
•
•

The activities that took place
Areas for improvement
Successes
An improvement plan with individual/department/division assignments

After Action Reports should be reviewed prior to any exercise to ensure that any previous issues
are recognized and corrected as successfully as possible.

Emergency Procurement and Spending
RTD uses any existing contracts first to make purchases and secure goods and services for
emergency requirements. If such a contract is not available, the EOC Manager and the
Specialist, Emergency Management each has authority to spend up to $25,000 by use of an
RTD Purchase Card (P-Card) for emergency purchases if it is not possible or practicable to
initiate a purchase requisition (PR) for the emergency purchase. These purchases require
emergency justification and supporting documentation, consistent with the Procurement
Standards Manual. Purchase authorizations above this limit must be approved by the Policy
Group.
If an emergency P-Card purchase is necessary without the possibility of a
PR in excess of a P-Card holder’s single transaction limit, contact:

Emergency Contracting
Emergency and post-disaster contracts will be managed by the Contracting and Procurement
Division. Allowing emergency contracting during an emergency is an important way to avoid
lengthy contract bidding processes and speed up response and recovery efforts; however, it
should be carefully managed in order to prevent RTD and the tax-payers from potentially
overpaying for goods and services by failing to facilitate appropriate competition for taxpayer
funded contracts. More detailed information about emergency contractors can be found in the
Procurement Standards Manual.

RTD Emergency Operations Plan
EOP Coordination
This Emergency Operations Plan will be promulgated every 3 years. The reviews, revisions,
updates and changes made to the plan will begin with the Emergency Management Division of
the RTDPD, who will then elevate the plan as needed if signatures are required for the changes
to the plan. If any changes need to be made to the plan that originate outside the Emergency
Management Division, the need for updates will be communicated to the appropriate
department via email to ensure version control and accountability.
Planning and Coordination Responsibility
The Emergency Management Division of RTDPD is tasked with maintaining, distributing, and
updating this EOP. Revisions to this EOP will be coordinated by the EM Division who will also
review and approve any proposed revisions.
EOP Updates
Plan maintenance includes updating and revising the plan to reflect all changes, testing the plan
periodically, and ensuring that all personnel remain up to date on their roles and responsibilities
as outlined in the plan. If any issues emerge, situations change, gaps become apparent and/or
requirements change, the plan must be updated to reflect these and remain usable, compliant
and up-to-date. The RTD EOP will be reviewed annually, after any exercises, following any
changes in requirements, and/or after actual incidents, as necessary.
EOP Reviews and Updates
This EOP is continuously monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness, and will be updated
after the following:

•
•
•
•

When lessons learned from real-world incidents are reviewed
When hazard risks or risk areas change
When alert and warning systems change
When government planning standards for the document in question are changed

EOP Revision
Anyone who plays a role in implementing the EOP should be appropriately trained on the plan
and understand their role in supporting emergency response operations. RTD exercises its EOP
annually; however, real world events that result in activations may be substituted for an
exercise if deemed appropriate.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Human Resources Update

July 12, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the March 8, 2023, Operations and Safety Committee meeting, the Chief People Officer
committed to presenting an overview of the agency’s people power on a quarterly basis.
DISCUSSION
The RTD workforce comprises a vast array of highly skilled disciplines and roles from safety and
compliance, information technology and cyber-security, heavy-duty mechanics, service and cleaning,
maintenance, legal, financial, human resources, engineers, customer support, law enforcement, and bus
and rail operators.
Ensuring RTD has the right people, in the right roles, doing the right work, at the right time is critical to
agency success. The purpose of this discussion item is to report on RTD’s people power metrics,
including vacancy rates by key positions, as well as recruitment, and retention initiatives and outcomes
for Q1 2023.
People Power
Over the past nine months, the agency has enacted various strategies and tactics to support the
recovery of its people power and correlated service. As of March 31, 2023, RTD employs 2,685 fulland part-time staff. RTD’s overall vacancy rate (calculated against 2023 budgeted positions) sits at
16%, reflecting a 2% reduction in vacant positions agency wide compared to 2022 yearend. However,
the agency continues to experience vacancy rates of 30-40% in key positions, notably, bus maintenance
(general repair and body shop), light rail vehicle maintenance, and Maintenance of Way and
infrastructure.
Talent Acquisition
The competition for talent remains incredibly fierce. However, the focus is simple and steadfast–attract
significant numbers of specialized skillsets in a short period of time, and then once hired, provide an
employee experience that makes them choose to stay. To this end, interest in RTD is on the rise.
Applicant traffic rose an astounding 55% in Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022. There are many
contributing factors (e.g., pandemic effect), however, the majority of applicants came directly through

Packet Pg. 450

1.E.1

RTD’s Careers website. This is evidence that the collaborative community outreach, partnership, and
targeted recruitment efforts of the Communications and Engagement and Talent Acquisition teams are
creating a positive increase in RTD’s profile and career opportunity quotient.
Retention
Continuing the positive trend, separations in Q1 2023 were down 18% over the same period last year.
Of the 82 separations in Q1, 79% were voluntary and 21% were involuntary. The most frequent reason
for voluntary separation was retirement (26%). However, a further exploration of the numbers
highlighted that nearly 50% of voluntary separations were for either other employment, job
abandonment, or family reasons. Only 3% cited dissatisfaction with pay as the primary reason for
separation. Employee retention is a challenge not only in the transit sector, but across sectors (public
and private). As previously noted, the competition for talent is real and the challenge is complex. Further
exploration of the numbers and determinative factors is necessary in order to fully understand drivers
and lasting mitigation tactics.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.
