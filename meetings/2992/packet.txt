Subject:

Addition of Information Section to Committee

Executive

Manager,

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board adopt a ministerial change to the format
of committee meeting agendas to include a section for informational items not intended for discussion
during meetings unless expressly requested by one or more Directors.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 – Strong and Ethical Leadership
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
Meeting agendas reflect the established order of business. For Board and Committee Meetings, the order
of business is described in the Board Bylaws, specifically Art. V, §4 and Art. VI, §1(f), respectively.
For a typical committee meeting, the agenda includes the following standard items: A) Call to Order; B)
Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Other Matters; E) Next Meeting Date; F) Adjourn.
Directors have expressed on several occasions an interest in truncating the duration of committee
meetings. At the same time, the Board has indicated its desire to continue to receive ample information
to inform the decision-making process.
DISCUSSION
For a given agenda, this ministerial change would allow staff to include a section, between Updates and
Other Matters, specifically intended for items of recurring, non-actionable, and informational nature.
These items are not intended to be presented or discussed by staff; should questions arise or
clarification be needed for any Director while reviewing the agenda, the Director would contact staff in
advance of the meeting as needed. Should the Director feel further discussion is warranted during the
meeting, the Director would then submit a request, both to the chair of the appropriate committee and
to the Executive Manager of the Board Office, as far in advance as practicable, asking that the item be
opened for questions or discussion as necessary. Advance notice of such request ensures that the
appropriate staff resources can be available during the meeting to present information and respond to
questions and comments as necessary.

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

This action is an attempt to strike a balance between the timely and transparent dissemination of
information to the Board and the desire to employ additional time management practices during
committee meetings. Should this action be adopted by the Board, Directors are encouraged to continue
to make inquiries of appropriate staff prior to meetings to the greatest extent possible, as contemplated
in the Board Operating Guidelines, adopted February 2019
Following this change, the typical order of business for committee agendas would be as follows: A) Call
to Order; B) Recommended Actions; C) Updates; D) Information; E) Other Matters; F) Next Meeting
Date; G) Adjourn.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No additional expenditure is necessary as a result of the adoption of this item. Rather, increased meeting
efficiency would result in moderate cost savings as a result of reduced need for support staff and facility
resources.

Subject:

Exercise First Contract Option Year for
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture Contract for
FasTracks Construction Management Support
Consultant Services

General

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to approve a contract amendment to exercise the
first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for Construction Management Support Consultant
Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase
in the contract not-to-exceed amount. Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the
2020 Adopted Budget in the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
This action addresses the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #5: Increase Ridership.
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with four
one-year options. In May 2017, the Board authorized an increase the total contract not-to-exceed value,
bringing the not-to-exceed amount of the contract to $34,400,000.
As of March 23, 2020, RTD has contracted for a total of $$31,056,716 in services to be delivered
through the current contract end date of July 13, 2020, with $283,933 of change orders pending
approval, and $3,059,351 remaining of the contract not-to-exceed value. As of the January 2020
invoice, RTD has paid out a total of $28,335,846 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill JV includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE goal of 27%
for this contract. As of march 23, 2020, actual DBE participation has been 43.7% of the contract
value.
DISCUSSION
RTD has reached the stage of the FasTracks program where all of the ongoing corridor projects are in
the closeout phase, or will be entering closeout within the next few months. At this time, it is crucial to
retain the institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts and meet final reporting requirements
for FTA grant projects. The proposed time extension to the CMSC contract would make the resources
available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Packet Pg. 9

2.12.B

In addition, as part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces claims and lawsuits related to its
projects. Support from the CMSC staff that were involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.
RTD envisions the CMSC providing continuing support in those areas through July 2021:









Support for North Metro project completion, operations standup, and closeout
Closeout support for the Southeast Rail Extension and Eagle projects
Completion of the Longmont Infrastructure Master Plan
TOD support
Quality management support
DBE support for project closeout
Specialized planning and environmental support
Support for other ongoing projects as needed

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total Contract Not to Exceed Amount for the CMSC contract would remain at $34,400,000 with
this time extension. All remaining funding for this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in
the specific projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to
approve a contract amendment to exercise the first option year of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture
for Construction Management Support Consultant Services (CMSC) for FasTracks, extending the
contract end date to July 13, 2021, with no increase in the contract not-to-exceed amount.
Funding for the remainder of this contract is included in the 2020 Adopted Budget in the specific
projects where CMSC support would be utilized.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to
exercise the contract option. Instead, allow the contract to expire on July 13, 2020, and perform
the remaining work in-house with RTD staff. This is not recommended because RTD does not
have in-house staff with the institutional knowledge, background, and technical skills of the
specific staff to be retained through this time extension, and would not be able to replace their
expertise in a timely and cost-effective manner.

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City of Boulder for the Transfer
of Used RTD Site Amenities

General

Board Meeting Date: April 21, 2020

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer
of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to
these quantities may be made if the project scope changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s goals:
Core Goal #5 - Effective Communications & Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has 9,702 bus stops, of which 330 are RTD-maintained. Adding amenities such as
shelters, benches, and trash cans provides a more comfortable environment to RTD patrons to wait, but
comes with initial capital and ongoing maintenance costs. RTD’s maintenance costs for a stop with
amenities are approximately $4,600-$5,600 each year. Several bus stops are maintained by local
agencies or by advertisers.
The City of Boulder is reconstructing Broadway on the north end of the City from Violet Ave. to US36.
There are currently six bus stops within the project area. All bus stops will be rebuilt as part of the
project. The City of Boulder would like to include site amenities at the bus stops for RTD patrons and is
seeking RTD’s assistance in providing these site amenities. RTD currently has the requested site
amenities in its salvage yard that could be transferred to the City for use on the project. The City has
agreed to take ownership of the amenities and to provide all ongoing maintenance at the stops within
the project area.
DISCUSSION
The City of Boulder has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4 benches, 6 trash
receptacles, and 4 bike racks. The City will take on ownership of the amenities and be responsible for all
future maintenance at the bus stops within the project area.
RTD currently has no shelters at the stops within the project area, and other amenities are also limited.
All southbound stops have a high number of boardings, and northbound stops have a high number of
alightings.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for transferring site amenities for 6 locations along Broadway St.
in the City of Boulder 1) Violet Ave. NB, (2) Yarmouth Ave. NB, (3) Lee Hill Dr. NB, (4) Lee Hill Dr. SB,
(5) Yarmouth Ave. SB, and (6) Violet Ave. SB. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:

Packet Pg. 12

2.12.C





RTD design/construction review and approval of bus stops
Maintenance responsibilities at bus stops
Transfer of ownership of shelters, benches, trash receptacles, and bike racks

The proposed IGA includes provisions that RTD will not be held responsible for any claims or liabilities
that result from Boulder’s actions or omissions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will not provide any funding towards the construction or maintenance of the project.
The transferred amenities are currently in storage and have an estimated value of $28,560.
There would be no impact to RTD maintenance costs because RTD currently does not provide any
maintenance at the stops within the project area, and the City of Boulder will be responsible for all future
bus-stop maintenance.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and
CEO or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with the City of Boulder, for the transfer of ownership of 3 bus shelters, 4
benches, 6 trash receptacles, and 4 bike racks. Minor adjustments to these quantities may be
made if the project scope changes.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in
leaving several high-use, project-area bus stops without site amenities for our patrons, when a
reasonable mechanism to enable addition of the amenities is being proposed.

Revisions to Code of Conduct

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board adopt the attached revised Code of Conduct as amended and
authorize the GM/CEO to revise the code of conduct in the future but only in the event of a declared
state or national emergency. Any changes made by the GM/CEO must be ratified by the Board within 14
days.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership
Task Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The Code of Conduct was adopted in 2016 for the purpose of regulating behavior on RTD vehicles,
facilities and property. The Code allows RTD to regulate conduct through civil action by suspending
individuals from using transit services or removing individuals from RTD facilities or property.
DISCUSSION
The Code of Conduct needs to be revised to reflect changes in how RTD manages its transit services
and facilities. The following is a summary of the proposed changes:


Clarifies ambiguous language;



Prohibits obstruction of accessible features such as ramps and high blocks:
o



Paragraph 23: Obstructing disabled passengers from accessing features necessary to
enable disabled passengers to use transit services such as ramps, lifts and high blocks.

Prohibits individuals from remaining at a transit facility after being asked to leave:
o

Paragraph 35: Remaining at a facility after being asked to leave, for violation of this Code
or other applicable rules. RTD may, in its sole discretion, regulate the movement of
individuals to enable the provision of transit services. Facilities are to be used only for
travel-related purposes, except when a permit is otherwise granted, so that passengers
can utilize the transit system in a safe and efficient manner without inconvenience or
delay.

Outside of the Code of Conduct, RTD’s General Manager already has the authority to issue reasonable
rules and policies to manage RTD property.

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services, when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
• Create undue financial and administrative burdens
