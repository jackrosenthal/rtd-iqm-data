December 27, 2019
Executive Committee
DOUG TISDALE: I will now called to order the Friday, December 27, 2019 meeting of the RTD
Executive Committee. We are convened at 12:04 PM in the RTD Board conference room. And I
will note for the sake of the record that present in the room are Executive Manager, Barbara
McManus, First Vice Chair, Peggy Catlin, Second Vice Chair, Angie Rivera-Malpiede, the
Treasurer of the Board, Shelley Cook, Director Natalie Menten as an observer, and Director Jeff
Walker as Secretary, and Jennifer Ross-Amato, our Deputy General Counsel, and Nate Minor from
CPR. And the first item on the agenda is Interim GM search discussion.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Pardon me, Chair, I think you should also mention those on the phone.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, thank you very much, Director Folska. I appreciate that. I was just so eager
to make sure we had the business here and forgot that. And on the telephone, we have Director
Claudia Folska and Director Troy Whitmore. Are there any other persons who have joined us on
the telephone?
There are none others acknowledging at this time. We have some logistic matters that we will be
discussing. But we're actually going to get into those and other matters. The principal purpose of
this meeting is pursuant to the resolution that was adopted by the Board.
The Executive Committee has already presented the Board all submittals. And the Executive
Committee is now in position of indicating, if it wishes, the top two each of internal and external
applicants. That is a process that we will conduct an Executive Session for that discussion of all
of the names of the individuals. And I'll indicate to you a process that we hope will expedite the
discussion and make it productive and effective.
Any other matters that might address the Interim GM search discussion we will bring up under
other matters. So we are ready to proceed into Executive Session right now. So, therefore, I call
for a motion.
SHELLEY COOK: Can I ask a question first, Chair.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: So are we discussing those matters of process within the Executive Session. I
was curious about the second-DOUG TISDALE: No.
SHELLEY COOK: --provision, the CRS, the powers and duties of search committee, if what we're
doing is just discussion the people we would designate as their top two internally and externally.

DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: We actually need that second provision, the CRS, 24-6-402, so for what?
DOUG TISDALE: Well, let me ask our counsel. I believe it's always better to have a full coverage,
but Counsel, what do you think?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: So let me just make sure I understand the question. So the question
is, do we need both citations? Well, I think it's always better to be covered. But if you want to-- if
you only want one of them to apply, then I would just move for that provision.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, I'm going to ask for a motion for both. And then we'll see how it goes,
OK?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, just what would we be restricted from talking about if we just went with
personnel matters? Would we be unable to do the top two in each category? Or what would we'd
be able to do that we couldn't do if we just said personnel matters?
DOUG TISDALE: My concern is that personnel matters might, by someone, be challenged to read
only as to existing personnel as opposed to hiring of future personnel, whereas 3.5 specifically
addresses searches for new executive employees.
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: And that's the reason for wanting to be sure that we cover it just in case
someone were to come on later and say, well, no, that section doesn't really apply. That's my
thought.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: Do you agree?
DOUG TISDALE: You're the lawyer, not me.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: I think-- well, we both are. But I think out of an abundance of
caution, that's probably right. If you have any legal questions about the process that you want to
answer I'll at least provide those as well.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: And, by the way, I did jump ahead of one thing that I wanted to confirm. And
that is because the motion-- the resolution is adopted specifically says, if it wishes. That's open
session. That's not executive.

So, therefore, let me ask, is it the wish-- I'll read that out, and you can translate it to desire. Is it the
desire of this Executive Committee to consider presenting to the Board top two each of internal
and external applications?
PEGGY CATLIN: Are we limited to the top two?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm just reading what it says.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, so that's a good point. I'm fine with it.
PEGGY CATLIN: I had some really close-SHELLEY COOK: I would say, yes, for the purposes of the Board's interviews, I would support
interviewing more than just the top two in each category. So-DOUG TISDALE: That's not what we're discussing today. The only thing we're discussing today
is the task imposed upon the Executive Committee. And that was expressly limited to two-- internal
two, external. My question for the record is, are you all in agreement with-- because this says, "if
it wishes."
So I have to ask the question, is that your wish? So is it your wish, Peggy-PEGGY CATLIN: To-- to what?
DOUG TISDALE: To proceed in this manner-PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: --and select the top two.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Is it your wish Angie?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It is.
DOUG TISDALE: Is it your wish, Shelley?
SHELLEY COOK: It is.
DOUG TISDALE: Is it your wish, Jeff?
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, we have unanimous consent.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is it your wish?
DOUG TISDALE: And it is my wish indeed. We have-- thank you for asking.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Really?
DOUG TISDALE: Therefore, we have unanimous consent that we will address that. I mean, I just
got to make sure we make a record that we're actually going to do the option because it's stated as
an option. It's not a mandate. It's an option. So the committee wishes to do that.
Therefore, I will now ask for a motion for the Executive Committee to convene an Executive
Session for the discussion of personnel matters pursuant to cover revised statute section 24-6-402
paren 4, paren paren, F paren I and further conferences with legal counsel for legal advice and to
provide instructions regarding Colorado Revised State Statute Section 24-6-402 paren 3.5 and the
powers and duties of the Search Committee of a state public body or local public body with the
intention being as stated-- to discuss these candidates and come up with the top two internal and
external. May I have a motion?
SHELLEY COOK: So moved.
DOUG TISDALE: I have a motion. Is there a second on the motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: Second.
DOUG TISDALE: I have a second on the motion. Is there any discussion on that motion. You
want discussion on the motion? Absolutely.
NATALIE MENTEN: My question is more about the process and then where would that be?
Would that be under "Other Matters"?
DOUG TISDALE: Other Matters.
NATALIE MENTEN: Before now-- or now-- and this relates to when we signed a nondisclosure
agreement, it ties our hands in some way. And the first two things that come to mind for me is a
background search on candidates. How would that be done? Two, how would we check references
if our hands are tied?
DOUG TISDALE: OK, as to each of those, excellent questions, no problem with that. We will
discuss those after we go through this process because if, for example, we determine that the
Executive Committee says, there is nobody in here at all that we like, or, gosh, we really like 18
out of these people, it's going to impact a lot of what the "other matters" are in the rest of the
process.
So, therefore, your questions are exceptionally well taken. They absolutely will be discussed today
by this committee once we conclude the Executive Session.

NATALIE MENTEN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: OK? Any further discussion on the motion to enter into an Executive Session?
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]
DOUG TISDALE: All right, all those in favor indicate by saying, aye.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, wait, yeah, Claudia?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah, Thank you. My question is will Director Whitmore and myself be
able to participate by phone?
DOUG TISDALE: No ma'am, sorry.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK. So that's fine. So how will we know when you're out of the executive
functions?
DOUG TISDALE: Ah, now that's a great question.
DOUG TISDALE: We're going to have Barbara or someone call you back as soon as we're done
with the Executive Session and offer you the opportunity to dial back in. Yes, that's an excellent
question.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: OK?
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you very much.
DOUG TISDALE: Further discussion on the motion? None? All those in favor indicate by saying,
aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Aye.
SHELLEY COOK: Aye.
DOUG TISDALE: Are there any opposed? There are none that passes unanimously. We'll
respectfully ask Mr. Minor to excuse us. Thank you very much for being here, Nate. If you want,
we can contact you as well and let you know. And you can easily dial in also, OK?
So, yeah, leave a card with Barbara here so we got that. And we'll make sure we get back with you
also.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Bye, Nate.
DOUG TISDALE: Now is Natalie coming back? She just left for a minute? Or-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have no idea.
SHELLEY COOK: She's coming back.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, good. All right, now, here, for the sake of the record, let me note that as
of 12:14 PM Mountain Standard Time-[AUDIO OUT - Entered into Executive Session
Separately call Nate, Claudia, and Troy-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Just to let them know that we've concluded exec. And congratulations to all of
you. That was really, timing-wise-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, good discussion.
DOUG TISDALE: --I thought we should be here a lot longer.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm glad that it worked as efficiently as it did.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is Nate out there?
PEGGY CATLIN: Mm-mm. I didn't see him. Apparently, Shontel wants to call in too.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, now are-- are they going to try to call?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Do you have it? OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'll dial in in just a second.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, no, that's fine. Take a minute.
PEGGY CATLIN: That was easier than I thought it would be.

DOUG TISDALE: Absolutely. Let's, formally, for the sake of the record-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I think the whole process-DOUG TISDALE: --let's take a three-minute break so we can have it is a bio break, or a onefunction break, or whatever they call it. So we'll take a one-function break. And we'll come back
on in just a moment.
NATALIE MENTEN: How many minutes do you think that was?
VOICE: RTP's voice conferencing.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: How many minutes, what?
NATALIE MENTEN: How many minutes is the break going to be?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: He said three minutes. He said-- he said three minutes.
SHELLEY COOK: It's 1:27. So that would be 1:30.
VOICE: Thank you. Please hold to enter your conference. If you're the first caller, you will hear
silence until others join.
[BEEP]
BARBARA MCMANUS: Do we have anyone on the line?
SHELLEY COOK: Did somebody call her folks?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, they're calling them.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, good. Let's see Savannah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Here, I'll show you.
SHELLEY COOK: Oh, she's so cute.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: She's just-- we had so much fan.
PEGGY CATLIN: What's this?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Savannah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh.
SHELLEY COOK: Who else?

PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, I found out that Kyle and Lucy are going to have a boy.
[AUDIO OUT]
DOUG TISDALE: The open portion of this Executive Committee meeting. And we are now
turning to other matters. And relative to other matters, I believe that, among other things, Ms.
McManus wanted to confirm with us some procedural details. But let me, just for the sake of the
record, indicate that the Executive Committee has performed its function because it indicated that
it wishes, indicating the top two each of internal and external applicants.
That information will be shared on a confidential basis with the directors. I think Ms. McManus
can get that out today. They'll have that. And then the full Board, of course, as we said, we'll
consider everybody, the full packet, on next Thursday at 5:30 PM.
OK, now Ms. McManus, what specifically did you want to make sure that we addressed?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So there's some additional elements that need to be spoken about in
terms of moving forward with the process. So I'd like to know what your thoughts are on those,
what the interview process looked like, what the timing looks like, interview schedule.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, I think that-- I went back over our original notes when we
started working on it. And so we slated that January 2, we would have a special Board meeting.
And the Board members would have, by then, selected their two top internal and external
candidates.
And then it would be open for discussion at the discussion Board meeting, but with the option of
opening it up because some Board members may have more than two candidates. And so that
would be the forum in which we would have a robust discussion about potential candidates.
Yeah, if you remember, we talked about having a discussion of the process first before at the outset
of the meeting. I don't remember us actually saying that the Board as a whole would come up with
the top two. But even-- I'm glad for the discussion that there would be-- we could broaden it if we
wished because there were a lot that were, like, pressed in there.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I don't remember that the Board would come up with two each other. So
I thought it was this committee that-DOUG TISDALE: I don't believe there is-- yeah. I don't believe we have anything specific. We
did have a recommendation that each Board member come to the meeting with a narrowed list.
And I think it wasn't top two in each. I think we said four, come forward with four names.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, so I tried-DOUG TISDALE: And that was just as an easy discussion point that's in no way of limiting.

SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, in fact, I hope that we don't identify our top four simply through a
number crunching exercise because this-- just this discussion we've had, has been really beneficial,
because you can see our top two shifted once we've had a chance discussed among ourselves. And
I think the Board as a whole could see that kind of, you know, development of thinking.
I called all the non-executive committee people that I could reach this morning. I've tried every
one of them. But I reached about six or seven of them. And they generally-- Claudia Folska's on
the line. And I think Shontel might be on the line. So they can express what they said.
But, generally, people were interested in interviewing more than before, especially if it included
only two external. So I think there's, you know, one person said five or six external. One person
said eight. One said six. One said five external. Once said six. One said four or five. So I think
there is a significant number who wanted to look at a broader group. But we'll let-DOUG TISDALE: Well, and to confirm what you said, that's exactly what the resolution says. The
suggestion, and it was only that that the Board office sent out was try to give us your top four. And
that was not broken down internal or external.
It was just try to give us your top four so that we have the same kind of discussion we had here.
And just get some focus because if there is no direction, then we're duty bound to talk about 41
candidates. And I don't think anybody is interested in spending Thursday night talking about 41
candidates.
PEGGY CATLIN: Maybe 40.
DOUG TISDALE: The Board is to determine-[SIDE CONVERSATION]
--some appropriate number of individuals to interview.
SHELLEY COOK: How about-DOUG TISDALE: And that could be three, four, five, or six.
SHELLEY COOK: How about having the Board identify five or six, whether internal or external,
and then deciding how many of those we want to interview once we've kind of winnowed out and
discussed et cetera?
DOUG TISDALE: I think you've just said what I just said. I just said the Board as a whole will
then determine some appropriate number of candidates to interview. That's what the Board will
do. Now, we could send out another note today when we send out, here's what the Executive
Committee has determined. Please come in with a list of five or six, or so.

We could say that. We say five or six, or so of your top candidates, whether internal or external,
to make it clear that it's just-- give us some sense because we really don't want to spend all night
going through. Is it 41 or 40? I forget.
SHELLEY COOK: 41.
DOUG TISDALE: 41. Yeah. We don't want through all 41. I think it just makes sense. So, yes,
Barbara can send that memo today to the full Board saying, please, when you come on Thursday,
have five or six, or so, of your top candidates, whether internal or external, in mind so we can try
to focus the discussion.
PEGGY CATLIN: Have a meaningful discussion.
DOUG TISDALE: OK? Say it again.
PEGGY CATLIN: So we can have a meaningful discussion.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I think that-- I think that will be manageable. I also think that-- I think
most people are evaluating fairly consistently, at least if you take the sample of five here. And so
I have a feeling there's going to be some logical emerging candidates, I guess. So-DOUG TISDALE: I might ask also if we could have something like this dry erase Board handy
and maybe do the same kind of exercise just so people can visualize who were we talking about
that might be helpful. Yes?
JEFF WALKER: I'd like to have a cap on the number of potentials, just so nobody feels like, well,
I only brought in five because I'm trying to play fair, and then somebody brings in seven, right?
So I want to-- so we can avoid that.
DOUG TISDALE: What do you think?
SHELLEY COOK: Five, six, or so I liked what you had said-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I thought it was too vague. I would like to see your top-- up to
top-- up to 10. Up to 10 or, you know, so that they know, oh, I could pick up to 10. I think most
people won't.
I really just-- you know, I think we heard eight. We heard seven. We've heard six, but up to 10
candidates. But you're not required to have 10 kind of deal. And then cap the-DOUG TISDALE: Up to 10. But don't feel compelled to select 10.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. I mean, whatever it is that you-- is moving you. But no
more than 10.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, so up to 10?
SHELLEY COOK: I would probably limit it to eight. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Would you?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, I mean I don't care, but-SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: I'd say five.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, you're saying up to five, up to eight?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Eight.
SHELLEY COOK: Eight.
DOUG TISDALE: Up to 10?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No, eight is fine.
DOUG TISDALE: Eight?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm fine with eight.
DOUG TISDALE: I'm going to say eight.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Why don't we just say eight?
SHELLEY COOK: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Pick up to eight.
PEGGY CATLIN: But don't feel compelled to pick eight.
DOUG TISDALE: Don't feel compelled to pick eight.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. You don't-- it's not a requirement.

DOUG TISDALE: Up to eight, whether internal or external.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Right.
DOUG TISDALE: No division there. You pick up to eight. Don't feel compelled to pick all eight,
whether internal or external, OK? Is that-- all right, so that's the consensus of the Executive
Committee that we will communicate to the full Board today the selections by the Executive
Committee top two, internal and external, and then say, dear Board members please present on
Thursday night with up to eight. Don't feel compelled to pick all eight candidates, whether internal
or external for discussion purposes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: OK?
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Understood? Understood. Are you OK with that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, I'm fine with it.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I just-- I'm just trying to put together a timeline here so I know what
I'm working with. So then that's-DOUG TISDALE: So that's Thursday night.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. Hopefully, it's just Thursday night, but we have Friday night out
there as well should we don't meet consensus. Then would-- what would you say on a preliminary
basis where dates we would be looking at for setting up interviews?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. So-PEGGY CATLIN: Are they-- are they going-- they're going to be interviewing with the entire
Board.
DOUG TISDALE: That's how the process was contemplated.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's why we talked about all of the questions and that kind of thing.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Can I ask a question about that? Could we do the first
interview either in person or by Skype?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We are already testing that. We tested that today.
DOUG TISDALE: And, in fact, yes, the Board office has already arranged for software and
hardware as necessary so that we have the capacity to do either a Skype or a GoToMeeting.
BARBARA MCMANUS: In this room.
DOUG TISDALE: --connection.
SHELLEY COOK: Good. That's great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Can I-- can I make a suggestion of Thursday, January 9 for
interviews? That would give-- we'd be in session and then have our Board meeting on Tuesday
and then this on Thursday.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, if we extend and make a decision on Friday the 3rd, then we can't
even call anybody until Monday the 6th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's two days before interviews are-PEGGY CATLIN: I am-- I am out of town from the 12th to the 16th.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh.
PEGGY CATLIN: I've got TRB.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, the other idea is the 7th, we already have a special Board meeting called
then. I mean, I recognize it's different from what we ever do. But everybody is already planning to
come that night. I don't know if that would be too short.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Tuesday, the seventh?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, it would be-DOUG TISDALE: So you're saying interview candidates on the Tuesday-SHELLEY COOK: Potentially.
DOUG TISDALE: --January 7.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, and this is something to talk about.

BARBARA MCMANUS: And this is a day's notice?
SHELLEY COOK: Well, this is some-- let's say it's the 2nd. Maybe some of the locals would be
available. And or-- who knows, you know? We're going things by phone call too, Skype. So it's
just one possibility. And we'd have to get a sense from the Board as a whole as to whether it's OK
with that.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's what it comes down to.
SHELLEY COOK: I do too.
DOUG TISDALE: I am averse to the notion of that this committee will now select dates for
interviews.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No, no, no. I'm looking for a range because I have to know what my
team is looking at.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: I mean, you hear the earliest suggestion here is, let's interview them all on
Tuesday, January 7.
SHELLEY COOK: Or as many as we can on that day.
DOUG TISDALE: Or as many as we can. And I think that's going to be rejected by the Board. But
I think it's a good offer to make. Then we hear that First Vice Chair, and after the 7th, we don't
know what position anybody holds, except for me, from the 12th through the 16th, you said?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. I mean, I have not made my flight reservations. But-- so I can be somewhat
flexible. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can you call in on Skype?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, exactly. Could-PEGGY CATLIN: If I could call in on Skype, that would be-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Well, you can-- yeah, you can go up to at least five, at least, because I've
done that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Just on my home.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And then you could be e-mailing if you need anything, you know?
PEGGY CATLIN: Well, I would prefer not to, but I could probably make that work with the one
provision that if my committee is meeting at that time-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You wouldn't be able to do that.
PEGGY CATLIN: Then I would not be able to do that.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
PEGGY CATLIN: And I can find out-DOUG TISDALE: Is this TRB?
PEGGY CATLIN: TRB. I can find out the specific agenda and when I would be available.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great.
PEGGY CATLIN: But, yeah, it's my last year on that committee. So I feel compelled to go.
DOUG TISDALE: No, that should not be something that gets interrupted unless it's absolutely
necessary. But we do hear then that we do have the possibility for between-- and, realistically, I'm
going to take out in this discussion, and I will suggest to the Board that we take out Saturdays and
Sundays.
I think we've already imposed enough on Board members. I spent 18 hours yesterday. I don't know
about you. And it's a little much to say let's spend Saturday doing this. That said, the 12th or 13th,
I will say, through the 17th is another possible week.
And I think that's a much more realistic one for trying to schedule this. But we have to be as
considerate as we can because the contemplation is, you know, to interview by special Board
meeting. And so this is a full Board process with 15 people engaged.
Now, there was discussion, and that's something that I think is appropriate for us to raise now,
because the Executive Committee was to conduct a preliminary screening of the applicants and
generally oversee the process. We've conducted a preliminary screening of the applications now
by virtue of the action we've taken.
The issue is for the debate-- the debate-- the interviews. We were talking about potentially
assigning however many interviewees we get, but assigning three, four, or five directors as the
persons who would be asking questions of the individuals rather than saying we'll have all 15
directors each get assigned one question, because we have about-PEGGY CATLIN: Eight.

DOUG TISDALE: A dozen? Eight? How many questions or so-ish?
PEGGY CATLIN: I think we have eight.
SHELLEY COOK: It was eight.
DOUG TISDALE: Eight.
PEGGY CATLIN: It was eight, right?
DOUG TISDALE: OK. So we have eight questions. So we probably want to have four directors.
Right. Each doing two questions.
SHELLEY COOK: How do you see follow up happening? If somebody-- not on the panel.
DOUG TISDALE: Well, I think it's a logical kind of connection thing. Now, the issue arises if a
director says, oh, but I really want to ask a follow up question of Fred or Barney or Betty-- I use
those names deliberately so nobody thinks I'm talking about anybody we talked about.
So I want to ask a follow up question of Fred. And I'm not on the list of four. I demand to be heard.
What do you want to do about that?
SHELLEY COOK: I don't want to restrict it too much. I like the idea of being able to ask follow
up questions. And it may be that somebody who's not on that panel of four has a question that
others would have, you know?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That's very relevant.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, it is.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: So-DOUG TISDALE: The problem is, how do you make it the same across the Board, say, where
you're treating people differently when you interview them?
SHELLEY COOK: No. I think what you say is we're going to have these four people asking our
questions. We've already agreed to the questions.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: So that's one thing. But the follow up questions that may occur to people as
they listen, I want not to say, oh, sorry, you're not on the panel four. You can't, therefore, ask
questions. This really is so important in an interview. Let's say it's 45 minutes long with 15 minutes
in between, then, you know, asking eight questions, does that take a half hour?

And then we have 15 minutes for follow up questions? So just limit it by the number of the amount
of time, and then I would hope that the person facilitating would be conscious of, OK, Shelley,
you've talked quite a bit here in terms of follow up. Let's open it up to other people as well. So, I
mean, that's-I mean-- and I think it will be up to the facilitator to determine whether the question is really a
follow up, or is it-- did you just bring something in out of left field because you really wanted to
talk about that all along, and you weren't given the chance? So you said, well, I have a follow up.
And then you completely switched directions. Who gets to call the balls and strikes on that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we're going to have, I believe, Roger Vesely from HR is-DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, the facilitator.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --going to be the facilitator. And if he-- you know, if he might say if
you asked that question, you're perfectly welcome to. But you have to ask it of every candidate.
DOUG TISDALE: Every other candidate.
PEGGY CATLIN: Right. Right.
DOUG TISDALE: And what happens if you don't ask it of the first tow, and you ask it of the third
one?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, so [CHUCKLE]. So the follow up is something where you ask for
elaboration or, you know, you mention this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Clarification. Clarification.
SHELLEY COOK: And so that doesn't seem like it needs to be-DOUG TISDALE: No, that-BARBARA MCMANUS: The Chair said if someone changes directions-DOUG TISDALE: That's right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --how would we handle that?
DOUG TISDALE: As I said, if we come out left field-SHELLEY COOK: OK, got it.
DOUG TISDALE: --that's the issue. No, if you say, we asked you how you would now make this
up. We asked you how you would improve removing gravel from the bed rock quarry.

And you said, you would use more trucks. Can you expand on where you would get the money or
how you would handle more trucks? That's a follow up, OK?
But if the question was asked, how are you going to get gravel out of the bedrock quarry? And
then somebody says, oh, I have a follow up. I want to know, is it true that you've been sleeping
with Betty, and Barney doesn't know it?
[LAUGHTER]
That's not a follow up, is it? But somebody could ask that. And I use an extreme example. I
exaggerate to illustrate. The point is, at some point it is so-- you know, it's so extraneous that it's
not really a follow up. Somebody has to be able to say, you know, we can't go there.
SHELLEY COOK: So Roger's is going to be our person. Is he-- he's done this kind of facilitating
before. He'll be a neutral third party.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, he's the head of recruitment of RTD.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, he's the head of HR and recruitment. So we figure if anybody-PEGGY CATLIN: That's a good switch.
DOUG TISDALE: --along with Jennifer knows the law, he does, right?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, OK, good. That's great.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We did not have time to go out and get someone a third party. I'll talk
a little bit about some of the other things we are doing in a little bit, but-PEGGY CATLIN: Well, and I think, you know, Director Williams was pretty adamant that we use
HR for the interim search.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: So I think that's-- I'm happy with that.
DOUG TISDALE: I think it's very valid. I think it's very valid.
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, I do too. I just think that's-DOUG TISDALE: It serves a good purpose.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's good.
DOUG TISDALE: So, now, oh, I'm sorry. Go on first, because I want an answer Director Menten's
questions.

JEFF WALKER: OK, I don't know. I didn't cancel your original question was answered about
what to do with that fifth person, that fifth interviewee who doesn't have a question identified, a
specified question to ask. I guess some draw straws or-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, no, we're going to have to come up with some kind of procedure for that.
And that's going to be, I think, we can talk generally about it. I would suggest, for your
consideration, that just as we did this, first we get through the discussion of people to see, you
know, because what if we end up with just six.
And we say, you know what? I think everybody is satisfied. This is the pool of six. That's different
than if we end up with eight, and then somebody says, no, but I demand we have nine. You know,
it's a different process, or we may end up with five.
So that's going to help direct some of this. Then we say, let's talk about other matters because I
have come back to Director Menten's questions that she has. And we'll find out how best to deal
with that after. So that's either Thursday night or sometime on Friday we'll discuss that part of the
process.
JEFF WALKER: OK, thanks.
DOUG TISDALE: OK? Other thoughts and questions before I let Director Menten into the
discussion here.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: And then I'll go to the phone too.
BARBARA MCMANUS: For process? Is it process?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, it was a process-- yeah, she had a process question that she asked before.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: And I apologize. I don't remember.
NATALIE MENTEN: That's all right. So first of all is, did you narrow-- did you nail down
timeline? Because all I've got written down so far is Thursday, January 2. That's the first question
I've got.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, the meetings that are scheduled currently, Thursday, January 2 and Friday,
January 3 are already scheduled-NATALIE MENTEN: If necessary.

DOUG TISDALE: --and noticed meetings. In addition to that, there is a scheduled and noticed
special meeting of the Board on Tuesday, January 7 for the purpose of selecting a new Executive
Committee. That's already on the books.
PEGGY CATLIN: And a safety Executive Session.
DOUG TISDALE: Pardon?
PEGGY CATLIN: And a safety Executive Session.
DOUG TISDALE: And a safety Executive Session. Thank you for the clarification. That's right.
We have that annual Executive Session where they show us the secret passage and so forth. I say
that just to make people curious, you know, because they're all saying, there's a secret passage? I
didn't know there was a-[LAUGHTER]
Then on Wednesday, January 8 at noon, the new Executive Committee will convene and will have
its meeting. The proposal for when do we do interviews has ranged from Tuesday, January 7
because these people should be ready, they should drop everything, and maybe that's true too, if
they're really interested, to January 13 through 17 as being possible dates for interviews.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think somebody also brought up the 9th.
SHELLEY COOK: I did. Thursday the 9th.
DOUG TISDALE: And Thursday the 9th.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. So as early as Tuesday, January 7, Thursday, January 9 or Monday,
January, what did I say? Just 12?
SHELLEY COOK: 13th.
DOUG TISDALE: 13th, thank you. 13th or the 14th or the 15th or the 16th or the 17th. But
somewhere within that time limit because, once again, there is in the motion an urgent goal-- urgent
goal of making the appointment effective by the date of Dave Jones departure, which is January
20. So that's where we are. Now-NATALIE MENTEN: All right. So and this is going-- I'm sorry. What are you going to say?
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say, that having been said, there's a lot more to the timing to
discuss because Director Walker as the secretary of the Executive Committee has circulated a
memo relative to timing and the 14-day rule. And at some point, I don't know if you want to do it

now or if you want to do it on Thursday night, Deputy General Counsel has to make sure that the
directors understand the 14-day rule. OK. Go on.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right, so then next, which I'm looking forward to that discussion because
this is very tight, and there's concerns. Next is-- is folks start with, let's say we go into this. But we
know we're going to go into this January 2 discussion. And let's just say, potentially, we narrow it
down to two and two, two external, two internal. Are those fine rules? And trigger the 14th day. I
think that-DOUG TISDALE: Now you see then. You're going, right to where I said. And I did tell her that
she didn't have to answer that fully now, but she's going to have to answer it fully on Thursday
night. So if you want to do a dry run, of you're answer.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Well, I-- Rolf and I are working on a memo to you to help you find
you some guidance on that. But, basically, what the statute says is you have to give notice of the
finalized 14-- for 14 days before you can make the appointment. So if your goal is the 20th, you
got to back out of that.
And so you need to think through that. Now, the-- as I think might be clear to some of you that
finalist exception is not particularly clear, doesn't say, you know, a specific number. It does say if
there's a candidate-- if there's less than three candidates, they're all finalized.
So I think when you're at the final stage of the selection process, if that is the four, and you're
between four, I would suggest that that would be the finalist. And, basically, the current statute
says that those are the-- the materials that have been provided by the finalists have to be disclosed.
So that's kind of the big-- the big substantive issue with determining whether they're finalized.
SHELLEY COOK: Can I ask for clarification on that? If we don't consider this step on the second
to be a final stage, in other words, we're just identifying people we'd like to talk to, you know,
interview, because we really are going on two sheets of paper, basically, in a lot of cases, then that
wouldn't-- I mean, we could clearly state this is not a final stage, correct? We could state that this
is just deciding whom to interview, who to talk-- take to the next step.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Correct. But at some point, you will have to designate-SHELLEY COOK: Correct.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: --who are the finalists and disclose those materials 14 days before
you can make the appointment.
JEFF WALKER: However, if-- thank you. If we come out-- come out of that meeting with three
or fewer, then those are automatically finalists.
SHELLEY COOK: Right. Yes.
DOUG TISDALE: Final.

JEFF WALKER: And so-- so if I can ask one-JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Yes, that's very good.
DOUG TISDALE: Please.
JEFF WALKER: One question, this does apply to an Interim General Manager?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: I-- so the statute just says specifically executive position. So it
doesn't designate-- make a distinction between interim and not interim.
JEFF WALKER: So anybody holds that seat, for no matter how long, whether by contract or by-PEGGY CATLIN: Would be-JEFF WALKER: GM is GM. It doesn't-- interim is irrespective?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: I think the statute doesn't specifically clarify. So if you-- out of an
abundance of caution, would apply it.
JEFF WALKER: OK. I understand. I just wanted to ask that question because it's still a question.
Thank you.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: It's a good question.
DOUG TISDALE: Conclude with your questions.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, so that opened up the door then for what is available to us, before that
finalist moment and after the finalist moment, as to how do we do our job and doing reference
check, background check, and not having our hands bound?
DOUG TISDALE: No, well, we can do that now. That said, you raised the point, I want to call
references, I believe was the quote from you. I want to call the references myself and say, hi, this
is Natalie Menten, I'm a member of the Board of Directors. Fred Flintstone has applied. What do
you think of Fred? Tell me.
That's what you asked the right to do. I have suggested that that may be inopportune, may be
inappropriate, but, nonetheless, it's what you've requested. That doesn't mean you get to do it. It
means you request it, and the Board gets to consider.
I believe that HR will be conducting the background searches and the reference checks in the first
instance. You would like to replicate that process is what I hear. I think it's up to the Board as to
whether Board members will be authorized to replicate the process.
NATALIE MENTEN: So that was part of the question, I-- because let's say right now it's not clear
to me what would we get out of HR, what would that be filtered, and when you have a phone

conversation with somebody, phone-- old phone game tell people something. What did they hear
out of it? What did they write down? What did they provide in the file? I'm not clear what we
would have from that.
So that's just a question that I've got. Yes. And just like I look at some of the resumes, and I see
this was my perspective, and I did this under-budget, and whatever they say there means it needs
to be fact checked. Everything. So-JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Can I clarify one thing out of that?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: So the statute does say that letters of reference, even for finalized,
do not need to be disclosed. So just to keep that in mind.
NATALIE MENTEN: So I'm not clear of the answer on this whole background check. Are we
going to do a full-blown criminal, all of it-- above-BARBARA MCMANUS: That's standard.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. And then what would we get on if, let's say, we didn't have the option
to call up a Board Director or Commissioner or somebody? What would we get in this reference
check?
SHELLEY COOK: So do you-- do you know?
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: So they're going to ask some standard questions. They will have to go
through drug testing at some point before being hired. That hopefully could take place on a second
interview, which I'm assuming would happen for what is considered the finalists but if we're going
to be doing especially external via Skype or some sort of remote.
I don't know what the standard questions are, at that level, what they would ask. I just know that,
you know, opening it up to 15 directors to call whoever they feel they want to call is just not good.
It's not professional. It doesn't make us look good. And it makes the process look unprofessional.
PEGGY CATLIN: There are some pretty strict protocols for questions you can-BARBARA MCMANUS: And can't ask.
PEGGY CATLIN: --you cannot ask.
NATALIE MENTEN: And I would ask that Roger Vesical or Velesy?
PEGGY CATLIN: Vesely

NATALIE MENTEN: Vesely, before any decision is made give us the sheet that indicates the
normal across-the-board questions for reference and especially, at SLT technical level, what are
those questions. Drug testing is actually the least of my concerns.
I'm assuming he's not a heroin addict, or she. So that's something I'm not clear about, and it is
already quite difficult to find some of these searching social media, the internet, and it's quite
challenging.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I would say that, you know, the Directors are certainly welcome to be
checking out Facebook and LinkedIn on any-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
BARBARA MCMANUS: --on any of these candidates, which, by the way, I've done on all of
them that were out there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have as well. I have as well.
DOUG TISDALE: I will suggest, by the way, when you use a LinkedIn search, you might think
about turning on your privacy settings.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I don't do LinkedIn because the can see.
DOUG TISDALE: So they don't know who is looking. They just have a general title.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: So I-- I want to just clarify that. So when you're doing social media
searches, make sure that you're just looking at information that's publicly available, that you're not
asking the candidates for their account information or that you're asking them to be your
connection so that you can see more information than you would as a regular member of the public.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm looking at articles that are published of-- something that's
public so that-JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Exactly.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --it gives me a clear idea. Yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: The big thing for me, what kind of dog do they own.
[LAUGHTER]
DOUG TISDALE: And here's the point-NATALIE MENTEN: Note to all of us.

DOUG TISDALE: --the notion of individual directors conducting their own background search,
number one, will quickly become public. It is not something that will be able to be kept
confidential. Barbara's already expressed-- I just want to underline that while I'm still sitting in this
chair.
There is literally nothing more unprofessional in terms of having a state agency, and we are a state
agency, looking like we're checking out, in an unprofessional manner, information about people
for a very important, serious job. It just makes us look like hell.
NATALIE MENTEN: Jeez, I talked to a lot of constituents that will go, good job.
DOUG TISDALE: Fine. I hear you. I'm sharing my view on this.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Do you have another question? Because then I want to go to Troy and Claudia
and ask them if they have questions.
NATALIE MENTEN: What law requires that we ask the same questions?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: So this just goes back to the defensible process of having-- that you
have to have evaluative criteria that are related to the job. If you end up asking different questions,
that can sometimes draw concern that you're treating somebody differently. But there's no law that
says specifically you have to ask the same question if it ever came to it.
NATALIE MENTEN: That's good to hear because I think some of the varietyon the-- I think is
quite logical that there would be some different questions. So that answers what I've got. So can
we then get something from Roger?
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah, I'll work with Roger.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's an excellent thought. If Roger can provide a briefing on Thursday
at some point, indicating, by the way, this is what our office does with the applications that you go
through when you say, all right, fine, now I'm down to, let's say, six. We'll actually now scrub
these six.
They're not going to scrub 41 because it's a waste of everyone's time. But when we identify six or
five or four or whatever number we identify, he will describe what they will do. And I think that's
a very fair question. And we do need to know that.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Director Folska, let me go to you first on a seniority basis. Do you have any
questions that you want to share with us now? I'll give you a minute during your mute off in case
you're still there. Director Folska, the question is, do you have any questions you would like to ask
at this point?

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yeah, thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: You're welcome.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: So seeing as [COUGH] that we 14 days right, less 20. That means we need
to know on January 6.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: What's the plan? Because you've got it out to the 13th, the 14th, the 17th.
You have 14 days. And that's after January 20th.
DOUG TISDALE: You got it. You guessed that pretty well.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: So if it takes--[COUGH]. Well, so what is the plan for that?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm not aware of one.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, maybe we should get one right now. Except I believe that the
committee is constrained and cannot come up with one because this has to be a full Board decision.
So the full Board will have to discuss this on Thursday, January 2.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: What is the time frame? So working backwards, what is the gap[INTERPOSING VOICES]
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: You know, we were talking about continuing the interviews, you know, on
January 3 or something like that, you know, and not continuing interviews over the weekend.
DOUG TISDALE: Mhm. That will be for the-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: --full Board to decide. This committee is not allowed to consider that.
SHELLEY COOK: So is it appropriate to discuss the idea of the gap here or an executive decision
for that committee?
DOUG TISDALE: I'm sorry. Say it again.
SHELLEY COOK: Is it just-- is it appropriate to discuss the issue of a gap now or an Executive
Session with the full Board, or what's your thought there?
DOUG TISDALE: No, actually, we can discuss presenting that question to the full Board. Yes.
Yeah. And I think it would be an appropriate discussion to have. And I want to make sure that I

got all of Director Folska's question. But you're absolutely right, yes. OK, other questions, Director
Folska?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Right. So then we have a gap. And then I guess that's what we'll also discuss
at the full Board meeting on the 2nd, is that correct?
DOUG TISDALE: Yes, ma'am.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: OK, that's all I have.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you. Director Whitmore? Any questions from you, Director Whitmore?
TROY WHITMORE: Just one clarifying question here. You had agreed-[AUDIO OUT]
DOUG TISDALE: You all, as Miss McManus said, to submit the questions to her for incorporation
into sort of a master list that we can bring up under "Other Matters." Remember, the discussion
point here is, we'll go into Executive Session as soon as possible on Thursday night.
We will then replicate something similar to the process that we did here in our Executive Session
in order to determine how close we are to a reasonable number of candidates, about whom we can
then open up for full discussion. All right, other questions? Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: So with Thursday's agenda, Thursday the 2nd, if we could, at my request,
open it, make it clear that open meeting for process questions because everybody in this room on
the phone has an advantage. And we don't want to skim. So it's part of that stated agenda.
And then I don't know what the CRS statute, citation, and then we go into that. But so it's really
clear that everyone's prepared going in that that process is part of the discussion before we go in
the Executive Session.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, that's an excellent observation. I think what I will try to do as chair is
give an overview of the general process and then reflect that after we have the Executive Session,
we will then come back into open session and have further discussion. So rather than-- because,
see, I really, literally, do not want to get too bogged down in process before we begin the process
of saying, what are we doing with these candidates? How many of them are truly viable for coming
forward?
So we will have an overview, much as we did here, have an overview of process then go into
Executive Session with the understanding, knowledge, and promise that there will be a full detailed
discussion of process when we come out of the Executive Session and staying as long as directors
desire. We've been doing this process for just over one hour now.
PEGGY CATLIN: So and it's-- at that latter open meeting that Jennifer will provide answers to
those questions?

DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes. Because they won't be appropriate for Executive Session because they are
process questions that-PEGGY CATLIN: No, or for your overview.
DOUG TISDALE: --the attorney has to do in-- yeah, in open session.
SHELLEY COOK: So it might be good to have some flexibility because some things could be
helpful in terms of guiding the discussion in the Executive Session. So I would say, you know,
don't be hard and fast on no process before because maybe -DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, and I think perhaps, and maybe I haven't demonstrated this enough, but
I don't think I've ever been real hard and fast about anything. I've always said, you want to say
something, speak. I've never cut anybody off.
NATALIE MENTEN: So just heads up, not to be difficult, but we have a delay before our video
and transcript is available for the public.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, OK, yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: So if somebody comes, as an example, we had-- you had come for the state
here today.
DOUG TISDALE: And he's back on the line with us now.
NATALIE MENTEN: Oh, he's on now. OK. So in the same way, if we are on this meeting, and
somebody is there sitting, and then they're pretty much shuttled out the door early on, and they
don't want to sit around, I will probably video record the beginning before we go into Executive
Session, after we come out of Executive Session, just so it can be posted and available without
worry about the CC closed captioning.
But it's out there, just part of the process. That's especially why I was asking for before the meeting.
So I'm just giving you a heads up if you see a camcorder, I will turn it off during the Executive
Session. But that would be the purpose as to let the world know as best as possible what is our
process.
DOUG TISDALE: I hear what you say. And by the way, for the record, look, the telephone is open
again during the open session. So people can dial into that meeting as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: If they don't want to stick around.
DOUG TISDALE: Just so you remember. Yes?

PEGGY CATLIN: So my question to Barbara is that we don't have a lot of these things-- these
questions answered until after the 2nd in terms of you developing your timeline, right?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Correct.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And, also, depending on, in my mind, on the 2nd, we have to come out
of Executive Session and have a recommended action to move forward. I mean, we-PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: There will be a vote next Tuesday.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Now-DOUG TISDALE: Thursday.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thursday, sorry. Our plan is to post that meeting with whatever that
recommended action looks like. In my mind, it will be generic in a way, basically, that the Board
has come to consensus to up to eight prospective candidates.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Just so you know that, we will come out, and we will-PEGGY CATLIN: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: --unless we're not to consensus, and we're coming back on Friday, in
which case we'll postpone to the date certain of Friday the 3rd.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And we'll be posting the Friday meeting probably on Monday as well.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK, right. But if Friday does not-- we don't need Friday-BARBARA MCMANUS: You just cancel.
PEGGY CATLIN: Then it's canceled. OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Just to make sure to cancel it. All right.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And we announced that on Thursday, correct?
DOUG TISDALE: Mhm.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. So it is part of the record, of, that we 're-DOUG TISDALE: We have, in fact, already previously announced that. And we will reiterate it
on Thursday. But when we announced these meetings, we have already said, if necessary, the
Board will meet again on Friday, January 3. Yeah, we've already said that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I also want to reiterate that, you know, part of what we'll need to
firm up. And I know everybody wants flexibility, but there are nine different departments that are
involved in every single meeting that we have, that we have to give them notice that they have to
work and that they have to prepare for our meetings.
So-- and, you know, we only have the 24-hour rule, and I'm sure once, or maybe twice, if we have
to pull something together within 24 hours, we can. But I would just like everybody to be cognizant
of the fact that it's just not my staff.
PEGGY CATLIN: Sure.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, that there are other people who are impacted by this, nine departments
in all.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It seems to me that when we send out our information about these
meetings that we should put that in that memo, that this is a collective component that includes
nine different departments. And so it's not just the Board staff working on this.
It's a whole lot of other people because I don't think the Board as a whole knows that. And I just
think it would be something for them to know.
DOUG TISDALE: It might be nice to remind them.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that's right, yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: So just curious-DOUG TISDALE: Before you do, if I may go to Director Walker, and then I'll come back to you.
JEFF WALKER: So I think it'll be beneficial to have some discussion about the process, such as
it is, so that all the Board knows that there are still gaps that exist in there because it might give
them some other-- something else to consider, as before we have this discussion. And as much as
flexibility is appreciated, some of us don't have the luxury of flexibility.

We have obligations outside of this building, this process-- this job, this Earth, this realm, this
singlet. So-[LAUGHTER]
So-- so , I, personally, would like a tighter time frame so I can plan the people who depend on me
to take them around town, just like our passengers like a tight schedule. They don't like that
flexibility that we've been providing over the last few years.
So I would like some discussion, hopefully an extensive discussion, about what this means before
we start talking about the names in that binder.
DOUG TISDALE: I took that as Director Cook's advisement as well. And I think I am wellinformed, and, therefore, will make sure that what I've called the overview is a little more detailed
and that it won't be just a fly by.
It will have some detail in terms of what we have determined pointing out that the final
confirmation process is up to the full Board. And that's what we're looking for so that they know,
because as Ms. McManus has stated as our Executive Manager, when we come out of the
Executive Session, we will have to have a recommended action to come forward.
SHELLEY COOK: Right. Agreed.
DOUG TISDALE: OK? Other thoughts or comments? Did I cut you off, Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: I'm next.
DOUG TISDALE: You're missing?
NATALIE MENTEN: I think I'm next.
DOUG TISDALE: I was going to say, yeah, I know. That's I wanted to make-NATALIE MENTEN: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: --changes because I was asking others first, that had called in.
NATALIE MENTEN: I mean, I'm going after, but OK.
DOUG TISDALE: Then it's you, right?
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, going back to the nine departments, we got HR. We got the [COUGH].
That's 10, I think, it'sSHELLEY COOK: Or is it--

NATALIE MENTEN: Who are the other departments that are-- need to be on Board for our
discussion about-BARBARA MCMANUS: Safety and security. And there's two separate areas of safety and
security that come aboard. We have-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Communications.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Communications. We have legal. We have the Board office. We have
the-- the setup team. I can't remember what they call themselves, the ones that set up and break
down.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: IT?
DOUG TISDALE: Facilities management.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Facilities management.
SHELLEY COOK: IT.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Pardon? Pardon me?
PEGGY CATLIN: IT.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We have IT. We have Catering. That's external. But it's still a
coordination. How many are we at?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Eight. And-BARBARA MCMANUS: I don't know. I'll get back to you on the nine.
DOUG TISDALE: From memory, that was excellent.
PEGGY CATLIN: That was really good.
DOUG TISDALE: Is that sufficient for your needs at this point in time, Director Menten?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, sir.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you, much.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Appreciate it. Other questions, thoughts, comments, concerns, issues?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: You know, the only thing I would have to say is that this exercise
for the Board is their elected responsibility. This is what we got into office for. And this is one of
our main responsibilities. And so I have no problem putting in the time that needs to be put into
this time-SHELLEY COOK: For critical-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: For a critical decision.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, I agree.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, I appreciate you're saying that. It comes back, again, to my comment,
this literally is, without question, the most important job that the Board has, period. Everything
else flows from this. So, yes, and it does take an awful lot of time. And we're doing that.
Any-- yes, Miss McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So I just want to go over really quickly-- usually, not here, but in my
past life, usually, the start of the search for the permanent has already been happening. And in this
case, it hasn't been. So timing-wise, we're a little bit behind.
And we have generic RFPs that are put together for executive search and also for a communications
liaison that will need to be reviewed pretty quickly after the first of the year to move forward and
figure out-- figuring out what we're going to do there.
We would need to also be looking at if there were any changes to the job description of the General
Manager. We went with the same job description of the current General Manager for the interim.
But I'm not sure if there's any changes that may be required to that job description that the Board
may want.
And so, you know, those are the really big things that we really have to get going. There is quite a
bit of outreach and scheduling, as we talked about it, you know, some of the averages of how long
a search normally takes. I would hope that we're going to be able to write the RFP to have an end
date.
But that is all contingent on how the decision is made for the full Board to run this operation. And
I just want everybody to be cognizant of the timeline. The last thing in the world we want is this
to go past December 31, 2020, when seven new Board Directors get to make this decision after
not being part of the process.
And we're looking at that possibility. So as we're making decisions that may cause delays along
the way, I want everybody to be cognizant of that up front.
So
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: One of the first orders of business once we--

[INTERPOSING VOICES]
SHELLEY COOK: --committee will need to do that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you, and that's it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: No, that's good. And I didn't quite hear the last comment, but I would think
that there's no way that this Board wants a separate committee doing all this. But, rather, the full
Board will do all this. And I'll certainly be an advocate for that. Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: I'd like to just speak right now that spending $30,000 to $40,000,
potentially, $70,000, $80,000, on a public outreach subcontractor seems to me a really bad waste
of our taxpayers' money. And if we are going out to the public about service changes, perhaps
these meetings should be brought together and maximized.
Maybe they're intertwined to that as to what the public wants to see in the General Manager
because we have such a tight timeline. But I would hope that we would not issue the RFP to, again,
spend tens of thousands of dollars, which is what some low income people would hope to earn in
a whole year, just for doing a few meetings. That's speaking on the record for the penny pincher,
Natalie. Thanks.
DOUG TISDALE: Designated pitcher.
SHELLEY COOK: I think that Jeff Walker wants to speak.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, I'm sorry to-- thank you.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. I had one other question for Ms. Ross-Amato.
DOUG TISDALE: Go ahead.
JEFF WALKER: So one other thing I'm not sure-- sure of is if-- the finalist, one that we choose to
see, is an internal candidate, does that internal candidate, or employee, I guess, current employee,
get to negotiate the salary because we are not following that replacement process that we had that
identifies either 10% of the bottom, 10% increase from the bottom of the pay scale? I don't know
because I'm not following what is written.
DOUG TISDALE: Oh, all right. So the question as I hear is, our policy has been if an internal
candidate is selected for the position of Interim General Manager, that internal candidate gets a
10% raise or the bottom of the designated range for the General Manager position, whichever is
more.

JEFF WALKER: Correct.
DOUG TISDALE: And that's how it reads. The question being asked of council is, has this process,
because of the way it has evolved through this special resolution, changed that, or are we in a
position to say on Thursday, if we select an internal candidate, we know the cost because our
policy has already set that, and they know that going in that they will get either a 10% raise or the
bottom of the range for the position?
JEFF WALKER: That's correct. Thank you for putting that-DOUG TISDALE: No, I just want to make sure that we all understand.
SHELLEY COOK: I thought that we-PEGGY CATLIN: I thought that Rolf already answered that. We need to ask him that. So-JEFF WALKER: I didn't hear that.
SHELLEY COOK: Something to discuss or have more information about.
Yeah, I think it's-- well, how it has happened in the past was that it's a total negotiation. There are
no guidelines given. I mean, you can give the candidate guidelines, and they can choose to go
forward or not.
JEFF WALKER: For an external interim.
BARBARA MCMANUS: For an external.
DOUG TISDALE: We're just talking interim. I know.
JEFF WALKER: Interim.
PEGGY CATLIN: Internal.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: The questions is confined to internal.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It was the same, wasn't it?
DOUG TISDALE: It kind of -- the question.
SHELLEY COOK: It was the same.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It was the same.

DOUG TISDALE: I think Rolf did-- Rolf did answer it.
BARBARA MCMANUS: And that is the answer.
DOUG TISDALE: The answer is-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, it follows the process.
DOUG TISDALE: --we're stuck with that.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes, it does follow the process internally.
DOUG TISDALE: But that question, because you can hear now, lack of certainty.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Well, let-- let me just clarify. I mean, we live in an at-will state,
which means that each side of the employment relationship can choose to enter that relationship
or not. So we can't control what the ultimate selected candidate wants.
We can control how we respond to that. So I think your question is, how does the RTD Board
believe that it can respond to that question?
DOUG TISDALE: Respectfully, that's not quite the question. The question is, RTD has a policy
for an internal, Interim Executive Director.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Right.
DOUG TISDALE: The General Manager, CEO, of you get either 10% increase or the lower of-the lowest value in the room. That's a policy that RTD has. So we've already made a determination
on both external and internal candidates. I believe Rolf told us that's right. That's what we have.
We need you to be able to clarify that because as I understand, Rolf will not be there on Thursday.
And we need to have you be able to respond to that question because, as I said, you hear lack of
certainty in terms of the understanding around this table, you need to provide a certainty.
JEFF WALKER: True. We do have that policy, but we are not following that policy for this
process.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: For the whole process since we've already done so many other things. Right.
JEFF WALKER: So-- so I didn't hear Rolf-DOUG TISDALE: Well, the question.
JEFF WALKER: --express that. So that's why I asked you because I didn't have that too.

SHELLEY COOK: So you're saying because we're not following the policy, does that therefore
release us from adherence to that one piece for an internal candidate?
JEFF WALKER: And, yes, and the internal candidate also.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah?
SHELLEY COOK: Three quick things-SHELLEY COOK: --if that's OK. Just remembering what one of the Board members said when
we were discussing the scoring that-- that the ranking, you know, assembling the number of people
that were, you know, that were discussing, after everybody gives their eight or whatever, isn't done
on the basis of score because one person's 100 might be different from another person's 100.
DOUG TISDALE: Absolutely.
SHELLEY COOK: So that was one-DOUG TISDALE: Thank you. Yeah. That's a very important clarification. Let's take a minute,
please, just to expand upon that because I think some people might be confused. And they say,
well, that person only got a cumulative score of 412. This person got-- yeah, but some people are
high graders and some people are low graders.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
DOUG TISDALE: That's your point, yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: That was purposely for an individual to decide.
DOUG TISDALE: Right. Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: How to help them.
SHELLEY COOK: Right. The only reason is I noticed that this one had a score listed.
DOUG TISDALE: Exactly.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, then the second thing is-DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.

SHELLEY COOK: You triggered a thought when I was calling around. One of the persons said,
hey, do we even need recruitment? Because, you know, we've gotten 41 responses.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
SHELLEY COOK: And it's been such a strong thing. So be prepared for that to come up just as a
matter of discussion.
DOUG TISDALE: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: And then the third thing has to do with whether we want to announce-- I think
the fact that we had that good response is good. It's a good thing. It signalled that there is interest
and commitment to the agency. And so I'm just hoping-- I know it's been on Facebook.
But I'm wanting some unanimity about what we say in terms of the number of people and our
pleasure of having that number, or something like that. So do you all-- yeah?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, I want to build on that. This really goes in line with the
TBM component piece, you know, something that goes out that says, we are absolutely thrilled to
have received-PEGGY CATLIN: At our response.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: At our response, blah, blah, blah. And, additionally, this year,
we're going-- we're going to also implement a telecommuting component of something so that it
shows that we're really thinking outside of the box.
DOUG TISDALE: Well said. I think that's an excellent point, and we will make sure that that gets
preserved and communicated. Yes, sir?
JEFF WALKER: So the people who responded to this for the interim might be vastly different and
somewhat different than who would respond to it first.
SHELLEY COOK: They might. Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: I-- I would suspect some. Some of them might not want to leave a job if they
have a job or come out of retirement for something that might last more than 4 to 14 months.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's true.
JEFF WALKER: --some time beyond that, lasting beyond that. So I wouldn't expect this to be
representative of what we might get for a permanent-SHELLEY COOK: Good point.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, especially with the legislature looking at us and other things. So--

PEGGY CATLIN: There's some overlap in but not-JEFF WALKER: Yeah, there's some overlap. You know-JEFF WALKER: I'm dedicated to this position. And you can read, who was it, the guy who used
to work back for StreetsBlog. I can count on one hand the number of meetings I've missed. There's
no question about my dedication to this agency. And this is since my daughter was one. She's nine
now.
This is taking time away that I could be staying with her over the holidays. I-- anyway, so I will
do what's necessary. But the unnecessary stuff is really, really draining on me, especially this time
of year. And some of you have met my roommate and knows what she needs.
This-- this stuff is unnecessary. When I got on Board-- I'm going to drift here. When I got on the
Board, I was told that RTD had-- the Board had historically been a bunch of old, retired people. I
can understand why. I've done this with a kid, part of it as a single parent, now as a caretaker and
a single parent.
So, please, whatever we can do to cut this process down, that's-- the message I'm getting is, yeah,
this ain't for young people, for people who actually use the system in all kinds of circumstances.
This is for folks who don't have jobs.
SHELLEY COOK: Well, we all work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, no, I disagree.
SHELLEY COOK: All but one or two of us were.
JEFF WALKER: I'm getting to speak I get the floor. I get my opinion.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: So whatever we can do to cut down this process would be greatly appreciated
by me and the people that depend on me and people who might want to run in the future and, say,
yeah, I got a family. But I saw him do it. I can do it too. That's all.
PEGGY CATLIN: I think that's a good point.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you. All right. Director?
PEGGY CATLIN: No, I think that's a fair point. And, also, because it's put a great deal of
additional burden on the staff, I think we need to at least acknowledge that we'll tried to streamline
whatever we can.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, and I wish to point out that I've had the privilege today of doing the
reviews of both John McKay and Barbara McManus. And I have told them that I personally am

nominating them for sainthood. They have performed exceptionally well, above and beyond
anyone's possible expectations given all the various things that have been thrown at them this year.
And I think it is amazing. And I personally am delighted that they are still here with us because,
as we look at a transition to a new Executive Committee next year, we have a new General Counsel
coming in. We have a new General Manager coming in. We have a new Executive Committee
coming in.
You don't want to have a new Board Office coming in. So we've got to make sure we retain the
Board Office. That's just my thought. But I thank you for those observations.
And, again, we will try to give as much of this in a reasonable, and I will work hard with Barbara
in making sure it's a succinct script for an overview on Thursday so people understand the process
and know what we're looking to do. Then we have an efficient Executive Session.
But with everyone having their full say, we certainly aren't known for cutting people off and then
have a conclusion, hopefully Thursday night, but maybe Friday, with a recommended action item
on how to proceed from there. Other thoughts for this Executive Committee meeting. Ms
McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: So the RFQ went out in the street today for legal counsel executive
employment agreement. That will be in place by 3:00 PM on January 8 with a final selection made
on the 14th. So no negotiations can really take place until then at that point anyway.
PEGGY CATLIN: That's good to know.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Just, you know, throwing it out there with some of the dates that we
spoke about earlier. I just wanted to let you know also that I did hear from the state auditor, and I
did hear from Spiro and company. And each of those entities are going-- are asking for 30 minutes
on each of the Board members' calendars the week of January 6, which is in a week.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we will-- we will be calling-- you know, my staff will be calling you
and asking you for time and so we can get that scheduled to each of those entities. And then Susan
Spiro will be meeting-- will be the first order of business on the agenda for the Executive
committee meeting on January 8.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Got it.
BARBARA MCMANUS: They'll be here for an hour and a half.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Jennifer had something to say.
DOUG TISDALE: OK. Yes? Counselor?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Just really quick on the RFQ for the Employment Council. If you
want a Board member on the Evaluation Committee, please let me know. We're trying to keep it

simple, but, obviously, because we have a short timeline, but it would be nice to have somebody
that would be actually working with this person during contract negotiations.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. And the point is, this is the position of?
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: This is the outside council that will work with the Board on
negotiating an employment contract for the interim GM and the permanent GM because in-house
counsel has a conflict.
DOUG TISDALE: Right. But it would be the outside counsel for the candidate?
SHELLEY COOK: No.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: No. It's the outside counsel for-SHELLEY COOK: RTD.
DOUG TISDALE: The outside counsel for the Board.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: RTD. RTD.
DOUG TISDALE: Because the outside counsel of the candidate is separately selected. But we, in
the past, and we don't have to do this. But it's part of that cost. That's why I said it's an expensive
process. We pay from the outside counsel for the candidate, correct?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We have.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: In the past, I believe, that is the case. It is fairly common for any
executive to ask for that. And it's always in the organization's best interests that both sides have
counsel. But it's certainly not something that you have to do. But this RFQ is specifically for the
attorney that will represent you.
DOUG TISDALE: The Board.
JENNIFER ROSS-AMATO: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: OK, go.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. Thank you for that clarification and advice. Anything further to come
before the Executive committee? Anybody on the phone want to weigh in before we ring off with
you?
TROY WHITMORE: No, thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Going once, going twice, sold.
So as of 2:56 PM, we stand adjourned. Thank you, all.
