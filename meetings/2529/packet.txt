Re:

Update

During the interim BBMK has been meeting with candidates along with legislators about issues
of importance to the District. These meetings with candidates on both sides of the aisle provide
an initial introduction to our team. We encourage candidates to proactively reach out to us as
they formulate their 2017 legislative agendas.
In anticipation of the Oct 5th TLRC meeting where RTD will be presenting, BBMK along with
RTD Executive Staff Sherry Ellebracht and Bruce Abel met with Reps. Tyler and Winter on the
District's challenges with para-transit services. These meetings are to provide information ahead
of time to key members of the committee and to ensure leadership of the committee that the
District takes the legislators input seriously. During the October 5th meeting the members of the
committee will review legislation and BBMK will report to the RTD Board which legislation the
committee chooses to be introduced as TLRC Committee bills.
Per the request of Rep. Kraft Tharp, BBMK has scheduled a meeting in early October to discuss
the 36 corridor. RTD Executive Staff and BBMK will provide an update to Rep. Kraft Tharp
and other members of the 36 delegation that chose to attend. We will let Board Members know
the date/time of this meeting when it is confirmed.
The Joint Budget Committee received the September Revenue Forecast this month. There still
remains a high degree of uncertainty about the economy both nationally and within
Colorado. Perhaps the economy will continue to do well, or perhaps a recession is on the way.
Unfortunately, the data isn’t clear at this point so uncertainty rules the day.
According to the legislative council forecast general fund revenue for FY 16/17 is expected to be
$329.6 million or 3.0 percent short of the amount needed to fully fund the budget and a 6.5%
reserve. This current year deficit means that the JBC enters into the conversation about the 17/18
budget in the hole, but it probably will not lead to mid-year budget cuts. OSPB also projects a
decrease in revenue for the FY 16/17 budget but not as large as Legislative Council.
There are several statutory requirements impacting the 17/18 budget. This includes a projected
TABOR refund, and required transfers to Highway Construction, Capital Construction and the
State Education Fund. The General Assembly could choose to adjust some of these requirements,
as well as the current 6.5 percent required reserve, when they convene in 2017 which would free
up room for additional spending. Without changes, both sets of economists predict a very tight

17/18 budget. According to Legislative Council, at this point $65 million would need to be cut
relative to 16/17 and according to OSPB expenditures could grow by just .3 percent.
As a result of the BP decision and SB16-218 a total of $56.8 million was transferred from the
General Fund to cover severance tax refunds in FY 2015-16, it is estimated that an additional
$36.5 million will be needed to cover the severance tax refunds for FY16-17.

The Governor’s budget will be submitted to the Joint Budget Committee by November 1st.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: October 4, 2016
Striving to Prevent a Government Shutdown on October 1
State of Play as of September 28:


Since returning after Labor Day, Congress has struggled to reach agreement on a short-term
appropriations bill, or Continuing Resolution (CR), to fund the programs and agencies of the
Federal government for fiscal year 2017, which starts on October 1.

Congressional negotiations on the CR are taking place in the Senate. The House plans to
immediately take up and consider the bill the Senate passes and sends over, rather than to
attempt to negotiate its own bill with both Freedom Caucus conservatives and House
Democrats. Any such House bill would likely stand little chance of passing the Senate,
where strong conservatives have significantly less influence.
Dueling over Disaster Funding:


Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have been unable to reach agreement on a
bipartisan bill, mainly because the bill does not include funding for the lead-contaminated
water crisis in Flint, Michigan, but does include $500 million for Louisiana flood victims.



Rather than agreeing to Flint funding, Senate Republicans are considering stripping
Louisiana flood aid from the stalled spending bill as a way to secure Democratic support and
avoid a government shutdown.



Alternatively, Republicans in the House have agreed to include Flint funding in the water
infrastructure bill the lower chamber will debate on September28. This approach may satisfy
Democrats in the Senate seeking funding for Flint and clear a path for the CR to pass the
Senate before October 1.
What happens to Federal surface transportation programs if there is no spending bill?


If no CR is enacted by midnight on September 30, the lapse in appropriations means
virtually all non-essential functions of the Federal government will shut down until a
spending bill is passed. For surface transportation programs, treatment varies.



Nearly all functions of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), including the
apportionment of $43 billion in Federal-aid highway funds on October 3, are funded from
the Highway Trust Fund, which has unique treatment under the Federal budget that enables
the agency to keep operating in the absence of an appropriations bill. Accordingly, the
FHWA will apportion FY 2017 highway formula funds, even if there is no CR in place.



Nearly all activities of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) would shut down as of
October 1. Transit formula programs are funded from the Highway Trust Fund, but salaries
to pay FTA employees to disburse formula funds are derived from the General Fund. As a
result, all but a very few FTA employees who as “essential” would be prohibited from
working in the absence of an appropriations bill to pay their salaries. New Starts grants are
made from the General Fund as well, so FY 2017 New Starts funding must await an
appropriations bill.
