Jun 26 2018 0330 PM GM Oversight & Performance
Management Committee
JEFF WALKER: So I have 3:32? OK, the tape is rolling. So we'll call the meeting of the General
Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee to order. So let's go around the
room and introduce ourselves so anybody else who's listening in can check on our voices. This is
Jeff Walker.
BOB BROOM: I'm Bob Broom, District F.
NATALIE MENTEN: This is Natalie Menten.
DAVE GENOVA: Dave Genova.
DOUG TISDALE: And this is Doug Tisdale, District H.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board.
JEFF WALKER: And on the phone?
KEN MIHALIK: Ken Mihalik, District G.
JEFF WALKER: OK, I guess that's it. Larry Hoy should be here pretty soon. He said he would
be late by the time he walked from parking his car. So we have a quorum. Let's get started. OK,
today's agenda-- a call to order.
So we've all received the General Manager's mid-year assessment. Have we all looked at it?
BOB BROOM: [INAUDIBLE].
JEFF WALKER: All right. Do we have any comments? Well, I'll tell you what. Let's have Mr.
Genova go through that. And then we'll address any questions that might be left over after your
presentation.
DAVE GENOVA: Thank you, Chair Walker. I'll be very brief because I'm sure you've all had an
opportunity to read through it. Just a couple of things to be clear on. So the summary memo
represents the time frame from January 2018, through the end of May 2018. There might be a
few things that spill over after May. But predominantly it's just for that five-month period-- so
five months of 2018.
I think it's in the same format that we've presented in years past, with each goal stating what it
means to achieve the goal. I list out the accomplishments under what I believe achieves the goal
there. And then under each goal, we have what the criteria is for exceed expectations. And if I
believe there is anything to list under exceeding expectations, I've included that under the

accomplishments for that section. So that's the format and the shape-up of the memo, and the
time frame that it addresses.
And I know that in particular, on one goal-- core goal number five, effective communications-there's a lot of information listed under that particular core goal that represents not only a lot of
my activities, but a lot of the other activities that the organization does for outreach. And I just
want to make sure that everyone has seen, starting at the bottom of the packet, page 11, there's
just a lot of statistical information about the outreach through customer care, marketing, radio
impressions, direct mail, customer information, and then some information about the website,
and the page views, the NextRide and Trip Planner.
And then there's a lot of information on social media and other engagement. So I just wanted to
point that out. And I think I will just take any comments or questions.
JEFF WALKER: All right. Thanks. Let the record show that Director Deadwyler has just joined
us. So we just started.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
JEFF WALKER: And Mr. Genova just gave a real, real high level of the form of the-BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
JEFF WALKER: Responses. It's similar to what we've seen before.
DAVE GENOVA: And I think the most, if I may Mr. Chair? The most important thing, Director
Deadwyler, that I'd like to point out is the time frame. So this is the accomplishments from
January through the end of May. So that's the time period that the memo refers to. So if you look
at-BARBARA DEADWYLER: What are you looking at? The agenda?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes, so the second page of your packet-BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
DAVE GENOVA: If you see at the very top of the memorandum, under the subject matter, right
below the date, it has the summary core and task goals for that time period. So I just want to
make sure everybody realizes that even though we're well into June, the cutoff for putting
information in this document was the end of May. And there might be a few things that happened
after May that have shown up in here. But primarily it's through May. And it's the same format
we've done in years past.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.

DOUG TISDALE: The understanding is it's a five-month look-back with highlights listed-presumably not actually every single thing. I'm don't know when you have time to do that. But
nonetheless, the highlights listed of accomplishments, right?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And you were pointing out what, anything specific?
DAVE GENOVA: Just under core goal number five, under effective communications and
community outreach, I've included, as I have in years past with this, just a lot of the statistics
regarding the outreach, and impressions, and page views, and things that we are receiving as a
result of the programs that we have under marketing and public relations.
BOB BROOM: Did you have to go to all these Rockie games?
DAVE GENOVA: I did not.
JEFF WALKER: All right. So I know we've all had a chance to look over this. Does anybody
have-- all right. So Director Hoy has just joined us.
LARRY HOY: Sprinting.
[LAUGHING]
DOUG TISDALE: What a good man. That's because he's in such good shape. After this diet and
he's lost all that weight, he can-[LAUGHING]
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Everybody's dieting.
[LAUGHING]
JEFF WALKER: So Director Hoy, you just missed Mr. Genova giving a real high-level brief of
the content. So it runs through-LARRY HOY: (WHISPERS) We'll catch up, right?
JEFF WALKER: Right. January 1 through the end of May. Core goal five has a whole lot of
information about the communication activities that were performed by the agency. And that's
what Mr. Genova [INAUDIBLE].
LARRY HOY: I apologize for my tardiness also.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK. It's crazy out there.

JEFF WALKER: OK, so does anyone here have any questions? I'll start to my right and head
around the room. So I'll be starting with Director Deadwyler.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: No, not right now.
JEFF WALKER: OK, great. Director Broom, and questions, comments? Do you need a minute
to get situated?
BOB BROOM: No, but we'll come back.
JEFF WALKER: To get situated since you just sat down a second ago. Director Menten, any
questions, comments?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes, I do. Under packet page three, under accomplishments, so that we all
need to find that. Ongoing ADA retrofit of the labor and vehicles. How are we on that schedule
and when-- because I can't remember off the top of my head what is our schedule for total retrofit
slated?
DAVE GENOVA: Right. As far as the existing vehicles, this was a process that was going to
happen over a number of years due to a couple of reasons. One was budget, and then just the
availability of vehicles and spare ratio, and trying to schedule it with other work for example. If a
car is already coming in for its midlife overhaul, then we would do this at the very same time.
But I would have to follow up and let the committee know when we expect to complete this. But
it was over a number of years' period for a variety of different reasons. But I don't know if any of
the board members have seen any of the retrofits. But there are some that are out there. And then
of course, our 29 new vehicles that are already starting to arrive are configured in this way to
begin with.
NATALIE MENTEN: If you could, remind me by email.
DAVE GENOVA: I will do that. I will send the schedule to the committee.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right. And one other question-- Let me check it, marked here. In here
it was noted that Union Pacific Director of Public Affairs-BARBARA MCMANUS: What page?
DAVE GENOVA: Where?
NATALIE MENTEN: I'm sorry. This would be packet page 14.
DOUG TISDALE: Packet 14.
NATALIE MENTEN: Halfway down, staff met with the Union Pacific Director of Public
Affairs.

DAVE GENOVA: Mm hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm hmm.
NATALIE MENTEN: Could you remind me what that would have been in reference to, please?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK, I still need-DAVE GENOVA: Probably just an ongoing relationship and activities that we have going on
with Union Pacific. So we've done a lot of agreements with both the Union Pacific and the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe as a result of building out all the corridors, mainly right of way
deals.
NATALIE MENTEN: Mm hmm.
DAVE GENOVA: So it could have been just some follow up in regards to a right of way deal or
something like that. But I can get the specifics.
NATALIE MENTEN: I was just wondering if there was any progress. I can't really tell you off
the top of my head honestly which railroad it is up on the northwest. Which are all involved
with-DAVE GENOVA: It's the Burlington.
NATALIE MENTEN: [INAUDIBLE].
DAVE GENOVA: The Northwest rail is Burlington Northern.
NATALIE MENTEN: Mm hmm.
DAVE GENOVA: And UP, we've dealt with UP on a variety of the other projects. But we have
met, too, we continue to meet with the Burlington Northern folks. In fact, Henry had a meeting
not long ago with the person that heads up the passenger rail activities for the Burlington
Northern. And if you give me a minute, his name will pop into my head. But I know Henry just
had a briefing with him just recently. And I don't know if that appears on this list or not.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. All right, that's all I have now on these items. Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: Director Tisdale.
[COUGHING]
DOUG TISDALE: Excuse me. I have no specific questions. I do have an observation that there
is a tremendous amount of detail here. And I thank you for not walking us through all of it. I did
review it. And I will confess, no, I have not read every word. I have looked for highlights and

specific things that are of interest to me, and am pleased to see that many of those things do show
up here.
And I want to thank you for taking the time to do it. Because it's not just a question-- I think for
the sake of this record I would note. It is not just a question of this committee having this
information, but this information being available to everyone on the Board so that they can see it
for themselves and not have to have all of it regurgitated in front of them in a public meeting. So
I thank you for that.
JEFF WALKER: All right. Thank you. Anything else? You said you had one.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I'm just going to-- this packet is huge. I'm just wondering is there
any way in the future some of this can be broken down and not given to us all at the same time,
in phases.
BOB BROOM: It's twice a year, right?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes, we do it, excuse me.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Yeah, but it would probably be-- just give us a little update, and
then another one, and another one so we don't have to read all of this.
BARBARA MCMANUS: The first packet's the largest packet. And then as we move through the
year, only what's highlighted on the packet is new.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Yeah, but I'm saying these accomplishments, are you saying that's
highlighted?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Mm hmm. It'll be highlighted going forward.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Oh, going forward.
BARBARA MCMANUS: All of these are accomplishments.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Right, I understand that.
DAVE GENOVA: If I could clarify, I think what Barbara McManus is getting at is that when the
Board sees the next version of this, probably in about an October time frame, it will be-BARBARA DEADWYLER: [INAUDIBLE].
DAVE GENOVA: To about nine months, right. And what I will do is just add to this. But
everything that's in addition to, will be highlighted in yellow.
DOUG TISDALE: Highlighted in yellow.

DAVE GENOVA: And that's what we did last year. So then when we get to that period, it's very
easy for the Board to see the additions to the mid-year memo.
JEFF WALKER: OK. I think we get these in chunks when we get the GM update monthly. So
we get them in, here are the activities that took place. Some part of these, not this level of detail.
DAVE GENOVA: Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Chair. Yeah, a lot of the information that appears,
certainly some of the things that come right off of the monthly GM report that is in the Board
packet, a lot of that feeds into this, as well as other documents that we use on documenting things
that we've done throughout the year.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, and just starting this year on our Board agendas when we vote on
something, it says which goal it satisfies, which goal the action satisfies. So we are able to get
parts of it here and there.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I guess the reason I'm asking is because I see a lot of where staff or
you attended something.
DAVE GENOVA: Mm hmm.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And that's just it. That's all you did. You attended the April
meeting of the Metro Mayors Caucus. I don't see anything that says, what did you do, were there
any outcomes? There's no specifics. So I'm just wondering, does that need to be here just by
attending the meeting without any specificity on the meeting. But that may not be important. But
sometimes I like to-- it's very impressive that they went to all this stuff. But what did they do?
DAVE GENOVA: Well, I think just part of demonstrating what we are participating in is just
really to give the Board the idea and the concept of all of the various activities and groups that
we are participating on. And sometimes we're on the agendas of these activities. And when we
are, I do report that out in the GM report. Now that I don't go through every item. But on the GM
report that is in the packet every month, it states on there whether we did a presentation, or
whether we just attended. And so we try to clarify those kinds of things just on a monthly basis.
So I think when there is a subjective or a significant participation, it does get highlighted in those
monthlies.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Well, OK.
JEFF WALKER: All right. Are you done Director Deadwyler?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Well, I'm trying to get to the heading of this thing here to see if that
was part of just a goal? Or was there-DAVE GENOVA: It's a core goal.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Achieved or was that exceeded something?

DAVE GENOVA: Most of what you're reading under that is under the achieved. So it's core goal
number five-- effective communications and community outreach-- is the overarching goal. So
the way that memo's broken up is it's got the criteria for achieved, and then all the
accomplishments listed under that.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Mm hmm.
DAVE GENOVA: And then after that, it has the criteria for exceeds. And then if there's any
accomplishments under that, it's listed there. So that longest section of the memo that you're
looking at under communications, that's all under the achieved accomplishments.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
DAVE GENOVA: Or I'm sorry, meeting the goal, achieved the goal.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
JEFF WALKER: OK. Thanks. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: I just wanted to follow up on that. Because having been at-- and I'm looking
at again this core goal five. It's packet page 17 just as one example. Having been at a number of
these various meetings, I just want to reflect that I think what General Manager said is pretty
accurate.
When there's simply the attendance to show that we were there and engaged in part of it, it looks
like it just says attended. Because I was in attendance at a lot of these myself. Then when we
actually did something like on packet page 17, three quarters of the way down, it says, staff met
with state representatives blah, blah, blah, to answer questions and update them on the past
program working group progress and other RTD issues.
The detail is provided when there was more of an interaction with somebody, as opposed to
simply being there as one of a number of people for purposes, if nothing else, of waving the flag.
But it is that outreach that's part of goal five. So that's my observation of it when I went through
that. I kind of noted that myself.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And that's the stuff to me that we should highlight. Because they
did something there.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah. No, I know.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: They answered questions.
DOUG TISDALE: Right. Mm hmm.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: So highlight some of that stuff. And then when they say, oh, well,
they were there. And they answered questions regarding this, this.

DOUG TISDALE: Mm hmm.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And then the other stuff is just, they attended.
JEFF WALKER: OK. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: You alluded to 29 rail cars with the updated ADA stuff in it. Were those
acquired for the G Line and the N Line? And are those the last deliveries that are coming in for
the entire fleet? Or where are we at?
DAVE GENOVA: The 29 vehicles I refer to are light rail. So that's an additional 29 light rail
vehicles that'll be on the light rail system, not the G. So all of the vehicles that we need for the
University of Colorado A Line, the B Line, and the G Line, and North Metro are here and on
site. There are 66 cars. And they're all here. And they're all certified.
DOUG TISDALE: Compliant.
DAVE GENOVA: And we don't have any plans right now for any expansion of that fleet or any
contracts to expand that fleet. And similarly with these last 29 vehicles on the light rail, we don't
anticipate another rail vehicle purchase for some time. And those are very-- you talk about long
lead time. Because these aren't cars that come off of a-BOB BROOM: Assembly line.
DAVE GENOVA: An assembly line. It's a very manual kind of process. And typically the way
the rail car builders work is, they might have their contracts for three, or four, maybe five at a
time. And they're working those, and then they're set up for their next contract. So it takes a year
or two to just get into the pipeline.
BOB BROOM: Into the queue.
DAVE GENOVA: Yeah, let alone the manufacturing period.
BOB BROOM: Hmm.
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy, anything? Yeah.
LARRY HOY: Well, I will make a comment about the quantity of information in here. It's a
report of what's happened. And taking anything out would be incorrect. Because this is to judge
Dave's performance. If he doesn't put stuff in here, we're likely to say, well, you never went to
one of these, or you never did this, or you weren't in the community.
So I think there's good reason to have this much information in here. I know it's like, oh my God.
But it's a compilation of what you've done. No more comments.
NATALIE MENTEN: Your point is well taken, Director.

JEFF WALKER: Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK (ON PHONE): I did want a second. But it is an impressive list. And I do
appreciate that [INAUDIBLE].
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
KEN MIHALIK (ON PHONE): [INAUDIBLE].
BOB BROOM: It sounds like he's under water.
[LAUGHING]
JEFF WALKER: We're having a hard time hearing you. Is anybody-- I'm having a hard time
hearing. Is anybody else having a hard time?
BARBARA DEADWYLER Not only hearing, but it's broken.
NATALIE MENTEN: He says thanks for including it. And it was a little impressive list.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
LORRAINE ANDERSON (ON PHONE): I'm on the line. This is Director Anderson.
JEFF WALKER: Hi. Do you have any questions or comments?
LORRAINE ANDERSON (ON PHONE): I just have some comments. And I thought the report
of yours was done quite well. And I think that in all the years I've been a manager on this
committee, this was a very good, very general outline, and whatever you think [INAUDIBLE].
If the [INAUDIBLE] agency that's involved with, and I thought it was done quite well. And I
want to thank both Dave and Barbara McManus and her staff for presenting this to us in this
way. And I did read the whole thing. So I had some time. I did it. So I appreciate what was done.
Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. Is anyone else on the line? OK. So hearing none, the only
comments that I had on it were I didn't see the CBA in the achieved goal section.
DAVE GENOVA: That's because if I may, it's listed under exceeds. Because we reached
agreement with the union before the expiration of the contract.
JEFF WALKER: Right. So when I was going through it and I didn't see it in the achieved goals,
I was like, wait a second. I know they did more. And then I saw it later. So it just caused-- this is
me being nit picky I guess. But it caused a little bit of hesitation. I had to go back a couple of
times.

And there are other items I know that won't be fulfilled until later in the year like the budget,
[INAUDIBLE] et cetera. So it took me time to go through and realize that those wouldn't be
identified in the achieved because they haven't been started yet, or they haven't entered the point.
You know what I'm saying?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes. It's always hard to separate those items in ongoing but yet not yet
completed.
JEFF WALKER: Yes, I guess it's more of an observation than a comment. I don't know if there's
anything you can do about that. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: One question that I'd forgotten that I wanted to ask is, with the outreach
that's been done on the R Line?
DAVE GENOVA: Yes.
NATALIE MENTEN: And the current ridership, do we expect to do a proposed service
reduction?
DAVE GENOVA: I haven't talked to the team recently about the next service changes. That
would be January. So of course, we're still working through the August run board. I believe the
approval is on tonight, right? And so we haven't started to prepare the January run board yet.
But I am going to meet with-- Director Broom did ask me about if he could get an update on the
outreach. And so I think we've got something scheduled to do that. But I'm happy to update the
rest of the Board on the outreach activities to date, as well.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. Thanks.
JEFF WALKER: OK. All right. Any other questions, final questions, comments about the midyear assessment. All right, we'll move on to the survey comments. So last Friday I think it was,
we all got the survey, the Survey Monkey. I don't know how anybody's answered. I don't
remember if I know who's responded.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're not going to get that list until this coming Friday.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
BARBARA MCMANUS: I do know that a number of Directors have already completed.
JEFF WALKER: OK. All right. That's good to know. I did mine this morning.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So we have a PDF copy of the survey in here-JEFF WALKER: Yeah.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Just in case anybody had any specific questions that they needed
answers surrounding it.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm hmm.
JEFF WALKER: Nice.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, the one I gave you.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah. So-BARBARA MCMANUS: Because we wouldn't have the digital ones on the bus.
JEFF WALKER: So did anybody have any questions? Or hasn't anybody who's looked at it had
the opportunity yet? Do you have any questions on any of the [INAUDIBLE]?
LARRY HOY: Here.
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy. There I said it.
LARRY HOY: Quick, dirty, yeah. I guess I thought it was fine. I ended up going ahead and then
backing up, and then going through it again. And it's just a different method than we've used in
the past. Or it appears to me to be a little bit different.
BARBARA MCMANUS: You mean to be able to go-LARRY HOY: Well, no.
BARBARA MCMANUS: To not just [INAUDIBLE]-LARRY HOY: I would say all achieved goal. And then I would go and say, well, wait a minute.
Let me go look at that again and go back. And I was able to rethink my process. But I wouldn't
say for many of the Directors that aren't involved in this every day, as part of this team, they're
going to have a hard time answering these questions. These questions are going to be their
feeling and not their knowledge.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we did include-DAVE GENOVA:: They'll have the memo.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We did include the mid-year for reference in with the survey so that
you would have something to go back to if you did have questions.
LARRY HOY: Yeah.

JEFF WALKER: Right. Yeah, so when I did mine, I had the self-assessment here to see what
was actually done.
LARRY HOY: Right.
JEFF WALKER: And then I went through and answered the question. If I couldn't remember, I
went back to the assessment. So we tried to make it as objective as possible. And then also-- I'm
sorry. Go ahead.
LARRY HOY: No, it's just my observation. I understand all that. But I think that you're not
going to get people that's going to study the document and answer the question. I just don't think
that's going to happen. That's my comment.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah. Well taken.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I agree.
LARRY HOY: Yeah.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: We sit here and we use two documents toward the answer.
JEFF WALKER: Director Broom? Any? Director Menten, any questions, comments about the
survey?
NATALIE MENTEN: No.
JEFF WALKER: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: I think that the observation made by Chair Hoy is well taken in that it
sometimes can be oppressive for people to say, OK, I've already scored this. Now you want
detail supporting my score. And yet, I submit, it is fair at least to ask. Because if a person does
not give any support, either for a needs improvement, or for exceeds expectations, either way-- it
cuts both ways-- If you don't provide any support, there could be the sense that maybe this
particular person is just going through in order to complete the exercise and not really giving it a
lot of thought.
Whereas if you find some of those checked off, you'll say, OK, they've given it some thought. I
think we need to be aware that even the most scrupulous-- and I'm sure we have some who are
very scrupulous on the Board. But even the most scrupulous of person might find it difficult to
answer each of those questions with detail. So I do understand there is some problem with that.
But I also think it's probably as close as we can get to a real live personal interview. If you did
the interview, you see, you'd have that followup question. You'd say, well, you said that you
think he needs improvement. What is there that triggers that reaction in your mind? This is a way
of doing that without actually having a person sit down with you. So I think it is probably as
good as can be reasonably expected.

JEFF WALKER: OK. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK (ON PHONE): I think what Chair Tisdale just stated was a real good point. I
don't have anything beyond that [INAUDIBLE].
JEFF WALKER: OK. Thank you. I'm sorry. I missed the last thing you said.
LARRY HOY: That's because he was going under again. Bloop.
JEFF WALKER: Director Anderson.
LORRAINE ANDERSON (ON PHONE): I just have to say, it was one of the better ones,
surveys that I've taken. And I appreciate the work that went into it. And then again, I appreciate
all of the information that I was provided. So I think all in all it was actually an easier experience
than any I've taken before. And I've taken every one since I got on the Board. So that's a lot of
Survey Monkeys.
JEFF WALKER: It's a barrel full.
[LAUGHING]
BARBARA DEADWYLER: So what's the average time it's taking people to fill it out?
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, do we know?
JEFF WALKER: It took me about 15, 20 minutes this morning to do it. I did it before I put my
feet on the floor.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Hmm.
DOUG TISDALE: Now it starts to be too much information, Jeff. Just you can let it go at that.
You know what I'm saying?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I'm just saying it takes some of us a little longer when we're sitting
here with this Survey Monkey, and then a packet of information when you're not familiar takes
quite a while to get done. Just a comment.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: No. And I would agree that's probably a fair assessment.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Pass that candy?
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy?

LARRY HOY: Yeah, I was wondering if you took that Survey Monkey as a group right here,
right now, if we would come to agreement on the level of progress-- achieved, or exceed, or
needs improvement? It gets to be almost, here's the goal. This is what it means to achieve or not
achieve, or exceed. And here's what's happened.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Mm hmm.
LARRY HOY: Could we come to-- I don't know. Maybe this is a hypothetical. But do you think
that if people looked at the list, and looked at what the requirement is, that we could all agree the
same? Or is that never going to happen?
JEFF WALKER: For the first part of the survey, I think we should. I think we should. The work
is the work. And what was done, was done. But there's the final question that asks for additional
information. And I can't remember exactly how it's worded now. But it asks for additional
information.
BARBARA MCMANUS: It says, if you have any comments on the General Manager's
performance year-to-date, please provide them using the space below.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, so that's the part where we get to be subjective. And we could say, yeah,
Dave, Mr. Genova did all of this. But it wasn't good enough. Or he did it. And it was well
beyond what I thought. Or he was OK at the exceeded, or OK at this. Or we understand the
circumstances that prevented or enhanced. But that's the opportunity for that subjectivity to come
into the fulfilling of the completion of the survey.
LARRY HOY: So I hear that you, if I may, you probably believe or agree with what I think I
believe is that you could stack up the achievements and say, well, he's achieved or exceeded.
And you could just go right down the pipe.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah.
LARRY HOY: I mean as I was going through it, that's what I was thinking, that it's almost you
could almost take us out of it. You could use us as an observer rather than part of the process.
Observer of the facts-- here's what's happened.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Mm hmm.
LARRY HOY: And here's what he should've done. And in fact he did do what he should've
done, or exceeded what he should've done. But it seems like it's almost bad.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, here's his goals or the priorities and how he's going to meet those. Has
he taken the steps to meet them? Yes or no? Now there's always room for discussion about how
well they were met, how well things were achieved.
LARRY HOY: OK. I just wanted to know if I was-- if I saw some agreement with that thought
process.

JEFF WALKER: Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I know exactly. And that was our-- I think that was our, if
I remember it correctly back to January or February. That was-BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, yeah, when we reviewed this survey and we made the changes
to it, one of the observations from this committee was that they wanted to see more comments
like on 22. It says, what information would you like to see prior to the year-end evaluation? And
what additional information would help you form an opinion?
So when we made the changes to the survey, one of the things that bubbled up was that it's part
of this committee's and the full Board's job to put Dave to task on what the priorities are, with the
task and the core goals. And if we think that he's not doing that as he's moving through the year,
it's our job to guide him and tell him what he needs to do, or what he needs to change to show
that.
DOUG TISDALE: Right.
JEFF WALKER: Right, to provide that direction about the tasks, and then also to make sure that
we're just not making stuff up like Director Tisdale alluded to earlier, that we've actually put
some thought into this. Yeah, it does take time. But that's our job, to spend the time to make sure
that the GM has the direction he needs for this agency to do what it's supposed to. Director
Broom?
BOB BROOM: Well, there's literally hundreds of things in here that they're not all equal.
JEFF WALKER: Correct.
BOB BROOM: There's a lot of things that are far more important. And you should be
concentrating on those instead of the minutia-- attending all these meetings and that kind of stuff.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're exactly right. So when I was going through, I
matched up all of the goals.
BOB BROOM: I mean, if we'd had a strike and that thing fell all apart-JEFF WALKER: Right.
BOB BROOM: The conversation would be totally different.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Even if it were just for one day.
BOB BROOM: Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, and the next day they signed the CBA. You're right. Could've been a
totally different conversation.
BOB BROOM: Yeah.

JEFF WALKER: And that's what that-- so OK, yeah. We've got the, yeah, since we met achieved
before it-BOB BROOM: So from my viewpoint-JEFF WALKER: If somebody exceeded that.
BOB BROOM: Gets the really important stuff done right, that's good enough for me. Some of
the other stuff I think, you know, so what?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Director Broom, I'm going to have to agree with you. Because if
we can see where the important stuff was done versus digging through this document to find out
if he did the important stuff, like getting through all the-- attended these meetings-- that would be
easier for the other Board members to go through this.
BOB BROOM: Then it's just like this contract. What it got done is also a function of the other
party. When they call the referee in or whoever they were into the process early on, that kind of
slowed things down, I'm sure. Or maybe it didn't.
LARRY HOY: It might have sped it up.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: A tactical move. Yeah, it did. Because-BOB BROOM: Didn't get it off.
JEFF WALKER: It was where the new one was approved before the old one expired. So the
achieved goal is keep working on the CBA. The exceed goal is get it approved.
DOUG TISDALE Mm hmm.
JEFF WALKER: We have a role. And the union has a role before the old one expired and that
happened. So they can't go on strike until it expires.
BOB BROOM: Now the other thing is, there's issues hanging out there that you wonder about.
Are we're going to be sued over the cost of all those flaggers that went on all that time? And
how's that all going to turn out in the future?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: It's not a goal.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah. So the way that I take this is that we tell the GM what's important, right?
Through our meetings in March, this is what's important to us. And then he comes back-- in this
case he-- comes back to us and says, this is how I plan to get it. And then we approve that. And

we say, yeah, this is what you do. This is how you do it. This is how we want to see how you do
it. And then that's what is important to us.
So some of these steps have a whole lot more effort into them, like the communications. There
are 3 million people in this region. That's a whole lot of people to talk to or to get a message
across to. So that takes a whole lot more effort than-- remind me to pick one of these. See if I can
pull one out of the air.
LARRY HOY: Than other [INAUDIBLE].
JEFF WALKER: 80% of transit service. That's pretty simple, right? If we have enough drivers,
easy.
LARRY HOY: It may appear that way.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
JEFF WALKER: That's not an objective.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
[JEFF WALKER] ...a lot more subjective. So to make sure you hit all of those perspectives, that
takes a lot more effort. Because you want to hear it one way. You want to hear it a different way.
You want to hear the same message a third way. So that's why all those meetings are attended.
So it's representing in case that question comes up, a lot of people in all of these different places
to answer those questions. Does that make sense?
BOB BROOM: Yeah, yeah.
LARRY HOY: May I make the comment? My comment about years of doing the 80% transit
satisfaction or whatever?
(BEEP BEEP)
Some of the things that we look at as a Board and say, well, of course that happens. It's not
necessarily that easy. It happens because the team is working on getting it done. I think about my
days of when I would-- I'm familiar with garbage trucks. But we're still hauling things. And if I
had 300 trucks on the road, and they all went out in the morning, and all came back, and there
was no accidents, and everybody's trash got picked up, and the trucks weren't broken, that wasn't
luck. That was a lot of work. And so when it happens, we kind of get used to it. It's like, oh, it
just happened. But those things are a lot more complicated than-DOUG TISDALE: Yes. Yes.
LARRY HOY: We might know. And maybe even more than what our GM knowS. Because it's
the people down in the ranks that are making all that happen.

DOUG TISDALE: Right.
LARRY HOY: But it's because you hire the right people, and put most of the right people, and
then sent the right people, that that all gets-- I'm off my bandwagon.
JEFF WALKER: Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: A very brief footnote to that. The fact that something is repetitive does not
mean that it is necessarily easy. A guy who is in the circus and walks the tightrope every show,
every day, it's still hard. But it's a repetitive act. And you don't a lot of times give it much special
notice, but it's still a very hard act.
And I think you pointed out in the fact that, when we talked last time about keeping the lights on,
saying, well, that's part of your job. But the answer is, yeah. That's right. That's part of your job.
So you've got to check that box, too, along with find drivers, get retrofitted cars, provide
adequate service, build out a system, make sure we stay compliant, and so forth. And keep the
lights on.
JEFF WALKER: Right. Yeah, so I didn't mean to make it sound like scheduling is easy.
Scheduling is the item, a thousand buses. I have 20 hours a day where I have to move a thousand
buses. I have about 300,000 passengers a day. I know that part is easy. Finding the drivers, that
can be difficult. Dealing with somebody runs into a bus, that's difficult.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: But we know how to get to 80%. How to get that message across, that's-because that's all subjective. That's the hard part.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: So some of these tests are easier than others. None of them are easy. But
they're easier than others.
DOUG TISDALE: Easier than others.
JEFF WALKER: But some are easier than others. And that's what you mentioned earlier. That's
what Director Broom mentioned earlier, with some are more weighted. I think that's the term you
used-- weighted-- than other tasks.
BOB BROOM: Well, in the last six months, we've had some really important people retire and
leave the organization, and replaced. We haven't heard, how are the new guys, or people-- I don't
know whether they're guys or gals. How are they fitting in? And are they getting up to speed? So
at some point, we probably need some talk about where we are as an organization with these key
people and are we keeping up, that type of thing.

DAVE GENOVA: If I may just quickly comment on that. I think they're doing really well. So
Michael Ford's been on since January. And so he's settling in very nicely. We had a good amount
of time with some overlap with Bruce for both to help with that transition.
And then also for the bus assistant general manager just started I think last week maybe, the
week after rail. And so again we have some overlap time with Bruce. So that transition's going
well. And we had a little overlap between Dave Jensen, who's our new AGM of rail, with Terry.
But the other thing, too, is they're bringing in a lot of fresh perspective, and new ideas, and
seeing things that sometimes people that have been in the position a long time don't see. So
there's a different perspective. And so far I'm really pleased with the work I'm seeing out of all of
them.
BOB BROOM: When we have our next retreat, we ought to ask those guys, well, you're new
here. What did you see here? What did you observe when you came here that you think may
need improvement or changes? I think that'd be interesting to know. Because if you've got people
that are here 20 some years, you're going to plow that row the same way. As long as it works,
why mess with it?
DAVE GENOVA: And I've been very candid with all of them. It's just like, hey, I'm not the kind
of person that if you come to me and say, we need to take a look at this and make this change, it's
not going to offend me or be a problem for me. I said I want your candor. And I want your
observations and recommendations.
JEFF WALKER: All right. OK, so it looks like we've gotten down through that-DOUG TISDALE: Jeff, do you want to ask Director Mihalik, further thoughts?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, I was going to go around the room. Anything else? I'll start with
Director Deadwyler and move-BARBARA DEADWYLER: Go that way first, please.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
BOB BROOM: He put you on the spot.
DOUG TISDALE: I have nothing further to add to that. I think it was a good conversation.
JEFF WALKER: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Nothing.
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy.
LARRY HOY: Nothing.

JEFF WALKER: Director Broom. Director Mihalik. Any other-KEN MIHALIK (ON PHONE): Nothing.
JEFF WALKER: Director Deadwyler, last word? Director Anderson?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I wanted a chance to drink. She hung up.
DAVE GENOVA: I heard a double beep. Yeah.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, I heard somebody. I'm sorry. I guess that was her. Director, Mr. Genova,
anything?
DAVE GENOVA: I do not.
JEFF WALKER: All right. OK, so the next meeting date. What was the date you had?
BARBARA MCMANUS: July 17th, from 1:00 to 2:30.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: July 17?
JEFF WALKER: And that's before, what's the other meeting?
BARBARA MCMANUS: That's prior to the Finance workshop-JEFF WALKER: Yeah.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Before the meeting.
LARRY HOY: Oh, I will not be in attendance at that meeting.
DOUG TISDALE: I will be out of the country that day.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I have a doctor's appointment.
JEFF WALKER: Really? OK, so we-BARBARA DEADWYLER: I'm just kidding.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, Bob, it's on your shoulders.
[LAUGHING]
BARBARA DEADWYLER: July 17.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

[LAUGHING]
JEFF WALKER: So that's a Tuesday. No, I'll be here.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And that's from 1:00 to 2:30? Why so early?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Because the Finance committee is meeting. And some of the members
here overlap with attending that meeting.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Makes a long day for me, especially when I have shared ride where
I can't just get up and leave, and go home, and come back, and go somewhere else.
BOB BROOM: Can you do this after the Finance committee? Does that work?
LARRY HOY: No.
BARBARA MCMANUS: No.
BOB BROOM: No, nobody's going to want to come out early.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
JEFF WALKER: You can call in.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Yeah, I can call in. I can call in. I can call in, no problem.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, that's good. Now, all right. Thank you all.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Menten, you have a conflict? Or are you good?
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah, no. I just have a-- I'll make it no matter what.
BARBARA MCMANUS: OK.
JEFF WALKER: OK, with nothing further, let's call it adjourned.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And Dave, I think this is Career Week or Career Day?
DAVE GENOVA: Yesterday for the girls in transportation. It's a DOT program.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Well, a couple of my friends' children attended.

DAVE GENOVA: Oh, good.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And Terry Jackson?
DAVE GENOVA: Oh, yes.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Her daughter attended. And they were so elated about their
experience in going to the headquarters or whatever they went to, the Command Center.
DAVE GENOVA: They went to the Security Center, yes.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Yes. They're still talking about it. So Terry sent a really nice email
today. Did you get a copy?
DAVE GENOVA: I did see an email from Terry. I haven't had a chance to look at it yet.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Very nice.
DAVE GENOVA: Well, I got a chance to talk to the young ladies. I asked Zamy in our group, I
said, why did we call them girls in transportation? And I guess that's the name of the DOT
program. I said, it should be young women.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah.
DAVE GENOVA: I have a hard time saying girls. But I got to talk to them for about 15 or 20
minutes. And they asked me a lot of hard questions.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Yeah, they're smart.
DOUG TISDALE: I was so blown away by that story. That was so cool. That was just neat.
DAVE GENOVA: It was very good. I've seen the clips.
DOUG TISDALE: I mean, really that was fantastic.
DAVE GENOVA: It's a bigger turnout than we had last year. Last year there was just a handful.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Before you leave, I'd like to show you some of the video.
LARRY HOY: A new mayor, yeah.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
DOUG TISDALE: We've got a video around here.
