#### 1. Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option - Farnsworth Group

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a one year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing contract through 2013 in an amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract amount $295,100.

Motion:               Director James made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 22nd, 2012 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter stated that this is a very straightforward recommendation to exercise the third year option for boundary mapping services to the Farnsworth Group.  He explained that Farnsworth Group was originally selected in late 2009 and have been providing these services for the past few years.  Bill Van Meter said that returning Board members may recall that in addition to the boundary mapping, Farnsworth also provided very strong service in the Board re-districting effort that was performed in late 2011-2012.  He believes they have performed these services well since they have been brought under contact.

Committee Chair Bagley declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Denver Union Station Update

Committee Chair Bagley noted that this update was presented during the January 8, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting.

### D. Other Matters

Director Tayer stated that as many of the Board members and staff is aware, he was honored to get the appointment as the new Boulder Chamber of Commerce President and CEO.  He explained that this is a wonderful position and a great opportunity to support his community in a different capacity but it is also a pretty monumental undertaking.  Director Tayer said that he was taking this opportunity to give notice of his resignation from the RTD Board.  He passed around a note to the Board that is available in the Planning and Development agenda packet for January 8, 2013.  He said that it has been such an honor to serve the community on this Board.  He believes it is such a pleasure to work on such a critical issue for our environment, economy and quality of life.

Director Tayer explained that he would be giving notice to the Boulder County Commissioners so that they could begin their process to appoint a new Board member.  He stated that he will remain on the Board until an individual is selected.

General Manager Washington said that on behalf of the staff, the drivers and mechanics, the service and cleaning, and the Senior Leadership Team, they want to congratulate the incoming Board members on their swearing in; they also want to congratulate the Board members that were selected as officers.  He stated that staff looks forward to working with this new Board as the governing body of RTD.

General Manager Washington shared with the Board that on Saturday he would be briefing the Metro Mayor’s Caucus at their annual retreat.  He stated that he would be presenting as part of a panel with CDOT Executive Director Donald Hunt along with the Denver Metro Chamber Executive Director Kelly Brough.

General Manager Washington also shared that next week several of the Senior Leadership Team members will be out of the office.  He stated that he, Rick Clarke and Dave Genova will be at the Transportation Research Board (TRB) Annual Meeting.  He explained this is a long approved trip that TRB actually funds.  General Manager said that he is on the TRB Executive Committee.  The purpose of the trip will be to work on the research projects and provide oversight for the TRB’s activities.  He stated that at the January 15, 2013 Committee Meeting, Bruce Abel would fill in as Acting General Manager.

Committee Chair Bagley shared that he looks forward to working with every member of the Board; not just the new members of the Board but supporting our Chair and working with the other members of the Executive Committee to make sure we have an outstanding 2013.

Committee Chair Bagley thanked Director Tayer for his service and stated that he will be missed by the Board.
