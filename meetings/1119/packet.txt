BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

William C.
Manager

Date:

January 3, 2013

Subject:

Approval of Boundary Mapping Contract Option
- Farnsworth Group

Van

Meter,

Assistant

Date: January 3, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 8, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to exercise a one year
contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the existing contract through 2013 in an
amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract amount $295,100.
BACKGROUND
The contract was awarded to Farnsworth Group in late 2009 following a competitive bid of 5 submitted
proposals. Farnsworth provides RTD with boundary mapping services. These services include tracking
annexations by jurisdictions along the District’s boundaries, and the corresponding changes to the
respective Director Districts, as well as ensuring RTD is up to date with the appropriate precinct rolls by
county for each Director District.
The contract included five option years; this requested action would be to exercise the third year option.
The Contract Not-To-Exceed amount for 2013 is $68,900.
DISCUSSION
The contract support is critical to RTD so that staff is able to maintain an accurate, up-to-date boundary
map that allows RTD to determine which residents and businesses are in or out of the District thereby
maximizing RTD’s sales tax collections. Also, the boundary map is used to determine who is eligible for
in-District parking privileges and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates. Additionally,
counties within the District often modify precinct boundaries. It is imperative for RTD to have the most
up-to-date precinct boundaries whenever a general or special election is required so that RTD can certify
the precinct list for the respective Director District.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Cost to the District to exercise the option from Farnsworth Group is for an amount not to exceed
$68,900. Sufficient funding has been included in the 2013 expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to exercise a one year contract option to Farnsworth Group for an extension of the
existing contract through 2013 in an amount not to exceed $68,900 which would make the contract
amount $295,100.
2. Do not approve the option to extend the contract with Farnsworth Group.
recommended for the following reasons:

This action is not

iii.

RTD will not be able to determine when annexations have occurred by local jurisdictions along
the District boundary and will thereby lose sales taxes generated in newly annexed areas; and
RTD will not be able to accurately determine who is eligible for in-District parking privileges
and who should be required to pay out-of-District rates; and
RTD will not have an accurate list of County precincts and will not be able to certify precinct
lists for Director Districts for regularly scheduled or special elections thereby compromising
the election process.
