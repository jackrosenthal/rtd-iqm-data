RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to 6e Technologies for BI Work Order Contract (Contract Number 19DH0XX) for an amount not to
exceed $2,500,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding
for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
 Core Goal #3- Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to provide technology services related to Business Intelligence.
RTD is moving into more data driven decision making. The District needs data to drive business
decisions hence the need for Business Intelligence IT services. RTD currently has a variety of BI tools
such as Oracle OBIEE, Oracle OACS, Informatica, Tableau, etc. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to
mid-term periods addressing business, management of technology and consultant services. The activities
are inclusive of all activities necessary to support, enhance and update the BI tools and processes.
RTD anticipates the upcoming 5-year contract period may include work associated with several
initiatives around data including: Ridership Analytics, Realtime operational trend analytics, predictive
maintenance analytics, state of good repair and other ancillary analytic needs. RTD will also use this
contract to assist in maintaining day-to-day operations of the existing Oracle BI and Informatica tool sets
while the new systems/tools are being implemented.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for a BI Work Order contractor. Five firms submitted proposals.
The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected two firms for final interviews. 6e Technologies was
selected as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $2,500,000. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in
the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of funds are dependent upon the
funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project
requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $500,000.00 in any one year.
The current timeline and approximate costs for activities such as business process reviews,
implementation services, and system configuration for new implementations; assistance maintaining the
current BI systems; and other associated project work is as follows:
2019 - $ 500,000
2020 - $ 500,000
2021 - $ 500,000
2022 - $ 500,000
2023 - $ 500,000
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to 6e Technologies for BI Work Order Contract (Contract Number 19DH0XX) for an
amount not to exceed $2,500,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work
order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on
which the work is performed.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity that can be provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of RTD.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Approval of IGA between RTD and the State's

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to execute an IGA
to develop and operate software to help manage LiVE Eligibility Applications through the State PEAK
software system (State Contract Management System (CMS) # 128691) for an amount not to exceed
$1,800,000. The IGA is for five (5) years of development, operations and maintenance.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. As part of this process, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new Low-Income Fare (LiVE)
Program in mid-September 2018.
RTD is working with the Colorado Governor’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a
program for evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE program using the State’s public benefits
application system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and
OIT every week for several months.
The ability to leverage the State of Colorado systems to determine eligibility for the LiVE Program is
expected to:
 Reduce the time for implementation of the LiVE Program
 Limit duplication of data
 Allow for consistent eligibility data usage
 Reduce the time spent on administering the LiVE Program’s eligibility assessment
 Store sensitive data in the State system (For example, data will include pdfs of the application,
photographs, and verification of income information.
 Make it easier for those applying for other benefits to access RTD’s LiVE Program
 Save RTD significant expense
DISCUSSION
RTD needs to execute an Intergovernmental Agreement with OIT to implement the LiVE Program. The
IGA includes the following items:

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2







Develop a Business Requirements Document (BRD) to identify necessary changes to the PEAK
System. This has been completed.
Develop a Technical Design Document (TDD) to identify the details for development of the
software changes to the PEAK system. This has been completed.
Perform software development to implement the BRD and TDD.
Test software changes when complete.
Provide operational support and maintenance for funning the applications, sending automated
RTD correspondence, store images and documents, provide system administration and provide
call center and help desk support for the application.

The design and software development changes shall be performed by OIT’s contractor for a fee.
Members of OIT and Members of the PEAK Executive Steering Committee have generously donated their
time to provide guidance, support, document development and review to support implementation of
RTD’s LiVE Program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $1,800,000. Funding for this project is included in the 2019
through 2023 Budget. The largest portion of these costs are for the software changes being developed
this year. Annual correspondence, operations, maintenance and customer support are not expected to
exceed $211,000 per year during the term of this agreement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
execute an IGA to develop and operate software to help manage LiVE Eligibility Applications
through the State PEAK software system (State Contract Management System (CMS) # 128691)
for an amount not to exceed $1,800,000. The IGA is for five (5) years of development,
operations and maintenance.
2. RTD can independently, or through a contractor, develop software to accept and evaluate
applications for the LiVE program. RTD does not have the resources to adequately support the
system 24/7 and continuously meet Personally Identifiable Information (PII) security standards.
Development of such a system from scratch would take more than a year to implement and
would be appreciably more expensive. This would put implementation of the LiVE Program and
RTD security systems at significant risk.
3. RTD can develop a process to manually accept and evaluate applications for the LiVE Program.
This would require development of new policies and procedures and the hiring of more than 5
new employees. This would take more time and cost significantly more to implement.

Integrity of Model Forecasts
• Forecasts are updated semi-annually to reflect the most current
economic situation.
• Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the

Baseline scenario assumptions
•
•

Changes in Colorado economic metrics since the Sept-18 forecast were mixed in the medium term
Changes in short-term market expectations, tax laws, and policy all contribute to changes in revenue forecasts,
revenues for 2019 and remainder of forecast were revised lower compared to the Sept-18 forecast
ü Average of Colorado retail sales growth is 4.5% for medium-term forecast and state retail sales will
outperform the nation
ü Colorado personal income growth will be slower in 2019 compared to 2018 (5% vs. 5.5%)
ü Colorado economy will hover at capacity, with future employment growth rates constrained by slow
growth in the working-age population

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, and changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low income
fare program development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the low income program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT every
week for several months.
The following has been completed:




The Business Requirements Document (BRD) has been finalized.
The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
Marketing has completed the MyRide card design and final proofs have gone to the smart card
vendor for production.
The technical design document for the development of the LiVE program software in PEAK has
been completed.

Marketing and Outreach Advisory Group:
The Marketing and Outreach Advisory Group was formed to help RTD effectively market and address
stigma associated with the LiVE program. The advisory group comprised of leaders from various
stakeholder groups such as: NAACP, Mile High Connects, Warren Village, Denver Human Services, and
Colorado Coalition for the Homeless.
In the first two meetings, the group discussed the harm of deficit language and developed five core
values for the development of the marketing plan. The group used these core values to help RTD align
the marketing plan with the true intent of the program and minimize stigma. Those core values were:

Helpfulness
Eco-friendly

After careful consideration of the advisory group’s recommendations, RTD sought feedback on options
for the program name including “LiVE.” The group stated that “LiVE” aligned best with the advisory
group’s core values, better reflecting the intent to support the vitality of the community. Further, we
tapped into the group’s intimate experience serving and marketing to the intended market. The group left
us with a list of best marketing practices, effective channels of communication, and a commitment to
continue to engage and advise RTD as needed.
The LiVE Program MyRide card is the first card to use RTD’s newly established design guidelines. All
smart cards will follow these same design guidelines in the future. The intention is to establish
consistency in the display of RTD’s brand. This card is leading the migration of all cards to the new
guidelines. Feedback regarding the final name and card design was positive. The group voiced being
pleased with the process, facilitator, and the representation of their recommendations in the final name
and card design. See attached PowerPoint for more information.
Next Steps:






Finalize the intergovernmental agreement between the State and RTD for development,
processing, and data storage. (Board Approval requested in April)
Continue evaluation of options for production of LiVE ID cards.
Continue evaluating options to verify household income of applicants who are not enrolled in
certain food, medical, or cash assistance programs.
Continue evaluating options to provide customer service to LiVE applicants.
Planning for the programming changes in the MyRide web portal and back office systems, mobile
ticketing, and development of brochures.

Final Decision - Feedback
Feedback regarding the final name and card design was positive. The group voiced
being pleased with the process, facilitator, and felt like their recommendations were
represented in the final name and card design.
Regarding Card Name:

Regarding Card Design:

• This name has a positive tone.

• We like the clean look.

• We can see how ads and messaging for this
program can be used to encourage people
to utilize the program.

• It’s good this card will be like
all other MyRide cards in the
future.

• Potential to humanize those that have the
LiVE MyRide Card.
• Pronunciation may be an issue but that will
be okay – it doesn’t take away from the
larger message and create marketing can
help with this.
