BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

December 4, 2019

Subject:

Adoption of Pension Plan Contribution

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 4, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Task Goal #2 – Address Service & Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future. In 2016, the policy was changed to fund an amount that
would keep the Plan “actuarially sound” based on the recommendations of the Actuary and RTD’s Chief
Financial Officer.
The Actuary has updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2019 valuation assumptions for
the DB Plan. The 2020 Actuary recommended contribution is $8.1 million.
If the Actuarial
recommendation of $8.1 million is made beginning in 2020, the plan is expected to achieve 100%
funding in 2031 and the recommended amount is projected to drop below $5.1 million in 2032.
RTD’s Chief Financial Officer is recommending a contribution of $6.1 million. If RTD contributed $6.1
million in 2020 and beyond, the Plan is expected to achieve 100% funding in 2040. This also assumes
an annual rate of return of 7% per year.

Packet Pg. 12

1.B.2

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2019.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Below is a summary of the current and recommended DB Plan and DC Plan funding scenarios:

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of $6.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2020 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $6.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its initial 2020 Requested Budget to the
governing body on September 17, 2019 with updates on October 22 and November 12. By legal
notice, the governing body made available/posted the initial 2020 Requested Budget for public

Packet Pg. 18

1.B.3

review prior to October 15. A public hearing to solicit formal public comment for the 2020
Recommended Budget is scheduled for the December 17, 2019 regular meeting of the Board of
Directors.
DISCUSSION

Overview of the 2020 Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,159.2 million on a combined basis are expected to decrease $59.6 million (4.9%) in
2020 from the 2019 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) a decrease in farebox revenue of $5.5
million, 2) a decrease in grant revenue of $48.3 million, and 3) a decrease in investment income of
$8.2 million, offset by 1) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $2.4 million.










Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $158.1 million is budgeted to
decrease $5.5 million or 3.4% from the 2019 Amended Budget. Fare revenue is projected
to decrease on the Base System and increase for FasTracks. The increase for FasTracks
will come from full-year ridership on SERE and the G Line and partial year ridership on the
N Line based on a May 2020 opening date.
o On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to decrease 11.1% from the 2019
Amended Budget to $111.4 million in 2020.
o For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 22.0% to $46.7 million over the
2019 Amended Budget.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat to lower on Base System with ridership increases
attributed to FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 2.1% in 2020 over
that projected for 2019.
Sales and use tax revenue of $664.7 million in 2020 is forecast to increase 2.0% or
$13.1 million over the 2019 estimate. The 2020 budget incorporates the most recent
September quarterly sales/use tax forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $310.3
million, a decrease of $48.3 million from the 2019 Amended Budget.
o Total Base System grants are estimated to total $150.5 million in 2020; of that
amount, $103.3 million is new grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is
$47.2 million. Base System grants are projected to increase $11.8 million over the
2019 Amended Budget. This includes increases in FTA grants for capital maintenance
(5307), fixed guideway (5337), and bus facilities (5339).
o FasTracks grants are budgeted at $159.8 million, which is a decrease of $60.0 million
from the 2019 Amended Budget. Of the amount, $159.8 million is the projected
carry-forward grant funding to 2020. Operating grant revenue is estimated to decrease
$0.2 million while capital grant revenue is estimated to decrease $59.8 million from
the 2019 Amended Budget, a result of project completion and the winding down of
associated grant revenue.
Combined investment income of $7.5 million is projected to decrease $8.2 million from the
2019 Amended Budget due to expectation of lower interest rates on investable fund
balances.



Other operating income and other income totaling $18.5 million will remain flat from the
2019 Amended Budget. This recurring miscellaneous revenue is increased at the CPI but
is offset by the Build America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off.
Other income also includes payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the
A Line (FasTracks Operations) and DUS rental income (Base System and FasTracks
Operations).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $739.7 million on a combined basis in 2020 (excluding
depreciation), which is $3.6 million lower compared to the 2019 Amended Budget. Base System
operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.9 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are
budgeted to decrease $7.4 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
remain essentially flat.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the 20202025 Mid-term Financial Plan, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in the MTFP, plus
operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2019, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at
the time of the MTFP, net of necessary operating expense reductions. For FasTracks Project, the
decrease in operating expenses is due to completion of several FasTracks projects and capitalization
of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors. For FasTracks Operations, operating expenses include
both direct costs and full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating new service
corridors, including the opening of North Metro, and a higher estimated service payment to Denver
Transit Operators for full-year operation of the G Line. For FasTracks, operating expenses are derived
from the MTFP.
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2020 is $17.3 million for Base System, $4.6 million
for FasTracks Project, and $1.6 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and maintenance
projects approved in the MTFP for the Base System for 2020 and carried in the 2020 budget total
$10.3 million (in 2019 dollars).
It should be noted that reductions were made overall to
departmental operating budgets including expense projects to meet the operating expense targets in
the MTFP for Base System and FasTracks and to make up for estimated shortfalls in sales/use tax
revenue and fare revenue compared to the MTFP.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at a lock price of $2.00 per gallon, compared to a budgeted price of $2.30
per gallon in the 2019 Amended Budget, resulting in a savings of approximately $3.0 million from the
2019 budget. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.90/gallon in 2020, same as the 2019 budgeted price.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the initial
Requested Budget consist of various operating expense item reductions, additions for approved
MTFP expense projects, and new expense items requested over the MTFP amounts.
The 2020 Recommended Budget includes funding for costs for operations related to RTD operation
of the North Metro commuter rail line assuming a May 2020 start of revenue service. This budget of
approximately $16.4 million covers staffing, consumables and spare parts for maintenance of the
infrastructure and passenger facilities, training and other support needed to prepare for revenue
service, power, security, vehicle maintenance, insurance, and contingency.
Interest expense in 2020 is budgeted at $170.4 million on a combined basis, an increase of $18.2
million from the 2019 Amended Budget. The decrease is mainly due to a GASB rule to take effect in

Packet Pg. 20

1.B.3

2020 that no longer allows capitalization of interest during construction. Of total interest expense,
$16.8 million is budgeted for Base System and $153.6 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks
interest expense includes the TABOR interest expense of $35.8 million which is paid with the DTO
service payment.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $88.2 million on a combined basis, which is $11.4
million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the 2015A COPs that
began in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment of $10.0 million in 2020. Base
System principal payments of $65.8 million are $3.2 million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget
due to scheduled principal amortization on current debt. FasTracks principal payments of $22.4
million are $8.2 million higher than the 2019 Amended Budget due to scheduled principal
amortization on current debt and the TABOR principal payment. No new debt issuances are planned
in 2020 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2020.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2019 (previously approved
capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2020. The capital carryforward is $573.6 million made up of $127.7 million on the Base System and $445.9 million on
FasTracks.
New capital spending of $39.7 million on a combined basis will decrease $52.9 million from the
2019 Amended Budget. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $40.6 million to $0.8
million in 2020 due mainly to completion of SERE, North Metro mobilization work, Longmont Station
work, and purchases of Flatiron Flyer vehicles. On the Base System, new capital projects will
decrease $12.4 million to $38.8 million. In major categories, Base System will spend $1.2 million
less in transfer stations, $0.5 million less in park-n-rides, $2.6 million less in capital support projects,
$3.8 million less in LRT construction, and $12.1 million less in fleet modernization and expansion,
offset by higher spend of $3.2 million in facilities construction and maintenance, and $5.5 million in
capital support and equipment. The Base System new capital was approved as part of the MTFP in
October 2019 and is the amount identified for minimum critical projects within SOGR priorities.
After the MTFP was approved, certain projects were deferred for the Base System in order to
balance the 2020 budget.
New capital expenditures for 2020 and the change in new capital in the 2020 Recommended Budget
over the 2020 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B.
The capital carry-forward
expenditures for 2020 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2020 Recommended Budget
over the 2019 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve accounts include maintenance of the Base System
unrestricted year-end fund balance at $2.0 million. This projected fund balance is in alignment with
the MTFP after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized,
however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales
tax revenue in 2020 (this will become evident in the 2020 amended budget). Also on the Base
System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $3.0 million to $26.4 million, the
capital replacement fund is projected to remain at $0, and the unrestricted operating reserve is
projected to be unchanged at $15.4 million.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the three key reserve funds (Board-appropriated,
capital replacement, and unrestricted fund) are maintained at 3 months of operating expenses.
Additionally, in FasTracks Project, the FasTracks management reserve was previously reduced by

Packet Pg. 21

1.B.3

payment in settlement of RRP North Metro project claims in 2018 and is budgeted at $0.9 million.
The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $103.5 million in 2020 from
savings from construction under budget and internal account growth.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to remain essentially flat
compared to the 2019 Amended Budget. These fund balances are maintained in minimum
accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.

Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2020 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures
incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual
target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2020 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base
System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve for the Base System.
The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal
approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and
FasTracks. The 2020 budget reflects maintenance of the FISA at a level deemed sufficient to fund
adjustments to FasTracks operations and maintenance.
On a District-wide basis, the total of these fund balances (excluding the FISA) for 2020 is projected
at $90.2 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $41.9 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $15.5 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and 4) the
remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $17.5 million. The Base System portion of these
fund balances listed for 2020 is projected to total $43.8 million.

Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Attachments
As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2020 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year
2020 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/non-operating
sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and

fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached is the Program Capital
Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget
summary (Attachment A), a Capital Projects (New) summary (Attachment B), and Capital CarryForward Expenditures (Attachment C).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2020 Recommended Budget is balanced, and the total proposed current year appropriation for
the 2020 Recommended Budget (combined Base and FasTracks) is $1.233 billion. This includes an
operating expense budget of $739.7 million, interest expense of $170.4 million, new capital
expenditures of $39.7 million, debt payments of $88.2 million, FasTracks management reserve of
$0.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $103.5 million, Board-appropriated fund of
$41.9 million, capital replacement fund of $15.5 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $17.5 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $573.6 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carryforward is $1.806 billion.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 for the adoption of the 2020 Budget,
Resolution No. ___, Series of 2019 for the 2020 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___,
Series of 2019 for the appropriation of 2020 Previously Appropriated Capital.
2. Do not adopt the 2020 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District will
not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2019. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2019, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

1.C.1.a

The purpose of RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit Function is to provide
independent, objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value and
improve RTD’s processes. The mission of Internal and Information Systems Audit is to
enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective
assurance, advice, and insight. The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function helps
RTD accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate
and improve the effectiveness of governance, risk management, and control processes.
(Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing).
The Internal and Information Systems Audit Function will govern itself by adherence to the
mandatory elements of The Institute of Internal Auditors' International Professional
Practices Framework, including the Core Principles for the Professional Practice of
Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International Standards for the Professional
Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Definition of Internal Auditing. The Manager of
Internal and IT Audit will report periodically to Senior Management and the Board
regarding the function’s conformance to the Code of Ethics and the Standards.

Authority
The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will report functionally to the Board and
administratively (i.e., day-to-day operations) to the General Manager and CEO.
To establish, maintain, and assure that RTD’s Internal and Information Systems Audit
Function has sufficient authority to fulfill its duties, the Board will:

•
•
•
•

Approve the function’s charter.
Approve the risk-based Annual Audit Plan.
Receive communications from the Manager of Internal and IT Audit on the
function’s performance relative to its plan and other matters.
Make appropriate inquiries of management and the Manager of Internal and IT
Audit to determine whether there is inappropriate scope or resource limitations.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will have unrestricted access to, and communicate
and interact directly with, the Board.
The Board and the General Manager and CEO authorize the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function to:

•

Have full, free, and unrestricted access to all functions, records, property, and
personnel pertinent to carrying out any engagement, subject to accountability for
confidentiality and safeguarding of records and information.

Purpose and Mission

1.C.1.a

•

Allocate resources, set frequencies, select subjects, determine scopes of work,
apply techniques required to accomplish audit objectives, and issue reports.
Obtain assistance from the necessary personnel of RTD, as well as other
specialized services from within or outside RTD, in order to complete the
engagement.

The Manager of Internal and IT Audit will ensure that the Internal and Information Systems
Audit Function remains free from all conditions that threaten the ability of all auditors to
carry out their responsibilities in an unbiased manner, including matters of audit selection,
scope, procedures, frequency, timing, and report content. If the Manager of Internal and
IT Audit determines that independence or objectivity may be impaired in fact or
appearance, the details of impairment will be disclosed to appropriate parties.
All auditors will maintain an unbiased mental attitude that allows them to perform
engagements objectively and in such a manner that they believe in their work product,
that no quality compromises are made, and that they do not subordinate their judgment
on audit matters to others.
Auditors will have no direct operational responsibility or authority over any of the activities
audited. Accordingly, auditors will not implement internal controls, develop procedures,
install systems, prepare records, or engage in any other activity that may impair their
judgment, including:

•

Assessing specific operations for which they had responsibility within the previous
year.
• Performing any operational duties for RTD or its affiliates.
• Initiating or approving transactions external to the Internal and Information
Systems Audit Function
• Directing the activities of any RTD employee not employed by the Internal and
Information Systems Audit Function except to the extent that such employees have
been appropriately assigned to auditing teams or to otherwise assist internal
auditors.
Where the Manager of Internal and IT Audit has or is expected to have roles and/or
responsibilities that fall outside of auditing, safeguards will be established to limit
impairments to independence or objectivity.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

December 4, 2019

Subject:

LiVE Update

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: December 5, 2019
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: December 10, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND:
In 2018, the RTD Board of Directors approved a new income-based fare discount program to be
implemented along with several other fare changes in 2019. This new program was named LiVE
(pronounced as in “live your best life”) and was developed using recommendations from the Pass
Program Working Group and public input. LiVE fares offer a 40% discount from RTD’s full fare rates
for eligible customers. To be eligible for the LiVE program, participants must live within the District,
have household incomes at or below 185% of the federal poverty level and be between the ages of 20
and 64 years old. Other RTD fare discount programs apply to those that are ages 19 and under and
ages 65 and older.
In conjunction with the implementation of LiVE, the non-profit fare discount program will transition to
new rules after December 31, 2019.
DISCUSSION
In order to use the discounted LiVE fare products, customers must be able to present a valid LiVE
eligibility card to bus operators and fare inspectors. To obtain this eligibility card, customers must
apply through the State of Colorado’s Program Eligibility and Application Kit (PEAK) website. The
PEAK website is the application point for several public assistance programs, and now also offers an
option to apply for the LiVE program.
Applicants who are enrolled in certain medical, food, or cash assistance programs and fall under the
income threshold for the LiVE Program will automatically be approved (“categorical eligibility”) for the
LiVE program if they choose to apply and fulfill the age and address requirements. Applicants who do
not participate in assistance programs may apply for the LiVE program as well. After an applicant has
submitted all required information through the PEAK system for the LiVE program and has uploaded a
photo, applications that were not automatically approved by the system are reviewed for eligibility by
Denver Human Services. Data for applicants who meet the eligibility requirements and have uploaded
a photo is transferred to RTD and RTD’s LiVE eligibility card vendor for production, mailing, and card
administration. Approved participants can expect to receive their eligibility card within about two
weeks of application approval. Applicants who do not meet eligibility requirements or do not provide
the required photo or information are notified by mail.

1.C.3

The PEAK application for the LiVE program became available to the public on July 29, 2019.
As of December 1, 2019, 3,420 LiVE eligibility applications have been submitted, 2,016 have been
approved, 972 have been denied and the remaining 432 are pending. Of the 972 denied, 658 of them
were denied because of age, i.e. they were 19 or younger or 65 and older which entitles them to a
better discount. 228 were denied because their address was out of District, 8 were denied because it
was a duplicate application, 5 were denied because the applicants were already enrolled, 5 were denied
because they did not respond to requests for additional information, and 68 were denied because they
did not meet the income threshold.
In addition to going live on July 29th, the following actions have been completed:

photos, working with applicants if a better photo is required, and assisting customers
whose cards have been lost or stolen.
The livecard@rtd-denver.com mailbox is active and being utilized to communicate with
customers about photos and cards and to field questions.
A feedback form about the LiVE application experience is available on the RTD website.
RTD staff have promoted the LiVE program and answered questions at community events.
RTD hosted live and webinar training by PEAK Outreach (Boulder County) for nonprofit
organizations that are interested in helping their clients apply for LiVE.
RTD has refined the communications plan for LiVE and is expanding outreach and
marketing activities.
The team has started working on identifying requirements for PEAK enhancements related
to the LiVE application and application processing.

On-Going:



RTD is working closely with the State’s software vendor and Denver Human Services to
work out remaining “bugs”.
RTD staff is pursuing targeted outreach opportunities and is also including LiVE
information and brochures in other RTD outreach activities.
Denver Human Services is providing information and training about LiVE applications to
county and community partners.
RTD is working with nonprofit agencies to ensure a smooth transition from the current
nonprofit program rules procedures to the new ones that go into effect in 2020.

Next Steps:





RTD will continue to refine communications materials and outreach activities.
RTD will conduct a survey of LiVE customers for feedback on all aspects of the LiVE
program.
The team will use feedback from customers, partner organizations, and RTD staff to
evaluate potential enhancements to systems, procedures, and communications.
