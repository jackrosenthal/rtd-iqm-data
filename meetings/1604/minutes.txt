Passenger Cost Analysis
John Tayer asked for this item to be put on agenda. He requested that staff find out if we
can do an analysis of what it would cost us when we have an additional passenger enter
the system. He asked staff to bring back some information of the cost that we look at
when bringing new riders and marketing strategies. He would like an analysis of all
services including all services across the district. What are expectations that we have for
Marketing? What return do we get?
