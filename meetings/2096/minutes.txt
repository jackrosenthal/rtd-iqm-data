There were two retirees for the month of August. Ernie Muniz was present to receive his
award. Mike Gil, Deputy AGM for Operations, recognized Ernie as an outstanding 16 St Mall
Shuttle driver who had a safe record, well known by the people on the mall, and who kept him
on his toes about upcoming events or changes affecting the Mall Shuttle schedule. He quoted
Ernie as having described his work with, “Good people who are good at what they do, he is
proud to be part of the Transportation District.” Ernie expressed pride in his work and job.
Driving the mall shuttle has been his only route where he shared he has received 72
accommodations during his tenure. He will miss the people as he has met a lot of good
people. As someone once said, “Don’t be sad because it is over, smile because it happened.”

GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT
Private Activity Bonds Transaction
General Manager, Phil Washington, spoke about the successful close of the $397M
bonds. Teresa Sedmak was involved in the closing in New York and several members
of the team had participated in meetings with potential investors. This marks a
milestone for the District.
Eagle P3 Project Financial Close and Full Phase 1 Notice to Proceed
General Manager Washington shared the financial close was August 12, 2010 which
forms another checkmark on the blue slide. Full notice to proceed is ahead of schedule.
The next major event is the August 26 groundbreaking at DIA.
Other Matters:
 We locked in fuel for 2011 at $2.36 per gallon. This provides budget certainty.
Director Martinez asked what was the original estimate and what number went into
the budget assumptions. General Manager Washington indicated the original
estimate was around $2.64 and the budget assumption was $2.35. The $2.36
represents the average. Director McMullen inquired what were the levels of
fluctuations. General Manager Washington responded we have seen it up to $2.55
per gallon so the $2.36 is a good lock.
 Base System Safety—Staff continues to focus on base system safety and is making
strides in tracking stats and other information that will help them to manage. This
information on bus and rail safety will be briefed to the Board at the next
Operations Committee meeting.

IX.


New Capital up $239.4M

Base debt payments up $6.1M




local, express, regional and skyRide service by approximately 12.5 percent and would also
include corresponding increases in other multi-ride tickets and passes including Eco Pass
products. Following consideration of public input, staff is further directed to present a final
recommendation to the RTD Board no later than the regularly scheduled Board meeting in
October.

MOTION:

An electronic vote was taken with 15 votes in favor and
0 against.

Chair Kemp declared the motion PASSED Unanimously.
Follow-up Clarifying Discussion:
Director Martinez emphasized this is only a vote to go out to get public comments. General
Manager Washington stated the staff is flexible. Director Cohen indicated part of the
process is to educate our riders and to look for other opportunities. General Manager
Washington stated it is an opportunity to educate our public on “transit economics.”
Director Tayer stated it is important that the discussion around tradeoff between fare
increase and service reductions occur. General Manager Washington agreed and stated
they would discuss the TaskForce Sustainability effort.
H. Approval of 2011-2016 Strategic Budget Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the 2011-2016 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
MOTION:

Director Tayer made the motion to approve the 20112016 Strategic Budget Plan to include option 6 as
provided in the Board packet for 8/17/10.
Director James seconded the motion.

DISCUSSION:

Director Brohl expressed concern with the direction of
implementing fare increases along with service
reductions. She had expected to see other options. She
was referred to page 54 which provided an alternative
option 6 using 1% of operating reserve.
Director Tayer stated either fare increases or service
deductions are difficult decisions which is why it is
important to obtain public input before a final decision is
made.
Terry Howerter, CFO, was asked what would be the
impact if the decision to approve the SBP was delayed.
Terry explained this financial information will be used for
the Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) application on
September 15 for the East Corridor. If the decision is
delayed, he would have to use the previously approved
plan with old numbers which may not have a positive
reflection on the application. Terry also indicated that the
purpose of the SBP is to give direction but the Board
would have a chance to review for their approval of the
budget later in November.
Director Martinez expressed difficulty approving the SBP
plan before we have gone out to the public for a public
hearing. He expressed we are putting the cart before the
horse and he could not support.
Director Bagley stated he was not pleased with the
options and feels there is an option 7. He expressed in
the next 1-1/2 months, the focus should be on new
revenue sources that can be expanded or explored (i.e.

advertising on rail, grants, etc). He would like to get
away from the potential service reduction of $2.0M.
Chair Kemp stated Option 6 does give some flexibility
with the operating reserve as an option. With this
proposal we may use some operating reserve but the TDR
provides opportunity for us to replenish.
Director Brohl inquired if the application for the FFGA
required specific details or can they put some language in
there stating the commitment to the $18.1 but leave the
specific sources open. Terry Howerter responded the
FFGA process is a complex one requiring detailed level
information by the year. General Manager Washington
emphasized it is not prudent to submit a FFGA formal
application for $1.3B without the requested specific data.
He responded we do not want to jeopardize this
application process but internally could make necessary
adjustments as appropriate.
Director Cohen indicated we should continue to look at all
options. He asked a clarification between the 12.1% in
the report with the numbers on p. 52 and was told the
page 52 referred to farebox revenue whereas the report
spoke to revenue increase. Director Cohen stated he too
was looking for more scenarios around varying the %
increases.
Several other Directors expressed concerns around if we
were sending the wrong message to make a decision
around the SBP before the community input had been
received. Director O’Boyle expressed “we are just
kicking the can down the road.” With a gloomy economic
forecast for the next year, it is not wise to use the
operating reserve and he would favor option 5 to 6. This
is a very difficult decision but the Board needs to face up
to it—we must balance the budget. Director McMullen
agreed this is difficult but felt he would support this. He
thinks option 6 is a good compromise and keeps us well
positioned for the FFGA.
Director Brohl inquired how does this 1% increase
compare to other years. Bruce Abel, AGM Operations,
stated we have had higher increases in previous years.
General Manager Washington added we continue to make
surgical cuts but everything is on the table.
Director Daly expressed hopes that the Long Range
Sustainability Task Force would address the issue of new
and sustainable revenue sources.
Director Christopher stated he did not like the options but
the less service cuts the better. We have to make some
tough decisions. The low hanging fruit have long
disappeared. He will support this as a one-time option to
balance the budget for next year while the LR
Sustainability Task Force looks for more sustainable
options.
Chair Kemp expressed these options are difficult for
everyone to deal with. We owe it to the constituents to

get their input. We also need to show the Federal
Government we can keep the agency moving forward.
The agency needs to stay whole. The Long Range
Sustainability Task Force is a proactive step to look for
some alternatives. We need to balance our budget using
the operating reserve, go out to the public to educate
them on the real transit economics and take the
necessary steps to move forward. He plans to support
this motion for Option 6.
Director Busck stated the overwhelming message is one
of how can we improve our process so we do not have to
have these painful discussions each year.
VOTE ON
MOTION:

An electronic vote was taken with 10 votes in favor
(Busck, Cohen, Christopher, Daly, James, Kemp,
Malpiede, Mcmullen, Pulliam and Tayer) and 5 against
(Bagley, Brohl, Martinez, O’Boyle and Tobiassen).
Chair Kemp declared the motion PASSED.

XII.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
There was no unfinished business.

XIII.

NEW BUSINESS
Director Busck apologized to the Board for him and Director Martinez who had been tasked last
year to develop a process for the election to the Executive Committee. They had done the
work but failed to send out to obtain full Board approval. This will be forthcoming in the next
month or so. He commended Chair Kemp for his email, stated his support of the Chair, and
stated that he is running for the 1st Vice-Chair in 2011 and will be running for Chair in 2012.
Director McMullen indicated he has no interest in chairing a committee in 2011 but appreciates
the opportunity that he has had. He shared that he, Directors Tobiassen and O’Boyle along
with staff member Jesse Carter, met with the Arapahoe County Commissioners to discuss
transit need as they transition employees from the old Aurora site at 14th and Chambers to the
new site off Potomac. No commitments were made but people appeared happy with the
direction of the discussion.
