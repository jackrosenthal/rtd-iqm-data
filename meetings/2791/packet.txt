Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached Investment Policy which contains no recommended changes from last year.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in November 2017. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. No changes are recommended this year.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
A copy of the policy is attached in the form adopted by the RTD Board in November 2017.
Recommendation
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the attached Investment Policy with no changes.
2. Adopt the attached Investment Policy with changes

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 7

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-18 (3630 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

1.B.1.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 8

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-18 (3630 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

3.3 Yield

1.B.1.a

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
3
Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy 11-2-18 (3630 : Adoption of the Investment Policy)

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.

Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the
security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time

1.B.1.a

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

1.B.1.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.

The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

Subject:

Adoption of the 2019 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 7, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2019 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In 2019, there are
41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same number as in 2018.
No new performance measures are proposed.
Core Goal #1: Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and they integrate with the Board’s 2019 priorities of enhance
safety and security, service and human capital balance, fiscal sustainability, future transportation
needs, and asset management/state of good repair.
A report detailing year-to-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of
Directors following the end of each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2019 are
brought to the Board of Directors for approval at this time because the measures are used in
development of the 2019 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2018 to 2019 are listed below:


Goal 3.1 Maintain system-wide on-time performance
o A change is proposed to the Regional on-time service measure only from 92% to 88.0%.
Traffic congestion is having a major impact on Regional service on-time performance
(OTP). For example, from 2014-2017, travel time and variability for I-25 southbound
weekday a.m. peak traffic has grown by an average of 9% every year (variability is the
extra time that travelers must add to their average travel time when planning trips to
ensure on-time arrival).
Other factors having an impact include the I-70 corridor
construction, drivers buying their way into HOV lanes, ridership growth from elimination of
Express service, service increases, and regional population growth. Year-to-date through
8/31/18, all regional routes combined had 87% OTP and it is unlikely that this will improve
over the next year.



Goal 5.1 Improve ADA on-time performance
o It is proposed that this measure and its definition be changed for 2019. The goal in 2018
and prior of 96.0% reflected carrier on-time performance (OTP). Changes to our Access-aRide service contracts regarding criteria for issuing liquidated damages for late trips no

Packet Pg. 19

1.B.2

longer make it necessary to have a separate OTP definition for contractors. Passenger
OTP is now relevant and is defined as an operator arriving for pick-up within a 30-minute
scheduled window. Any vehicle arriving at the pick-up location beyond the scheduled
window is considered late. The ADA contracts state that OTP should meet the same OTP
standard as fixed route, which is 86%. Passenger OTP was 88.1% in Q2. The proposed
goal for 2019 is 86.0%, making it consistent with fixed route.


Goal 6.2 Increase in ridership
o It is recommended that the ridership increase for 2019 be established at 4.1% which is
based on the fare revenue model. The fare revenue model incorporates the fare rate
increase approved for 2019, and assumes first time full-year ridership for the G Line and
partial year ridership for SERE in 2019. Overall system ridership is projected to be flat for
Base System with ridership increases attributed to FasTracks. The measure includes all
passenger boardings not limited to revenue ridership. Ridership estimates for the Mall
Shuttle and Free MetroRide are included in the measure.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o It is recommended that the fare revenue increase for 2019 be established at 14.2%. This
is the percentage increase in total fare revenue in the fare revenue model over the 2018
projection. The proposed percentage increase of 14.2% is higher than the fare rate
increase that will take effect in 2019 because the 2018 fare revenue projection is
expected to come in about $3.5 million under budget. The increase is also driven by fare
revenue increases from ridership growth (see 6.2 above). The fare revenue model
assumes full-year ridership for the G Line and partial year ridership for SERE.
o It is recommended that the total operating revenue increase for 2019 be established at
13.6%.
This is the percentage increase in total operating revenue in the 2019
Recommended Budget over the 2018 projection.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2019 Performance Measures are being utilized in the development of the final 2019 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors adopts the attached 2019 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. In
2019, there are 41 proposed performance measures to be tracked for the GM, which is the same
number as in 2018. No new performance measures are proposed.
2. Modify the recommended 2019 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2019 Proposed Performance Report and make required
adjustments, if necessary, to the 2019 Recommended Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2019 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2019 Proposed Performance Report. This is not the recommended action because
it results in no measures for ridership, fare revenue, and total operating revenue and does not aid
in the development of the 2019 Budget.

contracts regarding criteria for issuing liquidated damages for late trips no longer make it necessary to have a separate OTP
definition for contractors. Passenger OTP is now relevant and defined as an operator arriving for pick-up within a 30-minute
scheduled window; any vehicle arriving at the pick-up location beyond the scheduled window is considered late. As of 2019,
the report will reflect passenger OTP.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed 2019 Requested Budget to the
governing body on October 9, 2018. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2019
Requested Budget for public review on October 10, 2018. A public hearing to solicit formal public
comment for the 2019 Recommended Budget is scheduled for the November 27, 2018 regular meeting
of the Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 35

1.B.3

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2019 Recommended Budget (combined Base and
FasTracks) is $1,316.4 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $755.4 million, interest
expense of $152.1 million, capitalized interest of $21.4 million, new capital expenditures of $90.0
million, debt payments of $76.8 million, FasTracks management reserve of $0.9 million, FasTracks
Internal Savings Account of $84.9 million, contingency reserve of $5.0 million, Board-appropriated fund
of $39.8 million, capital replacement fund of $16.4 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4
million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $58.2 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry-forward) is $719.4 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry-forward
is $2,035.8 million.
Overview of the 2019 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,236.8 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $22.7 million (1.9%) in
2019 from the 2018 Amended Budget. This is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $16.8
million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $45.5 million, and 3) an increase in investment income
of $3.9 million, offset by 1) a decrease in grant revenue of $42.9 million, and 2) a decrease in other
income of $0.6 million.








Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenue of $163.6 million is budgeted to
increase 11.5% over the 2018 Amended Budget based on the fare change proposal
presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. The percentage increase
is higher than the fare rate increase that will take effect in 2019 because it is driven by
ridership growth on FasTracks, in part due to full-year ridership in 2019 on the G Line and
partial year ridership for SERE. Based on the model, a higher proportionate amount of fare
revenue is allocated to FasTracks and a lower amount is allocated to Base than in previous
periods.
o On the Base System, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 8.8% over the 2018
Amended Budget to $125.3 million in 2019.
o For FasTracks, farebox revenue is forecast to increase 21.2% to $38.3 million over the
2018 budgeted amount.
Ridership growth is expected to be flat on Base with ridership increases attributed to
FasTracks. Total revenue ridership is projected to grow 4.1% in 2019 over that projected
for 2018.
Sales and use tax revenue of $668.3 million in 2019 is expected to increase 5.6% or
$45.5 million over the 2018 projected level according to the most recent September
quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Total grant revenue, including new and carry-forward amounts, is estimated at $370.9
million, a decrease of $42.9 million from the 2018 Amended Budget.
o Total Base System grants are estimated to total $146.6 million in 2019; of that
amount, $103.2 million is new grants while projected carry-forward grant funding is
$43.4 million. Base System grants are projected to increase $3.9 million from the
2018 Amended Budget. This includes increases in FTA grants for capital maintenance
(5307), fixed guideway (5337), and bus facilities (5339), offset by some decreases in
CMAQ grants.
o FasTracks grants are budgeted at $224.3 million, which is a decrease of $46.8 million
from the 2018 Amended Budget. Of the amount, $224.3 is the projected carry-

forward grant funding to 2019. Operating grant revenue is estimated to decrease $2.9
million while capital grant revenue is estimated to decrease $43.8 million, a result of
project completion and the winding down of associated grant revenue.
Combined investment income of $15.7 million is projected to increase $3.9 million over
the 2018 Amended Budget due to expectation of higher interest rates on investable fund
balances.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $0.6 million from the
2018 Amended Budget. This recurring revenue is increased at the CPI but is offset by the
Build America Bonds subsidy which declines as the bonds are paid off. Other income also
includes payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line (FasTracks
Operations) and DUS rental income (Base).

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $755.4 million on a combined basis in 2019 (excluding
depreciation), which is $55.0 million higher compared to the 2018 Amended Budget. Base System
operating expenses are budgeted to increase $13.0 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are
budgeted to decrease $4.3 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to
increase $46.4 million.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the Mid-term
Financial Plan, plus operating and maintenance projects approved in the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial
Plan, plus operating/expense projects carry-forward from 2018, and other miscellaneous increases
unknown at the time of the Mid-term Financial Plan. For FasTracks Project, the decrease is due to
completion of several FasTracks projects and capitalization of certain costs to the uncompleted corridors.
For FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to both direct costs and full allocation from Base
to FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors, including the opening of SERE and startup/operational costs for North Metro, and a higher estimated service payment to Denver Transit
Operators for Eagle partially due to the early implementation of the University of Colorado A line 4-car
consist in 2019 due to capacity issues. This accelerates by one year what was assumed in the
Concession agreement. For FasTracks, operating expenses are derived from the Mid-term Financial Plan.
The operating/expense project carry-forward to 2019 is $30.3 million for Base System, $14.6 million for
FasTracks Project, and $5.5 million for FasTracks Operations. New operating and maintenance projects
approved in the Mid-term Financial Plan for the Base System for 2019 total $7.6 million (in 2018
dollars). It should be noted that reductions were made overall to departmental operating budgets
including expense projects to bring expenditures into alignment with the Mid-term Financial Plan for Base
and FasTracks.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at an estimated price of $2.30 per gallon, compared to a budgeted price of
$2.20 per gallon in the 2018 Amended Budget, resulting in an incremental higher cost of
approximately $1.0 million over the 2018 budget. Senior staff is reviewing opportunities to lock
diesel at a favorable price for 2019. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.90/gallon in 2019 vs. $2.65/gallon
in the 2018 budget for an increase of $1.1 million coupled with an increase in gallons used.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of additions for approved Mid-Term Finanical Plan expense projects and expense
projects carry-forward, as well as costs for North Metro operations not finalized in the Requested
Budget.

Packet Pg. 37

1.B.3

The 2019 Recommended Budget includes funding for both start-up costs related to RTD operation
of the North Metro commuter rail line and costs for operations assuming August 1, 2019 start of
revenue service. This budget of approximately $24 million covers staffing, consumables and spare
parts to be purchased for maintenance of the infrastructure and passenger facilities, training and
other support needed to prepare for revenue service, power, security, vehicle maintenance,
insurance, and contingency.
Interest expense in 2018 is budgeted at $152.1 million on a combined basis, a decrease of $1.1
million from the 2018 Amended Budget. The decrease is due to the effect of refundings and
rescheduled amortization. Of total interest expense, $19.4 million is budgeted for Base System and
$132.8 million is budgeted for FasTracks. FasTracks interest expense includes the TABOR interest
expense of $35.9 million which is paid with the DTO service payment.
Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $21.4 million, the same amount as in the 2018
Amended Budget, all of which will occur in FasTracks Project for the North Metro debt.
Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2019.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $76.8 million on a combined basis, which is $12.1
million higher than the 2018 Amended Budget due to payment of principal on the 2015A COPs
beginning in 2019 and the inclusion of the TABOR principal payment of $9.4 million in 2019.
Of
the total, Base System principal payments are $62.6 million (increase of $3.6 million) and FasTracks
principal payments are $14.2 million (increase of $8.5 million). No new debt issuances are planned
in 2019 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to
fund major capital purchases and construction in 2019.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2018 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2019. The capital
carry-forward will be $719.4 million made up of $136.5 million on the Base System and $582.9
million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $90.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $120.1 million from the
2018 Amended Budget due to project completion in FasTracks and the completion of LRV purchases
on Base System. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $89.3 million to $39.6 million in
2019 due mainly to completion of purchases of LRVs, a reduction in North Metro mobilization and
system work, offset by purchases of Flatiron Flyer vehicles and work on the Longmont Station.
For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $30.8 million from the 2018 Amended
Budget to $50.3 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $12.1 million less on capital
support projects (only the Welton blank-out sign replacement project is programmed in 2019), $21.7
million less on rail transit (the final purchase of the 29 LRVs was funded in 2018), and $3.4 million
less on capital support equipment (the major project here is the Oracle upgrade). These decreases
will be offset by an increase of $3.9 million in facilities construction and maintenance (a variety of
needed projects throughout the District), and an increase of $3.4 million in fleet modernization and
expansion (on-going purchases of 30-ft and 40-ft transits, Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride cutaway
buses). The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Mid-term Finanical Plan in
October 2018 and is the amount identified for minimum critical projects within SOGR priorities.
New capital expenditures for 2019 and the change in new capital in the 2019 Recommended
Budget over the 2018 Requested Budget are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward

Packet Pg. 38

1.B.3

expenditures for 2018 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2018 Recommended
Budget over the 2017 Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance and reserve changes include an increase in the Base System yearend unrestricted fund balance from the 2018 Amended Budget to $41.7 million. This projected fund
balance is in alignment with the Mid-term Financial Plan after incorporating all revenue and expense
adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected
due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2019 (this will become evident in the
2019 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to
increase by $3.0 million to $23.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected to remain at $0,
and the unrestricted operating reserve is projected to increase by $0.7 million to $15.4 million.
A $5.0 million contingency reserve is carried for the second year for the Base System. The purpose
of this reserve is to cover unanticipated needs that may arise through the fiscal year. The funds will
be used at the General Manager’s discretion to fund unbudgeted inflationary increases, respond to
emergencies, new regulations, and cover cost overruns within his Board delegated authority.
In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the reserve funds are maintained at 3 months of
operating expenses. Additionally, in FasTracks Project, the FasTracks management reserve was
reduced by payment in settlement of RRP North Metro project claims and is now budgeted at $0.9
million. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is budgeted to grow to $84.9 million in
2019 from savings from construction under budget and internal account growth.
On a District-wide basis, the total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve and the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $21.4
million over the 2018 Amended Budget. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal
policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations)
per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2019 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2019 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a
capital replacement fund, and the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base
System and FasTracks, as well as an additional unrestricted operating reserve for the Base System. The
objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately
three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The
2019 budget reflects maintenance of the FISA at a level deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to
FasTracks operations and maintenance.
On a District-wide basis, the total of these fund balances (excluding the FISA) for 2019 is projected at
$129.9 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $39.8 million, 2) the capital replacement
fund of $16.4 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $15.4 million, and 4) the remaining
unrestricted year-end fund balance of $58.2 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances
listed for 2019 is projected to total $80.5 million.

Attachments
As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2019 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year
2019 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/non-operating sources,
debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and fund balances
of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached is the Program Capital Summary
including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget summary
(Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary (Attachment B), and Capital Carry-Forward
Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 for the adoption of the 2019 Budget, Resolution No. ___,
Series of 2018 for the 2019 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2018 for the
appropriation of 2019 Previously Appropriated Capital.
2. Revise the 2019 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2019 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District will not
be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by December 31,
2018. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2018, State statute (29-1-108
(3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations
and maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,
Administration

Date:

November 7, 2018

Subject:

Adoption of Free Rides for Active Duty US
Military Personnel

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 7, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military for the period of
January 1, 2019- December 31, 2019.
Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications and Community Outreach
BACKGROUND
Since the fall of 2006, RTD has offered free rides for active members of the United States Military. This
action is taken by the RTD Board of Directors on an annual basis. As a result of these actions, all active
duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard, and Reserves are
entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as service to the airport and
BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in uniform or

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Bill Van Meter to a term expiring 12/31/2019
and reappointing Sylvia Francis to a term expiring 12/31/2020 as trustees for the Salaried Employee
Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management, Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability, and Task Goal #2 –
Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of 2008 providing that
a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee Pension Trust
Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit Committee) will screen
applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management salaried
employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board.
In 2010, Resolution No. 27 made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have
served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not
necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the RTD
Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors amended the
Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle” management
distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee Trustees who
participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan, in addition to
the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a
permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts.
Sylvia Francis current term expires 12/31/2018.
Series 2010 for reappointment.

She meets the criteria from Resolution No. 2017,

Scott Reed a Trustee who is a Pension Plan participant has retired from RTD; thereby leaving a vacancy
for an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Benefit (Pension) plan to serve as the same trustee
on both of the Trusts be selected by the Board.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and Bill Van Meter is recommended for
appointment as a trustee to the Plans to carry out the remaining term of Scott Reed who has retired.

committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

Access-a-Ride Fares for 2019

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 13, 2018
Information

CURRENT STATUS
On September 18, 2018, the Board adopted the preferred alternative fare structure recommended by
staff. During discussion on the action item, staff was asked to review the recommendation for the
Access-a-Ride fares to include keeping the fares the same as 2018 for one additional year.
Staff has reviewed the recommendation that was adopted for Access-a-Ride. The adopted fares were
$5.00 for local, $9.00 for regional, and $20.00 for airport. Staff is recommending keeping the Accessa-Ride fares as adopted by the Board in September.







Access-a-Ride is RTD’s most expensive service
o For 2017, fully allocated cost per boarding was approximately $62.00
On December 9, 1992, the Board of Directors adopted the 1993 ADA Paratransit Plan update. In
that update, it states that “the fare for this service will not exceed two times the regular
undiscounted fare for a trip of similar length and at the same time of the day on the fixed route
system.”
Based on the 1992, Board adopted policy, the original staff recommendation was twice the cash
fare, i.e. $6.00 – Local, $10.50 – Regional, and $21.00 Airport.
Large number of comments were received through the public hearing process about the fare
increase for Access-a-Ride
A special joint meeting was held with the two RTD Advisory Committees to discuss the fare
increase for Access-a-Ride
As a result of that meeting, the staff recommendation was changed to $5.00 for local, $9.00 for
regional, and $20.00 for airport. This recommendation results in the following change from 2018
to 2019.
o $0.30 increase for local
o $0.50 increase for regional
o $2.50 increase for airport

Staff is looking for guidance as to how to move forward.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of keeping the fares the same: $4.70 – Local, $8.50 – Regional, and $17.50 –
Airport, is estimated at $300,000 for 2019.

DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2018 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the third
quarter of 2018. The U.S. unemployment rate decreased to 3.7% and general inflationary pressures
remained tame.
In view of inflation and labor market conditions, Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to
raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 2.25 percent. The Committee also dropped the
language saying that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative” from their September
statement.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

3rd Quarter

RTD cash and cash equivalents:

RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

0.326%
0.460%

0.511%
1.117%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio for the month of September was 2.11%. Year to date
invest earnings if annualized would produce earnings of approximately $7.8 million.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Fiscal Sustainability Update

CFO/AGM,

Date: November 7, 2018

Board Meeting Date: November 13, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in March 2018. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the Task
Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded comments
are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate new FasTracks lines opened since 2016 and further service modifications may come
forward with the opening of new lines. Certain service revisions are made with each runboard period in
response to public feedback, internal ridership and utilization data. We will continue to assess service
optimization.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks. While FasTracks

Packet Pg. 87

1.C.4

has met this objective, the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal within the
six-year term of the Strategic Budget Plan.
Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in January 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating facilities and installed equipment and lighting
upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy upgrades throughout the District in the annual
budget. We will continue to address energy efficiency in building systems as on-going projects are
completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate
sponsorship contracts will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, partnering
with the City & County of Denver on Route 15L improvements, as well as TOD activities. RTD
continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons who park longer than
24 hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature prohibited the charging of daily
parking fees to in-District patrons at District facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking
management briefing at a study session that focused on a consultant-led pay-for-parking study. In

Packet Pg. 88

1.C.4

December 2016, the Board approved the Parking Guiding Principles, which clarify how future changes
to parking policy will be evaluated.
Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on
items taxed.
