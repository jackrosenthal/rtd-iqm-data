RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring
12/31/2020 as trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried
Employee Defined Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On August 16, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan, with termination
dates to provide for staggered terms. The terms of Scott Reed and Derrick Black expired on 12/31/17.
Resolution No. 27 Series of 2010, made modification to state that, “for reappointment of Trustees who
have served satisfactorily and in whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is
not necessary to seek applications for renewal, and instead the application process established by the
RTD Board of Directors in 2008 will be used on those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or
appropriate to appoint new salaried trustees to the Trusts.”
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
attached Resolution No. ______ reappointing Scott Reed and Derrick Black, to terms expiring 12/31/2020 as
trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require a revised
recommendation. This is not the recommended action.

Project Carryforward for SmartCard Stored

CFO/AGM,

Date: January 17, 2018

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 30, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve a budget transfer of $1,919,147 from the operating reserve to the Information
Technology Base System capital project budget, effective January 1, 2018, to allow for the
completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project (#10322) that was not completed
in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that
were not spent on this project in 2017.
BACKGROUND
The 2018 Adopted Budget includes an amount for previously-approved projects carried forward from
2017. The basis to determine the amount to be carried forward is the Oracle accounting system.
The locally-funded SmartCard Stored Value Implementation Project was closed in error in Oracle,
therefore it was not included in the final capital carryforward report generated in Oracle. The project
was discovered in an Oracle post-budget capital carry-forward report in which the project had been
reopened.
DISCUSSION
The balance of the funds for this project totaling $1,919,147 were not accrued or spent at the end
of 2017. The transfer from the operating reserve to fund the carry-forward to 2018 will allow the
project to proceed in 2018. This transfer will allow RTD to continue work on this SmartCard
project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no net financial impact to RTD. The unspent funds for this project were included in the
general fund balance at year-end. The savings to RTD from not completing the project in 2017 will
be carried forward and be used to replenish the operating reserve at the time of the 2018 Amended
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a transfer of $1,919,147 from the
operating reserve to the Information Technology capital project budget, effective January 1,
2018, to allow for completion of the SmartCard Stored Value Implementati on Project that was
not completed in 2017. The operating reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended
Budget with funds that were not spent on this project in 2017.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the requested budget transfer at this time.
Instead, include this request as part of the 2018 Amended Budget. This action is not recommended
since it will require RTD to suspend work on this project, and will not allow RTD to advance the
ongoing SmartCard project as a whole.

Subject:

RTD Code of Ethics

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: January 17, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: January 23, 2018
Information

No action required; for information only at the January 23 Finance Administration & Audit Committee. A
Recommended Action regarding the following may be taken to the following Finance Administration &
Audit Committee in February.
BACKGROUND
The current RTD Code of Ethics (Code) was approved by the Board of Directors January 21, 2003.
RTD’s Code is consistent with FTA requirements that the District have a Board-approved code of ethics
applicable to the Board as well as to RTD employees with responsibility for procurement. However, while
such a “procurement code of ethics” provides guidance for specific employees and protection for RTD in
situations related to contractual relationships, it fails to guide RTD Directors and Staff on broader, more
basic ethical standards by which all RTD representatives should be measured. RTD’s current Code has
long caused confusion because while it is given to all RTD employees, only a small subset of RTD
employees are actually subject to its terms. The current Code also needs updating to adhere to current
legal requirements. Staff is tonight presenting a draft of a new Code, and is seeking comments,
questions and suggestions before presenting a final draft and recommended action to this Committee in
January.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.1

RTD decided that updating the RTD Code of Ethics was a valuable project that could successfully be
assigned to the 2017 Leadership Academy. The project was taken on by a team of RTD represented and
salaried employees: Todd Kier, Corey Petzinger, Karl Shoemaker and Raleigh Elstun. The team has been
sponsored and mentored by RTD’s General Counsel Department and Education, Training & Development
Division.
The proposed new RTD Code of Ethics started as a clean sheet. The cohesive team collaborated, set
goals, planned the work, and then worked their plan. The team identified current FTA requirements and
researched other transit agency Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit, SEPTA) for ideas
and guidance.
The team and General Counsel ultimately decided to have a two-part Code of Ethics: the main part
which pertains to all employees, and a smaller part with additional standards which pertain to employees
with fiduciary responsibilities. This arrangement was determined to be optimal for clarity, simplicity,
functionality, and applicability for all employees.
Unlike the current Code, the proposed Code of Ethics is much shorter, far less technical in language, and
goes beyond procurement to express basic ethical standards applicable to all RTD representatives:
Integrity, Honesty, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Sustainability.
Instead of the current document in which examples and explanatory comments are part of the Boardapproved Code and can therefore only be updated or revised through Board action, the proposed Code
offloads examples and comments into a separate procedure which will be maintained and updated as
necessary by RTD’s General Counsel. This keeps the Board-approved Code of Ethics clean and simple,
and allows for regular updating of examples as necessary to ensure that they stay relevant and address
current concerns and questions.
The proposed Code includes changes addressing changes in law since 2003, and applies monetary
standards for gifts based on those now applicable to other public employees under the Colorado
Constitution (through the ballot initiative Amendment 41).
The Leadership Academy team gave presentations and conducted interviews with many RTD
stakeholders including Safety, Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Asset
Management, and RTD’s General Manager. Drafts were also provided to the Union for review and
comment. This outreach provided invaluable information and perspectives to aid the team to create the
most relevant and highest quality Code of Ethics possible. The draft Code of Ethics presented tonight is
an original document that satisfies legal requirements as well as major stakeholders’ wishes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no adverse financial impact to adopting the new Code of Ethics. There will be mino r costs in
printing and distributing the new Code and obtaining approvals. RTD already conducts training
courses in ethics to new and other employees. RTD will educate employees on the Code of Ethics
and is planning to roll out training and education within RTD’s existing education and training
budget.

Executive Summary
Leadership Academy Code of Ethics Project
Todd Kier - Cory Petzinger - Karl Shoemaker - Raleigh Elstun
Sponsors: Rolf Asphaug and Pam Kachka

Introduction: The current RTD Code of Ethics (COE) is self-limited in applicability to employees who interact
with contractors or whose roles include contract assignments and reviews. While this provides a level of
guidance for specific employees and a level of protection for RTD in situations related to contractual
relationships, there is no standard by which all employees conduct is guided.
Objectives:





Work closely with RTD legal counsel to develop a comprehensive Code of Conduct/Ethics that is
applicable to all RTD employees
Develop a rollout plan for 2018
Work with the Employee Onboarding & Orientation project team to incorporate the Code of
Conduct/Ethics
Cooperate with ETD to develop the necessary training for new and existing employees

Background:




Previous Code of Ethics was written in 2003 and needs updating to adhere to current FTA requirements
Applied only to a limited number of employees
Need up-to-date data and relevant examples

Process:







Research other Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit, SEPTA) for ideas and guidance
Get input from RTD Stakeholders (Safety/Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor
Relations, Asset Management, CEO)
Create an original document that satisfies FTA requirements, major stakeholders’ requirements,
followed by an abridged version of the document in order to be simple and concise in delivering the
message of the new Code of Ethics that encompasses all members of RTD.
Present to Board of Directors for review and approval
Consult with Union counsel in order to get “buy in”, and avoid any pitfalls

Recommendations:



Company-wide adoption of the new Code of Ethics, now applicable to all employees



The creation of a new internal Ethics course complete interactive webinars made possible by ETD’s new
Franklin Covey software package.



The marketing department can create a campaign to introduce the new Code of Ethics, explaining why
it is valuable to our corporate culture, and to invite employees to participate in the upcoming training
course.

A.

Introduction

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. Those of us who supervise others must
foster an atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD policies and procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics
training and resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are
ever unsure whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for
a written advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team
consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.3. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.4. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any contract
or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative capacity.
1.5. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado
Constitution Art. XXIX (Amendment 41). To confirm the current dollar limit, click
here for RTD’s ethics procedures or contact RTD‘s General Counsel.

Contracts with Current and Former Employees

For RTD employees who have responsibility for procurements or who are engaged in the
award or administration of contracts, RTD is generally prohibited from entering into contracts
with such employees, or with such former employees within one year of termination of
employment.

1. Contracts with Current Employees
RTD will not enter into any transaction involving goods, services or
property with an RTD employee, or with a person or entity in which an
RTD employee has an interest.
RTD employees are considered to have an interest in transactions involving:
1. Any immediate family member (spouse or domestic partner, and their
parents, children, brothers and sisters)
2. Any person or entity with whom an RTD employee has an agreement to
receive (or reasonable expectation of receiving) any benefit
3. Any entity in which an employee is a director, officer, employee, prospective
employee, or shareholder
4. Any debtor of the employee

situation is prepared by the General Manager and submitted to the Board of
Directors at its next regular meeting.
5. Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict, and

Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in the contract file.

2. Contracts with Former Employees
RTD will not contract with, or take any act favorably affecting, any person,
or any entity represented by a person, who has within the preceding one

employment under standard policies approved by RTD’s Human Resources Division.
This section will not apply in cases where a contract involving a current employee
would be exempted. Any such exceptions must be fully disclosed and documented in
the contract file.

D.

Annual Disclosure

Employees in positions determined by RTD to be responsible for
procurements or engaged in the award or administration of contracts must
complete and submit to the General Counsel an interest disclosure form subject to

Advice, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violation

If you are unsure as to whether an action may violate this Code of Ethics, you should
first consult the comments and examples in RTD’s official policies and procedures, and then
contact RTD’s General Counsel if you still have questions. If you are ever unsure whether
anything you do may violate this Code, contact the General Counsel for a written advisory
opinion before taking action.
An employee or director violating this Code of Ethics may be subject to discipline up to
and including termination of employment, or such action or penalties as authorized by RTD’s
Bylaws, respectively, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law.
A contractor’s or agent’s contract with RTD may include terms incorporating all or part
of this Code of Ethics and treating contractor employees as RTD employees for such purposes.
Violation of this Code may be considered a breach of the contract with RTD or grounds for
disbarment from future RTD contracts.

Construction and Authority

The RTD Board of Directors has approved this Code of Ethics. This Code replaces all
prior Codes, but does not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply.
This Code of Ethics is to be construed liberally to promote its purposes and to
supplement such other rules, regulations and laws as may apply.
This Code of Ethics is prospective, not retroactive, in application. The provisions of this
Code are severable; i.e., if any of its provisions are deemed unconstitutional or invalid, that will
not affect or impair any of the remaining provisions.
This Code of Ethics is based on and supplements provisions in the Regional
Transportation District Act and RTD's Bylaws, as amended, to which RTD directors and
employees are also subject.

The disclosure form is kept confidential and is used to create a general, nonpersonalized list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing
business. No financial data is required. Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see
if there are relationships that could cause a conflict of interest, in which case the General
Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Management will consult.

Section 2. Official Interest Only.
(a) No member of the Board of Directors, nor any employee or agent of
the District, shall be interested in any contract or transaction with the
District except in his official representative capacity, or as provided in his
contract of employment with the District.
(b) Neither the holding of any office or employment in the government of
any municipality or other public body or the federal government, nor the
owning of any property within the State of Colorado shall be deemed a
disqualification for membership on the Board of Directors or employment
by the District, nor a disqualification for compensation for services as a
member of the Board of Directors, or as an employee or agent of the
District.
This Code of Ethics incorporates and expands to non-federally-supported RTD contracts
as RTD rules the following requirements for federal grantees in FTA Circular 4220.1F (March 18,
2013), Ch. 3, as amended:
1. WRITTEN STANDARDS OF CONDUCT. The Common Grant Rules require each
recipient to maintain written standards of conduct governing the performance of its
employees that are engaged in or otherwise involved in the award or administration of
third party contracts.
a. Personal Conflicts of Interest. As provided in the Common Grant Rules and in
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, no employee,
officer, agent, or board member, or his or her immediate family member,
partner, or organization that employs or is about to employ any of the
foregoing individuals may participate in the selection, award, or
administration of a contract supported with FTA assistance if a conflict of

Introduction

At the same time, qualified persons should be encouraged to serve as RTD directors
and employees. RTD directors and employees should be permitted to pursue their own
private interests except where a conflict of interest would result.
The rules in this Code are intended to be simple and reasonable. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of the standards in this Code will not be accepted. Any RTD
director or employee unsure of what is expected should also review the comments
following each rule. If after reviewing the Code, including its comments and examples, any
person remains in any way uncertain whether an action will violate this Code, the person
should request an advisory opinion from the General Counsel before taking the action.

2.

Definitions

Business means a corporation, partnership, sole proprietor, or any other person or
organization carrying on an enterprise for profit.

This Code of Ethics establishes mandatory ethical standards for directors and
employees of the Regional Transportation District. To merit the trust of the public we
serve, RTD directors and employees must not be motivated by personal or private gain in
performing official duties, and must conduct themselves to avoid any appearance of such
motives. In addition, federal procurement regulations require RTD to maintain a written
code of standards of conduct governing the performance of directors and employees
engaged in the award and administration of contracts.1

Has access to confidential information relevant to contracts or contracting
decisions;

3.

Is in a position to influence contracting decisions; or

4.

Has supervisory control of an inspection or audit function with respect to
contract performance or in relation to contract disputes.

The term “employee” includes RTD directors, officers, agents and consultants
unless expressly excluded elsewhere in this Code. The term “employee” also
includes any person who holds a position with the District at manager level or
above, or who otherwise holds a position from time to time designated as such by
the District in accordance with the above standards.
Employment means any rendering of services on request, whether paid or unpaid.
Immediate family means an employee’s spouse or domestic partner, and their parents,

Interest means any direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit held by or accruing to an
employee arising from a transaction involving official action by the District. Unless
otherwise provided, the term "interest" does not include any remote interest. An
RTD employee is deemed to have an "interest" in transactions involving:
1.

Any person in the employee's immediate family;

2.

Any person with whom a contractual relationship exists, whereby the
employee may receive any payment or other benefit;

3.

Any business in which the employee is a director, officer, employee,
prospective employee, or shareholder; or

4.

Any person of whom the employee is a creditor, whether secured or
unsecured.

Official act means any administrative, appointive, or discretionary act of the District or its
employees.

The RTD Act and RTD By-Laws

This Code is based on provisions in the state Regional Transportation District Act
and RTD's own Bylaws to which RTD directors and employees are subject.
The Regional Transportation District Act states:
32-9-118. Conflicts of interest prohibited. No director, officer, employee,
or agent of the District shall be interested in any contract or transaction with
the District except in his official representative capacity.
RTD's Bylaws state, at Article X:
Section 1. Refrain from Participation. Any member of the Board who is
present at a meeting at which is discussed any matter in which he has,
directly or indirectly, a private pecuniary or property interest, shall declare
that he has a conflict and shall refrain from advocating for or against the
matter, and shall not vote in respect to such matter.

Property means any real or personal property, whether tangible or intangible, and includes
currency and commercial paper.

Section 2. Official Interest Only.

(b) Neither the holding of any office or employment in the
government of any municipality or other public body or the federal
government, nor the owning of any property within the State of
Colorado shall be deemed a disqualification for membership on the
Board of Directors or employment by the District, nor a
disqualification for compensation for services as a member of the
Board of Directors, or as an employee or agent of the District.

4.

Impartiality

RTD employees must avoid giving the impression that any person can improperly
influence them in their performance of official acts.
Comment:
This section prohibits employees from taking any action, whether in
an official or private capacity, which may cause the public to suspect favoritism by the
District. This section should be read together with the provisions of section 11 of this
Code on disqualification.
Examples:
1.

An RTD employee writes a letter to the editor of a local newspaper
criticizing the District for failing to hire a contractor with whom the
employee has had substantial private business dealings. The employee’s
actions violate this section.

2.

While participating in the selection process for a firm to contract with the
District, an RTD employee allows representatives of a potential contractor to
pay for the employee’s travel expenses and/or lodging. The employee’s
actions violate this section.

3.

An RTD employee is elected to the local city council. The employee may
hold office without violating this section; however, the employee should
declare that she has a conflict and refrain from advocating or participating in
contracts or agreements concerning the District.

Gifts, Entertainment and Favors

1.

To do so may give the appearance that the employee will be influenced in
the discharge of official duties;

2.

The employee recently has been, is now, or in the near future may be
involved in any official act directly affecting the donor or lender; or

3.

The employee has or appears to have influence over actions of the District
affecting the donor or lender.

This section does not apply to infrequent, non-pecuniary gifts of insignificant value
such as inexpensive food or refreshments in the ordinary course of a business meeting, or
such as unsolicited advertising material such as pens, pencils, calendars or other businessrelated items.
This section also does not apply to items, even if of significant value, when the
circumstances should make it clear that an obvious, long-standing social or family
relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned is the motivating factor, or
when the item is an award publicly presented in recognition of public service, or to random
drawings open to and participated in by the public.
An employee may also receive voluntary gifts of nominal value on a special
occasion such as a birthday, marriage, birth, religious holiday, illness, retirement or
transfer.
Comment:
The purpose of this section is to prohibit the solicitation or
acceptance of any gift, whether in the form of money, services, loans, travel,
entertainment, hospitality or promises, under circumstances in which it reasonably could
be inferred that the gift was intended to influence the recipient, or could be expected to
influence the recipient, in the performance of official duties.
Examples:
1.

An RTD employee asks the president of a company seeking a contract with
the District to find employment for the employee’s nephew in the company.
The employee’s request violates this section.

2.

An RTD employee enters his name in a special sweepstakes drawing
sponsored by a company that from time to time has business dealings with
the District. The drawing is not open to and participated in by the general
public. The employee’s name is drawn as the winner of an all-expense paid

3.

An RTD employee owns a construction company. An officer of a
construction firm seeking a contract with the District promises to buy the
necessary materials for the contract from the employee’s company if the
officer’s firm wins the RTD contract. In reliance upon the officer’s promise,
the RTD employee tries to have the contract awarded to the officer’s firm.
The employee’s actions violate this section.

4.

In the course of a business meeting outside RTD’s offices, an RTD employee
accepts coffee and sandwiches offered by representatives of a company
hoping to bid upon matters for which the employee has responsibility. The
employee’s actions do not violate this section provided the value of the food
is insignificant.

Contracts Involving Employees

The District shall not enter into any contract involving goods, services or property
with an RTD employee or with a business or organization in which an RTD employee has
an interest (as defined in section 2 of this Code). This section shall not apply in the case
of:
1.

Contracts with a business that is the only available source for essential
goods, services or property;

2.

The designation of a bank or trust company as a depository for District
funds, or the borrowing of funds from any bank or lending institution that
offers the lowest available rate of interest for such loan;

3.

Contracts entered into with a business that employs a District consultant,
provided that such employment is not incompatible with the consultant’s
duties to the District;

4.

Contracts under emergency circumstances, provided that a record explaining
the emergency is prepared by the General Manager and submitted to the
Board of Directors at its next regular meeting and thereafter kept on file;

5.

Contracts entered into with full disclosure and knowledge of the conflict,
and approval of the contract, by the Board of Directors; or

6.

Contracts where the employee’s interest in the contract is a remote interest
(as defined in section 2 of this Code) and is fully disclosed.

vacation valued at $1,000. The employee’s acceptance of the prize violates
this section.

1.C.1.c

Comment:
This section merely reiterates the general prohibition against public
entities contracting with employees. Such contracts may give the appearance of selfdealing. While the District is responsible for avoiding such contracts, it is equally improper
for employees knowingly to enter into such a contract.
To come within this section, the contract need not be directly between RTD and an
employee, but may also be between RTD and a business in which an employee has an
interest. Such interest need not be financial in nature; for example, a family relationship
may be sufficient to establish a prohibited interest.

1.

An RTD employee is also an officer of a public utility company that provides
the only available service of its kind. Although the District is not prohibited
from contracting for such services with the employee’s company, the
employee should disqualify herself from participating in any discussion or
decision concerning the contract or the services provided to RTD.

2.

An RTD employee is also an officer of a bank that offers the same rate of
interest for loans sought by RTD as do other lending institutions within the
District’s boundaries. The District should not seek to borrow funds from the
employee’s bank. However, if the employee’s bank offers the lowest rate of
interest, the District may borrow funds from the bank provided that the
employee discloses his interest and disqualifies himself from participating in
any manner in the transaction.

3.

An RTD employee approves a contract with a construction firm that,
pursuant to a prior agreement, subsequently assigns at a discount the
proceeds of the contract to a firm in which the employee is a partner. The
employee’s approval of the contract violates this section even if the
employee sells her partnership interest before the actual assignment of the
proceeds.

4.

An RTD employee owns a few shares -- less than five percent -- of a
publicly-traded company with which the District contracts for goods. The
employee’s actions do not violate this section because the employee’s
interest in the company is a “remote interest” as defined in section 2 of the
Code.

Confidential Information

No employee shall disclose, use, or allow others to use for private interests
confidential information acquired by virtue of the employee’s position or employment with
the District.

Even if not intended for financial gain, the unauthorized or premature release of
confidential information to a relative, friend or business associate tends to undermine
public confidence in the District and is therefore prohibited.
Examples:

8.

1.

An RTD employee buys land knowing, but without disclosing, that RTD is
planning a new transit line that will substantially increase the land’s value.
The employee’s actions violate this section.

2.

An RTD employee invests, or advises a friend to invest, in securities of a
company about to be awarded a highly profitable contract with the District.
The employee’s investment or advice violates this section.

Representation

No employee shall represent, advise or appear on behalf of any person or firm
concerning any contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of an official act or
action of the District. No employee shall use or attempt to use the employee’s official
position to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for the employee or other
persons.
Comment:
This section is intended to prevent both the actual practice and public
appearance of “influence-peddling.” The prohibition extends to appeals made on behalf of
an undisclosed person.

9.

Incompatible Employment or Services

No employee shall engage in, accept employment with, or render services for any
private business or professional activity when such would be adverse to or incompatible
with the proper discharge of the employee’s official duties.

Comment:
An RTD employee must not use for the employee’s or others’
financial gain “inside” information not generally available to the public and to which the
employee has access solely because of the employee’s association with the District.

1.C.1.c

Comment:
This section is intended to ensure that District employees do not
accept other employment that may impair the employees’ abilities to exercise independent,
objective judgment in their official roles. Other employment may be incompatible with
employment at RTD either due to physical inability to perform the functions of both jobs or
due the duties and functions of the two jobs being inherently inconsistent.
Example:
An RTD employee is charged with supervision and approval of work on
District property performed by an outside contractor. The employee accepts
a second job with the company that performs such work. The employee’s
dual employment is incompatible and violates this section.

10. Disclosure
An employee who has an interest that the employee has reason to believe may be
affected by the employee’s official acts, or by the official acts of the District, shall fully
disclose such interest to the General Counsel for a determination as to whether such
interest violates this Code.
An employee with any interest, direct or indirect, in any contract to which the
District is or is about to become a party, or in any other business with the District, shall
fully disclose such interest to the General Counsel for a determination as to whether such
interest violates this Code.
Employees with responsibility for District procurements shall complete and submit
to the General Counsel a yearly interest disclosure form. The information required by the
disclosure form is intended only to disclose the nature of relationships that an employee
may have that could result in a conflict of interest, and therefore no financial data is
required. The information is intended to disclose investments in businesses that engage in
activities related to the business of RTD, such as: transit equipment suppliers, companies
engaged in manufacturing rail transit rolling stock and related components, and
construction companies engaged in transit systems, etc. The General Counsel will use the
disclosure forms to prepare a general, non-personalized list of those persons or entities
with whom the District should not do business. The General Counsel will provide the list to
the Manager of Materials Management. Should the Manager of Materials Management
question whether it is proper for RTD to do business with a person or entity appearing on
the list, the Manager will request the General Counsel for a determination as to whether a
conflict of interest exists.
Comment:
Disclosure is fundamental to monitoring potential conflicts of interest, and in
maintaining public confidence in the good faith and impartiality of employees making

1.

1.C.1.c

The increasingly complex nature and scope of the activities of the District means
that inadvertent conflicts may arise, causing public embarrassment or scrutiny of both the
employee involved and the organization. To prevent the possibility of an inadvertent
conflict of interest and to provide as much protection as possible to employees and the
District from being placed in such a position, this Code requires yearly disclosure of
interests in certain categories of businesses by employees with responsibility for
procurements.
Examples:
1.

An employee is a creditor of an insolvent company being considered for
construction work by the District. The employee should disclose her interest
to the General Counsel.

2.

An employee is uncertain whether his relationship with a company being
considered for work by the District warrants disclosure. The employee
should disclose his relationship to the General Counsel for an advisory
opinion.

3.

An employee has responsibility for approval of certain District contracts. The
employee should fill out and submit a yearly disclosure form.

11. Disqualification
An employee is disqualified from participating in any official act directly affecting a
business or activity in which the employee has any interest or remote interest.
Comment:
This section is intended to prevent conflicts of interest from arising after the
District has awarded a contract to a business in which an employee has an interest. For
example, while this Code permits transactions involving businesses in which District
employees have remote interests, this section prohibits employees with even remote
interests from participating in official acts affecting such businesses.

RTD Code of Ethics (1/21/2003 rev.)

Packet Pg. 33

official acts on behalf of the District. The burden of making such disclosures rests on the
individual employees. The District’s employees are held to a high standard of care and
good faith to ensure that no potential interest goes undisclosed. Any concerned individual
should, on his or her own initiative, request the General Counsel for an advisory opinion as
to whether a particular personal or financial relationship warrants disclosure under this
section.

1.C.1.c

1.

An employee holds less than five percent of the shares of a business with
which the District does business. The employee should not participate in any
official act directly affecting the business.

2.

An employee is a director of a nonprofit organization with which the District
has a contract. The employee should not participate in any official act
directly affecting the organization.

3.

An employee is seeking employment with a business that is bidding on a
District contract. Since a person is deemed to have an interest in
transactions involving a prospective employer, the employee should not
participate in any official act directly affecting the business.

12. Acquiring an Interest
No employee shall acquire an interest in any contract or transaction when such an
interest may be affected, directly or indirectly, by the employee’s or the District’s official
acts.
Comment:
This section prevents employees from making investments or otherwise acquiring
interests that create or may give the appearance of creating a conflict with their official
duties or the District’s official acts. If an employee acquires an interest in good faith and
without reason to believe that a conflict or the appearance of a conflict is created, the
employee is not required to divest herself of the interest; however, as required elsewhere
in this Code, the employee should fully disclose the nature and extent of the interest when
she discovers the conflict or appearance of a conflict, and should refrain from participating
in any official acts affecting her interest.
This Code does not prohibit employees from retaining an otherwise prohibited
interest acquired prior to the interest holder’s election, appointment, or employment with
the District, provided that the existence of such interest is properly disclosed. However,
this section prohibits renewal or expansion of such an interest.
Examples:
1.

An employee acquires stock in a company from which the District has
recently made a cash purchase of equipment. Because the purchase is a
completed transaction and unlikely to be affected by the official acts of
either the employee or the District, the employee’s stock ownership does
not violate of this section.

Packet Pg. 34

Attachment: Code of Ethics - Existing (3362 : RTD Code of Ethics)

Examples:

1.C.1.c

2.

An employee who supervises and approves certain construction work by a
contractor acquires an interest in a company to which some of the work is
later subcontracted. If the employee had no reason to foresee that a conflict
might arise, his interest in the subcontractor does not violate this section;
however, the employee should disclose his interest and disqualify himself
from the work of both the principal contractor and the subcontractor.

The District shall not contract with, or take any official act favorably affecting, any
person, or any business represented by a person, who has within the preceding twelve
month period been an employee of the District.
Comment:
This section is intended to prevent employees from improperly using knowledge and
influence acquired through employment with the District in subsequent post-employment
dealings with the District. It is also intended to prevent the consideration of future
employment from improperly influencing a District employee.
The following factors should be considered in determining whether a proposed
action is prohibited by this section:
1.

The employee’s position and duties with the District;

2.

The identity of the new or prospective employer;

3.

The employee’s position and duties with the new or prospective employer;

4.

The nature of the relationship between the new or prospective employer and
the District; and

5.

The nature and extent of the employee’s contact with the new or
prospective employer while employed by the District.

A person or business may be considered to be “represented by” a former District
employee based on the following factors:
1.

Whether the employee meets or would meet in the new or prospective
employment the definition of an “employee” under this Code;

2.

The nature and extent of the knowledge and influence acquired by the
employee from employment with the District;

1.C.1.c

3.

Whether in the new or prospective employment the employee has or will
have the power to negotiate or influence agreements or otherwise bind the
new or prospective employer;

4.

Whether in the new or prospective employment, the employee has or will
have duties (1) that allow the use of knowledge or influence acquired from
employment with the District; or (2) that include direct or indirect dealings
with the District.

1.

An employee resigns from his position at the District, accepts employment in
a company, and participates in negotiating a contract between the company
and the District. The District should discontinue negotiations with the
company.

2.

An employee is terminated by the District as part of a reduction in force, and
seeks employment with an affiliate of the District’s general engineering
consultant at an out-of-state construction project. While employed by the
District, the employee had no direct influence upon the scope of work to be
performed or the compensation to be received by the consultant or its
affiliate. The employee’s employment with the affiliate would not prevent
the District from continuing its existing contract or entering into new
contracts with the consultant.

3.

An employee resigns from his position with the District and accepts
employment with a large automobile company. While with the District, the
employee was an administrative assistant whose duties included preparation
of a departmental budget, purchase of office supplies, and supervision of
two clerical workers. At her new company the employee is an office
manager and does not have the authority to bind the new employer or to
negotiate agreements, does not have direct or indirect dealings with the
District, and does not perform bid or proposal presentation. Since the
likelihood is remote that the knowledge or influence the employee acquired
at the District could be used by others within her new company to obtain
confidential information, the company is not “represented by” the employee,
and her new employment with the company will not prevent the District
from contracting with the company.

4.

An employee resigns from a position as an engineer at a District construction
project and takes a job at a subcontractor that has performed work on the
same construction project. The employee’s new job is as a site manager for
a number of his new employer’s construction subcontracts, none of which
currently involve District projects. The District will not be permitted to enter

Information

Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card which customers load and
reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass
and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All buses and light rail validators installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new
buses and light rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 327,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
December 2017, 1.3M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016 MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
general public. As of December 2017, approximately 18,400 cards were issued, of which 13,200
(72%) were full fare cards and 5,200 (28%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded
(initial purchases and reloads) was $40.80, with a total value loaded of almost $1,973,000. There were
547,200 trips taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $1,463,000. Of these
trips: 77% were local, 20% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at Retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $6,500 in cash value reloads. As of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $20,000 in cash value reloads.
As of January 1, 2017, Xerox Transport Solutions, Inc. separated its Business Process Services Unit into
an independent public company called Conduent. Xerox will be referred to as Conduent.

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize
(10) $5.3m for utility taxes was refunded covering the years 2015-2017
NOTE: the Q3 2017 SB154 cost recovery ratio was 49.7% which exceeds the statutory minimum of 30.0%

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Third Quarter of 2017. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance
measures tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals in the third quarter. The following is a
discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q3, but performance was
comparable to Q2. System-wide Local on-time service at 86.4% was only slightly below Q2. In
Local on-time service, both Transdev and First Transit-Longmont met/exceeded goal while the
remaining carriers did not. Regional on-time service at 86.6% did not meet goal and was slightly
below Q2. Staff will continue its targeted efforts in studying the worst performing routes and
identifying the resources needed to improve such as service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail on-time service exceeded goal in Q3 at 94.4%. Commuter Rail on-time service
at 92.8% also exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Improve Level of Customer Complaints
In responding to customer complaints, the overall average cycle time at 10.7 days in Q3 slightly
exceeded goal. The customer service position at Access-A-Ride was vacant for much of the Q2
and Q3 reporting periods which accounted for most of the variance. The position was filled in
September.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership for year-to-date Q3 was down 1.5% compared to same time prior year which mirrored
the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Although year-to-date Q3 fare revenue was up 5.6% over same time prior year, it did not meet the
budgeted goal of 5.8%.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization

Packet Pg. 56

1.C.4

Bus operator vacancies and bus mechanic vacancies exceeded goal in Q3 due to attrition, retirements,
system growth, and the strong local economy.
