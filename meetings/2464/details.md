## II. April Board Meeting Agenda Review

1st Vice Chair Hoy provided the initial review of the agenda and indicated it would be a quick meeting as we only have a few items for review.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to approve moving the April 19th Board agenda to the full Board.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              1st Vice Chair Hoy noted there were no retirees to be recognized at the Board meeting and he believe this is the first time this has happened since he has been on the Board.  2nd Vice Chair Deadwyler indicated we would be doing a special recognition for the RTD Security team who has received the Gold Standard Award from the TSA.  GM Genova said this was the third time we have received the award and the TSA does a full assessment every few years of the security plans and the award addresses the merits of the overall plan.

1st Vice Chair Hoy walked through the agenda bullet point mentioning that we would be having a General Manager Oversight and Performance Management committee meeting prior to the Board meeting on the 19th.  He continued to walk through the agenda citing the approval of Board meeting and Committee meeting minutes.

GM Genova asked if the Chair’s script and the Chair’s report were prepared by staff or by the Chair.  Acting Executive Director McManus indicated they were prepared by staff and after having a discussion with Chair Tobiassen going forward both documents would be incorporated into one for efficiency.

1st Vice Chair Hoy said he liked the approach of simplicity and moved onto the review of the 3 items on the unanimous consent agenda.  2nd Vice Chair Deadwyler reminded 1st Vice Chair Hoy of the language he would need to present allowing the Directors to sever any of these 3 actions and move them to recommended action to be voted on independently.

1st Vice Chair Hoy asked for some clarification on the Longmont service and ridership increases and the increased dollar amount.  GM Genova said the program was supported by Boulder County and the City of Longmont and he went on to explain that this model works for Longmont because it is a contained area and why this same model would not work in other areas.  He also indicated that if service needed to increase we would not be able to accommodate the impact but for RTD this is found revenue.  2nd Vice Chair Deadwyler asked in the scenario of increased ridership what would the recourse be?  GM Genova said the City of Longmont and Boulder County would have to pick up the cost.  1st Vice Chair Hoy stated they are seeing increased trips but not necessarily increased ridership.  Director Walker said this was much like the Art service in Englewood which also is a good program.

1st Vice Chair Hoy indicated the next two item were housekeeping items that will update bank signatures and authority of the TIFIA loan documents.

1st Vice Chair Hoy moved onto the single recommended action, the performance measures.  He said as he remembered the action was placed back to the past performance percentages.  GM Genova said he was correct the numbers were moved back to what they have always been in the past.  1st Vice Chair Hoy asked if the changes had been made in the Board Report moving forward to the board meeting.   Acting Executive Director McManus indicated all the corrections had been made by Finance and the document moving forward is in the Executive Committee packet.
