Subject:

Longmont Free Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that RTD approve a new contract
with Boulder County to allow the County to continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local
fixed route services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323,
324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of an additional 18 months.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. The current contract was for a period of two years from July 1, 2014 – June 30,
2016. The County would like to continue the program.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined in
Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build ridership
and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of the
program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within their thresholds; any new cost will
be borne by Boulder County. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, have
performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of RTD
Marketing. RTD will continue to promote this program. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will
hold meetings to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 18 month period, Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD $391,806 for fares on the
300 series routes and approximately $21,150 for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service
area boundaries of the 300 series routes (the Access-a-Ride dollars are approximate and the County will
reimburse based on actual usage). Calculations for this reimbursement are based on the original dollar
amount established in the 2014 contract which was based on the 300 series fare revenue from 2012.
This new dollar amount reflects the new fare structure and an additional 8% to reflect the new riders.
There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the County or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.
Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the

Packet Pg. 4

2.11.A

Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). In 2015 boardings increased
to 313,692.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.

Adoption of 2017 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Date: April 6, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2017 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. There are 23
specific performance measures in total, and it is proposed that an additional goal be added (goal 3.2)
for a total of 24.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and integrate with the Board’s 2017 priorities of Fiscal
Sustainability, Workforce/Human Capital and State of Good Repair. A report detailing year-to-date
performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the end of
each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2017 are brought to the Board of Directors for
approval at this time because the measures are used in development of the 2017-2022 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and 2017 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2016 to 2017 are listed below:


Goal 3.2 Maintain system-wide service availability
o While service availability is currently measured for Light Rail, an additional goal is
proposed for service availability for Bus as well beginning in 2017. The measure is
calculated as total operating hours less service delay hours, divided by total scheduled
hours. In other words, it is the percentage of scheduled service that is available as
operating service. The goal has been 99.0% for Light Rail and will be 97.0% for Bus.
The latter is considered a realistic measure considering lost service experienced in recent
months from lack of operator availability. This measure also includes time lost as a
result of accidents, vehicle breakdowns, etc. Bus system-wide availability was 98% for
2013, 97% for 2014, and 96% for 2015.



Goal 3.4 Improve mileage between road calls
o The goal for Mileage between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls is increased from
28,000 to 30,000 miles. The improvement is expected due to the new bus vehicles
that dominate the bus fleet and require fewer maintenance road calls. A lost service
maintenance road call is a maintenance-related problem that results in a revenue vehicle
being traded, towed, or repaired on the street causing a service delay of 1 minute or

Packet Pg. 14

2.12.D

more. Mileage between lost service road calls is calculated by dividing actual miles
operated by the number of lost service maintenance road calls.


Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall ridership increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model, and it is carried as a placeholder at this time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

It is noted that we are developing a performance protocol for commuter rail linked to the
concessionaire agreement with Denver Transit Partners and such measurement report will be brought
to the Board for review at a later date. While we have numerous contractual reporting requirements
at various intervals, DTP’s operational reporting system is a work in progress and we plan to create a
baseline report in 2016 to incorporate relevant criteria. Major categories around which measurement
criteria will be developed include rolling stock availability, station availability, asset service availability,
and incident detail, among other criteria.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2017 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2017 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2017 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2017 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2017 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2017 Performance Report.
