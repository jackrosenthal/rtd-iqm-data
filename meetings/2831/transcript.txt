Oct 9 2018 0300 PM General Manager Oversight
& Performance Management Committee
[SIDE CONVERSATION]
JEFF WALKER: All right, let's go ahead. So let's bring it out. Let's reconvene as soon as we
start recording.
BOB BROOM: I thought that was a thermostat.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, so in room, you have Director Walker, Tisdale, Broom, Hoy, and
Menten just joined us, and Directors Folska and Catlin and Ms. McManus.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: Mr. Mihalik is, I believe he's en route, but he's not here yet. So we are-- are we
back in session now? We're recording?
OK, so we are being recorded now. So I'll go ahead with a motion. It is recommended by the
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GMOC) that the Board
of Directors approve proposed amendments to the existing Executive Employment Agreement
consistent with the draft amendments labeled option one considered by the committee at its
October 9, 2018 meeting. Do I have a motion?
BOB BROOM: I so move.
LARRY HOY: Second.
JEFF WALKER: Director Broom and Director Hoy are the first and-- the mover and the second
in order. Do we have discussion?
DOUG TISDALE: If I may, Mr. Chairman.
JEFF WALKER: Mr. Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Very briefly, the committee has been presented with detailed information
relative to the specific impact of the amendments, which amendments I submit work
significantly to the financial benefit of the agency by virtue of some significantly reduced cost
and securing some stability in the position and yet allowing the agency full flexibility going
forward. So I'll be voting for the motion.
JEFF WALKER: Anybody else?

LARRY HOY: If we're not taking a vote right now, I mean, I do the same thing. I can, like we've
done on the phone in the past where we asked people, I will be in favor of this motion.
JEFF WALKER: OK.
LARRY HOY: And I will be leaving here right now if-JEFF WALKER: OK, we have a first and a second. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: One purposefully-- I was here earlier, although I did arrive late, refused to
come into an executive session because I would not be willing. I felt there were really no
negotiations based upon some prior history, blah, blah, blah. But I will be a no.
[INAUDIBLE]
NATALIE MENTEN: I will be a no vote even though this is freezing the salary at $295,000 is
what I'm guessing what came out of the Executive Committee. And maybe that should be read
for the record with option one if that is what the closed meeting came to instead of just saying
option one. And I will be opposed to this. I've mentioned more than once that in a comparison to
the-PEGGY CATLIN: Oh.
JEFF WALKER: Wow.
NATALIE MENTEN: Well, now it's going to read the right time. Anyway, as-BOB BROOM: Well, we always wanted to see time fly.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yeah.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Well, luckily not on me or Jeff.
JEFF WALKER: Right.
NATALIE MENTEN: That based upon the comparison of the head of the Colorado Department
of Transportation covering the entire state of Colorado.
PEGGY CATLIN: Sorry about that drop.
NATALIE MENTEN: --and the fact that the other thing is Regional Transportation District with
a limited amount of users, a limited amount of geographical coverage, not the entire state of
Colorado, the CDOT executive director makes $174,000 roughly, puts into his own pension,
while the RTD general manager now would be at-- remaining-- staying at $295,000. Taxpayers
fully fund the pension instead of an employer contribution. I think this is very unfair to the
taxpayers, and I'll be opposing this.

JEFF WALKER: OK, thank you. Director Deadwyler?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Thank you, Jeff. In listening to to Director Menten, I had sent her
some questions to ask in the Executive Session. However, it doesn't sound like those questions
got asked or answered.
So therefore, I'm going to oppose option one. I will be voting no. Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: OK, thank you.
BOB BROOM: And Mr. Chairman, if I can. it may be, and I don't want to be presumptuous on
this, but it may be that some of the questions could legitimately be asked in open session and
wouldn't create any kind of problem in at least getting them on the record and see if the chair or
if anyone else feels they're in a position to answer them. So I shouldn't think it would be
inappropriate to ask questions and see if they can be answered.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right, so for me, if you don't mind, Chair.
JEFF WALKER: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Sorry, This is Natalie Menten. I don't have any questions. Barbara did
ask-JEFF WALKER: Deadwyler
NATALIE MENTEN: Board Director Deadwyler asked me, knowing that I was coming down
here, to have me asked three questions which she can ask herself here. And I don't have any
questions.
I don't have any-- even just in a matter of time, I think I understand all that. But I think those
would be better directed at Director Deadwyler if she would like to ask those. But otherwise, I
don't.
JEFF WALKER: OK. Director Deadwyler, please go ahead with your questions.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Thank you. My first question was we selected [INAUDIBLE] Jeff
Walker to negotiate this contract with David Genova. And my question is regarding your
process.
What amount of money did you offer to begin the negotiation process? What did you put on the
table? Because we did have parameters of 243 to 295.
We ended up at 295. How did we arrive at 295 but what was the process to get there? And I'll
wait for that answer before I ask my second one.

JEFF WALKER: OK. We presented three options at first-- well, I guess four options, being the-the current contract being the fourth option or the first option, but one of the options. All of
those-- well, we had discussions before we presented any money. And that's how we found what
was acceptable to Mr. Genova within a realm and also what we found what was acceptable to the
GMOC. During the course of those discussions, before we presented any options, we had a good
sense that number below 295, below current contract, wouldn't be accepted. So that was-BARBARA DEADWYLER: I'm lookin-- Who decides that? You and Doug?
JEFF WALKER: Well, Mr. Genova. This negotiation is a two way street. Mr. Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, and let me respond on that further, Director Deadwyler, because, yes,
we did run by the general manager all of the options that we discussed in the September 11
meeting. And I won't use the specific numbers because I'm not sure how much of this really
should be on the public record. But I will share with you that all of the instructions-- and you'll
recall you had some specific relative to the notice period for the termination without cause. And
you had one number.
And then there was a higher number. And we ended up in places in between depending upon the
various options. But we did-- and who just joined?
LARRY HOY: This is Larry.
DOUG TISDALE: OK, just checking. We're just answering-- Larry, it's Doug, and I'm sorry.
Because I'm speaking, I'll just explain. We're answering a couple of questions for Barbara, and
then we'll be ready to take a vote. We did present to David each of the various points on the
parameters that the committee instructed us to do.
LARRY HOY: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: That was to-- that was addressed to Barbara, by the way, Larry.
LARRY HOY: OK.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: And with negotiations, you know, I mean, the normal process is
that you make an offer and he counters it, makes a counteroffer. And I wanted to know what
process did you all use to arrive at the 295 or you just skipped the process and just started at 295.
DOUG TISDALE: No, ma'am.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: No ma'am?
DOUG TISDALE: No ma'am, we did not just skip the process. We followed the process you just
described.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: But did Mr. Genova make a counteroffer?

DOUG TISDALE: Yes, ma'am.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Can I ask what that was?
JEFF WALKER: You can ask, but you won't get an answer in open session.
DOUG TISDALE: Yeah, and this is Doug Tisdale here, and I just want to say that we're more
than happy to give you that answer privately or in Executive Session. But if your question is-and this is totally appropriate for open session, I believe. If your question is, was there a back
and forth, a give and take, the answer is yes.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: OK, thank you.
DOUG TISDALE: Mm-hm.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Thank you very much.
JEFF WALKER: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: So I'll just ask. Was-- I was very clear that my top line, top line, being
generous, was $243,000.
JEFF WALKER: Right.
NATALIE MENTEN: Was that presented to Mr. Genova outright and what was his response?
DOUG TISDALE: That was part of the discussion, yes. And it was not agreed to. What was
ultimately agreed to was he would do either option one or option two.
And we, in the course of this, are now taking a vote on option one. But no, it was most definitely
presented along with-- because you had already given some explanation of the rationale, which I
appreciated because it made the conversation easier because we said, look, here's a position you
have to take into account. What do you think about that? So yes, we have that dialogue.
NATALIE MENTEN: Thank you.
KEN MIHALIK: Here in the break, this is Director Mihalik.
JEFF WALKER: Oh, welcome. So thanks for joining us. We have had some discussion about the
process. We just wrapped up those questions. Do you have any questions that you want to-DOUG TISDALE: Tell him what the motion is, maybe.

JEFF WALKER: Oh, I'm sorry, yes. So let me back up. We have a motion and second to-basically to accept option one.
KEN MIHALIK: OK. I don't need addition questions. I caught Director Deadwyler's
[INAUDIBLE] maybe just [INAUDIBLE].
JEFF WALKER: OK. So you and I had an opportunity to speak earlier today. So we had a
discussion about this. If you don't have any questions, if Director Deadwyler and Director
Menten have further questions, we have a motion on the floor. Let's take a vote. All those in
favor.
BOB BROOM: Aye.
DOUG TISDALE: Aye.
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy?
LARRY HOY: Aye.
JEFF WALKER: Director Mihalik?
KEN MIHALIK: I'm also an aye. I'm an aye.
JEFF WALKER: Director Deadwyler?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I'm a nay.
JEFF WALKER: And Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: No
JEFF WALKER: OK. All right, so we have a-NATALIE MENTEN: I didn't quite catch Ken's
JEFF WALKER: Aye.
PEGGY CATLIN: Aye
KEN MIHALIK: It was a yes, an aye.
JEFF WALKER: So we have five ayes, two no's with Director Menten and Director Deadwyler
voting in the minority. Motion passes. All right, thank you very much for that dialogue. All right,
our next item on the agenda is-- let me make sure I get it right.
PEGGY CATLIN: Survey.

JEFF WALKER: Yeah, the sur-- OK, yeah, there it is. I mean, a survey review and approval.
During our discussions for the-- over the survey, last summer, there were some suggestions
made. Director Deadwyler mentioned that it would be good to have some questions up front in
the survey instead of kind of a general catch-all question-- what are your feelings about the
process or about where we are in the year. Have those questions up front instead of at the bat.
So we met with Mr. Tranguch. I got it right. And so he added-- I think it's two questions at the
beginning to give the respondents some time to frame their or think about their responses that'll
be coming after those two questions. That's the only change that's made to the survey. Has
anybody had a chance to read that and are there any questions, comments on that?
BARBARA DEADWYLER: I didn't get it. I didn't get the survey. So yeah, I don't-- I didn't see
it, so I don't know a response.
DOUG TISDALE: she did it.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Now was my question included?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah. So I'll read it to you right quick. This is-DOUG TISDALE: Two, two questions.
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, yeah, there were two questions. The first one is thinking about the GM's
performance year to date, what are the most significant accomplishments? The second question
is, what are the most significant shortcomings? What would you recommend for improvement?
And those are the two changes, and those are the first two items that a respondent will see on the
survey.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: Thank you.
JEFF WALKER: You're very welcome. Thank you for the suggestion. So one thing to
remember-- that when you're filling out the survey, if you change devices, it will end, and you'll
have to start over on a new device.
If you stop-- if you have to stop the survey and restart on the same device, it will pick up where
you left off. So remember that as you fill out the survey. Try to keep it on the same device.
NATALIE MENTEN: So-JEFF WALKER: We have a question from Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: So there will be save as draft or something along that line?
JEFF WALKER: Yeah, yeah, there's some-- yeah, it'll save it as a draft.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK.

JEFF WALKER: It should take about 20 minutes to complete. These are the only two changes.
So whenever other information you want to add, that will influence the time that it takes.
But it should take about 20 minutes. Do you have any questions for anybody on the phone? Let's
start with Director Deadwyler.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: No questions.
JEFF WALKER: Director Hoy? Any questions on the survey?
LARRY HOY: No, I don't have any questions. I had to get you off mute.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. And Director Mihalik, any questions on the survey?
KEN MIHALIK: No questions on that.
JEFF WALKER: I'm sorry, did-DOUG TISDALE: He said no.
JEFF WALKER: He said no? OK. So this isn't a motion. I see the head nod. Can we release this
to the T wall in the next couple days?
NATALIE MENTEN: Or maybe the 18th.
JEFF WALKER: The 18th? That's right. The 18th, and then we'll have it 10 days to complete.
So we should have all the responses by the 28th. We need to have all the responses by the 28th.
Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: No.
JEFF WALKER: OK, question withdrawn. All right. Where's my-- all right, so that concludes
that.
Any other questions? old business, new business? No? OK, next meeting of the GMOC will be
November 13, 3:00 to 5:00 PM. If no further business before the committee, let's call it
adjourned.
NATALIE MENTEN: May I ask what would be the agenda on that day?
JEFF WALKER: I don't know because the survey won't go up. Could be canceled. But right
now, we have one scheduled. That's was on the schedule from the original.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Well, we--

JEFF WALKER: Right.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We did have a discussion about what if there were an amendment to
the contract with the full board. That is the subject that would be brought to the GMOC at that
point in time if that did happen.
JEFF WALKER: OK, yes. So we'll keep that as a placeholder in case that something does come
up. Anything else?
NATALIE MENTEN: And a review of the survey, one with-JEFF WALKER: Survey won't be-NATALIE MENTEN: Yes.
JEFF WALKER: --done until the 28th of November.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK
JEFF WALKER: It'll be released on the 18th and due on the-NATALIE MENTEN: Ah, OK.
JEFF WALKER: --28th.
NATALIE MENTEN: I was thinking October.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yeah, if we don't need this next meeting on the 13th, then the next
meeting would come after the survey, at which time we have that discussion.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right.
JEFF WALKER: And that'll just be a discussion of the survey.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK.
JEFF WALKER: [INAUDIBLE]
NATALIE MENTEN: The path on this salary contract, whatever you would like to call it, will
be that it will go into a separate meeting of the Board of Full. And that-- of the Board -- I can't
think of the word. My-JEFF WALKER: The Board.
NATALIE MENTEN: Too many jobs going on right now in my head.

JEFF WALKER: OK.
NATALIE MENTEN: It's like a [INAUDIBLE] mouthful.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So it will move forward to executive committee on Thursday. And
then it will go to the full board at the board meeting at the end of the month.
NATALIE MENTEN: And is that planned to be an executive session or an open meeting?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Open.
DOUG TISDALE: I think we can talk about that, but my thought is that to allow for a full
discussion, I would suggest that we have an Executive Session scheduled, see, A, whether it is
necessary, B, how long it goes, but then C, just as we have done here just now, have discussion
in open session relative to these things too before taking any final vote.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right, I think that's my only questions.
DOUG TISDALE: OK.
JEFF WALKER: All right, no further questions, then this meeting-- do I need a motion to
adjourn?
BOB BROOM: Move to adjourn.
JEFF WALKER: Moved.
DOUG TISDALE: Seconded.
JEFF WALKER: Seconded. So moved. Adjourned. Thank you.
BARBARA DEADWYLER: [INAUDIBLE]
BARBARA MCMANUS: We're adjourned, Director
