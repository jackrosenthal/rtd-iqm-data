RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve proposed amendments to the existing Executive Employment Agreement,
consistent with the draft amendments considered by the Committee at its October 9, 2018 Meeting
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee appointed on September 11,
2018, Chair of the Board and member of the committee Doug Tisdale and GMOC Chair Jeff Walker to
enter into discussions with the General Manager to review and discuss the consideration of various
potential amendments to be made to the current Executive Employment Agreement. These meetings
resulted in the preparation of two separate proposed versions of contract amendments, each of which
adheres to the guidelines and parameters imposed upon Board Chair Tisdale and GMOC Chair Walker in
the September 11, 2018 discussion. These proposed amendments will enhance RTD’s position as to its
leadership.
DISCUSSION
All General Manager’s Oversight and Performance Management Committee agenda’s, supporting
documentation have been sent to the full Board and the minutes, transcripts and video with closed
captioning are available on the Board of Director’s meeting portal.

Agreement.

Agreement. This will delay the approval and leave RTD with the contract as it stands.

parties that arise out of or relates to Mr. Genova’s employment with the District or this Agreement
(or the breach thereof) (a “Dispute”), the parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the

Arbitration. In the event any Dispute cannot be resolved through mediation
the parties agree to submit such dispute(s) to binding non-appealable arbitration within ten (10)
business days from the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set out in Paragraph 12(a), or the
dispute will be considered waived and time barred. Any such arbitration arising hereunder shall

Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect and the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. Each party hereby submits to personal jurisdiction in Denver, Colorado, for the
purpose of such arbitration proceeding. One arbitrator will be chosen from a panel of five (5)
arbitrators submitted by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall be selected
through a strike procedure, and the Party with the first strike shall be determined by the flip of a
coin. The arbitration hearing shall be held within ninety (90) days from the selection of the
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall reach a final decision within sixty (60) days of the conc lusion of
the arbitration hearing and the filing of post arbitration briefs, if any. The parties shall equally

administrative or scheduling costs charged by the American Arbitration Association or the
arbitrator, but each party shall be responsible for such party’s own attorneys’ fees and costs. The
non-prevailing party in arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party, which prevailing party
status shall be determined by the arbitrator, for the prevailing party’s share of the fees and costs
charged by the American Arbitration Association and/or the arbitrator as described above.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.
(c)
Temporary Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the alternative dispute
resolution steps and arbitration obligations of the parties provided for in Paragraphs 12(a) and (b)
above, either party may seek enforcement of this Agreement through injunctive relief in a court of
law located in Denver, Colorado to secure temporary injunctive relief until an arbitration can be
conducted with the understanding that all issues of final relief shall be decided by arbitration. To
facilitate temporary injunctive relief, a court of law shall have the authority under this Agreement
to make interim rulings of law as needed to issue temporary injunctive relief (inclusive of partial

Mr. Genova is the prevailing party in any action brought by Mr. Genova against the District or the

for the amount requested, up to the allowable ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).

body with authority to do so. If so compelled, Mr. Genova will make reasonable good faith efforts

Choice of Law. The Agreement has been made in and shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.

actions and claims under 42 U.S.C. section 1983, in accordance with the current bylaws, as may

District shall select counsel to defend Mr. Genova, but Mr. Genova may provide suggestions on
his preference for defense counsel.
11.

by the other Party shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach by the
other Party. The breach by either Party of any of the terms, conditions, or agree ments hereunder

(or the breach thereof) (a “Dispute”), the parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve the
Dispute(s). If the parties cannot resolve the Dispute(s) between themselves within ten (10)

Arbitration. In the event any Dispute cannot be resolved through mediation
the parties agree to submit such dispute(s) to binding non-appealable arbitration within ten (10)
business days from the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set out in Paragraph 12(a), or the
dispute will be considered waived and time barred. Any such arbitration arising hereunder shall

Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect and the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. Each party hereby submits to personal jurisdiction in Denver, Colorado, for the

arbitrators submitted by the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall be selected
through a strike procedure, and the Party with the first strike shall be determined by the flip of a
coin. The arbitration hearing shall be held within ninety (90) days from the selection of the
arbitrator. The arbitrator shall reach a final decision within sixty (60) days of the conc lusion of
the arbitration hearing and the filing of post arbitration briefs, if any. The parties shall equally
share the American Arbitration Association’s administrative fees, arbitrator’s fees, and any other
administrative or scheduling costs charged by the American Arbitration Association or the
arbitrator, but each party shall be responsible for such party’s own attorneys’ fees and costs. The
non-prevailing party in arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party, which prevailing party
status shall be determined by the arbitrator, for the prevailing party’s share of the fees and costs
charged by the American Arbitration Association and/or the arbitrator as described above.
Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof.
(c)
Temporary Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the alternative dispute
resolution steps and arbitration obligations of the parties provided for in Paragraphs 12(a) and (b)
above, either party may seek enforcement of this Agreement through injunctive relief in a court of
law located in Denver, Colorado to secure temporary injunctive relief until an arbitration can be
conducted with the understanding that all issues of final relief shall be decided by arbitration. To
facilitate temporary injunctive relief, a court of law shall have the authority under this Agreement
to make interim rulings of law as needed to issue temporary injunctive relief (inclusive of partial

temporary in nature and subject to review in arbitration with all final issues of law and relief
decided by arbitration. Injunctive relief may be granted immediately upon the commencement of
any such action, and neither Party is required to post a bond to obtain temporary or permanent
injunctive relief.
13.

Mr. Genova is the prevailing party in any action brought by Mr. Genova against the District or the

the execution of, this Agreement. The Parties agree that Mr. Genova will use the District’s
standard processes for requesting expense reimbursement, and should include his expense receipts
for the amount requested, up to the allowable ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00).
15.
Non-Disparagement. Mr. Genova shall not at any time during or after this
Agreement make any public statements (whether orally or in writing) that are derogatory or
damaging to the District or any of its respective affiliates, businesses, activities, operations or
affairs, officers, employees, directors, partners, agents or owners, except to the extent such
statements by Mr. Genova are consistent with his good faith performance of his duties hereunder.
This Paragraph shall not apply to testimony compelled under oath by a court or other adjudicative
body with authority to do so. If so compelled, Mr. Genova will make reasonable good faith efforts

other legal process compelling his testimony.
16.
Choice of Law. The Agreement has been made in and shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles.
