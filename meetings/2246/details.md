#### 1. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 64 - 40' Transit Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig LLC. in an amount not to exceed $27,500,000 for the purchase of 64 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare components.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that this is really a housekeeping item.  He explained that this is the third year in which RTD has been working to replace our 40’ transit buses through a phased approach.  The fleet being replaced is from 2000, so they have reached the end of their useful life.

Director Bagley noted that since this is the third year of the phased program, he wondered what staff’s experience has been during the first two years.  Bruce Abel said that it had been a very positive experience, thus staff was recommending that RTD exercise the option to purchase additional vehicles rather than go out for a new procurement.  Steve Gieske, General Superintendent of Maintenance, shared that RTD has received about 125 buses with 110 being in service.  He stated that it has been a better than expected experience.

Chair Sisk inquired what happens to the buses that are taken out of service.  Bruce Abel explained that when the vehicles are taken out of service, per RTD’s procurement policy, they are taken to auction.  RTD has a contract with Roller Auctions.  Chair Sisk wondered what RTD received for the buses that might have been auctioned in 2014.  Steve Gieske stated the average was around $5K per vehicle.

Director Walker pointed out that RTD was currently considering new fare options as part of the Fare Study, such as being able to purchase a day pass on the buses.  He asked if this type of equipment could be installed on these buses to accept a payment form different from today or print tickets.  Bruce Abel stated that staff did not anticipate any problems in terms of being able to install new equipment depending on the outcome of the Fare Study.  He noted that there have been issues related to space for mobility devices such as walkers.  He said that staff is working with the manufacturer to address this issue.

Director Archuleta wondered what percentage of the total sale price Roller Auctions charged for auctioning the vehicles.  General Manager Washington stated that there is a standard fee that Roller Auctions charges but he does not know the exact amount offhand.  Staff said they would send him the amount.

Director Solano inquired as to the rate of inflation since RTD purchased our last buses over 12 years ago.  Lou Ha, Manager of Technical Services, stated that it has been very low at an average of about 1-2% per year.

Director James commented that while it was a little off topic, he was wondering if staff could provide him with an update on the procurement for the new 16th street Mall buses offline.

Director Francone asked for the approximate cost per bus.  Steve Gieske stated it was around $423K per vehicle.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Approve Contract Amendment to Supply 18 - 60’ Articulated Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to exceed $12,300,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 18 additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel noted that, as with the 40’ transit buses, this is the third year of a phased replacement of the 60’ articulated buses.

Director Solano asked where in the system the new buses would be utilized.  Bruce Abel explained that the size of bus assigned to each route is based on passenger load.  Articulated buses are typically used on routes that have heavier passenger loads such at the 15L.  He said that virtually every garage will receive some of the new buses as they are purchased.

Director Folska wondered how different these articulated buses are as compared to the Free Metro Ride buses.  She also asked how much the Free Metro Ride buses cost per vehicle.  Bruce Abel explained that the Free Metro Ride buses come at a slight premium due to modifications such as a third door and different seating configuration.  Steve Gieske said the buses for the Free Metro Ride cost right around $700K.

Director Folska inquired how many Free Metro Ride buses were purchased and if they were used for other services throughout the system.  Steve Gieske said that 12 buses were purchased.  Bruce Abel stated that the Free Metro Ride buses were only used for the 18th/19th Circulator service.

Director Francone asked staff for the breakdown of the cost per bus for purchasing the articulated buses.  Steve Gieske stated that the 40’ transit buses are $423K, the 60’ articulated buses are $670K and the Free Metro Ride buses are $700K.  Director Francone noted that if she does the math the cost per vehicle does not equal the $12.3 million requested.  Steve Gieske explained that there are other spare components that RTD will be purchasing as well.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. Board Report May 2015 Service Change

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the May 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes

Motion:              Director James made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 17, 2015 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel reminded the Board that staff presented them with a draft recommendation last month.  He said that staff has since taken the recommendations out for public comment.  During the process of public comment and through continued analysis there were adjustments made that were highlighted in yellow.  He asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, to review the process and changes in further detail.

Jessie Carter noted that there were five public hearings with about 60 participants, which is a very good turnout for RTD public hearings.  He said the largest meeting was in the Westwood neighborhood where there were over 30 participants all praising the return of the Route 4.  The second largest was in Louisville where the Route DD is proposed for cancellation.  He stated that there were 15 people in attendance, all opposed to the cancellation.  He said the modifications to the proposed service changes were mostly minor adjustments to improve on-time performance or connectivity.  Staff is recommending the addition of two early morning AT trips due to overcrowding.

Director Deadwyler said that in reading the comments it seems there are a lot of people opposed to the cancellation of Route DD.  She expressed concern that this will cause quite a bit more travel time with several connections if this route is cancelled.  Bruce Abel explained that staff hoped the Route DD could be maintained until the VA completed its relocation; however, since the relocation of the University of Colorado Medical School and a variety of other medical services, ridership has decreased drastically.   Bruce Abel stated that based on current ridership, staff feels that this is a very non-productive use of RTD’s resources.  He believes that the small number of riders would be better served by working with DRCOG and 36 Commuting Solutions to create some vanpool, which can be more tailored to the riders’ needs.  Jessie Carter pointed out that the level of subsidy for Route DD is over $18 per boarding.  He said that compared to an average regional subsidy per boarding of $4 Route DD is almost 5 times as high.  He stated that this is one of the major reasons this route is being discontinued.  He reiterated that it is very difficult to justify providing this service when RTD is challenged to provide adequate capacity for exceptionally well performing routes.

Director Deadwyler noted that the recommendation indicates that the General Manager or his designee may execute contract amendments as necessary with RTD’s private operators.  She wonders if this would affect any of our Access-a-Ride private contractors.  Bruce Abel stated that RTD has contracts with First Transit and Veolia to provide certain fixed route services.  He said that the contract amendments would only relate to those contracts.

Director Francone pointed out that there are minor trip adjustments being proposed for the Route 77, 401, 402, and 403.  She asked if staff could elaborate on the adjustments.  Jessie Carter stated that there is a proposed change to the C-Line schedule.  He explained that due to this change, staff is recommending adjustments to certain bus routes that connect with the C-Line so they continue to make their connections.

Director Lubow shared that she will be voting no as she is continuing conversations with staff regarding Route DD.

Director Hoy inquired if Route DD had 12 riders per hour, meaning that there were actually 18 passengers on the bus.  He commented that every rider of that service must have submitted feedback opposing the cancellation based on the number of people we have heard from.   Jessie Carter stated that the information provided were trip specific, meaning there would be significantly less than 12 riders per hour.  He said it was not unusual to hear multiple times from riders when their route is up for discontinuance.

Director Archuleta asked for confirmation that Route 4 would be returning.  Bruce Abel stated that the reinstatement of Route 4 was included in the recommendation.

Chair Sisk pointed out that one of the suggestions for Route DD was having one morning and one afternoon trip.  He inquired if staff had evaluated this suggestion to determine if it was feasible.  Jessie Carter stated that while it is feasible, it is not a practical solution.  Bruce Abel noted that this really goes back to vanpools.  He explained that by only having one departure and return time would provide no flexibility; however, forming vanpools would provide the opportunity for more personalized service for the riders.

Chair Sisk stated that he supports cancelling Route DD even though it affects Boulder because it makes sense from an RTD perspective.  He hopes that staff will assist 36 Commuting Solutions and DRCOG in establishing vanpools for the riders.

Director Menten wondered why service on Route 16 needed to be terminated at 10th and Broadway to allow for use of a suitable operator restroom.  She asked why the schedule did not just allow for a break at that location instead.  Director Menten also inquired how RTD addresses the needs for restrooms along routes where RTD does not have facilities.  Jessie Carter explained that allowing for a break at 10th and Broadway and then continuing the route to the old terminus would really inconvenience the riders left waiting on the bus, so this is the better options.  He said that RTD has agreements with various businesses along routes as needed to meet the Collective Bargaining Agreement requirements.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Proposed US 36 Service Plan

Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, reviewed a Power Point with the Board that is available in the February 10, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.  He explained that currently there are 12 existing regional routes along the US 36 Corridor which is very complex and difficult for passengers to understand.  Jeff Becker stated that the proposed service plan consolidated routes, which was easier for riders to understand while allowing RTD to take advantage of roadway improvement.  He said of particular important in the US 36 service plan recommendation is that all of the service frequencies meet or exceed those outlined by the US 36 Mayors/Commissioners Coalition (MCC).  The proposed plan represents a 10.7% increase in service hours in the Corridor.

Director Hoy noted that with the exception of the proposed limited route, all the buses would stop at the Westminster and Broomfield stations.  He said if his calculations were correct the frequency of buses stopping at those stations would be 14 per hour or one bus every 4.5 to 5 minutes.  Jeff Becker stated that was correct but the buses stopping throughout the hour would have different destinations.

Director Hoy asked if this was the same presentation he reviewed with Jeff Becker several months ago.  Bruce Abel said that the initial report was provided by Transportation Management & Design, Inc., which was one of the inputs used in development the recommended service plan.  He explained that there have been adjustments from the consultants recommendations based on internal deliberations and feedback from stakeholders, public, etc.

General Manager Washington noted the other important consideration was developing a true Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) service.  He stated that true BRT is very frequent service, often so frequent that riders do not need a schedule.  Staff is attempting to get as close to that true BRT definition as initially possible with this service plan.  General Manager Washington pointed out that RTD is also over-subscribing with service in this plan.  There is a fine line between putting out service and the riders not responding as opposed to having people hang out the windows.  He stated that staff is trying to balance the idea that if RTD puts out ample service the ridership will come with sustainable service levels.

Director Hoy made the observation that Flatirons and Church Ranch have no express stops.  He wondered why as in his experience these stops have a pretty robust group of riders.  Nate Diaz, Service Planning/Scheduler, pointed out that compared to other stops that have 1,500 boardings per day, the ridership at Flatirons and Church Ranch seem relatively low at 200 boardings per day.  Jeff Becker commented that there are always tradeoffs but the plan will be taken out to the public for input.

Chair Sisk thanked the staff and stakeholders for their continued dialog and discussion.  He feels the process has been very positive; however, Chair Sisk expressed concern that we are still not where we need to be.  He recognized that BRT was promised to the Northwest area as part of FasTracks.  It was the only BRT that was part of the original plan.  He is concerned that only having a 10% increase in service hours in the recommended plan is not keeping with RTD’s promise to the voters.  He said he looks forward to rolling up his sleeves and continuing to work with the stakeholders.

Director Francone acknowledged that she comes from a District that is all about the bus.  She shared that she will be watching this very carefully.  She asked staff to keep her updated because a plan similar to this might be a solution for District N as well.  Director Francone requested that staff keep State Representative Tracey Kraft-Tharp included in the public input process. Director Francone noted that Representative Kraft-Tharp felt she had not been included during the initial plan development.

Committee Chair Anderson stated that this is just the first of many service plans for the openings in 2015-2016.  She said that staff and the Committee have a lot of work to do in the next year.  She asked that Directors continue to bring their questions and comments to the staff.

Director Lubow reminded everyone that in addition to promising BRT, RTD also promised rail to the Northwest area.

#### 2. Fare Task Force Update

Bruce Abel explained that the purpose of this evening’s update is not asking for the Board’s approval of the fare study recommendations, but simply giving the go ahead for staff to take the recommendations out for public comment.  He noted that there have been some minor modifications from what was originally discussed with the Directors due to feedback that staff has already received.  There was concern expressed about consolidating the express and regional service classifications so the new recommendation now includes local, express and regional bus service.  Bruce Abel stated that the initial recommendations did not meet the fare revenue assumptions in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) for 2016 so changes were made as well.

Bruce Abel recognized that the program for agencies to get passes for low income individuals needs to be simplified and improved; however, he stressed that staff needs to get closure on the foundation of the fare structure before that can be addressed.  He stated that staff feels the introduction of the Day Pass priced at the cost of a round trip ticket does begin to address the issues of affordability.

Lacy Bell reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the February 10, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

General Manager Washington acknowledged the great work done by the fare task force team.  This is something that touches every part of the District making their work extremely important.  He reminded the Board that the SBP referenced by Bruce Abel was approved by the Board in July of 2015.  The SBP has a number of assumptions over its six year period, one of which is for fare revenue to reach $131 million in 2016.  He explained that the fare task force took this figure into consideration when determining fare structure and level.  General Manager Washington pointed out that the comment of assuming a fare increase is not really a correct statement.  What actually happens is that a fare review is conducted every three years to determine if an adjustment needs to be made.

General Manager Washington noted that several Directors have received emails asking that the fare recommendation be delayed.  He reiterated that staff is simply asking to take this out for public comment so they can hear what people think.

Bruce Abel stressed that staff recognizes they need to continue to address affordability.  He shared that in talking with many other agencies, transfers have often had a major negative impact on fare revenue.  He said it is staff’s hope that eliminating the transfer might allow RTD to reduce fare or at least maintain it at the proposed level.  He stated that it is not staff’s desire to come to the Board every three years for a fare increase.  He commented that many people perceive that affordability is achieved by reducing fares.  He said that quite candidly RTD cannot do this without service reductions.  He believes this begins to recognize affordability in a manner that does not require service reductions.

Committee Chair Anderson reminded the Board that the question before them this evening is if staff should take the recommendation out for public comment.

Director Folska thanked staff for their work on this monumental task.  She thinks there are a lot of merits to the Day Pass.  She appreciates the attention that staff is giving to the transit dependent; however, one of the things that she did not hear was about the high cost of parking to the overall cost of transportation.  She had been hoping that would be part of the calculations.  Director Folska pointed out the numerous other services that RTD supports like the Art Shuttle, vanpools, etc.  She expressed concern that our economically challenged riders are the ones subsidizing parking and these other services that benefit those who are gainfully employed.  Bruce Abel stated that staff is continuing to look at the parking component.  He stated that it is also important to consider the subsidy cost of a local bus someone might take to a Park-n-Ride.

Director Folska stated that she supports staff taking the recommendations out for public comment.

Director Menten shared that she was very happen to see the changes to the plan that benefit RTD financially.  Her only comment is that her dream figures would be $5.50 for the Day Pass at $12 for an airport ticket if the person traveling was not an airport employee.  Director Menten acknowledged this might be a difficult task to separate out the DIA employees from the travelers.  She thanked staff for their work, recognizing what an intense job this has been.

Director Deadwyler believes the new price structure proposed would be devastating to many of our riders.  She sees moving the fare from $2.25 per boarding to $2.60 and not being able to transfer without buying a Day Pass as doing more harm than good.  She stated that the income level required for people to get a pass through the agencies we work with is virtually zero.  This means that even people with minimum wage jobs do not qualify for assistance.  Director Deadwyler does not believe that things are going to change for the people that cannot afford our service.  She said that she cannot support staff taking this out for public comment because the people that really need to have their input heard cannot afford to get to our public meetings.  Until there is a way for these people to participate she will not support moving forward.

Director Lubow thanked staff for all the work they have done.  She said that she has similar concerns to those of Director Deadwyler.  She wonders how this might affect a rider who really only needs one trip and a transfer.  The proposed Day Pass would now require the rider to pay for two trips, which they might not be able to afford.  She expressed that she is very concerned for the low income riders because the Board has heard from numerous people who are already having difficulty paying for transportation.  Director Lubow wonders if this structure is yet again making it so those that have more money get a better break based on the discount for monthly passes.  Bruce Abel explained that the breakeven point for the pass would be if the rider took 40 trips per month, which is up from the 36 trips needed currently.  The average commuter takes 42 trips per month.

Director Lubow wondered if the Day Pass would still be considered an option if we received many comments that it would not be helpful to our riders.  General Manager Washington explained that this process would be just like the process for service changes.  The plan is presented to the public, they offer suggestions or changes, staff evaluates and incorporates changes, and then the plan will be presented to the Board again in April.  General Manager Washington stated that he anticipates there will be changes to the final product.

Director Walker shared that he is very curious to hear what people will say.  He said that as a long time bus rider he thinks the recommendations look good.  He commented that $2.60 is a weird number as he does not often have dimes with him.  He also wonders how the Day Passes will be monitored as those have more value than our current transfers.

Director Francone echoed other Directors concerns about low income and transit dependent riders.  She said that she has been receiving many emails from transit dependent people who are really concerned about the fare structure.  She wonders how staff proposes to get feedback from those populations that cannot afford to attend the public meetings.  She noted that it is not likely that they have internet to email RTD.  Bruce Abel stated that his team is working with the Public Information department to maximize exposure but he does not have a concrete answer at this time.

Director Francone said that if her memory was correct when the SBP was presented prior to her being a Director, ridership was projected to remain flat through 2016.  She asked if this fare increased would really meet the desired revenues based on flat ridership.  Bruce Abel stated that the models indicate these fare rates will meet the SBP’s fare assumptions in 2016.

Director Francone asked if our surveys related to fare increase/service reduction are conducted in an either/or type format.  Bruce Abel explained that it was presented in those terms because those are the tradeoffs that management can control.

Director Francone stated that at this time she is not ready for the recommendation to go out for public comment.

Director Solano shared he also is not ready for this to go out to public comment.  He said that he understands the16th Street Mall Shuttle being free but he believes the Free Metro Ride should have some fare.  This is working people getting our service for free while the transit dependent has to pay.  Director Solano inquired what percentage of revenue would come from fare if the local fares were increased to $2.60 today.  Bruce Abel stated that they would need to run some models but it would probably be about a percentage higher than it is currently.

Director Bagley commented that most of the Directors today were not on the Board in 2011 when RTD had some significant revenue shortfalls.  The Board at that time approved cutting service by over $10 million.  He stated that is something that no one wants to do again.  He noted that in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting the Board will hear that fare revenue for 2014 is down compared to the budget.  Director Bagley stated this is something for the Directors to keep in mind as they review the fare recommendation; it is very important that any changes are at least revenue neutral.

Director Bagley said that staff has spent a great deal of time in looking at the fare structure and level.  He believes it is time for the public to provide their feedback.  He recognized that there is the opportunity for modification but he does not understand what staff and the Board will learn if this does not go out for public comment.

Director James concurred with Director Bagely’s comments.  He said that through his meeting with staff it was clear that they have really explored a wide array of possibilities.  He pointed out that it has been a long time since fares have been restructured.  Director James expressed his appreciation to staff and the efforts they have made to reach out to the philanthropic community;  he supports working with them as much as possible to help those that are underserved.  He believes the fare recommendations are ready to be taken out for public comment.

Director Tobiassen gave his support for staff taking the recommendations out for comment.  He shared with the Board that his brother-in-law, who uses a mobility device, would love to be able to pay a fare and catch a bus to work but his community has cut funding to the transit system to nothing.  He said he is appreciative of the taxpayers that are willing to invest heavily for an equal system.  He thinks that cutting fares would be a disaster so it is important to remain fare neutral as much as possible.

Director Hoy commented that today students, seniors and disabled riders receive half price fares but not have price Day Passes.  He asked if that would change with this plan.  Bruce Abel stated that they would receive half price Day Passes under the new fares.

Director Hoy said that this recommendation must be taken to the public.  He thinks that staff and the Board need feedback in order to make any changes.

Chair Sisk stated that he is all in favor of allowing the public to respond to the plan so that staff can make additional recommendations accordingly.  He believes that it is important to encourage people that are less fortunate to ride, which will be addressed once the foundation of the fare is in place.

Director Folska pointed out that in LA they just raised fare about 40% as compared to staff’s recommendation of about 12%.

Committee Chair Anderson said that in the interest of transparency it is incumbent upon this Board that the recommendations are taken out for public comment.  After we get feedback staff can begin to work with the agencies that help the low income and transit dependent.  She stated that she thinks the Day Pass is a great idea.  She noted that realistically if you ride the bus somewhere you need to get back home so the likelihood of this penalizing riders is non-existent.  She shared that at a recent public meeting she was speaking with a member of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) who is very active in the community.  This CAC member can hardly afford paying a fare for riding the bus to each of her activities so this will really help her.

Committee Chair Anderson informed the Board that she served on the Arvada City Council for 24 years.  She said on the council they had to make tough budget decisions.  She thought she was ready to make those decisions when she was elected to the RTD Board of Directors in 2011; however, hearing from a constituent about how cutting service will really affect their everyday life is painful.  She stated that no one wanted to cut service like that again.

Jeff Becker reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the February 10, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Menten expressed how hard it is for her to look at the Call-n-Ride subsidies.  She believes the service performs horribly on a subsidy per boarding basis.  Director Menten asked staff to work with her on an analysis of the cost comparison between an underperforming fixed route that is eliminated compared to adding a Call-n-Ride to help the riders who might be affected.  She wonders if perhaps RTD would be better keeping the fixed route when subsidy per boarding is considered.  Director Francone asked to be included in the process.

#### 4. CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues Report

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that per the terms of the settlement agreement with Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC), staff is required to provide the Board a report twice per year on challenges, issues, etc.

Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, said that in general the bus operators are becoming familiar with the wheelchair securement area policy.  She stated that the drivers are doing what they can to make sure people with mobility aids get access to our buses.  She noted that there are still issues with two passengers in wheelchairs already occupying the securement areas but in those cases the drivers are very good about calling dispatch to report the incident.

Committee Chair Anderson noticed that Route 52 seems to have that issue.  She thinks it is because that route serves Denver Health.

Director Tobiassen wondered if there was any feedback from CCDC as to their perceptions.  Carolyn Conover said that overall the feedback has been positive.  CCDC did ask if RTD was tracking any issues related to the area where we are removing seats from a certain area to create space for people with large items.  She explained that currently there is not mechanism in place for tracking this.

Director Menten shared that recently she heard from a constituent who is blind and has a service dog.  He told her about concerns he had on multiple routes where other passengers were bringing dogs onto the bus that were not service dogs despite the passengers claiming they were.  This constituent was having an issue with these dogs harassing his service dog.  Director Menten recognized that while drivers cannot question or challenge someone claiming their dog is a service dog, she wondered if there were any suggestions she can give the constituent in dealing with this issue.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, agreed that there is not anything that allows RTD to question passengers about their disability; however, she said that in terms of an animal that causes a disruption RTD might have some leeway.  She stated she would look into this and get back to Director Menten.  Mike Gil, Deputy Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that operators are trained to address a passenger with a disruptive animal that the behavior needs to stop.  If the animal continues to cause a disruption then the driver is instructed to call dispatch so a supervisor can come to the bus.
