#### 1. August 2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the August 2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $19,700 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Bus stop consolidation efforts aimed at optimizing bus stop spacing, thereby improving operational speed and reliability are proposed for Routes 40, 105 and services along the Broadway/Lincoln Corridor. Based upon current and past ridership performance a number of services will have minor service reductions.  The Route 46 - South Dahlia will see the largest reduction in early morning and late evening periods.  We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Five public hearings were conducted in Boulder, Curtis Park, Downtown Denver, Littleton and Southeast Denver, between June 7th and June 13th. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes an annualized net increase of $80,300 of which $100,000 would be offset by funding from the City of Golden; for the Golden Call-n-Ride proposal, resulting in a RTD base system cost savings of approximately $19,700 annualized.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Broom seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Bruce Abel, acting Chief Operating Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, reminded the Board that last month his team presented their draft recommendations for the August 2017 service changes.  He explained that RTD hosted several meetings around the Denver Metro Area for public comment and stated that staff made revisions based off of public feedback.  He said the proposal to alter the D Line was turned down and stated that public comment suggested that RTD needed to conduct more public outreach to explain the pros and the cons of the changes.  Mr. Abel asked Jessie Carter to go into more detail regarding the meetings and changes.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, noted that there was a good turnout at the public meetings.  He stated that as a result of the meetings, RTD will defer the L line proposal to have a more robust conversation with the community and stakeholders. He added that this will give staff an opportunity to look at the alternatives that were provided by both constituents and stakeholders.

Mr. Carter further explained that route 206 will not be eliminated, but the frequency from buses running every half an hour will be reduced to every hour.  He explained that modifications were made to the Route 0 and Route 0L to maintain a bus stop at Center Avenue and make an additional bus stop at Exposition.

Director Menten asked if the cost for the additional bus for the Golden Call-n-Ride will be covered 100%.

Mr. Abel stated that the City of Golden would fund that service.

Director Menten inquired if the constituents asked for any changes to the Golden Call-n-Ride.

Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, said that the only request was to increase the frequency of the service.

Director Lubow stated that there were some piteous letters written to the Editor regarding the 209 and Golden West.  She asked for information on how many people use that bus.

Mr. Carter stated that there are approximately 4 boardings a day southbound and 7 boardings a day northbound.  He said that if those figures are measured against the 23 trips offered southbound and the 13 trips offered northbound, it is a very small number of people per trip.  He further stressed that it would not meet RTD’s deviation standards to provide services there.

Director Lubow said in total for both directions, there were only 11 boardings per day.

Mr. Carter confirmed her numbers and said that the level of ridership had not increased even after marketing efforts were put into place.  He stated that at some point RTD needs to cut the losses from that route and direct efforts elsewhere.

Director Lubow stated there were a lot of comments regarding the Route 0 and 0L and wanted to know if they were resolved.

Mr. Carter confirmed that staff kept the Center Avenue stop on Broadway and added a stop at Exposition.

Director Tisdale congratulated staff and complimented Mr. Carter on his terrific people skills and ability to engage with constituents.

Director Folska informed Committee Vice Chair Williams that her computer was not working and therefore she would verbally state her vote.

Committee Vice Chair Williams declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Call-n-Ride Amendment for New Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the recently awarded ADA paratransit services contracts with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #16-DH-047) to include the provision of Call-n-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years for $13,110,752, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $4,587,223 and option year 2 is for $4,797,357.  Fuel is considered a pass through.  Fuel is estimated at $1,206,599 for the first three years and with option year 1 at $426,569 and option year 2 at $439,367.  The total not to exceed cost for the 5-year period for MV Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $24,567,867.  The amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years for $12,700,984, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $2,642,063 and option year 2 is for $2,753,714.  Fuel is considered a pass through.  Fuel is estimated at $671,325 for the first three years with option year 1 at $237,334 and option year 2 at $244,454.  The total not to exceed amount for the 5-year period for Via Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $13,854,096.

BACKGROUNDOn November 9, 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.  Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-a-Ride services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit service providers under the existing contracts.  Past experience has shown that the cost to provide Call-n-Ride service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.

All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into two (2) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages.  Proposers were required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service was not a “stand alone” service option).  Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational requirements of the service.

The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:

Package A                                                                                    Package B

Arapahoe                                                                                    Brighton

Belleview                                                                                    Broomfield

Dry Creek                                                                                    Federal Heights

Golden                                                                                                  Interlocken

Green Mountain                                                                      Longmont

Lone Tree                                                                                    Louisville

Meridian                                                                                    Superior

North Inverness                                                                      Thornton

Orchard

Parker

South Inverness

South Jeffco

The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.

DISCUSSION

Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated.  Only proposers that were recommended to provide Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services.  These proposers were MV Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility Services.  The Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated on the following criteria:  a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).  The proposal evaluations highlighted the following:

MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately eleven years.  MV Transportation proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure.  The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro area, which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides. MV Transportation bid on package A.

Via Mobility Services has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately seventeen years.  The management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride service.  Via Mobility currently provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a facility in the Denver area.  This allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems and cuts down on excessive deadhead mileage and fuel expenses.  Via Mobility Services bid on package B.

Transdev does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD.  Additionally, the Transdev cost proposal was higher than the other proposer.  Transdev bid on package B.

The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign Call-n-Ride Package A to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride Package B to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract.  The contracts to provide these services are scheduled to be effective October 1, 2017.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2017 budget.  There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the 2017 budget.  Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:

1)              Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services as recommended. This is recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride experience and can provide the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.

2)              Do not assign to either contractor.  Separate Call-n-Ride service from the ADA contract and put the Call-n-Ride services out to bid under a separate contractor.  This alternative is not recommended, as the cost will most likely be more expensive as Call-n-Ride would be a standalone service and the RTD would lose the economies of scale associated with the ADA contract.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Mr. Abel said that when submitting Requests for Proposals, RTD will first award ADA Paratransit services and then select Call-n-Ride service providers.  He said that this allows RTD to leverage management teams in the facilities of the ADA Paratransit Services and it results in lower costs to RTD.

He said that in April, the RTD Board awarded the ADA Paratransit services contracts to MV Transpiration, Via Mobility, and Transdev but only MV and Via Mobility were selected as the Call-n-Ride service providers as reflected in this action item.

Director Broom asked if the cost of diesel fuel increased by a dollar a gallon, how would the contract be handled and further inquired if RTD would have to complete a change order.  He then asked how much of a difference in cost would require the Board’s second review/approval.

Mr. Abel stated that the proposal is at $2.50 a gallon, and with gas fluctuating from $2.32 to 2.42 a gallon, he does not anticipate a budget amendment.  He stated that normally if there is a miscalculation, that particular division would come through the amended budget process and request additional funds.

Director Folska asked if RTD locks in fuel prices.

Mr. Abel said that RTD locks in rates for diesel but not gasoline because RTD does not use enough.

Director Folska asked how much RTD would have to spend on gasoline to lock in a price.

General Manager Genova said it was tied into whatever the contract amount would be.  He stated that he would research the item and report his findings to the Board.

Committee Vice Chair Williams declared the motion PASSED unanimously

#### 3. Authorization to enter into a contract with M.A.I.O.R. Sri, for a Fixed Route Scheduling and Run-Cutting Software Application (16DO018)

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for the new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application to M.A.I.O.R. Sri (M.A.I.O.R), in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.00. The price includes the period of performance base of four years and six one-year options (total ten years).

BACKGROUND

RTD’s Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is a core component in the development of bus and rail operation plans. The software is used to handle the complex task of organizing and manipulating time and spatial data for the development of route services, public information and operator schedules/runcutting. Runcutting is the process of developing operator assignments (runs) from a pool of vehicle “blocks” which are vehicle assignments derived from the public timetables. This is an iterative process conducted in accordance with RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Runcutting directly impacts operator resources and work assignments. Optimizing operators’ work with vehicle blocks creates a more efficient operator and vehicle utilization and reduces operational costs.

The scheduling and runcutting application is the central source of truth and a primary interface for several major systems including but not limited to; Driver pay calculations, Public Information Display System (PIDS), RTD website, Customer Care, TIES, CAD/AVL, etc… RTD requires a modern technical platform to assure ongoing quality scheduling, runcutting and data integration with all the major systems.

RTD’s current Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is over seventeen-years old and needs to be replaced with modern technology. Because of operational changes and growth, the legacy system, no longer meets RTD’s current needs, future needs and quality standards. Issues with the legacy system that impacts the District on a daily basis include but are not limited to:

- Ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) concerns requiring RTD to regularly create manual work-around processes that are labor intensive and error prone which redirects RTD staff away from other business priorities.

- RTD’s growth outpaced the current legacy system’s capabilities (i.e. Annually, from 50 days of special services to 200 days; rail operations and fleet growth)

- RTD’s bus and rail operations have changed since the original implementation requiring new technology and expanded functionality to generate the most cost effective runcutting and resource utilization strategies.

The Service Development department determined the replacement of the existing Fixed Route Scheduling & Runcutting system is absolutely necessary to assure the District’s ability to continue; “to meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.” Given the complexity of the Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application and processes, the business owner and stakeholders completed a thorough due diligence assessment and identified requirements to replace the legacy system.

DISCUSSION

To assure RTD’s ongoing ability to meet their mission and commitment to their constituents, RTD must replace the legacy Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system. The new system will be modern, configurable and fully supported that meets RTD’s requirements, quality standards and future demands.

RTD advertised an RFP publically to provide a proposal for design, testing, training, implementation and support for a Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system for the next ten years. RTD received six proposals.

The evaluation team consisted of personnel from the following departments; Service Development, Service Development Support, Service Planning and Scheduling and IT. The proposals were reviewed in accordance with the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement including: fulfilling RTD specified design and functionality requirements, cost, functional strength, experience, qualifications, project plan and schedule. After reviewing the submitted proposals, interviews with vendors and obtaining clarifications, the evaluation team unanimously selected M.A.I.O.R., as the preferred Fixed Route Scheduling & Runcutting vendor to move forward in the procurement process. The reasons for selecting M.A.I.O.R. Sri. include but are not limited to:

- M.A.I.O.R. meets RTD’s requirements and quality standards. All of RTD’s 532 compliance matrix requirements were accepted by the vendor.

- M.A.I.O.R. has international presence with some of the largest public transit agencies. References checked and verified.

- M.A.I.O.R. included in their cost proposal, all required reporting including custom development.

- M.A.I.O.R.’s product leverages automation and eliminates certain manual work-around processes leading to more efficient internal processes

- Of the six proposals received, M.A.I.O.R. offered the best architecture to meet RTD’s current and future demands, is all inclusive of RTD’s operations (Rail and Bus), was the most flexible and most responsive to RTD inquiries.

- M.A.I.O.R has a strong and proven project implementation strategy and has successfully deployed their Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system internationally.

This new system will assure RTD’s ability to schedule services, most effectively provide for cost saving runcutting and meet RTD’s commitment to the constituents with quality and accuracy. The vendor’s data center is located Woodbury, New York and a fail-over site in the central United States.

The selection committee was made aware of the pending sale of M.A.I.O.R. to the American company, Clever Devices. On June 2, 2017, RTD received confirmation the acquisition was closed on June 1, 2017. M.A.I.O.R. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Clever Devices.

Clever Devices is a nationally recognized company headquartered in Woodbury, New York, providing technology solutions to public transit agencies. They provide solutions for Fixed-route, bus rapid transit, paratransit, rail and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). RTD has used their Ridecheck Plus ridership evaluation software since September 2004.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The M.A.I.O.R.  proposal provides for System Design, Testing, Training, Integration and Implementation for $1,847,428; First four years of Operational Services (Warranty and Hosting) for $575,699.00 ($143,924.754 per year). Years five through ten Operational Service will be $200,688.00, per year and will be budgeted for annually. Total cost of the M.A.I.O.R. proposal is $3,607,814.00. The implementation of the Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is fully funded with existing approved capital and operating funds and includes the first four years of warranty and hosting. The total not to exceed contract amount is $3,607,814. Implementing a fixed route scheduling and runcutting system to ensure RTD’s ongoing ability to conduct accurate scheduling and runcutting operations may result in changes unforeseen at the time the Scope of Work was produced.  To allow for a timely implementation, it’s in RTD’s interest to have contract authority beyond the proposal amount by $392,168, to allow for such events. Authority is requested from the Board for a total amount not to exceed of $4,000,000 which includes implementation costs, annual warranty and hosting for ten years and contingency to cover any unforeseen expenses.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       RTD could choose not to implement a new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application and assume the risks and inefficiencies associated with maintaining the legacy system.

Motion:               Director Archuleta made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the June 27, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Mr. Abel mentioned that the Service, Planning, and Scheduling group had been using the Trapeze Fixed Route program for over 17 years and there have been a number of changes in technology and RTD’s services have changed as well.  Mr. Abel asked Eric Dunham, Senior Project Manager of IT and Jessie Carter to present this item to the Board.

Mr. Carter said that the Trapeze program is used to create RTD’s public schedules, however, it is out of date and cumbersome to use. He said that his team is wasting a lot of time using the program and staff needs a program with a friendlier user interface that is more time efficient.  He stressed that $4 million is a lot of money, but the return on investment will net RTD significant savings.

Mr. Abel stated that the new software assists with creating public schedules and run cutting is used to create schedules in which the Bus Operators bid on.

Mr. Dunham stated that IT’s role was to help Mr. Carter upgrade Service Planning’s system by reviewing the proposals from an IT standpoint and IT interviewed six companies.  He said that through the selection process, M.A.I.O.R. met all of the 532 requirements.  He stated that currently, M.A.I.O.R. works with large transit systems in Rome and Milan and they offered the best architecture to meet RTD’s needs. He added that the data center is located in the United States to ensure minimal risks and he advised Mr. Carter’s team to move forward with the contract with M.A.I.O.R. from an IT perspective.

Director Folska asked where M.A.I.O.R. was headquartered.

Mr. Dunham responded that M.A.I.O.R. is headquartered in Florence, Italy.  He stated that during the bid process staff was informed that on June 1, 2017, M.A.I.O.R. was bought by Clever Devices, that operates in Woodbury, New York.

Director Menten asked for clarification on Mr. Dunham’s comment regarding minimal risks to RTD’s system.

Mr. Dunham stated that there are standard practices and firewalls, and with the Data Center being in the United States, RTD has better access to the architecture and security.  He added that it was a requirement RTD put in the Statement of Work.

Chair Hoy stated that he had heard that Trapeze was a difficult system and agreed that this is a great change.  He asked how the transition is going to take place and who would train staff how to use it.

Mr. Dunham stated through the selection process, M.A.I.O.R. visited RTD to demonstrate an example.  He stated that their program appeared to be very easy to use and intuitive, and said that the transition will be easy.

Mr. Carter said that the M.A.I.O.R. program is a Windows based environment and the Trapeze system was D.O.S. based and not as user friendly.

Mr. Abel said that Bus Operations will budget money to send staff to user conferences to learn more about the program.

Director Sisk stated that his only concern is whether or not M.A.I.O.R. has done any business with transit systems in the United States, and if they have, which cities are using their services.

Mr. Carter stated that Kitsap Transit in Bremerton, Washington is currently using M.A.I.O.R.  Mr. Carter added that internationally, M.A.I.O.R. is working with more complex systems than RTD.

Director Folska asked if they are willing to make certain adaptions to fit RTD’s needs.

Mr. Carter responded that they are very responsive to do what RTD needs and they are set up to work with RTD’s rail system, which Trapeze is unable to do.

Director Folska asked if there was a plan in place in case the M.A.I.O.R. program does not work for RTD.

Mr. Dunham stated that it is IT’s practice not to transition an old program until the new program is running efficiently.  He stated that RTD will not decommission the Trapeze system until the new system is up and running.  He stated that as the project manager of this process, it will be his responsibility to meet all IT requirements.

Director Folska indicated that her concern is that the new software may not work and RTD will be stuck with the program.  She said she does not want to go down that path again with a program that cannot produce what RTD needs.

Mr. Abel noted that he does not want to down play the transition process, and indicated that his team is serious about making it work.

Committee Vice Chair Williams declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 4. Construction Award for RFP 16 DD - 002 -  Platte Bus Wash Replacement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project.

BACKGROUND

The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in December of 1976. The design capacity of the garage was based on 40-foot buses for a total of 250 buses. Currently, the facility supports 298 buses, which are made up of 28, 30, 40, 45, and 60-foot-long buses.

#### 1. Lost Service Hours Update

Mr. Abel, reported that for May 2017 there were 185 lost service hours.  He said that it is a significant improvement from last year and it is due in part to the mandate that employees must work one of their days off.  He explained that Bus Operations is 132 drivers short so his team is working diligently with Human Resources to bring more people in.  He noted that most of the employees that are leaving RTD are first year employees.

Director Folska suggested a heavy push in advertising on mainstream television, radio, and all other media outlets to assist with recruiting efforts.

Director Walker said that recruiting drivers and mechanics is a nationwide problem due to a strong economy.

Mr. Abel stated that on-time performance is still a challenge, but he was pleased to note that it has continued to improve since 2015.   He said that staff is still working on improving on-time performance and focusing on problematic routes in order to provide better service for RTD’s customers.

Director Folska asked for the Access-a-Ride on-time numbers to be included in the quarterly report.

Director Walker said that the Executive Committee for Denver’s General Obligation (GO) Bond forwarded their recommendations and there are some transit projects that will be beneficial to RTD.

Mr. Abel stated that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, and his team have been working closely with the City and County of Denver to put together the GO Bond recommendations.  He added that he was very pleased that the city had been listening to RTD and supporting transit.

#### 3. Access-a-Ride/Cab 1st Quarter Update 2017

Mr. Abel stated that the Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab reports reflect that rides have increased slightly compared to last year.  He stated that revenue hours were slightly below budgeted revenue hours and reminded the Board that in the first quarter, RTD was experiencing a shortage of Access-a-Ride drivers.  He noted that the new operator wage rates went into effect on March 1, 2017, and since then staff has seen improvements on dropped-services.  He stated that the on-time performance goal is 95% and it has improved from 94.5% in the first quarter of 2016 to 94.6% in the first quarter of 2017.

Director Menten highlighted that the Access-a-Ride numbers have decreased by 19%, which she felt was substantial.  She stated that she was under the impression that RTD was going to start veering towards Access-a-Cab and asked for clarification.

Mr. Abel commented that for this quarter RTD saw a decline in service and his team was not steering people into that direction, however, there was an attempt to incentivize people to use Access-a-Cab.

Mr. Buter added that cab drivers will only go for the big tipping destinations and they do not want to go out of their way for an Access-a-Ride trip.  He remarked that outlying trips are not being completed and there are a lot of driver no shows.

Director Menten asked for confirmation that there was an increase in Access-a-Ride service, and a decrease in Access-a-Cab service.

Mr. Buter stated that customers are shifting back to Access-a-Ride.

Director Folska stated that customers use Uber instead of using Access-a-cab, it will save RTD from spending subsidy costs.

#### 7. 1st Quarter 2017 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

Michael Meader, Chief Safety Officer/Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security and Asset Management, stated that he would answer any questions the Board may have regarding the security statistics and fare inspection summary.

Director Tisdale asked why fare evasion numbers increase when plain clothed officers issue tickets.

Mr. Meader explained that plain clothed officers do not have a visual deterrent of a uniform to cue fare evaders to exit a bus or train, and that is why plain clothed officers are able to catch more instances of fare evasion than uniformed officers.
