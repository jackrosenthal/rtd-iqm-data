100% safety reinforcement for all RTD Bus Operators which all operators are
mandated to attend
Private Contractors do safety reinforcements once a month
Increased visibility of Supervisor’s and Mangers at Operators Divisions – 24 hours a
day, 7 days a week.
Dave Genova’s group is doing an analysis of the past accidents to determine if
there are any trends that we can incorporate into safety reinforcement training such
as type, time of day, weather conditions and locations.
Additional safety messages are posted at all operating divisions.
Periodic data messages are sent to the bus reminding operators to be safe. Drivers
only check messages when they are in a safe place.
Daily operational safety meetings. Groups are meeting on a daily basis and top
managers are meeting weekly.
Increased on service monitoring – looking at what corners are bad intersections –
fifteen have been identified as hotspots. Private Contractors are doing the same.
Placing “Safety First” stickers on buses and light rail.

Bruce Abel shared that they have been in conversation about putting together a safety
summit involving local and national safety folks to share best safety practices.
Mike Gil informed the board that while out at the divisions talking to drivers, they are also
asking the drivers how they are doing and offering information on EAP. He also shared
that drivers are 100% committed to safety first.
Bruce Abel reinforced that all the activities discussed are going on system wide both at
RTD operated services as well as the privately contracted services.
Director Tobiassen was out at the East Metro garage talking to drivers and they would like
a safety campaign for the public to make them more aware of what they can do to be
safe. Director Tobiassen asked of there any statistical analysis on accidents compared to
other cities, in regard to yellow lights on traffic signals.
Tobiassen commended John Tarbert on his cert program. Tom has been working with
John Perry trying to get the Aurora Police more involved with bus safety. Aurora police is
on board with program.
Scott Reed talked about a program on public safety; they checking with other transit
agencies.
Director Malpiede suggested getting the TMA’s involved in a “keeping yourself safe”
project and incorporating the schools.

II. Other Matters
Bruce informed the board that at the May Operations Committee meeting staff will be
coming forward with service change recommendations for the August run board. This is
the last opportunity to have any impact on one of the few controllable areas of the RTD
operation i.e. level of services we deliver. Minor adjustments now will lessen the impact
of what would need to be done in 2011.
Marla Lien informed the board that RTD is planning on filing an Amicus Brief. RTD is
asking that given the 1995 case that says they are public employees, if the supreme court
overturns the court of appeals case that First Transit is a part of that extends
governmental immunity to those contracted employees, that they also overturn the
decision that says they are functional public employees.
III. Next Meeting – The next meeting of the Operations and Customer Services Committee will
be May 11, 2010.

IV. Motion to Move to Executive Session
Marla discussed this matter under other matters so an Executive Session was not needed.
