Recovery to Stabilization
•

First 8, everyone is impacted through lifestyle and choices (econ at 60-70%)
• Stay in Place…lost earnings, reduced hours, eliminated jobs
• Lifestyle activates down to 30-40% in sales and employment y/y
• Dynamic impact on service and moderate skilled workers, and low/mod neighborhoods
• Significant increase on public and non-profit safety net; from UI, food, health care, housing …

•

Second 8, economy begins to recovery – but in a new way (econ at 80-90%)
• Core business sectors rebound to 90% plus
• Lifestyle sectors continue to suffer, but rebuilding to 80-85% y/y
• Unemployment settles in 7-9% range, ending the year 6%+
• Labor Force shrinks as individuals make choices and face limited job market (adding to
unemployment
• Retail sector moves beyond evolution to revolution (store consolidation, closures)
• Entrepreneurial activities exploration
• Real estate/development is focused on flex/redeveloped workplaces and attainable housing
• Construction led by public projects (accelerate?) and residential (attainable price)
• Increasing demand for “safety net programs”

Recovery to Growth
• Third 8, a recovered but new economy (econ gets to 100%+)
•

•
•
•
•

Resident behavior and choices have changed; experience over goods consumption
• Retail is increasingly separated from store location – to online home and work-connected
• Dining, entertainment/arts, and then personal/business travel fully rebound and grows
Businesses and workers adapt work choices; increasing choice of work location split
Housing values rise, commercial space needs rise (except for retail), and development in next
place locations…
Increased job opportunities, and rising wage levels (starting late 2022 and 2023)
Continued and changed public/non-profit service demand

• Legacy Issues
•
•
•
•

Retail will not return to 2019 levels evolve toward value and new buying behaviors (online and
workplace connected locations)
Work options will include remote, in-person, hybrid and work pod, reducing both space needs
and travel demand (intra- metro and metro to metro/nation/global)
Experience spending (dining, travel, entertainment/arts/sports) will be a larger part of hhold
spending
Public revenue approaches will continue to weaken, both as base and dependence changes
(Sales tax, fuel tax (HUTF), property tax (commercial vs residential)

1.C.2.a

The COVID-19 impact
The lockdown resulted in leasing activity coming to a virtual standstill in the second
quarter. Tenant decision-making and leasing velocity is expected to remain slow throughout
the summer as businesses decide when to return to the office and then can assess the economic
damage prior to making any long-term space decisions.
Oil & gas slowdown
Oil & gas, and shale drilling in particular, began a small contraction in 2019 as a result of falling
out of favor with Wall Street, but the historic drop in prices in early 2020 will likely result in
continued major space reductions that could add up to 1.5 million RSF to office
inventory over next two to three years.
The coworking impact
Over-saturation, WeWork’s recent issues and the potential fallout of smaller players has been a
growing concern, and with new COVID-19 issues creating health concerns and an
economic pullback, a significant reduction in coworking space is anticipated.
Steady in-migration
Tech companies have been following millennial employees downtown, occupying large blocks
of space and have accounted for the majority of space absorption, albeit primarily in LoDo,
Union Station and periphery areas. A continuation of this theme will be necessary to offset
energy industry pullbacks and anticipated shrinkage in coworking space.
Increasing costs versus lower demand
Rising property taxes, increased construction costs and higher ownership bases over past few
years added to upward pressure on rental rates, but will need to be reconciled with
projected lower demand through the balance of 2020, which will likely put downward
pressure on rental rates.

Denver’s office use

Packet Pg. 235

1.C.2.a

What do
employees
think about
WFH?

What is the
role of the
office?

Employer Perspective: Physical space to bring
people together to showcase a company’s brand
and culture, and to foster collaboration and
innovation
Employee Perspective: A physical space for
social interaction, face-to face collaboration,
mentoring and managing

CONCLUSION: The office is a physical space that
extends culture through social interaction and
improves productivity by enabling collaboration.

©2020 Jones Lang LaSalle IP, Inc. All rights reserved.

What will
be the
lasting
impact on
office?

• Employees feel more productive WFH

• Real estate costs are ~10% of people costs

• Home office set-up and privacy are sub-optimal

• Function of the office evolving to emphasize
collaboration and innovation

• Enjoying ‘not commuting’ the most
• Miss the social interaction of office life
• Will want flexibility to WFH a few days a week

• WFH and technology will become embedded as
a part of flexible corporate life

Attachment: JLL_RTD market update 10-2020 - Final (4352 : Denver CBD Market Update)

Impact of Work From Home (WFH)

• Experiencing “always on” fatigue

• Employers will take this opportunity to
reimagine the future for competitive advantage

CONCLUSION: Flexibility to WFH 2-3 days a week will be
key to employee satisfaction, benefitting both the
employer and employer.

CONCLUSION: Recruitment and retention of talent will
dictate office location, utilization and design; with an
emphasis on flexibility, collaboration and innovation.

Work Trips

Since Stay-at-Home
orders were enacted in
mid-March, work trips
have dramatically
declined, while time
spent at home has
increased in the
Denver Metro Region.
This is likely due to
more people working
from home as well as
people being
furloughed or laid off.

• RTD may enter into agreements to provide residential, commercial, or retail uses on agency property.
• An agreement partner must compensate RTD at fair market value (FMV) and/or by the provision of services or
capital improvements such that the total benefit is not less than FMV.
• Residential use shall not reduce transit service or availability of adequate parking.

Common tools to reduce development cost and achieve eTOD
Reduce administrative cost
• Unsolicited proposals: prefer affordable-housing proposals in TOD Evaluation Guidelines
• Solicited proposals: conduct due diligence to inform future development
Reduce acquisition cost
• Discount property value for sale or ground lease
• Coordinate with state and/or local subsidies

Peer Agency eTOD Policy Requirements/Targets
• RTD’s peer transit agencies have varying affordable housing requirements for joint development
• Most commonly, agencies require between 20% and 35% of units to be affordable at 60%-100%
Area Median Income (AMI)
• Some agencies require these restrictions on a per-project basis, others on a per-station or
portfolio-wide basis

Illustration of a 20% vs. 35% Affordability Goal, Portfolio-wide
RTD holds ~15 properties with real development potential. In the next ten years, some number of them will develop.
RTD’s affordability goal would influence the number of units in those developments that are affordable. Here are three
illustrative scenarios, assuming 300 units per project and showing the difference between a 20% and 35% goal:
If 2 sites are developed:
20% Goal = 120 affordable units

35% Goal = 210 affordable units

Enter Presentation Title
Title Case

If 5 sites are developed:
20% goal = 300 affordable units

35% goal = 525 affordable units

If 10 sites are developed
20% goal = 600 affordable units

35% goal = 1,050 affordable units

A goal is not
enforceable — it helps
focus the agency on a
direction to pursue.
