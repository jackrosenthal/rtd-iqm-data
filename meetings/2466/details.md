## II. General Manager 2017 Tactical Plans

David Genova, General Manager and CEO, reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the Board that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.  It covered his proposed Tactical Plans for the Strategic Goals/Priorities established during the March 5th, 2016 RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SLT) Advance.  These goals are meant to drive the 2017 budget cycle.  He reminded the board that the top three priorities that came out of the Advance are:

- Fiscal Sustainability   (Strategic Goal #1)

- Workforce Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)

- State of Good Repair & Operations and Maintenance (Strategic goal #3)

General Manager Genova pointed out that a detailed write up was included in the Agenda Packet.  He explained that these items have not yet turned into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) goals and he would be developing the tactical plan further in conjunction with the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  He would be working with the Committee over the next few months with the goal of presenting the tactical plan to the full Board about mid-summer.

General Manager Genova reviewed the Board and staff focus areas as follows:

Strategic Goal Number One: Fiscal Sustainability

- Building Reserves

- Discuss Impacts

- Maintain Service Levels

- Monitoring

- Live Within our Means

- Identify New Revenue Sources

Strategic Goal Number Two: Workforce/Human Capital

- Pension

- Union Negotiations

- Health and Welfare

- Morale

- Recruitment/Retention

- Training/Development

- Succession Planning

- Recognition

- Working Conditions

Strategic Goal Number 3: State of Good Repair/Operations and Maintenance

- Safety and Reliability

- Maintaining What We Have

- Ensure Service and Accessibility

- Maintain Infrastructure

- Meet Federal Standards

- Maintain Facilities

General Manager Genova noted that further details could be found in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.  He asked if the Board had any questions or comments.

Director Bagley thanked General Manager Genova for his highlights of his Tactical Plan for the 2017 Strategic Goals, which align to the core goals for General Manager Genova.   He shared that as the Vice-Chair of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee he looks forward to working with General Manager Genova in the coming months to get a more detailed plan for each of these points.  He stated that he had found the packet fairly complete and thanked General Manager Genova for his presentation.

Director Deadwyler asked about the topic of ensuring service and accessibility.  She noted Access-a-Ride had not been included in General Manager Genova’s presentation.  She wondered if the reason for that was because Access-a-Ride was not RTD’s responsibility and was being left up to the contractors.  General Manager Genova indicated this was an oversight as it is to be part of the plans mentioned.

Director Menten commented that General Manager Genova indicated that sales tax parity has increased RTD’s revenue; she is hearing conflicting reports on this topic and asked for more information.  Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, stated that it has been hard to measure because it started at the same time as retail marijuana sales as well as a bump in the economy.  She said around several million dollars a year is contributable to that parity but it is really hard to come up with an exact number.  She noted if it had been done in isolation it would have been much easier but this time that is just staff’s best guess based on a comparative analysis.

Director Menten noted that General Manager Genova mentioned contributions that were made to make the Health and Welfare Trust to make it healthy.  She stated that is not how she would describe it.  The contributions were really what she would call bandaging a severe wound.  General Manager Genova responded that her interpretation was correct; he would not say it has been fixed it in its entirety but there have been some significant steps taken to keep it solvent.  He stated the Health and Welfare Trust would be one of the items addressed during the next contract negotiations with the Union. Director Francone thanked David for a very thorough and easy to understand presentation.   She added that she is looking forward to working with General Manager Genova as the Chair of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee to flush out these goals and turn them into SMART goals in the next month.

## III. Strategic Budget Plan Development Process and 2017 Budget Assumptions

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,  reviewed a Power Point presentation that was included in the April 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.  She reminded the Board that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) is RTD’s six year financial plan for the Base System that must result in a balanced budget.  FasTracks expenses and projects are included in the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) financial plan.  She said the goal is to combine the SBP and APE into one long-range plan going forward.

Jannette Scarpino explained that staff starts with the 2016-2021 SBP capital programs as a baseline to develop the current SBP. These projects are prioritized and evaluated using mission statement criteria and 2017 strategic goals. She said the SBP is comprised of operating elements (bus service, rail service, and operating and passenger facilities) and capital elements (fleet plan and operating passenger facilities and equipment).

Jannette Scarpino noted there are several revenue and cost assumptions used in development of the SBP which are:

Revenue Assumptions

- Sales and use tax growth rate

o        2017: CU-Leeds School of Business currently forecasts 5.6% increase over 2016

o        2018-2020: based on semi-annual forecasts from CU-Leeds School

o        February 2016 collections are 1.9% over February 2015

o        February 2016 collections are 3.1% below budget

- Fare Revenue

o        Assume system-wide 8.0% fare revenue increase in 2016 over 2015 actual

o        Fare revenue for 2017 will be established with formulation of 2017 Budget

o        Per policy, Board will consider a fare rate increase every 3 years with scheduled increases in 2019 then 2022

- Federal grants

o        Based on actual 2016 appropriations

o        Recognized as awarded

o        Assumed to increase at rate of inflation or as identified

Cost Assumptions

- Operating and maintenance costs

o        Based on 2016 Amended Budget

o        Costs escalated at rate of inflation

o        Collective Bargaining Agreement incorporated as fixed through 2017 then escalated at CPI

- Diesel fuel costs

o        Locked at $2.23 per gallon in 2016

o        Volatile commodity

o        RFP for 2017 vendor contract underway

o        Conservative cost assumptions and escalated at national inflation rate

- Debt service

o        Interest payments on existing debt and assumed financing

- Inflation rates

o        Based on Moody’s forecasts of February 2016

o        Denver-Boulder inflation rate: 3.0% in 2017

o        National inflation rate: 3.1% in 2017

Jannette Scarpino pointed out that there are many issues and challenges in developing the SBP.  The next steps are to review and prioritize SBP departmental requests for capital and expense projects, develop funding strategies and calibrate ridership/fare revenue estimates.  She will be presenting the first draft of the SBP at the May Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting with an update in June.  Staff hopes to bring the final SBP to the Board in July for approval so the 2017 Requested Budget process can begin in August with adoption of the Budget in November.

Director Walker noted that ridership had been adjusted downward to 1.5% due to the effect of the fare increase.  He wondered if staff had data at the local, regional, day pass, etc. level to show if there had been increases or decreases in fare revenue for each of those media to offset the decrease in ridership.  Jannette Scarpino responded that staff did not break it down at that level but were just looking at an overall fare revenue increase and ridership increase.

Director Anderson noted she had seen some information where it appeared that some fares went up while other fares went down.  She wondered if perhaps they could cancel each other out. Jannette Scarpino stated that was a true statement. She indicated staff is also leaning on the FasTracks expansion to provide some support to the fare revenue estimates. She said it is a somewhat aggressive assumption but it is obtainable.  Staff will have to monitor actuals for the remainder of the year and will report back.

Director Anderson complimented staff for the charts from Moody’s as it is great information to have on hand.  She thought it was interesting to see what the percentage of sales tax RTD gets for different categories. She shared that in the paper today there was a forecast that motor vehicles are not selling as well as they have in the past.   She sees that as a real jolt to RTD’s sales and use tax revenue.  She thanked staff for providing more detailed sales and use tax information as they are great reference pieces for the Board.

Director Bagley noted that the Diesel fuel lock in 2016 is $2.23 per gallon.  He wondered if staff has a sense of what it would be if we were to lock in today’s environment. Jannette Scarpino responded saying the future market for 2017 has been somewhere around $1.65 - $1.70.  Since then gas prices have trended up a bit so she suspects that number is slightly to the north of $1.70.  General Manager Genova added that we are expecting proposals for a fuel lock vendor by May.  He explained that staff has asked for something a little different as it is a competitive environment.  The Request for Proposal asked them to include what their lock would be for 2017 when they submit their proposals; however, there is typically a risk premium included on top of a fuel lock as they are hedging that prices are likely to go up.  He does not believe a provider would lock in this environment.

Director Lubow thanked staff for presenting an interesting, thorough and comprehensive review to the Board.  Director Lubow wondered if staff had thought about increasing the contributions to the fund balances so that they would become fully funded earlier.  Jannette Scarpino responded that we could always increase the contribution.  Staff typically brings forward the SBP with a contribution of $3 million to each fund. She pointed out that the SBP has historically been fairly tight so staff tends to leave that contribution at the minimum $3 million to each fund. She shared that staff run a variety of scenarios to see what the impact would be in adding more money.  Heather Copp further stated that, as was mentioned in the Tactical Plan, fund balances are one of the things that came up in the advance.   Staff is looking to build up our reserves sooner while we are experiencing sales and use tax growth rates in the 4-5% range as that will not last.

Director Menten requested more information regarding what the fare media purchases are pre-2016 and now.  She wonders how much the day passes are being used compared to before, what were the sales of express/regional versus the combined fare now, etc.  Director Menten commented that the first fare increase she experienced was the major overhaul of the entire fare structure as well.  She wondered when staff would start to look at the 2019 increase.  She believes it will be a lot less time than this past one but maybe not. General Manager Genova responded that this would be quite different compared to what we  just went through as the last effort looked at the overall fare structure, categories of fares, all of the zones on the rail system, etc. as well as looking at the rates.  Due to all the complexities it was a very long drawn out process.  He explained when we look at a general fare increase the process has less analysis and is usually less in duration.  He anticipates the process would begin in early 2018 for a 2019 fare increase.

Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation.  He stated that he is always interested in efficiencies.  He noted that staff puts a great deal of time into the SBP and wonders if perhaps there is a more efficient way to keep the Board informed.  He challenged staff to think about if there was a better way to do the SBP.    Heather Copp said that staff will have to see how changes to the SBP process would fit into the long term planning as there are plans that go out to 2040.

Chair Pro Tem Hoy thinks the most impactful comment is that sometimes we do things because that is the way we have always done them.   He does not know how Director Sisk’s suggestion might work specifically but believes our processes are something that should be looked at from time to time.

Director James appreciates Director Sisk’s skepticism.  He agrees that just because it is the way something has always been done is not necessarily a good reason to keep doing it; however, as someone who does this in a different dimension, his sense is that doing it annually is appropriate.  In a six year plan staff has more confidence than in a 60 year plan.  Jannette Scarpino noted that things move pretty fast around here.  She said historically many of staff’s assumptions change rather quickly; however, she pointed out that RTD’s business is also stabilizing.  She indicated staff would take the comments into consideration.

Director Walker thinks staff has a good idea of what our expenses are going to be but revenue is a little more of a greased pig.  Staff knows when we will need new buses but we do not know what our revenue will be each year.   He thinks it is prudent for the Board to get updates about our expectations and making adjustments yearly.  He stated as the Board saw in 2007, the economy can change on a dime.  He believes adjustments need to be made quickly.   He stated getting stuck in a rut is not always healthy but some level of predictability is essential.

## IV. Other Matters

Chair Pro Tem Hoy thanked everyone at RTD and especially at our FasTracks Program who made last week happen. He stated it was a monumental task, especially when thinking of all the little pieces that came together to magically make that happen.  He believes each and every person that works for RTD should feel proud of their efforts and the accomplishment.   He noted that people were ecstatic about the opening.

General Manager Genova agrees that it was a huge day and weekend.   He noted we received incredible media exposure that we could not have purchased.  He thanked the entire RTD and Denver Transit Partner teams because the opening took everyone.  He shared there was a switch and signal issue around mid-day Saturday as well as a few door issues but overall the opening was very smooth.  He indicated staff had three after action reviews and will continue to diligently monitor performance.  He noted there was also a brief bus bridge this afternoon between 40th and Airport but overall it has been a very positive experience.  He stated he was happy to see everyone really enjoying themselves.

Director Deadwyler congratulated General Manager Genova and Director Hoy for the wonderful job they did at the DIA Ribbon Cutting.
