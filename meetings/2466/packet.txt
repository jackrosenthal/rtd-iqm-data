GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability

Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2017 relates to
fiscal sustainability. The Board and staff identified the following specific focus areas:







Building Reserves
Discuss Impacts
Maintain Service Levels
Monitoring
Live within our Means
Identify new revenue sources

Building Reserves
The Board has adopted 2016 Fiscal Policies which includes a Fund Balance Policy. This
policy states the following:
 RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures. The unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board Appropriated Fund, a Capital Replacement
Fund, and an Undesignated Working Capital Fund. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
three (3) months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three (3) funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two (2) months of FasTracks operating funds excluding
depreciation. RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions
allow. At the end of Calendar Year 2015, the Base System had a fund balance, as
prescribed above, of $79.5 million.
Based on three months of operating
expenditures that amount for year end 2015 should have been $104 million.
FasTracks had a fund balance, as prescribed above, of $18 million. The Base
System is not scheduled to reach the three month threshold until the end of
Calendar Year 2019.
In recent years, RTD has seen significant growth in the sales and use tax, i.e., 9.8% in
2014 and 5.2% in 2015. This level of growth won’t last forever and consideration should
be given to meeting the three months fund balance sooner rather than later. In addition,
RTD should consider establishing an operating reserve that would be budgeted each year
to be more responsive to forecasted revenues verses actual revenues. This would allow
for more flexibility in dealing with revenue changes as they could be adjusted through the
reserve rather than cutting back previously approved projects or service levels.
Building reserves would allow for more flexibility in dealing with future revenue shortfalls

Background

2.1.c

Discuss Impacts
Each year RTD staff updates the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), a six year plan for the Base
system, and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE), a long range plan (2040) for FasTracks.
In addition to being utilized for the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) and
Long Range Plan (LRP), it provides a snapshot each year for the RTD Board and Staff to
plan for the future and understand the impacts of decisions that have been made and
those that are made today, and the impact on future revenues and operations. The SBP
becomes the basis for the annual budget each year. To remain fiscally sustainable, RTD
must annually balance the SBP while meeting service needs, addressing state of good
repair and building reserves.
Maintain Service Levels
Maintaining existing service levels is paramount to our customers especially with the
opening of five new lines of service in 2016. Unfortunately, service cuts have had to
occur in the not so distant past. In 2009, a service reduction of 6% was needed and
again in 2012 an 8% service reduction was implemented. Fortunately with steadily
increasing sales and use tax revenue since 2009, RTD has not had to make additional
service cuts. However at some point in the future, revenues will not increase at the
current rate and with the opening of five new service lines, operating and maintenance
costs will increase.
One of the ways to combat having to make service reductions is to have sufficient
reserves to be able to withstand fluctuations in the economy. As mentioned above, it is
prudent when economic conditions are favorable, as they are now, to make sure that
reserves are adequately funded so that service reductions are not required in the future to
balance the budget.
Monitoring
Monitoring of RTD’s financial condition is done at a variety of levels. Each month the
Board of Directors is provided a monthly financial report. The monthly financial report is
reviewed at the Finance and Administration committee each month. This report details
budget to actual both on a monthly basis as well as a year to date basis. This report also
contains a status of net position as well as an up to date accounting of the FISA. In
addition, beginning in mid-2015 staff began forecasting year end revenue shortfalls/
surpluses based on forecasts verses actuals.
At a staff level, monthly reports are provided by Accounting to the AGMs and budget
analysts so that expenditures can be monitored and corrective action taken. In addition,
2

Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan for 2017 Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability Final (2772 : 2017 Strategic Goals)

which is important because of the inherent economic volatility of the district’s largest
revenue source, sales tax. Growth of these reserves requires discipline to set aside funds
in the short term rather than spending the funds on service in the short term. This shortterm constraint on spending is a strategic effort to improve the long term fiscal
sustainability of RTD.

2.1.c

Live within our Means
According to MoneyTalksNews.com there are 10 ways to make sure you can live within
your means.











Know your income and expenses
Track your expenses
Separate wants and needs
Don’t compete “with the Joneses”
Pay in cash
Keep an emergency fund
Save money wherever possible
Cut down on expenses
Boost your income
Don’t deprive yourself

Although these ways are intended for personal use, they are very applicable to RTD. As
was discussed above in both impacts and monitoring, RTD needs to develop a budget and
then monitor revenues and expenditures to ensure that if revenues are not meeting
expectations or expenditures are higher than anticipated then corrective action is taken
before it is too late.
The SBP project selection process is designed to try to separate the wants from what is
really needed to maintain, operate, and sustain the RTD system. Projects are scored based
on how they meet RTD’s mission as well as the consequences of not doing the project.
The more difficult one is not competing with other agencies or what other governments
are providing. It is easy to want to provide additional services and the best new thing to
our customers, but RTD may not be able to afford those without jeopardizing existing
service and infrastructure.
RTD has issued debt to fund projects and assets. Currently all voter authorized debt has
been issued for the Base System and most of the voter authorized debt has been issued
for FasTracks. RTD needs to be prudent in issuing additional debt to make sure that it fits
in with both short and long term financial considerations.
In 2016, RTD is looking at cutting expenses that don’t affect service, such as travel, food,
and other operating items that are nice to have but aren’t necessary to provide service to
our customers.

each quarter in accordance with the Management Directive on Variance Reporting, each
Department head is required to submit an explanation to budget regarding any variance
between planned and actual expenditures that is +/- 10% and $100,000 or is deemed to
be material. This directive is intended to ensure that any issues are identified early in the
process and adjustments can be made to stay within budget.

2.1.c

In building our reserves, it was discussed that money should be saved when revenues are
healthy and reserve funds should be built in order to provide for shortfalls that will
eventually occur.

The last item is “don’t deprive yourself.” There is such a thing as being too lean. RTD
needs to ensure that our system is safe and the infrastructure is being maintained.
Identification of New Revenue Sources
To date, RTD has implemented many things that have helped increase existing revenue
sources. They are:
 Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
 January 1, 2016 implementation of the new fare structure and rates
 Implemented a naming rights program
Partnerships





Implementation of public private partnerships (P3) proposals for FasTracks, and for
other projects that provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to obtain additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities
Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where
RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development
and amenities and operating cost

Other Opportunities






Pursuit of a long-term solution to maintaining and operating on the 16th Street Mall
Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales
Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD
operations
Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

Workforce / Human Capital

One of RTD’s greatest assets is its employees. RTD has 2,904 employees. Of the 2,904,
863 are salaried employees and 2,041 are represented employees and fall under RTD’s
Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). As a part of this goal, the Board and staff
identified specific focus areas. Each of the following focus areas are addressed below:

Background

2.1.d

In March of 2013 RTD and the Union executed a five year agreement. That agreement is
scheduled to expire in February of 2018. In the latter half of 2017, RTD and the Union
will commence negotiations for the next contract. Covered in the agreements are such
things as:
 Pension
 Health and Welfare Trust
 Salary and Progression
 Working Conditions
In early 2017, we will initiate a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for
negotiations. Economic challenges are anticipated to address wages, pension, and health
and welfare.
Health and Welfare
The Union Health and Welfare Trust are governed by six Trustees. Three are appointed by
the Union and three are appointed by the General Manager. This governing body is
responsible for making plan decisions such as the employee contributions, deductibles, and
co-pays. These decisions of course affect the cost of the plans to both RTD and the
employees.
Over the last couple of years it has become apparent that this plan has become less and
less solvent. In 2015, the plan was struggling to meet its monthly obligations and health
care providers were being paid months in arrears. The Trustees met and made some plan
changes in late 2015, which are projected to allow the plan to remain solvent at least
through 2016. The Health and Welfare plan will have to be addressed in the next contract
negotiations with the Union.
Morale
The 2015 All Employee Survey indicated a large percentage of employees are engaged and
sense a feeling of enablement. However, approximately 40% of employees have low
levels of both engagement and enablement which may contribute to low morale. The
survey also indicated that communication up and down the chain of command and across
work groups can be improved. Additional survey responses from employees regarding
strategy, vision and decision-making at RTD were identified as areas for improvement.
RTD has undertaken three continuous improvement pilots to address morale issues
revealed in the Employee Survey and explore different paths to address the concerns
voiced in the survey.
Customer Care and Platte Bus Maintenance with support from policy analysis staff are
piloting process improvement training and facilitation called RTD Peak Academy (modeled
on the City and County of Denver’s Peak Academy lean process improvement
methodology). These trainings and continued support through Innovation Labs and
specialized workshops aim to give employees at every level of the organization tools to
identify and eliminate waste and coaching to propose innovations that serve internal and
2

Union Negotiations

2.1.d

Additionally, the Rail Operations Department has begun an intra-departmental pilot focused
on identifying and exploring employee concerns with monthly meetings modelled on the
successful Safety Meetings RTD has conducted for years. The policy analysis group is also
piloting a new tool, RTD Connect, for bus and rail operators to interface with support
staff.
Continuous improvement methods designed to create employee resolution and ownership
will continue throughout the organization. A follow-up survey will be conducted in 2017
to measure improvement from the baseline established in 2015.
Recruitment and Retention
As the economy has improved and unemployment has dropped to under 3% in the Denver
Metro area, recruiting has become much more challenging particularly in the areas of bus
operators, light rail operators, and mechanics. Hiring qualified applicants is not just a
Human Resource function, so recognizing that, RTD established a Recruitment and
Retention Working Group late last summer. This group is tasked with working together to
improve our recruitment process and working on ways to increase retention. Members of
that working group include: AGM of Rail, AGM of Bus, AGM of Communications, AGM of
Finance and Administration, HR, Marketing, State of Good Repair, and Bus Operations.
The following improvements have been made:
 “RTD is Hiring” messages on all buses and RTD vehicles.
 Advertising on billboards
 RTD Hiring Bus
 Holding “One-Stop” Hiring sessions on weekends and weeknights
 Hiring Bonus of $2,000
 Referral Bonus of $1,000
 Increase in shift differential and split shift pay
Since the inception of these changes late last year, the number of new applicants has
increased by 89.3% and new hires in the targeted areas has increased by 83.6%.1
Continued efforts include:
 Targeting specific sectors of the community that might produce more applicants for
bus operators, light rail operators, and mechanics.
 More research on what attracts people to RTD so we can appeal to that dynamic
 Looking at pay and benefits for these occupational groups through future CBA
negotiations
Efforts thus far, have been to focus on recruitment with several items focused on
retention. A recent review showed that approximately 7% of bus operators left within the
first 18 months. We are closely monitoring recruitment and retention vis-a-vis the
improvements made to date.

external customers better.

2.1.d

RTD has a very robust training and development program. Each salaried employee is
offered $2,000/ year and each represented employee is offered $1,500/year towards
education and training. In addition, RTD offers “free of charge” classes such as Word,
Excel, Power Point, and other classes to provide job enrichment. RTD also has the
Leadership Academy and the MAX program.
The Leadership Academy is designed to support RTD’s emerging leaders by focusing on
the relationship of mission, values, culture, and strategic priorities. Members of this oneyear educational program engage in a comprehensive coursework that provides them with
the tools and resources to successfully guide RTD in the coming years. Employees
selected for the program benefit from professional training and mentoring. By offering a
dynamic environment for the development of leadership mastery, organizational
stewardship, business fundamentals, and technical competencies, the Leadership
Academy promotes the advancement of RTD employees. Since its inception 95 current
employees have completed the program. The 2016 Leadership Academy class has 25
employees who will graduate in December of 2016 increasing the total number of
employees who have completed the program to 120.
The Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is a program designed to create future Transit
Leaders and to provide the public with continuity through the evolution of the industry and
the needs of our patrons. MAX is designed to leverage best practices of the industry in
order to minimize the learning curve and reduce the cost and time to implement new
programs. MAX participants are from RTD, Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Current RTD
participants in the program must also be graduates of the Leadership Academy.
Goals of the MAX Program are to (1) Provide a better understanding of transit industry
needs between agencies (2) Create an environment that provides a positive network for
learning and support in our unique industry (3) Provide a safe platform for candid
interactions between all agencies (4) Define high impact areas within our agencies,
including: Safety, Run cutting, Operations, Human Resources, and Capital Programs. The
4 agencies of the 2016 MAX program are focusing on Security, Recruitment and
Retention, and Employee Development as high impact areas. Since its inception in 2011,
26 current RTD employees have completed the program.
We are exploring the feasibility of an agency-wide mentoring program for employee
development utilizing Leadership Academy graduates as the core cadre for the program.
We are working on an advanced program learning path for graduates of the Leadership
Academy and the MAX program that would include a combination of newly developed
internal classes as well as external leadership programs such as Leadership APTA and Eno
Foundation courses.
We are continuing, in partnership with IT, to seek a platform to deliver computer based
training (CBT) that will communicate with our Oracle Learning Management system.
Managers/senior leaders from other departments either have developed or would like to
partner with Education CBT training courses in areas such as, but not limited to Ethics,

Sexual Harassment, Cyber Security, ADA, Legal, Title VI, Document Storage and
Retention, and Security.

Over 54% of RTD’s workforce is over the age of 50, including 4 employees over the age
of 80. Although employees seem to be working longer, eventually they will leave taking
years of knowledge with them. Two of the efforts that are intended to assist with
succession planning are the Leadership Academy and the MAX program. Another large
issue that needs to be addressed is Information Governance. Many RTD employees are
vested and eligible to retire. Knowledge management and retention of institutional
knowledge is critical to the continuity of business and it is imperative that RTD develop
and implement systems and processes to capture this historical information. That
information needs to be available to new employees in the form of Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and the ability to access past information. The ECM project authorized
by the Board last year is a key mechanism to address SOPs and provide ready access to
information.
In 2012, each major department began identifying key positions and the associated
requisite skills within their department. As these become clearly identified and included
into SOPs, development paths can be created for employees who wish to move into those
positions. All departments will update their leadership and succession plans in 2017.
Recognition
One of the 2013 Leadership Academy class projects was entitled “Employee Value
Program.” The team developed a project vision to describe the intended outcome of the
program. It was, “To have and keep happy employees by engaging both employees and
managers.” This vision was supported by the program mission: “To use spot on
recognition to motivate employees to provide safe, reliable, and courteous service.” The
project team also developed specific goals to measure the effectiveness of the Employee
Value Program:




To encourage goal alignment from top to bottom throughout District
To encourage the documentation of criteria so employees know what to work
towards and can easily reference those goals and criteria.
Improve recognition delivery and tracking, making the reward effective and
meaningful.

Based on the research and the employee survey, the project group developed
recommendations for an on-going Employee Value Program:
 Continuation and enhancement of existing formal recognition programs
 Establishment of informal recognition programs
 Development of employee recognition training for all managers and supervisors at
RTD
 Establishment of a permanent rotating Employee Recognition Committee to oversee
the Program

Succession Planning

2.1.d

As part of this project, an employee survey was conducted and an implementation plan
developed. To date, this project hasn’t been implemented. We will review this work in
2017 and determine if this or a like plan should be initiated.

RTD employees work in a variety of settings including: on-board operators; maintainers at
maintenance divisions; field staff working on maintenance, landscaping, infrastructure, and
field supervision; and office environments. Management staff maintains facilities and
working conditions to provide good work environments per work classification categories.
RTD employees are also subject to a variety of policies, procedures and rules depending on
work assignment. Efforts are made to make work policy effective and provide good
working conditions. RTD conducted stay interviews with front line workers to determine
employees concerns.








From the Stay interviews conducted by ET&D, LR and HR, front line workers raised
concerns about rest breaks/relief stations and the demanding schedule that
prevents the opportunity to take advantage of them. Operators understand the
necessity for split shifts; however, some split schedules are too lengthy, stretching
out their days considerably.
Safety was brought up, with some operators suggesting a driver “barrier” would
make them feel safer (a barrier to separate operators from the public on buses),
while others prefer no barrier.
Consistency in supervisor treatment was raised, for example some supervisors
demanding specifics for the reason the driver is calling in sick.
Complaints come to the attention of the driver immediately; compliments take too
long.
The extra board is difficult for a new driver.

We will continue to monitor work areas and work policy to create efficient and desirable
working conditions.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #3
State of Good Repair – O&M

In 2017 RTD will experience expanded operations and maintenance resulting from the
opening of five lines in 2016 and continued emphasis on the base system. At the same
time, our Asset Management and State of Good Repair program matures to encompass all
asset types.
RTD relies heavily on physical assets and exercising life-cycle management principles for
better operating results, system performance and efficiency. Assets exist to support the
delivery of transit service, so their value is dependent on RTD’s objectives, expectations
and system needs.
Asset Management consistently applied from the highest levels enables RTD to work
collectively and more effectively in realizing and extracting value from our assets. Asset
management, because of its interplay with other agency functions, provides an excellent
catalyst for the integration of all organizational strategies, goals and objectives.
Good asset management or State of Good Repair is a strategic data-driven approach that
guides our investments, resources, and policy decisions to achieve goals. Results help us
highlight areas of challenge, identify necessary adjustments, and communicate measured
success. International Standards Organization or ISO 55000 is one of the best examples of
the application of organizational management system and subsequently, supports working
towards achieving and maintaining a “state of good repair”. The descriptions below
provide the tactical approaches to accomplish this board goal while supporting and aligning
with RTD’s missions and all other agency goals.
The objective of RTD’s State of Good Repair program is to optimize the use or value from
our assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership while managing other risks.
Certification to the ISO 55000 Standard will provide evidence that RTD’s investment and
expenditure on assets meets with this overall objective and is in alignment with RTD’s
overall business strategy. Moving this goal forward also demonstrates to both regulators
and other stakeholders that assets are being appropriately maintained while addressing
short, medium and long term risks. In addition, independent certification provides evidence
of compliance to safety critical systems and procedures.
ISO 55000 is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
should begin pursuit as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management.
Benefits from the goal of State of Good Repair and the ISO standard encompass the
following aspects:




Safety and Reliability
Maintaining What we have
Ensure Service & Accessibility

Background

2.1.e





Maintain Infrastructure
Meet Federal Standards
Maintain Facilities

We continue to view safety as our #1 priority. RTD has an unwavering commitment to
provide safe services to our customers and stakeholders. RTD will implement the FTA’s
mandated Safety Management System framework including:




Dashboard safety reports
Document and implement the Asset Management / State of Good Repair safety
connection
Creation of automated system notifications of asset requiring further safety
evaluations

The Nexus between State of Good Repair and Safety was established with the passage of
MAP-21. The FTA adopted the principles and methods of Public Transportation Safety
Management Systems to guide its development and implementation. Safety Management
System (SMS) is a comprehensive, collaborative organization-wide data-driven approach to
managing safety risk. This system will build on RTD’s existing safety foundation to
mitigate risk, detect and proactively correct safety problems, share and analyze safety
data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully. SMS is the formal,
top-down business approach to managing safety risk, which includes a systemic approach
to managing safety, including the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities,
policies and procedures.
A fundamental aspect of RTD’s Asset Management program is the monitoring of asset
condition and performance as an indicator of system health. The data derived from
condition assessments inform the RTD of some practices related to SMS, to the extent
that an asset's condition could impact its safety. Maintaining assets in a state of good
repair will drive high reliability.
Maintaining What We Have
The operations and maintenance areas within departments do an exceptional job
maintaining what we have through established maintenance programs. RTD will continue
to utilize current maintenance programs and continue to submit strategic budget plan
(SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of good repair. It should be noted that many
SBP projects that are submitted are deferred due to a lack of resources. This has been a
recurring concern during the SBP process for the last several years. RTD prioritizes SBP
requests, however, resource limitations prevent all projects, some of which may be linked
to state of good repair, from being addressed.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets, exercising a life-cycle management approach
creates better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all assets involves a common set of elements.

Safety & Reliability

2.1.e






Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Evaluate all current maintenance strategies and plans
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all rolling stock,
infrastructure and facilities, and
Generate an annual report on RTD’s state of good repair.

Ensure Service & Accessibility (see also Maintain Service Levels)
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
communities, we must focus on reliability and accessibility. In addition to these objectives
RTD implements service changes three times per year. These changes compounded with
the opening of 5 lines will necessitate emphasis be placed specifically on our service &
accessibility. We will continue to focus on service planning to:



Comply with service standards,
Measure productive of service by route / line – insure expansion and cuts follow a
policy related to highest service and accessibility standards.

Service and accessibility are dependent on our system availability and maintenance. We
will continue to recruit and retain employees to assure delivery of service, and we will
continue with maintenance programs so that assets are available and accessibility is
preserved.
Maintain Infrastructure
Maintaining the condition of our transit infrastructure is critical for RTD and one that poses
pressing challenges for most of the Nation’s transit systems. RTD has several categories
of infrastructure: rail and bus maintenance facilities; track, power, signal and
communication systems; stations and park-n-rides; and various IT and security-related
systems. RTD’s bus maintenance divisions are approximately 30-40 years old and present
a variety of on-going maintenance challenges. Many of these challenges are addressed
through SBP projects, however, it is important to realize the age of these facilities and plan
for the long-term replacement as well as day-to-day maintenance. The original light rail
system is now over 20 years old and beginning to require some replacement and major
maintenance activities as well as day-to-day work. The focus of RTD’s SBP program
should prioritize infrastructure maintenance.

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan for 2017 Goal #3 - State of Good Repair (2772 : 2017 Strategic Goals)

In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the lifecycle cost,
physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary. This data-driven
practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and
manage risks. These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in
implementation. Steps to achieving this goal include:

2.1.e

The Board of Directors and RTD staff have taken the lead in the industry to comply with
MAP-21 and Fast Act established and forthcoming standards. The final State of Good
Repair / Asset Management rule making is expected in mid-2017 and RTD has been
intimately involved at the national level in shaping this legislation. The goal is that RTD
will be fully compliant and meet the implementation schedules set forth by the FTA, and
Department of Transportation. As industry leaders the secondary goal is to examine the
benefits of the full implementation of the ISO 55000 international standard. Because the
ISO standard is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
will pursue it as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management. Long-term
benefits from the standard encompass the following aspects:








Management
o

Liability mitigation is enhanced in the event of failures by being able to show
compliance with an international, best practice standard

o

Enhanced risk and performance management through well informed decision
making

o

Strategic planning is enhanced through access to better quality asset related
management information

o

Improved business performance with a robust template for generating more
value out of its assets and therefore providing more service with less resources

o

Enhanced reputation as a well-managed business

o

ISO 55000 establishes the role of asset management in the overall strategy of
the company

Operations & Facilities
o

Continual improvement is achieved through regular review of best practices in
processes and procedures

Maintain Facilities
RTD has thousands of facilities and related assets that range in age from over decades old
to new construction. Maintaining the condition of our transit facilities is critical for the
safe and reliable delivery of service. The operations and maintenance areas within
departments do an exceptional job maintaining what we have through established
maintenance programs. RTD will continue to utilize current maintenance programs and
continue to submit strategic budget plan (SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of
good repair.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets exercising a life-cycle management approach
supports better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all facilities assets involves a common set of
elements. In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the
lifecycle cost, physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary.
The link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive
maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance include mean cost per
square foot and frequency and time out of service. This data-driven practice aims to
maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and manage risks.
These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in implementation. Steps to
achieving this goal include:




Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all facilities.
