BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Aurora CELO Annexation

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the revised boundary map of the Regional Transportation District
and authorize the Board Secretary to certify the boundary map and description.
It is further recommended that the newly annexed area to RTD pursuant to the provisions of CRS 32-9106.6 (1)(b) be included in Director District F (Director Broom).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
HB 1295-07 requires that the District revise its boundary map and legal description following any
changes to the District’s boundary. Further, pursuant to CRS 32-9-106.6 (1)(b), any area annexed by an
in-District municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. The revised
RTD boundary map and legal description must be approved by the RTD Board and the RTD Board
Secretary must certify the map and legal description to the State and appropriate county. Additionally,
the Board must assign the newly annexed areas to specific Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
The land involved in this annexation is known as the CELO property in the City of Aurora. The property
lies on the south side of East Jewell Avenue approximately half-way between South Harvest and South
Powhaton roads. It encompasses 870,853 square feet or approximately 20 acres and is currently used
for agricultural purposes. With the annexation, the City has zoned the property R-2 for medium-density
residential use, generally permitting single family and duplex housing. As the attached map indicates, the
property is discontiguous with the existing District boundary; however, Director District F (Director
Broom) is the closest Director District to the property.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact is associated with this action. It should be noted, however, that the properties are
currently vacant and no RTD service is provided in the general vicinity.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Reimagine RTD Guiding Principles

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt guiding principles to create a framework for decision making for the
Mobility Plan for the Future element of the Reimagine RTD project.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD began the Reimagine RTD process in 2019 to develop a plan for what is next for RTD. Two primary
deliverables are being developed as part of the plan:
1. System Optimization Plan – a short-term plan focused on redesigning RTD services to balance
mobility needs and RTD’s fiscal limitations
2. Mobility Plan for the Future – a long-term plan focused on strategies to address the region’s
future mobility needs
Staff initiated discussions with the Board about establishing guiding principles for Reimagine RTD at the
August 27, 2019 Board Study Session. Guiding principles can be defined as value statements that help
guide future RTD decision making. During initial discussions with the RTD Board, concerns were
expressed about competing principles and difficulty in prioritizing a finite set of principles. Additional
discussions were held in 2020 during the development of the System Optimization Plan about RTD’s
transit service approach. Those discussions focused on developing a set of service philosophies to guide
future decisions about RTD service. Some consensus was developed amongst the Board during those
discussions about supporting social equity populations, service reliability, and addressing
partnerships/geographic disparities.
During the pause for the Reimagine RTD process between August 2020 and February 2021, RTD’s
General Manager and CEO, Debra Johnson, expressed strong support for establishing a set of guiding
principles for the Mobility Plan for the Future. Based on this direction, staff developed a new set of
guiding principles. This new set of principles was developed based on feedback received earlier in the
Reimagine RTD process from the Board of Directors and stakeholders as well as input from the General
Manager. The new set of guiding principles was presented to the Board of Directors on February 23,
2021. The guiding principles were also presented to the Advisory Committee and the Technical Working
Group for Reimagine RTD on March 10 and 11. Favorable feedback was received at all meetings. The
Advisory Committee and Technical Working Group for Reimagine RTD did express the desire to have
more specificity in the guiding principles. More specificity will be accomplished in the future with the
development of specific outcomes and strategies for each guiding principle.

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

DISCUSSION
Guiding principles for the Reimagine RTD Mobility Plan for the Future will be used to establish a
framework for decision making and create an organizing structure for the Plan. The Guiding Principles
include:
-

Mobility – provide safe, reliable transportation service to improve the quality of life of residents,
customers, and visitors.

-

Equity – remove barriers to accessing transportation services that enable customers to have the
freedom to get where they want to go.

-

Financial – leverage resources and maximize cost efficiencies, serving as good stewards of
taxpayer dollars.

-

Partnerships – pursue partnerships with both public and private organizations that help identify
innovative opportunities to enhance mobility throughout the region.

-

Workforce – foster a dynamic, diverse workforce that promotes engagement and innovation,
recognizing team members as RTD’s greatest asset.

-

Sustainability – provide sustainable mobility options while continually seeking to reduce RTD’s
environmental impact.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this action. The guiding principles will indirectly impact
future financial decisions as they will provide value statements that help guide future RTD decision
making.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Approval of Triunity Hill Joint Venture Contract Extension
and Value Increase

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
April 20, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the RTD Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager to approve a contract amendment to
exercise all remaining option years of the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture agreement for Construction
Management Support Consultant Services for FasTracks and Base Systems operations, extending the
contract end date to July 13, 2024, and increasing the contract value by $3,000,000 to a total not-toexceed value of $37,400,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In April 2014, the RTD Board approved selection and award of a multi-year contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture for an amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support
Consultant Services. Notice to Proceed was issued on July 15, 2014, for a six-year contract with four
one-year options. In May 2017, the Board authorized an increase to the total contract value to cover the
extension of resources from July 13, 2017, through July 13, 2020, bringing the not-to-exceed value of
the contract to $34,400,000.
In April 2020, the RTD Board authorize the Interim General Manager to approve a contract amendment
exercising the first one-year option, extending the term of the contract through July 13, 2021.
As of March 3, 2021, RTD has contracted for a total of $33,476,278 in services to be delivered through
the current contract end date of July 13, 2021, with $923,722 remaining of the contract not-to-exceed
value. As of the January 2021 invoice, RTD has paid out a total of $27,891,344 on this contract.
The Triunity-Hill Joint Venture includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner. RTD has set a DBE
goal of 27% for this contract. As of March 3, 2021, actual DBE participation has been 48.66% of the
contract value.
DISCUSSION
RTD is in the closing phase of several operational FasTracks corridors. It is crucial to retain the
institutional knowledge needed to close out all contracts, finalize Right-of-Way needs and meet final
reporting requirements for FTA grant projects. The proposed time extension to the Triunity-Hill Joint
Venture contract would make the resources available to RTD to complete the project closeout in a timely
and cost-effective manner.
As part of the contract closeout process, RTD faces potential claims and lawsuits related to its projects.
Support from the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture staff involved in the original issue could be critical to
resolving the issues in a manner that would be most favorable to RTD.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.3

Moreover, Triunity-Hill Joint Venture will continue to provide specialized services and staff in support of
FasTracks and Base System operations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total contract value for the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture contract would increase by $3,000,000 to a
not-to-exceed amount of $37,400,000, with a time extension through July 13, 2024. Funding for this
contract is included in the 2021 Budget within the specific projects where CMSC support would be
utilized. Any future year funding would be identified and approved based on needs and funding
availability.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Emergency Preparedness – Loss of power

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the February 9, 2021 Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors Operations and
Customer Service Committee meeting, during discussion of Item D, Other Matters, Director Broom raised
the following question, “Does RTD have backup systems to prevent what happened in Texas during the
cold spell?”
This discussion item serves as staff’s response to Director Broom’s inquiry.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s Design Criteria requires the agency’s systems including infrastructure to be designed to meet the
following parameters:
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
Ambient Temperature: -30°F to +110°F
Relative Humidity: 8 to 100%
Maximum Rainfall in 24 Hours: 1.88 inches
Maximum Snowfall in 24 Hours: 10.1 inches
Maximum Wind Speed: 54 mph
Average Elevation: 5,280 feet
Based on the Staff’s research (i.e. reviewing public codes), Texas does not design to the same cold
extremes as Colorado. RTD routinely operates below zero and has the resources and trained individuals
to support the agency’s core business functions.
The Capital Programs (CP) Department has 63 Facilities Maintenance (FM) Mechanics that are
responsible for preventive maintenance and non-scheduled maintenance work. Their skill sets include
licensed electricians, plumbing, carpentry, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), boiler
maintenance and general equipment repair. This Team is supported by staff assigned to the twenty-four
plus properties along with engineering and construction professionals. RTD keeps spare parts and
material on hand to repair and replace failing components across the District.

Packet Pg. 10

1.C.1

Lubricants, fuels, piping and facilities have been designed and procured to handle low temperatures. RTD
has backup generators at all facilities that provide power to critical systems including fuel pumps and IT
systems. Generators are maintained weekly. RTD’s Building Automation System (BAS) tracks the testing
and output of the backup generators. The FM Supervisors are notified by the BAS when the generators
are tested and if any faults are detected. RTD has trained staff to repair any issues with the generators.
Along with the permanent generators, RTD has one trailer mounted generator that can be moved from
facility to facility as needed and several portable generators for point of use.

Emergency Generator at Mariposa

Emergency Generator at District Shops

Emergency Generator at Elati
Power is continuously supplied with several Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) for critical systems
across the District. As the power supply moves from Xcel to backup generators (typical used for the IT
systems) a battery supply runs the system for these short periods of time.

Packet Pg. 11

1.C.1

UPS at District Shops for the Data Center
Boilers in the bus operations facilities are designed for natural gas and diesel. During the cold spell that
caused problems in Texas, RTD staff operated several of the boilers on diesel without interruption to the
building heating systems. The District also has serval portable heaters and swamp coolers in its facilities.

Boiler Room at Platte
Along with the staff and redundancies identified above, the Facilities Team has over 100 vehicles
ranging from pool vehicles, Jeeps and light to heavy duty pickup trucks configured as self-contained
office/workstation/material storage (including 110-volt systems), loaders and dump trucks (snow
removal in the winter).

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.1

Some of the RTD Facilities Team vehicles available
Capital Programs facilities staff are trained to maintain and repair RTD’s systems year-round. They also
provide snow removal for RTD’s operating facilities. Roles and responsibilities are documented in the
Facilities Maintenance Plan, Snow Plan and the CP SOP for Emergency Scenarios.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Northwest Rail Update

Committee Meeting Date:
April 6, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager Capital Programs
William Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 Minutes
BACKGROUND
At the February 9, 2021 Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors’ Study Session
regarding the Northwest Rail Corridor (NWR), staff committed to return to the Board and provide
additional information regarding the potential next steps to provide peak service along the Northwest Rail
(NWR) Corridor prior to April 30, 2021.
DISCUSSION
In an effort to formulate plans pertaining to next steps for the NWR corridor, a critical component of this
effort entailed leveraging jurisdictional stakeholder engagement sessions in order to garner a better
understanding of their concerns, ideas and recommendations as to the next steps in developing a Peak
Service rail plan. Through the compilation of this feedback, as well as input from the RTD Board
members, staff has developed a road map to a path forward.
Considering the District does not currently have the funds available for either a full build-out or Peak
Service operations, there is a strong need to understand the impacts and costs of moving forward with a
rail option along the corridor. RTD and BNSF will need a 30% conceptual design plans and the
identification of environmental impacts along the corridor before either entity can commit to an
operational scenario for the Peak Service Plan.
The presentation contains:
• Recurring themes identified during the jurisdictional stakeholder engagement sessions
o Frustrations – Communities have paid into FasTracks but still do not have rail
o Required activities - schedule and completion timeline needed for all activities
o Peak service and BRT (Hwy 119, Hwy 7 and 287) is not interchangeable with full rail
build-out
o Strategic investments interest (E.g., Improve mobility via BRT + Rail)
o Leverage FISA to fund 30% plans and environmental work
o Requests that the RTD Board formally supports the BNSF alignment as preferred Front
Range Rail alignment
