#### 1. Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group 24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190 (option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed $107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term, $4,725,730 for option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of $23,098,814 for the five year period.  This results in a total contract amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract period and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide “Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on August 17, 2014.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, reminded the Directors of the four fixed-route contracts: First Transit Denver, First Transit Longmont, Viola, and First Transit Commerce City.  Two proposals were received in response to the Request for Proposal 14-DH-003 for the Provision of Group 24 Public Transportation Services: one from First Transit and one from MV Transportation.  Both proposals were evaluated and the evaluation team found the First Transit proposal better from a technical perspective even though it is $13,000 higher than the MV Transportation proposal.

Director Anderson requested Mr. Abel to give her a call offline to further explain the cost difference in facilities.

Committee Chair Solano stated that the service provided by First Transit to Commerce City is horrible.  He asked to identify who “Group 24” is.  Mr. Abel noted the name is a title assigned to this package of service, and the group numbers are subsequent. Committee Chair Solano asked if the proposal included new buses.  Mr. Abel replied that RTD is in the beginning stages of a new vehicle distribution program.  Committee Chair Solano stressed his point of First Transit not representing Commerce City well.  He said that he would be voting no on this item.

Director Menten pointed out that due to legislation RTD was originally aiming to a minimum of 50% contracted out services and then it got changed to have a maximum percentage.  Mr. Abel noted that the Honorable Terry Considine, Colorado State Senator, introduced legislation in 1988 for RTD to have a minimum of 20% fixed route service hours contracted out, subsequently amended to 35%, amended again in the early 2000’s to 50% to include all rubber tire service hours (including paratransit as well as fixed route services).  In 2007 it was amended to a maximum of 58% of all rubber tire service hours.  If the recommended action is approved, RTD would still be at the high 56%/low 57% range.

Director Deadwyler asked for clarification on the Group 24 and wondered if they were a combination of all of RTD’s contracted services.  Mr. Abel clarified that each of the four contracts consists of different routes and schedule that RTD packages together and requests proposals.  Group 24 was previously known as Group 20, but it was renamed and sent back out for proposals as the contract was about to expire.  Director Deadwyler asked if this proposal was just for bus services and Mr. Abel agreed that it was just for rubber tire service hours.

#### 1. Special Services 2013 4th Qtr Report

Mr. Abel introduced Carolyn Conover, Manager for Contracted Services, and Brian Matthews, Special Services Manager, who referred the Directors to the Special Services 2013 4th Quarter Report found on pages 10-11 of the Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee (OCUS/FAA) Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.

Director Hoy asked Mr. Matthews to remind him of when the Federal Heights contract is up.  Mr. Matthews said that it was due to expire at the end of the year. Mr. Abel clarified that the Federal Heights contract is funded through a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program Grant (CMAQ) that has a finite period.

Director Folska asked for a definition of operator complaints.  Ms. Conover identified operator complaints as those based on the operator performance, such as bus running late, discourtesy, or careless driving.  Director Folska asked if the number of rides is increasing at the same time as the number of complaints.  Mr. Matthews answered in the affirmative, pointing out that there were 400,000 boardings for the year.  He also noted that most of the complaints during 2012 were due to the suspension of services in the Jefferson County area.  Director Folska asked if operators get judged on complaints received.  Mr. Matthews answered in the affirmative if the complaint is specific to the operator.  Mr. Abel clarified that there are no sanctions to operators if the complaint is due to lack of service.

Director Anderson noted that the Golden Call-n-Ride has been the most successful and asked about the possibility of being ready for fixed-route service in the near future.  Mr. Matthews said that the subject is an active conversation within his team.  Director Anderson noted that this is the first Call-n-Ride she recollects that increased the need for the number of buses.  Mr. Matthews pointed out that the Green Valley Ranch Call-n-Ride ridership went up very quickly as well.

Chair Sisk said that it is a great job in his opinion that there were 270 complaints in 2013 out of 400,000 boardings and that the number of complaints went down from 442 in 2012.  He asked for an update on the Parker Call-n-Ride.  Mr. Matthews pointed out RTD’s continued work with the town of Parker.  There was an instance of an operator documenting fictitious ride numbers.  He also pointed out how it is a hard, large area to serve since a lot of people own cars.

Director Daly noted the improvement on the Belleview Call-n-Ride and asked for further explanation on the performances of the Belmar and Evergreen Call-n-Ride.  Mr. Matthews pointed out the newness of the Belmar service since it started with the West Rail Line and how it seems to have not caught on yet. RTD is considering eliminating the service. Evergreen’s numbers have dropped because regular riders have passed away.  RTD is doing a bit of marketing to seniors in the area and hoping to pick up new riders.

Director Lasater pointed out the necessity to keep marketing in Lone Tree and Parker as they are close in proximity.  He also noted that he has received complaints from both areas on the inability to get service during peak times.  He mentioned that the rule of thumb for Call-n-Ride is to service a five square mile area; however, Parker is 20 square miles.  He asked Mr. Matthews to address why the town of Parker was marketing for the Call-n-Ride without RTD assistance.  He also wanted to know more about the operator referred to during Chair Sisk comments.  Mr. Matthews mentioned that there was an operator who admitted he wanted the Call-n-Ride to succeed and took matters in his own hands.  He was let go in June, 2013.  The ridership numbers from January to June of 2013 have been removed from the system.  Regarding marketing, Mr. Matthews said that he’s asked the marketing team to put a plan together for the area for 2014.  Since the Parker Call-n-Ride started, the marketing has been at a grass root level, contacting Home Owner Associations, schools/teachers for field trips, retail stores like Walmart and King Soopers, Recreational Centers and other onsite promotions.  Operators in the area are also on board to promote the program.  Mr. Abel noted that during peak hours there is limited capacity due to subscriptions.  Director Lasater indicated that cities on the fringe of the District have similar issues and to consider marketing to the aging population as this sector is growing in the area.  Marketing could include how to use the SkyRide since not all seniors would qualify for the Call-n-Ride services.

Director Bagley noted how in 2012, RTD has $10.7 million in service cuts across the district and how a number of routes were modified in the southwest area of the District.  He pointed out that the current numbers in ridership for South Jefferson County are healthy but not robust.  He asked Mr. Matthews if he had any general comments on any of the routes.  Mr. Matthews replied that South Jefferson County’s ridership is overall low and that RTD has made some changes to fine tune and adapt to the community. The goal is to increase the boardings to 4 per hour instead of the current 3.  Director Bagley noted that 3 is an improvement on the 2.8 from 2012.  He inquired about the efficiency of the Flex route.  Mr. Matthews pointed out that the ridership is low and that Flex route 67 was discontinued.

##### a. Special Services Monthly Report 4th Qtr 2013

#### 2. 4th Quarter 2013 Customer Complaint Analysis

Mr. Abel and Ms. Conover pointed the Directors to the 4th Quarter 2013 Customer Complaint Analysis found on page 15 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.

Director Daly wondered on the possibility of educating the public on learning to identify the block numbers on the buses in order to understand if a bus is truly running late.  Mr. Abel noted that would be a challenge for the customer to understand.

Director Tobiassen asked for an update on the program to work with operators regarding wheelchairs, strollers, etc.  Ms. Conover mentioned that it is still a challenge for operators when dealing with conflict and having to address it on the bus.  Mr. Abel informed the Directors that negotiations with the legal staff of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition reached an out of court settlement, which includes returning to practices from prior to 2002, including requesting individuals with strollers to fold them down and passengers with large items will need to utilize the area behind the wheelchair securement area.

Director Folska noted that the correct name for the Colorado School of the Blind is the Colorado Center for the Blind (CCB).  The School is located in Colorado Springs.  She asked if CCB was part of the settlement.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, answered that the settlement was primarily for mobility devices.  Director Folska asked for a copy of the policy once finalized. She also asked for an update on the software program collecting customer service data/complaints.  Mr. Abel mentioned that the settlement agreement includes some new data collection policies and that his team is currently working with the Board Office Staff to schedule a broader Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Study Session in the near future.

#### 3. Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2013

There was no discussion on this item.

##### a. Quarterly Performance Stats 2013

#### 4. 4th Quarter Access-a-Ride Performance Report

Mr. Abel introduced Larry Buter, Manager for Paratransit Services, to the committee.  Mr. Abel referred the Directors to the 4th Quarter Access-a-Ride Performance Report found on page 24 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.  He pointed out the Access-a-Ride program has increasing ridership without increasing hours of program.

Director Deadwyler shared with the Directors how she spent ten hours at Access-a-Ride on Monday, March 17th, and would like to work with Board Staff, RTD Staff, and other Directors to come up with ideas and suggestions to improve the service.  She appealed to her colleagues to promote the employment opportunities within Access-a-Ride in their Districts.

Director Hoy asked what the goal is for the Access-a-Cab program since the program is fairly similar to Access-a-Ride and how should the Board measure success.  Mr. Abel said that the goal is to grow the Access-a-Cab program and decrease the need for the Access-a-Ride program since the former one is more cost-effective.  Revenue hours were down 2% last year.

Director Menten asked for an explanation of the “assault” category on the Monthly Complaint Breakdown found on page 29 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.  Mr. Buter said assault is defined as unsolicited touching from operators to customers.  Both instances on the report referred to customers who, due to their disability, had problems controlling their arms or legs while the operator was attempting to secure the wheelchair.

Director Daly asked about the Access-a-Cab program in unincorporated areas.  Mr. Buter said most complaints of the Access-a-Cab program come from the suburbs and during games and concert time frames.

Director Folska agreed that cabs are hard to get in the suburbs.  She then asked about what could be done regarding ADA passengers that are passed up by bus operators. She shared from her experience that at first she didn’t know standing up was the cue for the operator to stop and maybe other customers don’t know to do this. She suggested the operators stop at any stop that has potential customers and ask if they need a ride.  Ms. Conover said that on most complaints, the passengers were not necessarily at the stop, but were inside the shelter, or behind the shelter.  Operators are addressed to look for passengers at the stop.  Mr. Abel added that it is not a practice for the operators to stop for customers who are not giving them the standing up cue for a ride. Director Folska asked how the paratransit complaints received are divided up between contractors and RTD employees.  Mr. Buter said 80% are from contractors and that at times there are complaints about policies. Director Folska asked then what could be done to improve the quality of training they receive.  Mr. Buter said the primary complaint is the lack of operators.

Committee Chair Solano said he had a few complaints of customers who were calling Access-a-Ride/Cab and couldn’t get to the Adams County Assembly to participate in the democratic process. Mr. Abel asked if there were any fixed routes serving the location of the assembly.  Committee Chair Solano replied that he didn’t think so since it is rural Adams County.  Mr. Abel noted that through ADA, Access-a-Ride operates in areas with fixed-route service.  Committee Chair Solano suggested that this policy may need to be addressed as well.

Director Deadwyler encouraged the staff to ensure the services offered by contractors are performed to RTD’s standards as our customers don’t know that the no show for Access-a-Cab is an independent contractor.

#### 5. 4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary

Mr. Abel introduced John Tarbert, Chief of Transit Police to the Committee.  He then referred the Directors to the 4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary found on page 33 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.

Director Hoy expressed how impressive it is to have 250,401 patrons checked for proper fare.

Director Tobiassen commented that the feedback continues to be positive for Aurora police officers traveling on the system and thanked Chief Tarbert for his work.

Director Lasater pointed out how on a recent personal light rail trip with his wife they were checked for fare both ways and how the officer was very cordial with two EcoPass users who had not validated their cards.  He noted they seemed to be foreign nationals and perhaps did not understand the process and asked what could be done to educate riders on this subject.  Chief Tarbert explained that his team is on an educational process timeline before starting to enforce the validating system.

#### 6. Light Rail Vehicle Procurement Update - Siemens Visit

Mr. Abel introduced Phil Eberl, Manager for Light Rail Vehicles (LVR) Maintenance, and Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, to the committee.  Mr. Eberl and Mr. Jenkins went through the presentation starting on page 37 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.  They also distributed a first conceptual design of the potential RTD vehicle to be constructed.

Director Tobiassen asked about bicycle accommodations.  Mr. Jenkins answered that at this point it is the current accommodations.

Director Lasater observed that the knee to back configuration may potentially preclude 50% of the ridership as he is aware of many people who can’t ride backwards and suggested a seat model where the backs could flip.  Mr. Jenkins noted other carriers have those kind of seats but isn’t sure that’s the model RTD would like to use as this may disorient some of the blind customers.  He said the actual configuration is not yet decided.

Director Daly double checked that the models have no bike racks and the storage is the same as current.  Mr. Eberl confirmed.

Director Hoy asked as to the advantage of knee to back seating as it doesn’t change capacity.  Mr. Eberl said it was a preference from staff and customers dealing with dirty seats.  Phil Washington, General Manager, added that the maintenance and service done to keep the seats clean is pretty significant as many people use the knee to knee configuration as foot rests.  Director Hoy asked how the cab size would increase.  Mr. Jenkins answered that the actual size is the same, but by configuring the operator seat in the middle it makes the cabin bigger and even adds space for an instructor seat.

Committee Chair Solano asked the Directors to refrain from cell phone use, including texting, during the meeting.

Director Walker asked about the weight capacity and type of seats. Mr. Jenkins replied the seats are 2 place bench seats with a thick cushion able to support up to 600 lbs. as they are also supported from the ceiling.

Director Menten asked about the savings per car.  During Director Menten’s question, Committee Chair Solano again asked the Directors to not use their cell phones during the meeting.  Mr. Eberl answered that RTD is saving 7% by requesting to build vehicles Siemens has already built before.  This percentage is under budget projections and any customization would bring the cost up.  He refrained from committing to solid numbers. Mr. Jenkins added the priority is a robust vehicle that is as “off the shelf” as possible.

Director Folska asked for the definition of “Made in America”.  Mr. Eberl answered that in order to be “Buy American” compliant, it has to be 60% built and/or assembled in the United States. Siemens imports the steel but it is completely built and assembled in Sacramento, CA, easily exceeding the compliance requirements.  Director Folska added that the Honorable Michael Bennett, United States Senator for Colorado, observed the need to market the “Made in America” status of our fleet.  Mr. Washington replied that his team is having those discussions.

##### a. Siemens visit board presentation 3-17-2014

#### 7. Smart Card Project Status Update

Mr. Abel introduced Judy McMurphy, Program Manager for Information Services, to the committee.  Ms. McMurphy gave an overview of the completed work at Sports Authority Field and the plan for validator installation at Auraria, Southmoor, 16th St & Stout, Orchard, and 27th & Welton.  The new configuration of the Smart Card would allow a contract to extend for 5 to 6 years with no need to recharge every year.  Her team continues to work with Xerox, the vendor, to determine a solution to resolve the capacity issue by analyzing rider habits, status of Smart Card recharges, passes on hold or suspended, etc.

Director Anderson asked Ms. McMurphy how RTD would know when someone drops out of college, graduates, changes jobs, passes away, etc.  Ms. McMurphy replied that the ride sponsors (company contracts) can access the platform to change the status of a card.  This card becomes “hot listed” and anyone riding with it will have it confiscated and be subject to a fine.  Mr. Abel stated that there’s an economic incentive to deactivate unnecessary cards as subsequent contracts are built on past card usage. He also told Director Anderson that these are some of the challenges his team is working through.

Chair Sisk said he was intrigued by the progress made and wondered how to read “going live”.  Chair Sisk asked how much of a delay is anticipated.  Ms. McMurphy hesitated to give a firm answer until she had more details and had a response from the vendor.  Chair Sisk appreciated the hesitation and not giving a firm date that could not be followed through.  Mr. Washington added that the capacity issue is the main factor on the delay and that he wanted his staff to be clear and transparent with the Board and outline the potential scenario of a delay.

Director Lasater asked as to the reasoning of a 6 year contract and how would a Smart Card user know if their card doesn’t work when validated.  Ms. McMurphy explained that validators are vocal with deactivated cards.  The system also displays a series of asterisk and a red light.  She added the 6 year time frame will help college students not having to go through the renew/recharge process if they take a break from school.  Management wise it is helpful because once it’s done there’s no need to do it again.

### D. Other Matters

Mr. Washington informed the Directors that the first Free MetroRide vehicle will be on display at 4:30 in front of the Blake building on Tuesday, March 25th.

Director Deadwyler reminded the Directors about the need for Access-a-Ride operators and to promote the employment opportunities within their Districts.

Director Daly attended the 2014 Awards Banquet of the Hispanic Contractors of Colorado with Chair Sisk, were Director Rivera-Malpiede received the Community Advocate Award.  He congratulated her on the recognition.

Committee Chair Solano reminded the Directors of the North Metro Ground Breaking on Thursday, March 20th and encouraged the Directors to attend.

Chair Sisk asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to remind the Directors about the basic guidelines during election season.  Ms. Lien reminded the Directors that the Fair Campaign Act prohibits the use of public funds to advance election efforts in any way.  This includes communication from RTD email; the use of RTD sponsored materials, such as postings, event tables, brochures; and the use of RTD expense funds.  The Directors may use the title RTD Director.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Solano adjourned to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee at 7:21 P. M.
