Subject:

Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for
an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190
(option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed
$107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term, $4,725,730 for
option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of $23,098,814 for the five year period.
This results in a total contract amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract
period and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and
responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide
“Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective on August 17, 2014.
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In January of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 24”. The Group 24 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under Contract Group 20,
and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to 14 firms
who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route services.
Proposals were due on February 26, 2014.
The Group 24 service offering consists of 110 buses operating 35 routes providing approximately
326,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 24 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 24 service package is currently operated by First Transit.
Implementation of Group 24 service is scheduled to be effective August 17, 2014. The award of
“Group 24” service to First Transit as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of providing
approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:
Two (2) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-003 for the Provision of Group 24 Public
Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, and MV Transportation.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 14-DH-003, that RTD award a contract for Group 24 fixed route transit service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications
and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Dean Shaklee, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Carolyn
Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Zamy Silva,
Manager, SBO; Amanda Murray, Civil Rights Specialist; and Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the two
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Qualifications.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in these
categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation. The
score for the “SBE plan and goal attainment” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD SBO
staff (both First Transit and MV Transportation met the SBE goal) and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and SBE score of each proposal to
determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in First Transit
being the highest rated proposal followed by MV Transportation. First Transit received an overall total
score of 93 (out of 100); MV Transportation received an overall total score of 87. It was the consensus
of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best proposal in terms of understanding of the
project, proposed management team, proposed organization/business plan/approach to deliver the
requested service.
First Transit was not the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period
between First Transit and MV Transportation was $66,047 or $13,209 per year. The overall rating
represents the evaluation process conclusion that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal
outweighed the strengths of the MV proposal. While the strengths of the MV Transportation proposal
included, experience with “Maximus” maintenance reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, the
MV Transportation proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of vehicle maintenance plan; facility
plan; personnel plan; and the recent/relevant experience (day to day operations) of the managers
proposed.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD
quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships
with Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service when
transitioning from the “Group 20” contract to the new “Group 24” contract. First Transit also proposed
very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and committed to obtaining the ASE
Blue Seal rating with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence by 2016. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
First Transit provides medical, dental, life, and short-term disability insurance for employees. First
Transit pays 100% of the cost of the employee-only premium for medical insurance and contributes

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

$100 per month toward the employee-plus-one benefit level, and $200 per month toward the family
benefit level. First Transit pays 100% of the cost for life insurance coverage for each full-time
employee, and 100% of the cost of the short-term disability plan for each full-time employee.
First Transit’s proposed first year price for “Group 24” is 6.8% lower than the current contract price of
the “Group 20” contract that it replaces. First Transit’s proposed hourly rates for the five-year period of
the proposed contract range from $60.06 (contract year 1) to $64.70 (contract year 5). The hourly
rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from $61.97-$69.48 (current contract year) to
$65.44-$69.48 (contract year 5). The total five-year proposed price represents a $29.6 million savings
over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the
recommended firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in
response to the RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of
technical, SBE and price issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and
communicated in the RFP document.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 24 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for First Transit’s provision of the services is included in First Transit’s Direct Service Cost as
shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted
2014 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MV Transportation, the second ranked proposer. This is not
recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation
process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 24 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 12, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

March 12, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 18, 2014

Subject:

4th Quarter
Analysis

2013

Customer

Complaint

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 4th Quarter of 2013. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2012.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding, and the goal for 2013 remains at .0003 complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 4th quarter of 2013, only RTD met the goal of .0003 complaints per passenger boarding. First
Transit Longmont had .0004 complaints per passenger boarding and First Transit Commerce City, First
Transit Denver, and Veolia all had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined
performance for all of the private contractors was .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The
combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.

Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2013, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 2013, the complaints in this category increased 18.8% compared to 2012. In
many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but running late. However, from the
passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in this category is 6.4 complaints per
day.
Bus Early – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 8.3% compared to 2012. Playbacks for
“bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible passengers see the prior bus
running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are addressed whenever the
CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The YTD average in this
category is 6.6 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 16

1.C.2

Bus Late – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 18.9% compared to 2012. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category is 12 complaints per day.

Careless Driving/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 25.4% compared to 2012.
On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks are performed to
determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private
contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their
buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and
retrained as needed to improve driving performance. The YTD average in this category is 4.2 complaints
per day.

Discourtesy/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 28.8% compared to 2012. In
the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints proves the operator not at fault. Video
evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and treated the customer with
respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare
payment, requesting space in the priority seating area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and
respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative manner. Operators are counseled and
disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate
manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling similar situations in the future. The YTD
average in this category is 10.8 complaints per day.

Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
2013, complaints in this category increased 11.2% compared to 2012. Investigation into
discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The total number of
discrimination-related complaints remains very small and the YTD average is 0.5 complaints per day.

Fare Dispute – For 2013, complaints in this category decreased 7.8% compared to 2012. It appears
passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares to be paid upon boarding.
Investigation into “fare dispute” complaints often shows passengers presented an improper/incomplete
fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The total number of
complaints remains low and the YTD average is 1.3 complaints per day.

Improper Procedure/Operator – For 2013, complaints in this category decreased 6.7% compared to
2012. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a regular basis to ensure
all operators are receiving consistent and accurate information. In addition, the recently completed ADA
refresher training provided information to remind operators of the procedures to follow to ensure
passengers in mobility devices are able to board the bus. In most cases, video evidence shows
operators are following proper procedures. The YTD average in this category is 7.3 complaints per day.

Packet Pg. 17

1.C.2

Incorrect Info/Operator –For 2013, complaints in this category increased 14.5% compared to 2012.
However, the total number of complaints in this category remains small and the YTD average is 0.5
complaints per day.

Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 2013, complaints in this category increased 10.5% compared to
2012. In many cases, playbacks for these complaints will confirm buses are on route and on time. It is
possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments
indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay
vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition,
operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed up due to the bus being
full. Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service Planning & Scheduling
Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will allow. The YTD average in this
category is 10.1 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th
Quarter 2013

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the fourth quarter of 2013 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 4th quarter. All of the three passenger accidents during the 4th quarter
were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct
proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 4th quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of 88.0% Local On-Time
Service in the 4th quarter. RTD is working with the private contractors to use the OTP report to
identify and campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The contractors also report that
they continue to experience route delays due to construction and detours. Increased passenger
loads and associated boarding delays also contribute to running behind schedule. The contractors
continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always tie safety to the
discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 4th quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING

Packet Pg. 21

1.C.3

The contractors, individually and as a group, did not meet the target of .0003 Complaints per
Boarding in the 4th quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to investigate and
address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance
and automatic vehicle location software to retrain operators on the importance of good customer
service and continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

4th Quarter Access-a-Ride Performance Report

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership decreased by 3% through the 4th quarter of 2013 compared to the same period
of 2012. Productivity decreased slightly from 1.25 to 1.24 passengers per hour. During the same
period, Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 18%. Total program ridership (Access-a-Ride plus Access-aCab) increased by 1% from 866,488 to 872,980 in 2013 as compared to YE 1012. The increased use
of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased passenger
trips without an increase in Access-a-Ride resources.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased slightly (approximately 2%) during the
fourth quarter of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 10% under budgeted revenue hours through the
fourth quarter of 2013.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the fourth quarter of 2013 decreased as compared to the same period in
2012. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue
meeting this standard of performance. Staff continues to work with our carriers to address operator
shortages.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the fourth quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period
in 2012. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of October, November, and December.
These tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare
evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police
officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare
evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
Work to install the new and improved network connectivity has been completed at Sports Authority
Field, and additional validators have been installed at 30th and Downing. Plans are in the works for the
platform validator installations at Southmoor, 16th and Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton.
Xerox has provided RTD with an estimated level of effort, schedule and cost for the following SMT Web
Portal Improvements:
 Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
 Increased search capabilities within the web portal
 Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.
 User Role enhancements that limit the actions a Web Portal user can access based on their job
responsibilities.
As of the end of February, 2014 over 84,000 CollegePasses have been reloaded with a contract
extension. Over 32,000 EcoPasses have been renewed. Plans are being made to extend the CollegePass
contract to 6 years with an automatic reload starting in May, 2014.
Through the College and EcoPass contract recharge/reload exercise a system constraint has been
identified in the Smart Media Technology. This limitation relates to the number of cards that the system
can process when a SmartCard needs to be deactivated, suspended, recharged or when a monthly
subscription needs to be placed on the card. In working with our vendor Xerox, we have identified
potential solutions to this issue; however the implementation of those solutions will delay the go-live of
MyRide Monthly Passes and Stored Value.
By March 21, 2014 Xerox will be providing cost and impact estimates for the following items:
A method by which we can increase the amount of memory on both bus and platform validators
Estimates for upgrading current validator versions to newer technology
The SMT Program Team has created a capacity model to help predict when an increase of card activity
may occur, which enables the team to transfer storage capacity within the system to accommodate
capacity requirements. The team has implemented this short-term measure as we await the estimates
from Xerox.

Status
The bus validator inventory has been completed. All but 2
validators were accounted for and the Mobile Technologies
Group continues to work to locate the 2 additional validators
which may be out for repairs.
A meeting took place on March 4th to begin planning for the
additional 4 platform validators to be installed at Southmoor,
16th 7 Stout, Orchard and 27th and Welton Street. Work is
targeted to begin the end of March or early in the month of
April.
In order to streamline the support of both the bus and
platform validator technology, responsibilities for both types
of validators have been assigned to separate teams. The
Mobile Technology Group will be responsible for
maintenance and repairs on the bus validators and the
Treasury technicians will maintain and support the platform
validators.
New Braille stickers have been designed with the assistance
from members of the Colorado Coalition for the Blind. The
new stickers are currently being manufactured and will be
placed on all the Platform Validators by RTD Treasury Team.
Two hundred sets if the new stickers were delivered to
Treasury on Friday, 3/7/14, and installation is planned to
begin the week of March 10, 2014.

We have reached an agreement with Xerox to implement a
series of Web Portal improvements in the areas of ticket
management, search and display functions, user roles and
ticket queues. These changes will be fully implemented,
tested and placed into the production environment in June
2014.
The functionality to upload large numbers of cards for easy
access by the web portal interface has been successfully
tested. The program administrators for the College/EcoPass
programs can now manage hundreds of cards at a time
instead of managing cards one at a time. This functionality
will streamline the SmartCard recharge process.

A formal process has been defined and documented that
covers a request for SmartCards to be used for internal
testing purposes. The development of this process creates
the auditability of SmartCards used to test equipment on
buses and at train stations, as well as perform tests on new
software elements.
A contract has been awarded to a new vendor that will
supply SmartCard media going forward. RTD, Xerox and G&D
are currently in the process of certifying RTD’s current
version of SmartCard Media to ensure that the card stock
works flawlessly with our SmartCard system.
