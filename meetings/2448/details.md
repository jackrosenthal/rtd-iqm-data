Committee Chair Anderson took the opportunity to recognize the passing of Cal Marsella, Former General Manager of RTD.  As stated by Director Sisk, Cal was really the father of FasTracks.  Committee Chair Anderson shared she had known Cal from the very beginning.  He started with Guide the Ride and when that did not pass he worked very hard and stood up to the opposition to get FasTracks passed.  She stated this year RTD is reaping the fruits of his labor.  She expressed that he would be missed and asked everyone to keep his family in their thoughts.

Director Bagley informed the Board that the contract negotiations with Interim General Manager Genova have been completed.  He said Directors would be receiving the completed contract in a confidential packet.  There will be an executive session during the March 29th Board Meeting, after which the Board will be asked to vote on the contract.

Director Bagley shared that he as General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Vice Chair, and Director Francone and Chair, have been very pleased to work with Interim General Manager Genova and his attorney over the last three and a half months.  He thinks collectively they have negotiated an excellent contract and knows Director Francone echoes those sentiments.  He reminded the Board that they are all still under a confidentiality agreement.

#### 1. Purchase of Six (6) Articulated Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK-001 in an amount not to exceed $4,127,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of six (6) additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.

It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $4,127,000 from the intercity bus procurement project to cover the cost of the requested 6 new articulated buses.

Motion:              Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, noted the 2016 Adopted Budget had funds included for the acquisition of additional intercity coaches.  He explained with the implementation of the Flatiron Flyer there have been service adjustments made to address some of the overloads, resulting in the implementation of a new Route, Route 90L.  This shift has resulted in the need for several more articulated buses as opposed to intercity buses.  He said staff is requesting a transfer of funds from the intercity bus procurement to cover the cost of the new articulated buses.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $72,700 in addition to the cost of the B and G Line commuter rail service cost as included in the Concession Agreement, and, further, to authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel asked Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, and Doug Monroe, B and G Line Service Planning and Scheduler, to join him to answer any questions.  He reminded the Board that the process for the Plan’s development, as well as the changes that have taken place through stakeholder and public outreach, have been reviewed during the last two Operations and Customer Service Committee Meetings.

Director Hoy noted there was no implementation date.  He asked when that would be.  Bruce Abel explained that an implementation date had not yet been determined.  That would be finalized as conversations continue with the Eagle P3 team.

Director Hoy pointed out there was no mention of the Route AB.  Jessie Carter reminded the Board that Route AB was part of the April, 2016 Service Changes and not part of the B and G Line Plan.  He said Route AB will be utilizing the Northwest Parkway as of April 24, 2016.

Committee Chair Anderson indicated she was very pleased with the plan as presented.  She thanked staff for restoring Route 92 in its entirety.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the University of Colorado in an amount not to exceed $2,157,000 for the purpose of distributing grant funds in order to fund the Anschutz Shuttle. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.

Motion:              Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel pointed out that the Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds are slightly different from the other Pass through Funds.  He said in the case of the other Pass through Funds RTD will receive the Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant funds and also provide service.  In the case of the Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds, RTD is the designated recipient but the University of Colorado (CU) will operate the shuttle.

Director Menten asked if CU will be accountable to RTD to provide ridership numbers.  Bruce Abel stated they will provide us with those numbers but are not accountable to RTD but to the FTA.  Director Menten wondered how many shuttles CU would run.  Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Service, said they would be purchasing four vehicles.

Director Hoy expressed his astonishment that while CU applied for the grant, RTD will get the money.  Bruce Abel explained that the FTA only recognizes one designated recipient in a given area.  Since RTD is the designated recipient, RTD gets the funds.

Director Hoy applauded CU for following-up on their promise to implement a shuttle.  He noted this was a big point of contention when they requested a realignment of the R-Line.

Director Lubow expressed her concern that after the grant expired in 2019 CU will continue paying for the shuttle.  She commented that often when service is provided through a grant, if the service meets are service standards we typically take over the funding at the end.  Bruce Abel indicated sometimes that does happen; however, RTD has made it very clear to CU that we have no obligations to take over the shuttle at the end of the grant funding.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 4. Motion to Group Pass Through Funds Together (Minus Anschutz)

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve all Pass through Funds, with the exception of the Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds, as one package.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 5. Approval of Pass Through Funds

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move all Pass through Funds to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 6. Route L Pass through Funds

This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match funds provided by Boulder County. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.

#### 7. Route 324 Pass through Funds

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with  the City of Longmont in an amount not to exceed $1,470,000 for RTD to provide expanded service on Route 324.

#### 9. Superior Call-n-Ride Pass through Funds

This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match funds from the City of Superior. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.

#### 10. Broomfield Call-n-Ride Pass through Funds

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with  the City and County of Broomfield in an amount not to exceed $527,000 for RTD to provide expanded Broomfield Call-n-Ride  service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match funds from the City and County of Broomfield. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.

#### 11. Construction Amendment for Contract 35 DP-003 – Platte Hoist Replacement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 35 DP-003 with Precision Construction Services for an additional $1,687,083, increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities, explained this was to replace in-ground hoists, or lifts, that have greatly deteriorated and become unsafe due to the original construction not including pit drainage.  He said with new lifts and technology, draining can now be added, which greatly improves the design.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 12. Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 11 DO-025 - Contract Amendment

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.

Motion:              Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Robin McIntosh explained this is merely a housekeeping item.  This simply allows RTD to extend our contract with our design firm to complete design work that was already approved in the Strategic Budget Plan.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 13. Construction Award for RFP 14 FH - 050 – Civic Center Renovation Project.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to award a contract to the most qualified proposer, Mortensen Construction, in the amount of $26,526,319.50 for the Civic Center Renovation project. Additionally, the Interim General Manager shall be authorized to issue contract amendments within the approved budget of $30,882,564.

Motion:              Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Robin McIntosh shared his excitement over this recommendation as the Civic Center Renovation is long overdue.  The procurement process began in 2014 with a Request for Qualifications.  RTD received two bids for the project.  It is staff’s opinion that Mortensen Construction meets all qualifications and is within budget.

Director Deadwyler noted the contract would be for about $26.5 million but the Interim General Manager would be authorized to spend up to $30.8 million.  She wondered why there was a difference.  Robin McIntosh explained that $30.8 million was approved for this project in the Strategic Budget Plan, so staff is asking for authorization to enter into contract amendments up to the approved budget amount in the event of any unforeseen circumstances.

Director Lasater pointed out that many of the riders from his District are dropped off at Civic Center.  He shared they are excited but they are also concerned about where they will be displaced during construction.  He hopes staff can alert everyone where they will be dropped off and picked up well in advance of construction.  Richard Rost, Manager of Facilities Engineering, indicated there is a plan that was submitted to the City and County of Denver but staff is awaiting final approval.  He stated all stops would be within a block of the station and riders would be notified well in advance.

Director Sisk shared he is very familiar with Mortensen and thinks they do great work.  He expressed concern that the bid came in at $4 million under budget yet staff is asking the Board to give the Interim General Manager authorization to spend that $4 million anyway.  Richard Rost stated that staff does not expect to spend the additional funds; however, staff wants to be able to act expeditiously if there are any unforeseen circumstances as the goal is to have Civic Center closed for only one year.

Interim General Manager Genova explained this is similar to what has been done on other FasTracks projects.  The additional funds would not be used for any enhancements.  Staff just wants to ability to keep the project moving forward in the event of unforeseen circumstances.

Director Folska inquired if the Scope of Work included the requirement for the architecture to support smart technology.  Interim General Manager Genova indicated the project had the same design criteria as Denver Union Station with the incorporation of the lessons learned from that project.  It would be very similar in design and capability.

Director James wondered what would happen to any remaining funds if the project came in under the $30.8 million budgeted.  Interim General Manager Genova stated those funds would be reallocated to other projects or activities.

Director James expressed his appreciation to staff for working with the community on this project.  He believes RTD has an opportunity to be a catalyst for transformation of that location, as it is an area that has had its problems in the past.

Director Deadwyler pointed out that every project has a contingency built into its cost.  She thinks the contingency built into the $26.5 million should cover any unforeseen circumstances versus needing an additional $4 million.  Richard Rost explained there was no contingency included in the contractors bid of $26.5 million.

Director Menten asked for more information about the parcel that would be preserved for development opportunities along Colfax.  She wondered about the size of the parcel.  Richard Rost said it was approximately 300 by 100 feet.  Interim General Manager Genova shared that RTD does not own the parcel so it will not be up to us as to how the parcel is developed.

Committee Chair Anderson shared that she is happy to see Civic Center being renovated.  She said it is a very scary place sometimes.  She understands Director Sisk’s concerns as you expect to have a firm price but she can also understand staff’s concerns that there might be something lurking underground.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

#### 6. Lost Service Hours Update

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that beginning in October of last year the lost service hours began to climb very dramatically due to our labor shortages.  He pointed out that the February lost service hours were horrible, climbing from 400 hours in January to over 900 hours in February.  He noted about 440 of those hours were directly related to the February snow storm so a more apples to apples comparison would be about 529 hours of lost service.

Bruce Abel shared that as of today staff is projecting the lost service hours to greatly improve for March; however, RTD is still having to mandate forced overtime for operators.  He said the real success will be when lost service hours are down without forced overtime.  He indicated the contractors have really stepped up their efforts in the last several months as well by increasing signing and referral bonuses and improving wages.

Director Lubow asked how no show buses are tracked in terms of lost service hours.  Bruce Abel explained there were two categories tracked.  One is a delayed pull out and the other is not being able to cover a run at all.  If a run is eight hours but a driver for the run is found after 50 minutes, then it counts as 50 minutes of lost service.  If a route is eight hours and no driver is found then it counts as 8 hours of lost service.

Director Bagley requested that staff continue to provide this report for the next few months.

##### a. Lost Service Hours Update

#### 7. Recruitment Update

Bruce Abel stated the bottom line is that we are seeing an increase in applicant intakes.  Bus Operations is seeing the size of classes they were hoping to see.  He recognized that Human Resources has been working very hard and he hopes we will be able to continue the trend.

##### a. Recruitment Update 3 9 16

### D. Other Matters

Director Menten wondered if any information had been provided to the Board as to the cause of the Light Rail accident several months ago at the Littleton-Mineral Station.  Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, said it was determined the accident was due to operator error.  Director Menten asked if there were any safety features staff was considering adding to prevent a similar accident.  She also inquired as to the cost of the accident.  Terry Emmons shared there were several systems staff was considering such as a signaling system that could slow a train at end-of-line.  He said the cost of the accident was close to $1 million.

Director Bagley said that as many are aware, recently the entire rail system in Washington, D.C. had to be unexpectedly shut down for a whole day due to electrical programs.  He believes this demonstrates the significance of maintaining the State of Good Repair.  He is happy to see staff take our State of Good Repair very seriously.

Director Folska shared that several Directors were in D.C. for the closure during the APTA Legislative Conference.  She said it was complete chaos.  She stated that RTD is fortunate for having staff that make sure we are in a State of Good Repair.

Bruce Abel said he had some exciting statistics to provide on the Flatiron Flyer performance.  In January, 2012, buses to Boulder carried about 8,600 to 8,700 people per day.  With the Flatiron Flyer opening in January, 2016, we are now carrying nearly 14,500 people per day with only a 5-10% increase in revenue hours of service.  He noted a number of Directors have received comments regarding the overcrowding.  Staff did respond rapidly by creating a special service for the Westminster Park-n-Ride.  He stated this was a stopgap measure but since then permanent changes were approved in the April Service Change package.  He shared that we can only do so much immediately so there is still some overcrowding, but overall this is the kind of problems staff likes to have.  He believes overall we are accomplishing what we set out to do which is improve the level of service to this region.

Director Folska thinks it is amazing that we raised fares and only increased service by 5-15% but have an increase in ridership of 45%.  She wonders if we can extrapolate these results to the rest of the District.  She asked if it was possible if we provided more frequent and reliable service if ridership would then increase.  Bruce Abel indicated that if we had the funds to provide this level of service everywhere he anticipates ridership would increase.

Director Hoy recognized staff for the wonderful job they have done with the opening of the Flatiron Flyer.  He expressed that while there have been challenges, staff has reacted immediately.  He thinks they have done a remarkable job.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 6:39 p.m.
