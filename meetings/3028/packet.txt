Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe: We
will strive to keep our communities connected and our riders,
employees and region healthy and safe.

#2

DRAFT COVID-19
BUDGET
REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES.

Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be
creative: We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions
and do so in such a way as to align with our mission. Accordingly,
service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded
approach by incorporating reductions in overhead, breaking down
silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative approaches to
service delivery.

#3
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit
during the pandemic: We will strive to maximize mobility during the
pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services
to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.

Packet Pg. 8

#4
We will support and value all of our employees. We acknowledge
our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the
public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We
also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage
categories, because a humane work environment is valued by
RTD.

#5

DRAFT COVID-19
BUDGET
REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES.

Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and
expertise: We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to
decision-making for the COVID period, while planning for the midterm financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through
the Re-Imagine project, the accountability committee, and
stakeholders.

#6
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input: We will take active
measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of
CARES Act money as well as in the decision-making process for
measures we adopt to respond to ongoing COVID financial
impacts.
