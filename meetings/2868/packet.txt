RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors adopt
the 2019 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title
VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:






Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership
Core Goal #2 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #2 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods

BACKGROUND
Pursuant to Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply
with 49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of
1964 (Title VI), as a condition of federal financial assistance. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the
basis of race, color and national origin from recipients of federal financial assistance (grants, loans, etc.).
DISCUSSION
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration
Recipients, RTD is required to submit a Title VI Program Update every three years. The Title VI Program
Update details the manner in which RTD intends to achieve compliance with the following objectives of
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964:
1. To ensure that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are equitably
distributed without regard to race, color, or national origin;
2. To ensure that the level and quality of FTA-assisted transit services are sufficient to provide equal
access and mobility for any person without regard to race, color or national origin;
3. To ensure that opportunities to participate in the transit planning and decision-making are
provided to persons without regard to race, color or national origin;
4. To ensure that decisions on the location of transit services and facilities are made without regard
to race, color or national origin; and

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

5. To ensure that corrective and remedial action is taken to prevent disparate impacts borne by any
beneficiary based on race, color, or national origin.
The update itself includes an Executive Summary and is an attachment to the board report. For the sake
of simplicity and efficiency, staff has not included previously approved policies documents due to the
high volume of pages (100+ pages), but these items may be requested from Michael Washington.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2019 Title VI Program Update does not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the recommended action by the Operations and Customer Service Committee. It is
recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the 2019 Title VI Program Update to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines
related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
2) Do not accept the recommended action by the Operations and Customer Service Committee. This
action is not recommended as it is against federal law and would jeopardize current and future
federal funding.

Title VI Program Update 2019

EXCUTIVE SUMMARY

Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order
12898 (Environmental Justice).
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity
receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive
Order 12898, which states that each federal
agency “shall make achieving environmental
justice part of its mission by identifying and
addressing disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects of its
programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA)
Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA
financial assistance with instructions for
achieving compliance with Title VI and
Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires that RTD document measures taken to comply
with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI Program to their FTA regional civil rights
officer once every three years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
In this Title VI program update, the Transit Oriented Communities Division has compiled a
documentation of compliance efforts made from June of 2016 – April of 2019. Below is an overview of
the collection of documents and information that comprise the 2019 Title VI Program Update.

Denver Local (bus and rail) and Limited Bus service is primarily utilized by minority and low-income
populations.

For detailed information pertaining to the District’s minority and low-income populations. Demographic
Profile Maps and Customer Satisfaction Survey data are included in appendix to this document.

COMPLAINTS
Federal recipients are also required to directly accept, log and investigate complaints of discrimination.
Further, recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complain and the procedures for
processing their complaint.
RTD has seen an increase in the frequency of complaints in the last two years. In the appendix is a copy
of the Title VI public notice placed on all RTD vehicles, and a table summarizing complaints received
and their status (open, closed, etc…).
To address the increase in complaints, RTD will explore the development of an equity training program.
The goal of the program is to provide customer facing employees with the cultural competency and
awareness necessary to enhance the customer experience for all.

SUBRECIPIENT
RTD’s sub-recipients of federal financial assistance must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964. To meet its enforcement responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a subrecipient monitoring process.
The RTD Title VI Manager will ensure the following actions are taken affirming that RTD and its subrecipients comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year sub-recipients must provide RTD with an FTA Civil Rights Assurance/Signed Assurance
that all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have been or will be
compiled, as appropriate, and maintained;
2. Each sub-recipient must implement a Title VI complaint process and provide RTD with a list of
active lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race,
color or national origin;
3. Each sub-recipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous and
accessible locations throughout its facilities;
4. Sub-recipients must take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services,
information, and other important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are
Limited English Proficient (LEP).

Page 4

Attachment: 2019 Title VI Program Update (Complete) (3816 : 2019 Title VI Program Update)

Since the 2016 Title VI Program Update, the minority population has grown in the entire service area in
number and proportion. The City and County of Denver is the only county that has seen a reduction in the
proportion of their minority population. The Hispanic/Latino population has grown most significantly.

1.B.1.b

In general, sub-recipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous
opportunities for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic, and environmental
impacts of proposed transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in
public involvement activities can include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at
all stations and in all vehicles, and measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural,
economic, historical, or other barriers that may prevent minority and low-income populations from
effectively participating in a recipient’s decision-making. Sub-recipients must file with RTD
documentation of its public participation plan.
Each sub-recipient further agrees to comply with, and assure compliance by its third party subcontractors
at any tier under the Project, with all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular
4702.1B and 49 CFR 21.5(b)(2) and 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), Appendix C to 49 CFR Part 21.

PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE
Included in this Title VI Program Update are an updated Public Participation Plan and Language
Assistance Plan. These plans detail how RTD engages minority populations, low-income populations, and
populations that are LEP. The Public Participation Plan also describes RTD’s approach to achieving
diversity on its non-elected advisory committee(s). These plans are included in the appendix.

SERVICE STANDARDS AND TRANSIT MONITORING
FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of Urbanized Areas with a
population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service to ensure service is
provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective decisionmaking in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to
ensure service is provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Service is monitored by comparing a sampling
of non-minority routes and minority routes, defined as 1/3 of revenue mileage borders census blocks with
a minority population greater than the service area average.
No disparities were found during the transit monitoring of this reporting period. The detailed transit
monitoring results can be found in the appendix.

FARE AND SERVICE CHANGE EQUITY ANALYSIS
The FTA requires RTD to establish policies that will guide the analysis to determine whether major
service changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations.
Accordingly, RTD established equity analysis policies and a service evaluation process to meet this
requirement.

EQUITY ANALYSIS POLICIES

In the development of the equity policies, RTD sought public feedback on the disparity and
disproportionate burden thresholds through a series of public meetings. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. MAJOR SERVICE CHANGE POLICY:
A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in the service hours of
any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major service changes
will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments,
rerouting an existing route, and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of
adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.
2. SERVICE DISPARATE IMPACT POLICY:
A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10 percent more than
non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact
3. SERVICE DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN POLICY:
A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income population 10 percent more than
non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. A lowincome population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of
Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
4. FARE DISPARATE IMPACT AND DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN POLICY:
Per the policy, the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income persons
as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater
than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership.
If a proposed major service change or fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate
burden, RTD will consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the
modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less
discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification
for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Page 6

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: 2019 Title VI Program Update (Complete) (3816 : 2019 Title VI Program Update)

Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy, and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity.

EQUITY ANALYSES COMPLETED

1. May 2019 Service Change
2. 2019 Fare Change
3. January 2018 Service Change
4. August 2018 Service Change
Each proposed service and fare change were evaluated for equity impacts prior to Board approval.

CONCLUSION
An equitable public transit system is a fair transit system, where services, resources, benefits, and impacts
are distributed with respect to transit demand, not race, color, national origin or income status. Staff seeks
to not only comply with these civil rights laws, but to enhance efforts to guarantee fairness in the delivery
of RTD’s services.
Below are the key initiatives to occur during the 2019 – 2022 reporting period include:




Transit Equity Training Program - Enhance inclusivity through cultural competency and implicit
bias training; prioritizing executive management, senior management and customer facing
employees
Preliminary Fare Equity Analysis: Cashless Fare System – an analysis of the equity implications
of implementing a cashless fare system



Inclusive Decision-Making Framework: Develop a set of policies and practices to facilitate full
public participation in major decisions (e.g. long range plans, service changes, fare changes,
policy development)



Internal Equity Taskforce: a cross-departmental assembly of internal leaders, focused on
identifying and responding to opportunities to promote equitable transit.



Safety and Security Community Relations Plan: build a trusting relationship with community;
inform safety and security policies and practices with community feedback



Language Assistance: engage communities to determine which language assistance tools and
practices can best ensure access to our services

During this reporting period, RTD performed extensive public engagement, completed several equity
analyses for major fare and service changes. This snapshot summarizes RTD’s effort to not only
comply with the requirements of FTA Circular 4702.1B, but to advance social equity through policy
and public engagement.

Title VI Program Update 2019

Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit
service in the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order
12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations
by submitting a Title VI Program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as
otherwise directed by FTA.
Included in this Title VI Program Update are a revised Public Participation Plan. This plans detail how
RTD engages minority populations, low-income populations, and populations that are LEP. The Public
Participation Plan also describes RTD’s approach to achieving diversity on its non-elected advisory
committee(s).

PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT OVERVIEW
As a federally funded public transit agency, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) works to
ensure that we are engaging our stakeholders in an authentic manner. We understand that many of our
riders are transit depend and rely solely on the service we provided. Our intention is to meet the riders
where they are, where they live and where they work, a tenet of RTD. As an agency, we are collectively
moving in a direction that meets stakeholders where they are so that we can fully understand their needs,
to provide the best service with the most benefit. We will do this by engaging all stakeholders,
specifically our most vulnerable and underserved populations, in the public decision-making process. As
an agency, we want to ensure that we are moving in a direction that builds, establishes and maintains trust
amongst all our stakeholders. Our future is in the direction of equity in transit, to be a catalyst for
leadership in the engagement of minority and low-income populations.

Title VI Program Update 2019

The agency’s objective is to establish a more robust public engagement strategy with the ultimate goal of
forging positive new relationships and strengthening existing relationships with riders and stakeholders.
Each year, RTD sees nearly 105 million passenger boardings in a 2,340-square-mile service area—one of
the largest in the United States—and serves 2.87 million citizens in 40 municipalities in the diverse
counties of Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Jefferson, Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas and Weld. Our riders and
stakeholders depend on us to keep them informed of new technology, proposed service changes and major
policy decisions.
Involved in this agency-wide effort are bus and train operators; fare enforcement officers; service
planners; marketing executives; urban planners; project engineers; sustainability strategists; customer care
agents; other civil rights managers (Americans with Disabilities Act, Equal Employment Opportunity);
event planners; public relations staff; senior managers and the RTD Board of Directors.
RTD’s Title VI program will also play a leading role in this effort by identifying, reaching out to and
working with transit-dependent communities, including low-income riders, communities of color and
limited English proficiency (LEP) communities living and working in all eight counties served by the
RTD transit system.
This document outlines our target audiences, departments responsible for informing and engaging with
the public, and existing and desired public outreach strategies we hope to implement over the next several
years.

As an agency, RTD works to incorporate effective, responsive public engagement into its core mission of
providing safe, clean, efficient, affordable and reliable bus and rail service to all passengers. Our 15member Board of Directors, senior managers and employees play a critical role in responding as quickly
as possible to the questions, concerns and transit needs of the entire region. Engaging effectively with
riders, stakeholders and the public through our decision-making processes and day-to-day services are
important goals.

EXISTING PUBLIC OUTREACH
PUBLIC RELATIONS AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DIVISION
Public Relations responds to formal (open record) and informal requests for information from the news
media, the general public, elected officials and other stakeholders about RTD operations. The department
takes the lead on strategic communication and public outreach to advance the RTD name, brand and
reputation and develops crisis communication strategies. Public Relations and Community Engagement
plan, organize and staff dozens of annual and special public events and gives public presentations around
the Denver metro region. They produce magazine stories for transportation trade publications; newspaper
op-ed pieces; speeches; talking points for media spokespeople; fact sheets; communication plans; news
releases; media advisories; blog columns; web content; e-blasts; invitations; video scripts and
storytelling; newsletters; and other communication collateral designed to relay essential messages to
employees, board directors, senior managers, stakeholders, riders and the general public. They also act as
communication liaisons for all RTD divisions—including public engagement support for Civil Rights and
the Transit-Oriented Development Divisions.

MARKETING
The RTD Marketing department oversees the creation of all advertising, marketing and public outreach
materials for PR, PI and other departments, and develops effective messaging to keep the public,
stakeholders, employees and the RTD Board of Directors apprised of all important agency initiatives.
Marketing is also highly involved in promotional special events related to RTD anniversaries, rider
appreciation events, station parties along new transit corridors and the openings of new transit facilities. It
oversees customer satisfaction and market research, and leads efforts to improve RTD’s Nonprofit
Program, which provides millions of dollars’ worth of free and reduced fares for nonprofits serving lowincome, homeless and other transit-dependent riders. Marketing account executives work closely with
other RTD departments to produce or order brochures, posters, maps, fliers, promotional giveaways and
other print materials that help the agency keep the public informed of all initiatives. The department also
leads digital marketing efforts such as the maintenance and updating of the RTD website, blogs, and the
agency’s social media channels, communicates directly with riders and stakeholders through a database,
and leads public communication efforts on technology rollouts.

Customer Care oversees RTD’s telephone information center, where dozens of employees answer
telephone calls every day from riders and others seeking information about the agency’s fares, services
and policies. Customer Care agents are available 6 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. on weekends and holidays. The agency’s customer service representatives are at the frontline of
RTD’s efforts to keep the public informed of its operations, FasTracks projects, technology, service hours
and many other issues.

SERVICE PLANNING
Service Planning oversees the scheduling of all bus and rail operations for the RTD system. The division
reaches out to the public three times a year (and more when new transit corridors open) when it is
planning system-wide and targeted service changes. Federal regulations require that RTD notify the
public of proposed service changes when they affect 25 percent or more of a service route’s hours.
Service Planning’s approach to public engagement entails public meetings in communities where service
changes are under consideration. The division also schedules meetings at RTD headquarters at noon and
again at 6 p.m. to give citizens who work in the downtown area opportunities to offer input on proposed
service changes. RTD is required to advertise public meetings two weeks before they take place. RTD is
required to notify the public of service changes six weeks before they go into effect. Upon request,
Service Planning provides interpretation for Spanish speakers and the deaf and hard-of-hearing. The
division works closely with marketing to publicize public meetings in local newspapers and via trans-flux
window clings hung in all RTD vehicles. The division also notifies local municipalities of proposed
service changes, which is a requirement of Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations.

SPECIAL SERVICES
This department within the Service Planning Division is responsible for working with the public to ensure
RTD meets the needs of passengers with disabilities through its Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.
The Special Services manager engages with the public regularly and proactively and upon request by
advocacy groups that want to ensure RTD is complying with federal ADA requirements.

BUS STOP PROGRAM
This program works with a coalition of groups advocating for the blind when it comes to ensuring that
signs posted at bus stops and stations are ADA compliant. Program managers vet proposed new signs
with these groups and incorporate their feedback into new designs before RTD posts signs for existing
and new services.

TRANSIT-ORIENTED COMMUNITIES DIVISION
This Planning Department engages in public engagement through its Transit-Oriented Communities
(TOC) Division to ensure RTD is compliant with federal regulations designed to incorporate the needs

CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION
The Civil Rights Division is highly involved with public engagement through its Small Business Office
(SBO) and its Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Manager’s Office. The SBO oversees the
division’s monthly Disadvantaged and Small Business Enterprise Advisory Council (DBEAC) meeting,
where RTD staff network with the small businesses that are contractors on projects and/or provide
maintenance services to RTD through its procurement office. Civil Rights staff attends local, regional and
national networking events to stay abreast of industry trends, issues and regulations and hosts its own
events to keep the community informed of RTD’s efforts to support and advance the success of small
businesses—and communities and individuals in the process—across the district. The division’s ADA
Manager’s Office oversees RTD’s compliance with Title‘s I & II of the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA). In addition to these efforts the ADA office also assists with proactive efforts through public
information and collaboration, complementary paratransit service, and accessibility to
vehicles/facilities/transit. This includes the newly created RTD Advisory Committee for People with
Disabilities and Access-a-Ride Paratransit Advisory Committee. As members for these committees are
selected, RTD will seek to recruit a diverse representation of the community.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OFFICE
The RTD Board of Directors is a publicly elected governing board whose members serve four-year terms
up to two terms in a row. Members represent RTD’s 15 districts across the eight-county Denver
metropolitan region. The board interacts with the public regularly during its weekly public meetings, at
special events and on a one-on-one basis with community, business and trade groups, stakeholders and
individual constituents. Members also submit op-ed pieces to local newspapers, give speeches at special
events, and respond to public inquiries at board meetings

RTD ADVISORY BOARDS AND COMMITTEES
RTD believes in and is committed to the public involvement process including the use of community
advisory committees, panels and boards. Each advisory group is tailored to meet the specific needs of its
program or activity. During the formation of these advisory groups, RTD consistently seeks participation
from minorities by directly soliciting organizations which represent minorities. Currently, RTD appoints
members of the public to the following advisory groups/committees.

and viewpoints of communities of color and low-income and LEP communities. Staff members excel at
articulating public impact issues surrounding the planning, construction and implementation of new
transit corridors and are highly involved with policy development and other efforts geared toward
layering public input into their decision-making process. As an example, the Planning Division oversaw
RTD’s most recent Pass Program Study, which included management of the Pass Program Working
Group and the development of the final fare change proposal. Included in that process was a robust public
engagement process that included numerous public meetings in every quadrant of the RTD region.

PASS PROGRAM WORKING GROUP
In September of 2015 the Board of Directors instructed Staff to form a Pass Program Working Group
(PPWG) to help comprehensively review and recommend changes to pass programs in collaboration with
the Affordable Fares Taskforce. The working group included members of RTD staff and external
stakeholders representing schools, businesses, municipalities, neighborhood groups and advocacy
organizations. The Board approved the following guiding principles to focus the working group: brand
loyalty, convenience, cost-effectiveness, equitable access, increased ridership, an ability to meet strategic
budget plan targets, revenue certainty and simplifying rider-operator interactions.
RTD convened 12 full working group meetings in twelve months. RTD advertised each working group
meeting to the public, inviting public comment at the beginning of each meeting to help inform the
working group as they developed their recommendations.
The group formulated several options, all of which were modeled by a consultant for their impact on total
fare revenue and ridership. After reaching consensus, staff provided an overview of the group’s
recommendation to the Board in March of 2018.
Working group members were selected for their connection to region-wide questions/interest
groups/constituencies and their ability to bring a big-picture view of the pass program questions. They
were selected for their level of interest in these questions and the depth of their experience with RTD.

RTD PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT: NEXT STEPS
It is an exciting time for RTD as we pursue new and innovative transportation solutions to meet the needs
of the region. New long-range planning initiatives (Transportation Transformation), adaptations to
FlexRide operations, and partnerships with private and public transportation interests are great initiatives
catalyzing major changes for RTD. These initiatives also come with the risk of unintentional and
unjustifiable, exclusion based on race, color, national origin and income status. RTD will mitigate this
risk by developing a practice of inclusive decision-making.
The Planning Department will lead the development of an Inclusive Decision-Making Framework. This
framework will establish a policy and set of practices that seek to include and consult the full spectrum of
the public before the district makes critical decisions. Critical decisions include policies, projects, and any
activity that has the potential to significantly impact (beneficially or adversely) the communities we serve.
Through an Inclusive Decision-Making Framework, we can reap the following benefits:
1. Collective Understanding – The community and RTD empathize with one another, understanding
an initiative from both perspectives, beyond the limitations of quantitative data
2. Managed Expectations – The community learns the limitations of RTD and understand how well
specific solutions may address community needs

Title VI Program Update 2019

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., provides that no person in the United
States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity that receives
Federal financial assistance. The Supreme Court, in Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563 (1974), interpreted Title
VI regulations promulgated by the former Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to hold that
Title VI prohibits conduct that has a disproportionate effect on Limited English Proficient (LEP) persons
because such conduct constitutes national origin discrimination.
Individuals, who have a limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English are Limited English
Proficient, or ‘‘LEP.” Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited
English Proficiency,” reprinted at 65 FR 50121, August 16, 2000 directs each Federal agency to examine
the services it provides and develop and implement a system by which LEP persons can meaningfully
access those services. Federal agencies were instructed to publish guidance for their respective recipients
in order to assist them with their obligations to LEP persons under Title VI. The Executive Order states
that recipients must take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to their programs and activities by
LEP persons.
The U.S. Department of Transportation published revised guidance for its recipients on December 14,
2005. This document states that Title VI and its implementing regulations require that DOT recipients
take responsible steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services, information, and other
important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are Limited English Proficient
(LEP) and that recipients should use the DOT LEP Guidance to determine how best to comply with
statutory and regulatory obligations to provide meaningful access to the benefits, services, information,
and other important portions of their programs and activities for individuals who are LEP.
The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) references the DOT LEP guidance in its Circular 4702.1B,
“Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients,” which took effect on October 1, 2012.
Chapter III part 9 of this Circular reiterates the requirement to take responsible steps to ensure meaningful
access to benefits, services, and information for LEP persons and suggests that FTA recipients and sub
recipients develop a language implementation plan consistent with the provisions of Section VII of the
DOT LEP Guidance.
RTD’s provision of language assistance to persons with limited in English proficiency in a competent and
effective manner will help ensure services are safe, reliable, convenient, and accessible to those persons.
These efforts may attract riders who would otherwise be excluded from utilizing services because of
language barriers and, ideally, will encourage riders to continue using the system after they are proficient
in English and/or have more transportation options.
Providing language assistance to LEP persons may also help increase and retain ridership among the
RTD’s broader immigrant communities in two important ways:

Page 41

BACKGROUND

1.B.1.b

Title VI Program Update 2019
1. Reaching out to recent immigrant populations in order to conduct a needs assessment and prepare
a language implementation plan (pursuant to the DOT LEP Guidance) will send a positive message
to these persons that their business is valued.

Additionally, conducting outreach to LEP persons can increase the potential for recruiting bilingual
employees to better serve the needs of the RTD service area. In summary, serving the needs of LEP
persons is not only a good business decision; it fulfills the mission of the district to serve the public.
Regional Transportation District (RTD) supports the goals of the DOT LEP Guidance to provide
meaningful access to its services by LEP persons. RTD has devoted significant resources to provide oral
and written language assistance services to LEP individuals. A substantial effort to provide meaningful
access to LEP populations has been underway for several years. This document describes how RTD will
continue to provide meaningful access to its transit services.

MONITORING AND UPDATING THE LAP
The DOT guidance also states that recipients should, where appropriate, have a process for determining,
on an ongoing basis, whether new documents, programs, services, and activities need to be made
accessible for LEP individuals, and they may want to provide notice of any changes in services to the
LEP community and their employees. RTD believes that the size of the service area, consistent changes in
demographics and frequency of changes to transit services warrants regular reassessment of this
Language Assistance Plan (LAP).
RTD is revising a basic information webpage so LEP persons can access vital documents such as safety
information, fare purchase information, service changes, and safety and security information.
Additionally, RTD is in the process of creating “How to Ride” guides which will explain how to utilize
RTD’s services in a step-by-step manner. The guides will be created in multiple languages and available
to the public to ensure meaningful access by LEP persons.
RTD intends to explore the provision of cultural competency training for staff to address the potential for
harm to LEP persons due to linguistic and cultural barriers. Trainings will target topics such as cultural
competency and implicit bias to prevent discrimination on the basis of national origin.
In 2019 RTD will conduct a Customer Satisfaction Survey which will estimate the percentage of
boardings represented by LEP persons. Through the survey, riders who speak a language other than
English at home also rate how well they speak English.
As previously mentioned, continued market research is essential to the effectiveness of this plan. On an
annual basis, RTD will revisit the demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau, the State of
Colorado, community organizations and LEP persons in an effort to remain in tune with the needs of LEP
populations.

2. Community outreach designed to identify appropriate language assistance measures can also assist
RTD in identifying the transportation needs of immigrant and linguistically isolated populations
ensuring that transit routes, hours and days of service, and other service parameters are responsive
to the needs of these populations.

FOUR FACTOR ANALYSIS

I.
II.
III.
IV.

Identify the proportion of LEP Persons in RTD’s Service Area
Determine the Frequency of Contact by LEP Persons with RTD Services
Determine the Nature and Importance of Transit
Assess the Current Resources and the Costs to Provide Language Assistance Services

RTD has conducted the Four-Factor analysis using a combination of market research resources which
consists of an evaluation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, interviews with RTD staff, consultation
with Colorado State agencies, consultation with community organizations and direct interactions with
people limited in English proficiency. The results of this analysis will be used as the criteria for the
development of the appropriate mix of language assistance measures to be employed by RTD.

FACTOR I. IDENTIFICATION OF LEP INDIVIDUALS IN RTD SERVICE AREA
WHO NEED LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE
DOT Guidance: “There should be an assessment of the number or proportion of LEP individuals eligible to be served
or encountered and the frequency of encounters pursuant to the first two factors in the four-factor analysis.
An assessment of the number or proportion of LEP individuals eligible to be served by RTD is an
important first step. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, of the 2,8 million people in the RTD service
area, approximately 228,180, over 8% of the RTD service area population, speaks English “less than very
well”3. The following points identify other notable findings from the assessment of the number and
proportion of LEP persons in the RTD Service Area:






Approximately 329,000 persons, over 11% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign
born.
Approximately 486,000 persons, over 17% of the RTD service area population, speak a language
other than English at home.
West Denver, CO, East Lakewood, CO and Northwest Aurora, CO have the highest concentrations
of LEP persons, containing multiple census tracts with LEP Populations exceeding 2,000.
Overwhelming, Spanish speakers represent the largest population of LEP persons in the RTD
Service Area and the State of Colorado.
High rates of refugee resettlement are increasing the population of LEP persons and diversity of
languages spoken in the RTD service area.

Overall, this assessment has revealed an increase in the amount of languages reaching the Safe Harbor
Threshold of 1,000 LEP persons. Accordingly, RTD will translate its vital documents into each language

Title VI Program Update 2019

DOT Guidance: “Recipients should assess, as accurately as possible, the frequency with which they have or should
have contact with LEP individuals from different language groups seeking assistance, as the more frequent the
contact, the more likely enhanced language services will be needed. The steps that are reasonable for a recipient
that serves an LEP person on a one-time basis will be very different than those expected from a recipient that serves
LEP persons daily.

RTD has collected general information regarding the frequency in which LEP individuals come in contact
with RTD services. For purposes of this assessment, the following data sources were used to estimate the
frequency of encounters by LEP persons with RTD services:




Customer Satisfaction Survey Data
Telephone Information Center Data
Website Visitation Data
LEP Survey

RTD TELEPHONE INFORMATION CENTER DATA
RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC) is one of many ways RTD fulfills its commitment to
providing quality customer service to all of its potential transit users. RTD’s TIC has 47 full-time
Information Specialists answering incoming calls from customers requesting route information, filing
complaints, making suggestions and comments for response by e-mail, telephone and/or mail.
Presently, TIC has experienced a limited demand for language assistance. TIC does accommodate LEP
Spanish speakers by staffing 20 full-time bilingual Information Specialists. However, the demand for
language assistance from Spanish speakers seems low, given the proportion of LEP Spanish speakers in
the RTD service area.
In 2018, the TIC received 871,592 calls, but approximately 19,540 (2.24%) of those calls required
language assistance for Spanish speakers. In July 2018 RTD’s TIC converted to Pure Cloud, a new call
queue system which does not track the number of calls received in Spanish. It is estimated the calls from
August to December stayed relatively the same. RTD is currently investigating new methods to track
called received in Spanish.

RTD WEBSITE VISITATION DATA
In 2015 we had a total of 47 million page views, 16.5 million sessions, and 5.7 million users on the RTD
website (www.RTD-denver.com). Over the same period of time we had 5,500 translations of the website
using our Google Website Translator tool, or about 0.03% of sessions.

Russian: 0%

Spanish represents the bulk of the translations, while Italian, Korean and Russian had very little evident
usage.
Most web browsers have started offering in-browser website translation tools. Thus it’s quite likely that
there are many more users who are viewing a translated version of the website through their browser.
Consequently, we’re unable to track all translated sessions. We expect this trend to continue. We are able
to see what default language the user’s browser is set to, providing some indication of the amount of inbrowser translation. Here’s a breakdown of our user’s browser language settings:
1. English: 99.02%

Title VI Program Update 2019
LEP SURVEY

This exercise indicated that 2.62% of passenger boardings are interactions between a passenger with
Limited English Proficiency (LEP) and an RTD bus operator. The larger percentage of those that speak
English less than well using RTD services than are indicated in the ACS data may show that those with
Limited English are drawn to RTD’s services. However, the much lower rate of LEP passenger and bus
operator interactions, 2.6%, may indicate that despite having Limited English Proficiency, customers are
able to utilize RTD services.
While results may not be reliable at the route level, there seems to be a relationship between the count of
Limited English Proficiency passenger interactions and the degree to which the specific route passes
through areas identified in the most recent American Community Survey as having a high rate of
residents born outside the U.S. While being born outside the U.S. is not equivalent to the rate of Limited
English Proficiency, density of individuals may be indicative of Limited English Proficiency resident
density.

FACTOR III. NATURE AND IMPORTANCE OF TRANSIT
Police, fire and medical emergency services are essential; however public transit is a key means of
achieving mobility for many LEP persons. To obtain a better understanding of the nature and importance
of RTD services and programs to LEP persons, various government agencies and community
organizations were consulted. Government agencies consulted was the Colorado Refugee Services
Program (CRSP) and community organizations like Colorado Progressive Coalition (CPC) have provided
significant anecdotal information.
Through consultation with various organizations RTD has found the trends of immigrants in Colorado to
be consistent with nationwide trends amongst immigrants. Many immigrants desire to switch from public
transit to automobile use because personal vehicles are a symbol of assimilation and cars can provide
greater mobility or access to economic and social opportunities that are beyond a transit system’s service
area. Recent immigrants might elect to continue using public transit for at least a portion of their trips if
their experience is positive. For transit agencies seeking to increase their “choice riders,” it may be easier
to retain riders who have past, positive impressions of the system than to attract those persons who have
never or rarely used transit. Catering to LEP persons may help to increase and retain ridership among
RTD’s immigrant communities.
Direct consultation with LEP persons has shown that LEP persons who use transit are substantially
dependent upon fixed route bus service. In fact, the areas with the highest concentrations of LEP persons
are densely populated and heavily served by RTD Local Bus Service.

Packet Pg. 70

Attachment: 2019 Title VI Program Update (Complete) (3816 : 2019 Title VI Program Update)

In order to assess the frequency of RTD patrons with Limited English Proficiency (LEP), RTD fixed
route bus operators were asked to record the number of interactions with customers where language
presented an obstacle to understanding or fulfilling the customers’ request during the week of August 5th,
2013.There was excellent participation in this effort among operators, with 82.4% of the survey cards
distributed to operators being returned (1347 survey cards returned of 1635 survey cards distributed).

1.B.1.b

Title VI Program Update 2019

FACTOR IV. AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND COSTS OF PROVIDING
LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE SERVICES

RTD is committed to assuring that resources are used to reduce the barriers that limit access to its
information and services by LEP persons. To date, RTD has taken many steps to provide language
services. Unfortunately, all costs associated with the provision of language assistance haven’t been
tracked, but a general assessment has allowed for RTD to determine the approximate amount of related
LEP related expenditures.
RTD roughly estimates that it spends $2,500 on the translation of documents, translation of marketing
material and accommodation of requests for oral translation. Written and oral translation services are
relatively inexpensive for Spanish, French and Russian; while Korean, Mandarin, Vietnamese and
African Languages are generally more costly.

FURTHER MARKET RESEARCH
RTD is committed to increasing its awareness of its interaction with LEP communities within the RTD
service area through further focused market research. In 2019, RTD will be conducting another Customer
Satisfaction Survey, where physical and web-based surveys will be offered in multiple languages.
Additionally, RTD is attempting to identify funding to conduct focus groups to obtain a more detailed
perspective of large LEP populations (5,000 or more).

LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE MEASURES EMPLOYED BY RTD
DOT Guidance: “An effective LEP plan would likely include information about the ways in which language assistance
will be provided.
RTD supports the goals of the DOT LEP Guidance to provide meaningful access to its services by LEP
persons. Accordingly, will immediately begin the implementation of its Language Assistance Plan, using
tools and resources currently available and develop new mechanisms to assist in the provision of
meaningful access to RTD services to LEP communities as needed. RTD currently offers a number of
language assistance services, including, but not limited to:




Interpretation Services
Written Translations
Public Outreach and Communications

Page 56

Packet Pg. 71

Attachment: 2019 Title VI Program Update (Complete) (3816 : 2019 Title VI Program Update)

DOT Guidance: A recipient’s level of resources and the costs imposed may have an impact on the nature of the
steps it should take in providing meaningful access for LEP persons. Smaller recipients with more limited budgets are
not expected to provide the same level of language services as larger recipients with larger budgets. In addition,
``reasonable steps’’ may cease to be reasonable where the costs imposed substantially exceed the benefits.

1.B.1.b

Title VI Program Update 2019

Advertising the availability of language assistance services will be key to ensuring LEP persons are able
to meaningfully access RTD services. RTD will notify LEP communities by posting signage at all major
passenger transfer stations, RTD’s administrative offices, and other RTD properties with high volumes of
pedestrian traffic. Furthermore, RTD will utilize its website and the relationships developed with
community organizations that assist LEP persons, to propagate the offering of language assistance
services by RTD.

TRAINING STAFF
The DOT guidance states that employees should know their obligations to provide meaningful access to
information and services for LEP persons, and all employees in public contact positions should be
properly trained. RTD intends to include training to ensure that:



Staff knows about LEP policies and procedures.
Staff having contact with the public (or those in a recipient’s custody) is trained to work effectively
with in-person and telephone interpreters.

As noted in the Four-Factor Analysis, RTD mainly encounters LEP persons byway of its Local Bus
Service. RTD’s vehicle operator training courses do provide general skills for handling LEP persons.
Fortunately, RTD’s workforce well reflects the diversity of the community it serves, as many operators
are multilingual and can often assist LEP persons directly.
It’s reasonable to anticipate that more complex interaction with LEP persons will occur with receptionists,
sales associates, transit security and other frontline staff. These frontline employees will have more
detailed procedures and sophisticated tools for managing interactions with LEP persons to include, but
not limited to:





Census “I Speak” cards
Written translations of vital and frequently requested documents
A contact list of bilingual employees
Pictograms

As RTD gains a greater perspective of the needs of the LEP community, enhancement to training
materials, tools and resources will be provided.

TRANSLATION OF VITAL DOCUMENTS
Whether or not a document (or the information it solicits) is “vital” will depend on the importance
of the program, information, encounter, or service involved, and the consequence to the LEP person if
the information in question is not accurate or timely disseminated. For instance, applications for a bicycle
safety course would not generally be considered vital, although summaries of major service changes will
be vital documents. Other vital documents include but are not limited to:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) mission to provide mass transit service in
the Denver Metro Area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of
transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and
reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to
environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits
discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial
assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or
national origin, be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination
under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order
12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission
by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects of
its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires
that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI Program
to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three years or as otherwise directed by FTA.

Service Standards and Transit Monitoring Overview
FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of Urbanized Areas with a population
of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service to ensure service is provided
accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective decision-making in the
provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to ensure service is
provided in a non-discriminatory manner. Service is monitored by comparing a sampling of non-minority routes
and minority routes, defined as 1/3 of revenue mileage borders census blocks with a minority population
greater than the service area average. No disparities were found during the transit monitoring of this reporting
period.

some way in order to bring them up to the minimum standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum
standards are subject to cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies.

RTD’s Minimum Service Frequency standard represents a compromise between economic efficiency and the
functionality of the system. For a route to be sustained at these frequencies, a route must meet the minimum
ridership performance standards. For Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon
the bottom 10% and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Regional routes, the standard is passengers per
trip. Those specific ridership standards are listed in table below:

On-Time Performance Standard and Monitoring Results
RTD strives to provide timely transit service district wide. RTD considers on-time to be an arrival at a location no
more than one minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time. Furthermore, RTD
expects trips on routes to be on-time at a certain percentage of the time depending on the service type. The
percentage of On-Time Performance for each mode is displayed below.

Vehicle Load Standard
The percentage of trips meeting the vehicle load standard on a route is a direct indicator of the appropriateness
of the level of frequency on route; as a route violating the vehicle load standard would be strong evidence for
a higher frequency of service. The Vehicle Load standard for each mode of service is summarized in the table
below. RTD requires that Vehicle Load standards be met 60% of the time.

Monitoring of the Vehicle Load standard involves an analysis of Crowding Reports that are based on Automatic
Passenger Counters (APC) data. Normally, the Crowding Reports are used to calculate the percentage of trips
meeting the vehicle load standard for individual routes. Due to the recent technical difficulties data integrity
issues, RTD is unable to examine vehicle load consistently or accurately. APC data issues should be resolved
later this year, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be completed.

Vehicle Assignment
Vehicles are assigned to specific routes and trips according to the following guidelines. These guidelines
may be modified if operational and scheduling needs require. Light Rail is exempted from this standard
as there is a singular standard vehicle available for Light Rail Service.

To examine vehicle target adherence, August 2018 runboard vehicle assignments of the sample routes were
examined for percentage of correct vehicle assignment. Each of the examined routes generally required a
standard 40’ buses. Thus in general, the assignment of a small 27’-30’ bus is considered to be an incorrect
vehicle assignment. Below is a graph displaying the rate of correct and incorrect vehicle assignment.

Area Coverage Standard
RTD generally measures the distribution of fixed-routes Area Coverage (service availability) standard. The
purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the District and to help RTD
maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes many different types of development, and
population densities and land use vary widely across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas
to support the same level of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be tailored to the needs of
particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for tailoring service to the needs of communities
and help ensure that all areas receive a level of service that is commensurate with their needs.
Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If existing or proposed
services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Chapter II of the RTD service standards, RTD may
choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may also limit RTD's ability to meet the
area coverage (or any other) standards.
The area coverage standards presented below, deal with minimum and maximum route spacing. Actual route
spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and productivity of existing service in the area.

Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre:


Peak period park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express bus, or a bus/rail
timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.

Transit Amenities Policy
Transit amenities are defined as seating (benches, seats at stops/stations), bus and rail passenger shelters,
windscreens, platform canopies, signage (printed and digital displays), escalators, elevators and waste
receptacles.
Distribution of transit amenities occur in accordance with the design criteria established for each type of transit
facility. Transit Facilities include: Park and Rides, Bus Rapid Transit Stations, Passenger Transfer Stations, StreetSide Bus Stops, Light Rail Stations and Commuter Rail stations.
The three sets of Design Criteria governing the distribution of transit amenities are included as an appendix
and are listed below:
1. Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria
2. Light Rail Design Criteria
3. Commuter Rail Design Criteria
To monitor the distribution of these criteria, RTD examined the transit amenities map shown below. No new
disparities were identified.

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

August 2019 Service Changes

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
Alongside the implementation of the Board adopted G Line Bus Service Plan, these service proposals are
submitted in an effort to maintain the existing transit network in accordance to RTD’s Service Standards
and Policies. Included is a proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low
ridership and replace the fixed route service with the proposed Platte Valley FlexRide. Proposals affecting
the Broomfield, Golden, Superior FlexRides are also submitted in this proposal. Additionally, a number of
service changes aimed at increasing on-time performance and service reliability are also included. We will
monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Local
Route 3L – East Alameda Avenue
Route 83 - Cherry Creek/ Parker Road
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add an exception bus stop at Speer Boulevard/Washington Street, to serve a developing
high density neighborhood. This change would also provide an alternative to Route 1 on 1st
Avenue. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 4 – Morrison Road
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Implement Saturday service, based on strong weekday midday ridership performance (30
passengers per hour), which will address a life-line weekend neighborhood transportation
gap. Cost impacts anticipated to be an estimated 728 hours and $105,600 annualized.
Route 6 - East 6th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments, focused on peak periods. No cost impacts
anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add one trip and respace all trips from 9th/Clermont to downtown Denver between 7:30am
and 8:30am, in an effort to relieve passenger capacity issues. Cost impacts anticipated to
be an estimated 255 hours and $21,000 annualized.
Route 31 - Federal Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Early morning and late evening trips will be curtailed on the route’s long-distance pattern
from the existing 112th Ave (FRCC) terminal to 104th & Federal Blvd. This is due to a
request by Front Range Community College for RTD to vacate its existing on-campus bus
terminal used by route 31, low ridership on the far north segment of the route to FRCC, and
the need for operator restrooms to be open for the route’s late evening trips. (Pending
outcome of operator test bus). No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue service due to low ridership and replace with new Platte Valley Flex Ride. Due
to low ridership performance, it proposed that this route service be discontinued. Current
ridership performance stands at 10.3 passenger per hour, which falls below the Urban Local
ridership standard. This proposal would impact approximately 55 weekday passengers. Cost
savings are anticipated to be an estimated 3,825 hours and $307,000 annualized.

FlexRide
Broomfield FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2016, the Broomfield FlexRide expanded the service area and added a 2nd vehicle
which was funded by a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant applied for by the
City and County of Broomfield. The grant was for 3 years. In 2015 the Flex Ride had
averaged 4.0 boardings per hour operating with one bus and a small service area. The grant
doubled the FlexRide service area. The average boardings per hour from Aug 16-Feb 19
has been 2.9 boardings per hour. Recommendation is to discontinue the 2nd vehicle and
reduce the FlexRide service area to operate with one vehicle. Recommended service area
will have the FlexRide east boundary at Sheridan. Service times for the reduced area will
continue to be 5:30am – 7:00pm. The City and County of Broomfield applied for a new
grant to keep the expanded service area and the 2nd vehicle. If this grant is approved prior
to the August Service Change implementation, this recommendation will be pulled. No cost
impacts are anticipated for this proposal.
Golden FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2017, the RTD and the City of Golden agreed to a Cost Share Agreement in which
the city agreed to pay for 1 additional vehicle on the Golden FlexRide route. Prior to this
agreement, the RTD FlexRide operated the flex route every 30 minutes with 1 bus. The 2nd
bus on the FlexRide route has the service at every 15 minutes. There are 2 other buses that
operate the “on demand” service in Golden. The boardings per hour for 2018 was at 6.2

Board of County Commissioners

Regional Transportation District (RTD)
Attn: Customer Care Division
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202

To Whom It May Concern:
As staunch supporters of enhanced transit in the Denver Metropolitan area. And, like RTD, as
the Board of County Commissioners move into our own 2020 budget discussions and the
impacts facing our County, we understand the challenges that lay ahead for Boards such as
yourself as you look at the areas you serve.
However, like the City of Golden, there is a concern with the adjustment to fare structure and
proposed service cuts for the W Line and support Golden ' s Resolution No. 2658: A Resolution
of the City Council of the City of Golden Recommending Adjustments to Regional
Transportation District Fare Structure and Service Cuts Affecting the W Rail Line.
As you are aware, the W Line terminates at the Jefferson County Government Center, which is a
location where citizens access a wide range of government services. RTD chose to make this
stop a regional, the only one on the W Line, rather than a local stop, resulting in increased fares
for many of the citizens of our community that can least afford to pay higher rates.
We respectfully ask that you reconsider the decision to make the Jefferson County Government
Center a regional stop and continue to engage the community in identifying ways to increase
ridership and serve the community.

Re:

May 2019 RTD Service Change Recommendations for W Line

Purpose of Agenda Item: This item is presented to Council as follow-up to
Council's discussions over the past month regarding potential May 2019 service
changes by the Regional Transportation District (RTD) . The item includes a draft Council
resolution for discussion on February 28th and repeats some previously presented
background material.

Background: RTD evaluates its overall service plan for busses and rail three times a
year. This effort is intended to match the level of service provided within the district to
available resources. Potential service enhancements or reductions are identified and
presented to the public in a series of public meetings, prior to board consideration and
action . In the past, the City of Golden has requested adjustments to the RTD
recommendations, most recently in August 2017 to request that RTD hold off on
reducing the frequency of trains for non-peak (mid-day) hours rail service from 15 minute
to 30 minute frequency. Based in part on our request RTD did not reduce "mid-day"
weekday or Saturday service frequency in those changes that went into effect in January
2018.
On January 19th, 2019, Council was notified by the local RTD Director that a further
Saturday service reduction is under consideration. If enacted , this service reduction
would change the frequency of Saturday "daytime" service from every 15 minutes to
every 30 minutes to match Saturday evening and Sunday all day service. RTD staff
estimates that this service reduction would save approximately $134,000 a year based
upon the reduction from 7 all day trains to six. The recommendation is based upon
Saturday ridership levels below RTD standards.
City Council discussed the infomiation from RTD on January 241h and provided direction
to staff. The primary recommendation was that Council felt a meeting in Golden,
attended. by RTD representatives, would be necessary in order to effectively
communicate about the proposed changes, as well as other local issues related to the
RTD system and operations. The other topics discussed that evening included Golden's

on-going support for transit mobility options and a serious concern about the existing
fare structure and map that places the W Line end of line station just outside the
boundary of having a trip downtown from this station be a "local" fare. The significant
price differential between a local fare at $3.00 and the current "regional" fare of $5.25 for
a trip to downtown Denver is a significant deterrent to ridership.

Following that January 24th, 2019 Council discussion , a community meeting was
scheduled and held on February 13th in City Council Chambers. The meeting was
attended by several staff and board members from RTD, all of City Council, and a
number of Golden citizens. Each Councilor commented on the record for RTD in support
of changing the fare structure and/or map, in opposition to the Saturday cuts, and in
continued support of transit alternatives.

Alternatives: As a result of the February 13th community meeting and City Council
comments, the attached draft resolution has been prepared for Council discussion and
potential action. Council's meeting comments are already on the record but Council may
wish to take the more formal step of adopting a resolution.

Recommendations: Staff recommends that City Council discuss the draft resolution
and determine whether to use the resolution as a more formal response to RTD before
the RTD board's official discussion of the topic on March 25th at 5:30 PM at RTD offices.
Public comment will be accepted at that time.

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
GOLDEN RECOMMENDING ADJUSTMENTS TO REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT FARE STRUCTURE AND
SERVICE CUTS AFFECTING THEW RAIL LINE
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden and its residents and businesses contribute significant amounts
of tax dollar resources to the Regional Transportation District (RTD) system; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden is a staunch supporter of enhanced transit in the Denver
Metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines, individually contributed
local funds to the 2013 establishment of the combination Call and Ride/Flex Route service at the end of
line station ofthe W Rail Line, which service is one of the most successful elements ofRTD' s Call and
Ride program; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines and Jefferson County, are
currently funding a two year pilot program to add an additional Flex Route bus daily, so that the flex route
bus matches the 15 minute headways of the W Line and thereby further enhance ridership of both services
by addressing first and last mile challenges; and
WHEREAS,
Light Rail service to the W Line station in Golden is already burdened by the fare
structure which requires a regional fare from this station to downtown Denver, and therefore should not be
further discouraged by service reductions; and
WHEREAS,
the Golden City Council recognizes the budget constraints faced by the RTD
board, and wishes to make constructive recommendations to both improve system usage and manage costs,
as well as increase local marketing efforts and ridership incentives.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF GOLDEN,
COLORADO
The Golden City Council hereby recommends that the Regional Transportation District Board of
Directors commit to give the most serious consideration to the below recommendations that provide the
opportunity to enhance W Line usage as well as improving local transit for our committed community.
a.

Commit to consider the long-term ridership, system operations, and fiscal implications of
adjusting the fare structure such that the W Line end of line station at the Jefferson County
Government Center is in fare zone B, under the current fare structure. In addition, City Council
urges RTD to take the opportunity, of more overall system transit lines being operational, to
review the entire fare structure related to station locations.

b.

Delay for an additional year those proposed W Line service cuts related to reduction of
headways in Saturday periods currently scheduled for fifteen (15) minute headways in order to
continue to seek ways to boost weekend ridership to match the growth in weekday ridership.

c.

In conjunction with these two recommendations, City Council commits to continue to seek
ways to promote and encourage transit use for the benefit of the community and the entire
region.

Re:

Service Availability – April 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.65% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in April 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (April) last year. Service delivery has improved significantly
since June 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





April 2019 – 113.58 hours
April 2018 – 1,883.01 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 1,904.75 hours
Year to date hours 2018 –5,099.30 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in April were one extreme weather event,
planned/unplanned shuttles (bus bridges), and special events (Rockies, Mile Hi 4/20 Festival,
Shakespeare Festival and the Cherry Creek Sneak). The weather event day accounts for 47:10hours of lost service for personnel reasons on that day alone.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.65% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,636 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 21,088 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:
