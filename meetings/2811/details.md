#### 2. Recommended Changes to Special Event Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approve the following changes to Special Event services:

1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and

2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.

BACKGROUND

1.       RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and RockiesRide service began that same year.  The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games.  Over the years, service levels have been adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton park-n-Rides).  Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks games; most games operated with six buses.  In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of $20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.

Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board passengers.  In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer be available.  Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another location to the Rockies-Lot.  RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for the past 24 years.

Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.

2.       RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides.  Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006.  Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011.  In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers).  As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.

It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service standards.

DISCUSSION

1.       RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.  Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.

Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.  No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide service.

2.       RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place at one time.  The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.

Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and US-36 & McCaslin.  No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and US-85 & Bridge.

Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative Offices.  Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and email:

RTD Administrative Offices

12:00 noon

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter.  There were six members from the public in attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments included the following:

- Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game

- Sports-rides should be better marketed

- Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

- Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

6:00 pm

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade.  There were three members from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.

No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.

RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  Those comments are summarized below:

- Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide Service.

- Email (3):  Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was good and/or full.  A third email shared several comments:

o        Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and non-existent on Sundays

o        RTD does not market anything

o        RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on ridership

o        RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game

o        Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park Avenue

o        Fares should be collected in both directions

o        RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service

o        RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service

o        RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting services that people actually use

FINANCIAL IMPACT

1.       RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of service.

2.       RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.              Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station.  This alternative is not recommended because on opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.

3.              Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent years.
