BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 7, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted 2018 Task Goal #3, Asset Management and State of Good Repair, Bus
Operations has begun the process of replacing the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses,
currently being used for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Information for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula to the original price quotes results in a
per bus unit cost of $69,303.57 for a Call-n-Ride bus and $65,371.03 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 322011 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the Call-n-Ride service and 12 2007 and 2011 Model Year
buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2007 and 2011 Model Year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 7 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them
in service.
The new ADA cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with
the disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an
extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for
the Call-n-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

1.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2018 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $3,100,654. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 8, 2018

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Recommended
Services

Changes

to

Special

Event

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the following changes to Special Event services:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, service levels have been
adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four
Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton parkn-Rides). Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks
games; most games operated with six buses. In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per
game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service
operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for
BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of
$20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet
been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies
games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north
metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded
sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service
configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve
the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides. Race
for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in
2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In
2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an
all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has
declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service
standards.
DISCUSSION
1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between
Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After
looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of
buses that can be used. Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain
clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a
minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for
special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent
attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at
Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize
staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies
game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide
service.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative
Offices. Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and
email:
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
12:00 noon
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter. There were six members from the public in
attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments
included the following:
 Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game
 Sports-rides should be better marketed
 Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L



Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding
the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
6:00 pm
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade. There were three members
from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service
changes. None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.
No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.
RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.
Those comments are summarized below:
 Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide
Service.
 Email (3): Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was
good and/or full. A third email shared several comments:
o Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and nonexistent on Sundays
o RTD does not market anything
o RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on
ridership
o RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union
Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game
o Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park
Avenue
o Fares should be collected in both directions
o RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service
o RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service
o RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting
services that people actually use
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this
funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of
service.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD
RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station. This alternative is not recommended because on
opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the
service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In
addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.
3.

Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended
as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent
years.

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.4% of all scheduled hours of bus service in
January 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase slightly from January
2017 (from 270.76 hours in 2017 to 664.04 in 2018), however, RTD did provide in excess of 99.4%
of all scheduled hours. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather McKillop,

Date:

February 6, 2018

Subject:

Authorization to enter into a contract with
DatamanUSA

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for an amount not to exceed
$7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these
Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to provide support and enhancement of the functional and
technical capabilities within Oracle E-Business Suite – and planning and implementing the next logical
upgrade/alternatives of products and tools. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods
addressing business, management of technology and consultant services. The activities are inclusive of all
activities necessary to support, enhance and update the Oracle Products and tools.
RTD has utilized an on-call contract of this nature for Oracle support for more than 10 years. During the
previous 5-year contract period, RTD spent a total of approximately $2.1 million on projects such as state
of good repair, business intelligence configuration and implementation, real time reporting, Oracle
advanced benefits assessment, open enrollment changes and updates, and Oracle hardware upgrades and
enhancements.
RTD anticipates the upcoming 5-year contract period may include work associated with several new
implementations including Inventory Planning, Contract Management, Budgeting, Human Capital
Management, Finance and Accounting, Enterprise Planning, and other ancillary systems. RTD will also use
this contract to assist in maintaining day-to-day operations of the existing Oracle system while the new
systems are being implemented. Other projects that may utilize work order assistance include real time
enhancements, business intelligence enhancements, open enrollment updates, Oracle hardware
configurations and upgrades, and system security enhancements.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an ERP Work Order contractor. Six firms submitted proposals.
The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected two firms for interviews. DatamanUSA was selected
as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $7,750,000 (including contingency). Funding for these Work
Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of
funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be
funded as the project requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $1,950,000.00 (including
contingency) in any one year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract to DatamanUSA for ERP Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH023) for
an amount not to exceed $7,750,000 over 5 years. Work is administered on an as-needed,
work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects
on which the work is performed.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity that can be provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of
RTD.
3. Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over six
months and not likely result in an improved outcome.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

February 6, 2018

Subject:

Code of Ethics Approval

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: February 6, 2018
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve the
attached RTD Code of Ethics.
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors approved the current RTD Code of Ethics (Code) 15 years ago, on January 21,
2003. RTD’s current Code narrowly meets Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requirements that RTD
have a Board-approved code of ethics applicable to the Board as well as to RTD employees with
responsibility for procurement. However, while such a “procurement code of ethics” provides guidance
for Directors and a small subset of RTD employees, and protection for RTD in situations related to
contractual relationships, it fails to apply to the rest of RTD’s employees, and fails to provide Directors
and staff with broader, more basic ethical standards to which all RTD representatives should adhere.
RTD’s current Code has long caused confusion because while it is given to all RTD employees in
training, only a small subset of RTD employees are actually subject to its terms. The current Code also
needs updating to adhere to current legal requirements.
Staff provided a new, draft Code of Ethics to the Finance Administration & Audit Committee as an
informational item in January, seeking comments and suggestions. In response, Directors asked that the
Code specifically reference the concepts of impartiality and avoiding appearances of impropriety; and
make clear that the Code is a Board-adopted policy, while accompanying examples and explanatory
commentary are not policy but procedures. After providing several weeks for any additional comments
or requests, staff incorporated all Director’s suggestions into a new draft. Staff is now requesting
approval of the new Code of Ethics.
DISCUSSION
RTD decided that updating the RTD Code of Ethics was a valuable project to accomplish in the 2017
Leadership Academy. A Leadership Academy team of RTD represented and salaried employees - Raleigh
Elstun, Todd Keir, Corey Petzinger, and Karl Shoemaker – took on the task, sponsored and mentored by
RTD’s General Counsel and Pam Kachka in the Education, Training & Development Division.
The proposed new RTD Code of Ethics started as a clean sheet. The Leadership Academy team
collaborated, set goals, planned the work, and then worked their plan. The team identified current FTA
requirements and researched other transit agency Codes of Ethics (Sound Transit, MBTA, BC Transit,
and SEPTA) for ideas and guidance.
The team and General Counsel ultimately decided to create a two-part Code of Ethics, with the main
part pertaining to all employees, and a smaller part with additional standards for Directors and employees
with fiduciary responsibilities. This arrangement was determined to be optimal for clarity, simplicity,
functionality, and general applicability for all employees.

Packet Pg. 15

2.B.2

Unlike the current Code, the new Code of Ethics is much shorter, far less technical in language, and
goes beyond procurement to express basic ethical standards applicable to all RTD representatives:
Integrity, Honesty, Inclusivity, Transparency, and Sustainability.
Instead of the current document in which examples and explanatory comments are part of the Boardapproved Code and can therefore only be updated or revised through formal Board action, the proposed
Code offloads such examples and comments into a separate procedural document. RTD’s General
Counsel will maintain and update that document under RTD’s standard methods for revising, publicizing
and maintaining procedures, following notification to and opportunity for comment by the Board and the
Senior Leadership Team. (In response to Committee comments in January, the new Code has been
revised to make clear that those procedures are not themselves policies.) This approach keeps the Boardapproved Code of Ethics clean and simple, and allows for regular updating of examples as necessary to
ensure that they stay relevant and address current concerns and questions.
The proposed new Code addresses changes in law since 2003, and applies monetary standards for gifts
based on those now applicable to other public employees under the Colorado Constitution (through the
ballot initiative Amendment 41).
The Leadership Academy team gave presentations and conducted interviews with many RTD
stakeholders including Safety, Security, Legal, Civil Rights, Human Resources, Labor Relations, Asset
Management, and RTD’s General Manager. The team also provided drafts to the Union for review and
comment. This outreach provided invaluable information and perspectives to aid the team to create the
most relevant and highest quality Code of Ethics possible. The new Code of Ethics submitted for
adoption by the Board of Directors is an original document that satisfies legal requirements as well as
major stakeholders’ wishes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no adverse financial impact to adopting the new Code of Ethics. There will be minor costs in
printing and distributing the new Code and obtaining approvals. RTD already conducts training
courses in ethics to new and other employees. RTD will educate employees on the Code of Ethics
and is planning to roll out training and education within RTD’s existing education and training
budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. The Finance Administration & Audit Committee recommends that the Board of Directors approve
the attached RTD Code of Ethics Adopt the new Code of Ethics. This is the recommended
action.
2. Do not adopt the new Code of Ethics, and instead return the new Code to staff for further
revision. This is not recommended, as the new Code has already undergone substantial review
including incorporation of all comments received at and after last month’s Finance Administration
& Audit Committee meeting.

2.B.2.a

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all all be alert to
potential ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct which
creates an appearance of impropriety. Those of us who supervise others must foster an
atmosphere that encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas.
Responsibility for compliance with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one
of us.
A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD policies and procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics
training and resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are
ever unsure whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for
a written advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team

consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of
comments from others, the Code of Ethics was approved and adopted by RTD’s Board of
Directors on _______________, 2018.

B.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

This part of the Code contains five basic ethics standards that apply to each of us: all
RTD employees regardless of position, plus RTD directors (also referred to as “employees” in
this part). These standards are: integrity, honesty, inclusivity, transparency, and sustainability.

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities, or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.1.1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions
which create an appearance of impropriety.
1.2.1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether
for ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.3.1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary
value to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.4.1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any
contract or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative
capacity.
1.5.1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit
nor accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from
contractors, potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial
interest is not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic
value. For purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial”
or of “nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado

Packet Pg. 20

2.B.2.a

Constitution Art. XXIX (Amendment 41). To confirm the current dollar limit, click

We will promote an environment of trust and safety, free from dishonesty,
misrepresentation, fraud, and misuse of RTD property.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

2.1. We will be truthful, sincere, and forthright in our work dealings and
communications.
2.2. We will not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises on behalf
of RTD.
2.3. We will not retaliate against employees who raise genuine safety, ethics or legal
concerns in good faith.

3. Inclusivity
We will value the background, experience, perspective and talent of
others, respect the diversity of the communities we serve, and promote a
work environment free from unlawful discrimination and harassment.
3.1. We will treat each other, our customers, contractors, partners, and members of
the public with respect.
3.2. We will not unlawfully harass or discriminate against other employees, our
customers, contractors, partners, and members of the public.
3.3. We will seek input from others and value differences of opinion.

4. Transparency
We will be transparent, accountable and open in our operations and
decision making, consistent with laws and rules protecting confidentiality
of certain information.
4.1. We will maintain an atmosphere of open communication and cooperation.

Annual Disclosure

Employees in positions determined by RTD to be responsible for
procurements or engaged in the award or administration of contracts must
complete and submit to the General Counsel an interest disclosure form subject to
procedures approved by the Senior Leadership Team.

E.

Attachment: COE Redlined (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

The disclosure form is kept confidential and is used to create a general, nonpersonalized list of those persons or entities with whom RTD may be restricted from doing
business. No financial data is required. Proposed transactions are compared with the list to see
if there are relationships that could cause a conflict of interest, in which case the General
Counsel and Senior Manager of Materials Management will consult.

Advice, Enforcement, and Penalties for Violation

If you are unsure as to whether an action may violate this Code of Ethics, you should
first consult the comments and examples in RTD’s official policies and procedures, and then
contact RTD’s General Counsel if you still have questions. If you are ever unsure whether
anything you do may violate this Code, contact the General Counsel for a written advisory
opinion before taking action.
An employee or director violating this Code of Ethics may be subject to discipline up to
and including termination of employment, or such action or penalties as authorized by RTD’s
Bylaws, respectively, in addition to any other penalties authorized by law.
A contractor’s or agent’s contract with RTD may include terms incorporating all or part
of this Code of Ethics and treating contractor employees as RTD employees for such purposes.
Violation of this Code may be considered a breach of the contract with RTD or grounds for
disbarment from future RTD contracts.

A.

Introduction

This RTD Code of Ethics provides mandatory standards and guidance on ethical behavior
and choices for all of us at RTD: our employees and directors. We will use this Code of Ethics to
guide our daily decisions and actions.

A key goal of this Code is to promote integrity by preventing conflicts of interest.
Conflicts between our RTD roles and our private interests, whether real or perceived, must be
avoided.
This Code also supports an environment at RTD of honesty, trust, inclusivity and
sustainability: a just culture with sincere, respectful and open communications.
This Code contains five main parts. The first part identifies five basic ethics standards
that apply to all of us at RTD. The second part contains rules limiting RTD contracts with
current and former RTD employees who have responsibility for or influence upon procurement
decisions, including all RTD managers and directors. The third part concerns annual disclosures
by those with responsibility for procurement decisions. The fourth part explains how to get
advice about the Code and states how RTD enforces the Code, including penalties for violation.
The fifth part provides more resources to help interpret the Code, including citations to relevant
legal standards.
The rules in this Code are simple, reasonable, and grounded in common
sense. This Code clearly states expectations for all RTD employees. A claim of lack of
knowledge or understanding of this Code will not be accepted.
No code of ethics can anticipate every possible situation, and this Code of Ethics does
not repeal other rules relating to ethical conduct that may apply. We must be familiar and
comply with all laws, standards and rules related to our specific jobs. To help in applying the
rules in this Code, RTD’s General Counsel will issue comments and examples applying the Code
to situations that may come up. These comments and examples will be approved by the Senior
Leadership Team as official RTD procedures. In addition, RTD provides ethics training and
resources to apply this Code to situations you are likely to encounter. If you are ever unsure
whether anything you do may violate this Code, contact RTD’s General Counsel for a written
advisory opinion before you take action.
This 2018 revision of RTD’s Code of Ethics was led by an RTD Leadership Academy team
consisting of represented and salaried employees. After internal reviews and solicitation of

Packet Pg. 31

Attachment: COE Clean Version (3393 : Code of Ethics Approval)

All of us at RTD are expected to be ethical role models. We must all be alert to potential
ethical issues and be ready to respond appropriately. We must avoid conduct, which creates an
appearance of impropriety. Those of us who supervise others must foster an atmosphere that
encourages everyone to seek help if faced with ethical dilemmas. Responsibility for compliance
with standards for ethical conduct ultimately rests with each one of us.

Directors on _______________, 2018.

Five Basic Ethics Standards for All of Us at RTD

1. Integrity
We will avoid conflicts of interest and promote public confidence in the
integrity of RTD’s decisions.
1.1. We will not engage in outside business or activities that interfere with official
RTD duties and responsibilities or in official RTD duties and responsibilities that
directly affect an employee’s outside business or activities.
1.2. We will be impartial in carrying out our duties, and will avoid actions, which
create an appearance of impropriety.
1.3. We will not use our positions for personal gain or private benefit, whether for
ourselves or for our families, acquaintances, or businesses.
1.4. We will not offer, or give in response to solicitation, any item of monetary value
to anyone from whom we are seeking official action.
1.5. No director, officer, employee, or agent of RTD will be interested in any contract
or transaction with RTD except in his or her official representative capacity.
1.6. RTD’s officers, employees, agents, or board members will neither solicit nor
accept gifts, gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors,
potential contractors, or parties to subcontracts unless the financial interest is
not substantial or the gift is an unsolicited item of nominal intrinsic value. For
purposes of determining whether monetary value is “not substantial” or of
“nominal intrinsic value,” RTD applies the current dollar limits in Colorado
Constitution Art. XXIX (Amendment 41). To confirm the current dollar limit, click
here for RTD’s ethics procedures or contact RTD‘s General Counsel.

(1) Variance is due to timing of invoices for contracted services as well as parts and supplies orders lagging expectations
(2) Variance is due to the timing of rail line openings and parts and wages being lower than expected
(3) Variance is due to the timing of payment for management services
(4) Variance primarily due to the reversal of a December bill of sale for US36 assets on FasTracks and timing of multiple projects on Base System
(5) Variance is primarily due to the timing of payment for outside security services and contracted maintenance in which accruals are recorded at year-end
(6) Variance is primarily due to higher-than-expected self-insured claims for liability and worker's compensation
(7) Variance is primarily due to the timing of purchase of data processing services in which encumbrances have been incurred
(8) Variance is primarily due to the timing of production of outside promotional and informational materials and costs related to rail openings
(9) Variance due year-end accrued expenses that did not materialize
NOTE: the Q3 2017 SB154 cost recovery ratio was 49.7% which exceeds the statutory minimum of 30.0%

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2017 attached.
On December 13, 2017, the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee announced that it would increase
short term interest rates by 0.25%, into the range of 1.25% to 1.50% range. This was the third and
final rate hike of 2017. The committee recently noted that “Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding
have affected economic activity, employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially
altered the outlook for the national economy.” and that “inflation is expected to remain somewhat below
2 percent in the near term.” Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to maintain
maximum employment and price stability.
The impact to the bond market was as expected in that as interest rates rose, the value of existing
bonds fell because newly issued bonds now have higher interest rates. This relationship between bond
yield and bond price is demonstrated in the following graphic:

The decrease in value of existing bonds will be reflected in RTD’s financial statements as of
12/31/2017, however since RTD generally holds bonds that it owns until maturity, actual losses are not
expected to be realized. The decrease in value is also reflected in the total return (yield plus change in
value) performance of RTD’s investments and their correlating benchmarks.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of

Packet Pg. 55

2.C.4

America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

4th Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.326%
0.284%

1.083%
0.856%

-0.233%
0.059%

0.512%
0.583%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

Historical performance of RTD investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmarks is reflected in
the following graphs:

2.C.4

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through 2017 was 1.40% which produced earnings of
$4,141,521. The current yield for the month of December was 1.50% which would produce annualized
earnings of $4,952,457.
