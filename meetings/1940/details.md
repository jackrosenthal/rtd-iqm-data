## II. 3 Intern Presentations - IT, Planning and Civil Rights

Phil Washington, General Manager, said that for the past decade RTD has been reaching out to the community through the internship program.  This program provides learning opportunities for young people to work for RTD on an annual or summer basis.  It also provides RTD with valuable work in different areas and projects.  Currently there are 30 interns throughout the District.  Interns are both at the High School and College levels.

He mentioned that in the past week 8 intern teams presented their reports to the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) and other RTD staff.  Phil Washington asked 3 teams to report to the Board: Planning Department, Civil Rights Department, and Information Technology (IT) Department.  He then introduced Victoria Broce, Labor Relations Administrator and Internship Program Manager, to introduce the interns.

Victoria Broce introduced the Planning Department Annual Interns: Kim Kinnison, University of Colorado (CU) Denver Geography senior student, and Rebecca Tate, CU Denver Urban and Regional Planning and Business Administration graduate student.  Stephen Rijo, University of Denver graduate student and teaching assistant for the Department of Geography and the Environment, was not in attendance.

Kim Kinnison said she worked with the Planning Technical Services team.  Among her contributions were the I-225 Draft Opening Day Schedule, Light Rail Simulation Calibration and the 2013 Bike on Bus Report.

Rebecca Tate mentioned that Stephen Rijo recently started the internship at RTD.  Among his current projects are the License Plate Survey, Bike Parking and Accessibility Plan, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS).  This last one, GIS, is his area of expertise.  She said her work has focused on Transit Oriented Development (TOD), specifically Alameda, Olde Town Arvada, Welton Corridor and Federal Center.  She also worked on the 2013 TOD Status Report and on the Grant Task Force.

Victoria Broce introduced the Civil Rights Annual Interns from Arrupe Jesuit High School:  Andrew Ramirez (junior), Estefan Hernandez, (senior), and Jazmin Huerta (2014 graduate).

Estefan Hernandez works with the Small Business Office and has attended community events.  Jazmin Huerta worked with the Small Business Office and in other areas as needed.  Andrew Ramirez assists project managers through administrative tasks.

Victoria Broce introduced the IT Department Summer Interns: Jazzmyn Boykins (Overland High School), Elijah Hewlett (George Washington High School), Devonte Stephens, (East High School), and Jorden Cammack (Thomas Jefferson High School).  As a group they shadowed the IT Department and worked with The Hub.  They learned about troubleshooting, hard drives, firewall audit, and data collection and use.

Phil Washington acknowledged the parents and counselors in the audience.  He said it was great to see all these young people working different areas.  He noted it was a great indication of all the disciplines required to run the District.

Director Folska expressed her relief and hope about the future.  She regretted not being able to see the other presentations.  She applauded Phil Washington and staff for the internship work.  Director Folska mentioned she knows Stephen Rijo as she has guest lectured for Andy Getz, one of his professors.  She sent her greetings to Jeremy Nemeth, one of Rebecca Tate’s professors. She encouraged the IT interns to invent a “ping” sound for the emergency blue phones.

Director Bagley remembered when, along with Phil Washington, he engaged WIN program participants at the Alameda Groundbreaking event.  He said the internship program is an extension of such programs in creating ladders of opportunities.  Director Bagley added that he was proud of the groups as it is hard to present to the Board of Directors.

Director Walker congratulated staff on the internship initiative.  He also thanked the parents and counselors for their support. He offered the interns advice: always look for the solution and not focus on the problem.

Chair Sisk expressed how proud he was of the young people serving the community and the state.  He encouraged Monte Whaley, reporter for the Denver Post, to write a story on the interns as they are the true lead story.  Chair Sisk thanked Phil Washington and staff for the robust internship program.

## III. ADA Update (Abel)

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, introduced Larry Buter, Manager for Paratransit Services and Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager for Contracted Services.  Together they presented the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) Update starting on page 2 of the Study Session Packet for July 29, 2014.  Bruce Abel mentioned that throughout many meetings the Directors have received updates on ADA and the Access-a-Ride service.  The purpose of the update during this meeting is to collectively have a better understanding on the matter.

The presentation included an overview of the ADA law and RTD’s Access-a-Ride program description, structure, eligibility, and certification process.   It also covered the Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab programs descriptions and data.  The presentation concluded with the programs challenges, such as operator shortages, increased demand, and cost among others.  During the presentation, Larry Buter noted that Access-a-Ride consults the government’s weather forecast in order to determine conditional services availability.  Bruce Abel emphasized that eligibility is not based on a medical condition but rather on functional abilities.  He also noted that in 2008 the Access-a-Cab subsidy changed from $7 to $12.  This proved to be an overall cost effective way to provide for constituents’ mobility needs.

Director Anderson said that some of her questions were answered throughout the course of the presentation, including exploring newer, cost-effective vehicle options and weather forecast.  She inquired about a couple of her constituents who were denied Access-a-Ride certification.  Larry Buter indicated that one of them enhanced his mobility when he acquired an electric wheelchair.  He did get certified on a conditional basis for snow.  Director Anderson said she was impressed with the program’s flexibility.  She also complemented the staff on responsibly using tax payer dollars and being successful in delivering ADA services.  She shared that a friend’s mother is a client of the Access-a-Ride program.  The mother, as well as the family, loves the service as it gives her a great deal of independence.

Director Bagley noted that Directors Daly, James, Tobiassen and he were part of the Board in 2009 when route match was a topic of public participation at almost every Board Meeting.  This topic has not been an issue during public participation in recent years.  This, he said, is a symbol of a fine tuned service.  He congratulated the staff on a job well done.

Director Lubow asked staff to explain the barriers preventing all ADA services to be classified as Access-a-Cab since that seems to be the option that costs the least.  Bruce Abel noted that not many cabs can accommodate wheelchairs.  He also pointed out trip distance: cabs are cost-effective on shorter distances while RTD’s van service is cost-effective on longer distances.  Bruce Abel mentioned that when contracting a service the company must abide by RTD and Federal Transit Authority (FTA) guidelines, such as drug and alcohol testing, background checks, and clean motor vehicle record (MVR).  He said most cab drivers would not pass the screenings.  A subsidize service is a service the customers use that RTD helps pay for.  Director Lubow asked how purchasing wheelchair accessible cabs would help. Bruce Abel said that scenario would be to RTD’s advantage.  He also noted that staff monitors taxi rates and trips distances.   He pointed out many of the Access-a-Ride customers prefer knowing an RTD van will pick them up.

Director Rivera-Malpiede complemented staff on serving the community.  She asked if there have been strategic conversations about operator’s shortage and if there are additional skills required.  Larry Buter answered that staff meets with carriers every week.  One of the carriers started advertising on the radio.  Staff will be monitoring any results from this marketing strategy.  He also noted all operator training is done in-house and that the only requirements are a valid CO license, clean MVR, a background check, and a drug/alcohol check.

Director Rivera-Malpiede inquired about any conversations with other service providers regarding referrals and/or assistance.  Larry Buter replied that staff has had conversations with the State regarding the Medicaid program.  Their policy states that they will only pay the lowest rate of the fixed route, in RTD’s case $2.25.  The Access-a-Ride fare is $4.50.

Director Rivera-Malpiede asked about the Freedom Grants and its availability beyond Longmont.  Bruce Abel said that RTD uses Freedom Grants to support Travel Training, which has been expanded District wide.

Director Walker asked if road construction qualifies as a conditional element for Access-a-Ride certification.  Larry Buter answered that it is considered an environmental barrier.  Director Walker also asked regarding any relationship with Uber and Lyft drivers.  Bruce Abel said there is no relationship with that company.  Director Walker noted that Portland’s TriMet utilizes an app that highlights infrastructure improvements.  He will forward contact information to staff.

Director Tobiassen thanked staff for the update and their progress.  He asked if the recent re-enforcement of ADA policy on fixed routes has increased ADA customer’s ridership on fixed routes.  Bruce Abel said that it is hard to say if ADA ridership has increased.  He also said there are fewer complaints about the re-enforcement process.  Carolyn Conover mentioned that the routes with more complaints are utilizing buses in which a row of seats have been removed to create room for stroller and carts.

Director Daly followed up on Director Lubow’s suggestion of increasing the number of cabs and asked if cab service is infrequent in certain areas.  Bruce Abel confirmed that some areas of the District are underserved by taxi companies.

Director Folska thanked staff for the update and for offering such robust services to the community.  She agreed with Bruce Abel about the lack of cab service to certain suburban areas.  She clarified that Larry Buter was referring to Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) 151, not TCRP 121 during his presentation.  Director Folska mentioned that Access-a-Ride customers are pleased to find out about the Access-a-Cab option.  She said that more outreach and education on the program would be terrific.  She inquired about the contract with Via Mobility for Travel Training and how it seems they only have 2 trainers, causing at times a 3 months waiting period.  Bruce Abel said that Via Mobility was contracted for a Travel Training pilot program in Boulder.  This program has now been expanded to the whole District.  Larry Buter added that through the past 6 months Easter Seals of Colorado, the contractor issuing Access-a-Ride certifications, has expanded their outreach.  Director Folska expressed her desire to see Travel Training be more effective as new lines will be opening soon.  She said that most disabled persons only need the training once or twice.  She then asked about Access-a-Cab reservation and modification hours.  Larry Buter said that reservations can be made 7 days a week from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Changes can be made at any time by calling dispatch.  Chair Sisk asked to take any further questions on this matter offline.

Director Hoy mentioned that commuter trains will have disabled areas with seats that will need to be manually pulled down in order to be used by abled customers in case of availability.  He suggested this type of seats for buses as well.  He asked for the overall annual operating cost of the paratransit programs.  Bruce Abel said it is between $35 and $40 million dollars.  The costs were broken down during the presentation to provide a holistic view of the program.  Director Hoy asked for clarification about Call-n-Ride services as it seems that an assisted living home in his District favors this service over Access-a-Ride.  Bruce Abel said that is correct as for some regions Call-n-Ride seems to be more cost-effective than Access-a-Ride.

Director Menten asked about adding to the amount of non-dedicated Access-a-Cab vehicles during peak hours.  Bruce Abel said that the new contract, which started on April 1st, calls for the contractor to make extra vehicles available during peak hours.  Once peak times are done, these vehicles return to regular cab services.  Director Menten inquired how long Access-a-Ride participants have been able to ride fixed routes for free.  Bruce Abel answered about 10 to 12 years.  He said it is a strategy to encourage people to become more independent.  Director Menten asked about the kind of conversations had with different entities that may provide their own disabled transportation services and how this may affect hiring more RTD bus operators.  Larry Buter said that RTD has been having these conversations with different entities for the past 20 years.  Bruce Abel said Longmont is a good example of cooperation as RTD collaborates with other entities to transport passengers.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the update and the work on Access-a-Ride.  She wanted to confirm that contracting with Veolia/Yellow Cab would mean that there would be more dedicated drivers during peak hours as many customers have experienced long waits or no shows.  Bruce Abel said that is the expectation.  Larry Buter explained that Viola/Yellow Cab is dedicated to Access-a-Ride through the First Transit Call Center. Director Deadwyler thanked staff for implementing some of her suggestions.

Director Tobiassen asked if Access-a-Ride customers could get a discount on the $4.50 fare.  Larry Buter said they could purchase a ten ride book for a 10% discount or use cash for the full fare.

Director Folska noted the Call-n-Ride service in Highlands Ranch is used by people eligible for Access-a-Ride since the former seems to be more cost-effective.  She asked if these customers would still be eligible for other ADA services.  Bruce Abel said that they need to be ADA eligible and certified in order to use the Call-n-Ride service.

Chair Sisk thanked staff for the in depth presentation and the Directors for the discussion.

## IV. Asset Management/State of Good Repair (Genova)

Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security, and Facilities, introduced Lou Cripps, System Administrator for Asset Management.  Together they presented the Asset Management/State of Good Repair Presentation starting on page 31 of the Study Session Packet for July 29, 2014.  The presentation covered a background on Asset Management, implementation of works, and a summary of future work.  Dave Genova acknowledged the State of Good Repair team in attendance.

Director Folska asked if the Asset Management software was built in house or bought.  Lou Cripps said that the team has been acquiring data since 2007 through Maximus and Oracle.  Dave Genova added that the Enterprise Resource program was updated from Legacy to Enterprise.  Phil Washington led the process when he was the Assistant General Manager for Administration.  That transition proved to be a great foundation for the current work.

Director Lubow congratulated staff on a well done program.  She asked if the new Asset Management federal requirement is a positive addition. Phil Washington said that RTD has been working towards Asset Management and State of Good Repair before the federal requirement possibility.  The Federal Government is working on establishing the standards.  Through its leadership participation in APTA, RTD will help shape these requirements.  Dave Genova added that that RTD meets and/or exceeds the qualifications in discussion to become requirements.  The FTA estimates nationally a backlog of $80 million dollars in State of Good Repair.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that funding will likely be linked to State of Good Repair instead of new capital projects.  Director Lubow noted it would be a mixed blessing if an agency is interested in capital project.  Marla Lien replied that it is not a mixed blessing when interested in safety.

Director Lubow asked when Asset Management/State of Good Repair cost-savings will be reflected.  Phil Washington said that it will take some time, but it will be seen, for example, when deciding the specifications and/or ordering a new fleet of buses.  These practices are placing RTD ahead of the rest of the industry.  Dave Genova added that tracking devices have been added to light rail vehicles to assess maintenance needs.  These data will help extend a fleet life cycle.  Phil Washington said that these practices are being used by RTD’s capital programs by making upfront investments that will account for savings in the long term.

Director Tobiassen asked about Asset Management for facilities, such as East Metro Garage and Park-n-Rides, which have many physical components.  Due to RTD’s, huge inventory, he wondered how staff goes about condition assessment.  He noted that in the long term these steps should be able to forecast capital replacement.  He also inquired how the FTA assesses compliance.  Dave Genova replied that the FTA is not assessing compliance yet because they are still working on the requirements.  Based on conversations, RTD seems to be well positioned to comply with FTA requirements whenever they are decided upon.  He said that Director Tobiassen addressed one of the purposes of Asset Management: giving the Directors the necessary details to determine where to make investments.  Lou Cripps noted that staff looks at system levels in order to prioritize Asset Management.  Some areas, such as IT, have a shorter life span.  These kinds of details are taken into consideration when considering assessments.  Phil Washington added that the Strategic Budget Plan addresses these types of prioritizations.  Staff also ties Asset Management to the customer experience.

Director James asked how Asset Management and State of Good Repair Program applies to RTD’s real estate.  Dave Genova said that currently the program focuses on assets meaningful to revenue, such as rolling stock, infrastructure, facilities, and equipment.  Phil Washington added that staff hopes to soon be able to assess real estate’s Asset Management and State of Good Repair.  However, real estate assessment would require extra resources and expertise.  Director James asked staff to keep real estate on the radar.

Director Menten asked for clarification on the cost based scoring on slide 18 found on page 49 of the Study Session Packet for July 29, 2014.  Lou Cripps said that the performance score is based on all scores combined.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for a very informative presentation.

Chair Sisk thanked the Asset Management team.  He acknowledged this type of information may not be headline material but it is vital in saving money.  He said that the Directors are indebted to the team for making RTD viable, saving tax payers’ dollars, and for working behind the scenes.

## V. Other Matters

Director Daly mentioned that he walked to the RTD Administrative Offices for today’s meeting from Denver Union Station.  The area was well lit and mostly construction free.  He asked why the pedestrian bridge is still closed.  Marla Lien said the elevator did not pass inspection.  She said the bridge should be open by the end of August.  Dave Genova said some fences may be up every so often as Denver Transit Partners finishes construction in and around the historic building

Director Bagley shared that he and Directors James, Menten, Rivera-Malpiede, and Solano attended the Fare Study meeting.  He said that it was very prudent for Board Members to participate with suggestions and by listening.  He commended staff on their work.

Director Walker commented on the APTA 2014 Transit Board Members & Board Support Seminar he attended the previous week.  He noted that Erin Klaas, Senior Board Office Assistant, and Barbara McManus, Board Office Administrator also attended.  He shared some of the improvements in the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority.  He also said that he, along with Erin Klaas and Barbara McManus, distributed promotional material to motivate attendees to register for the 2015 conference to be hosted by RTD.  Paula Perdue, Executive Director of the Board Office, said that one of the promotional materials handed out was a copy of transportation-inspired lyrics to Rocky Mountain High written by Director Walker.  She said Director Walker performed the song during the conference.  Director Rivera-Malpiede volunteered as “deputy” to assist Director Walker in planning next year’s conference.  Director Walker thanked the Board Office Staff for their work preparing the promotional material for the conference.

Director Folska asked if RTD has chosen a consultant for the Fare Study Task Force.  Phil Washington said that not yet and that the Board will be informed when it happens.

Director Deadwyler inquired regarding new signage at Denver Union Station to aid new riders find their way.  Chair Sisk replied that he knows staff is working on this item.

Director Lasater mentioned that he visited Denver Union Station over the weekend and the water feature was not working, disappointing a young family.  He asked as to when it would be available.  Phil Washington said that it should be working.  Dave Genova asked for the specific time that it was not working.  He said that the feature is still in testing period but at that time it should have been working.

Chair Sisk said that Phil Washington and he have been invited to a meeting with Union Pacific’s CEO next Tuesday, August 5th.  They will not attend the committee meetings scheduled for that evening.

Phil Washington said the Market Street canopy will be disassembled in the upcoming week.

## VI. Adjourn
