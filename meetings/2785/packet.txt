Subject:

Recommendation for Contract Award to
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. for RFP
18FH013, On-Call Construction Materials
Testing and Inspection Services

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a Work Order contract to RockSol Consulting
Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for On-Call Construction Materials Testing and
Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four years, with four one-year options to extend the
period of performance. Funding for the initial tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding
for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
On May 18, 2018, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for On-Call Construction Materials Testing
and Inspection Services. The selected firm would conduct testing of construction materials that is
required within RTD specifications, and specialized inspections of construction that lies outside the
expertise of RTD staff. This work is currently performed under a previous contract that was awarded in
2008, but that contract is approaching the end of its period of performance, so it was necessary to
bring in a new firm that could perform the necessary services for upcoming projects.
The RFP included the following evaluation criteria:
1. Project Team – Weight 30%
 Qualifications and ability of professional personnel
 Experience on similar projects as a team
 Commitment of key staff members
2. Firm Capability – Weight 30%
 Firm’s ability to do project concurrent with existing and project work load
 Firm’s to provide entire spectrum of testing services identified in the Scope of Work
3. Past Performance on Similar Projects – Weight 20%
 Demonstrated ability to control costs
 Demonstrated ability to perform quality work
 Demonstrated ability to meet project schedules
4. Work Location – Weight 10%
 Ability to support projects throughout RTD’s entire District boundaries
5. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises – Weight 10%
 DBE Program Plan demonstrating DBE commitment
 Identify past performance with DBE programs

Packet Pg. 40

11.A




Demonstrate how DBE firms will be integrated into team structure
Demonstrate creative initiatives, technical support and outreach efforts for DBE
participation

Since this is an Architectural/Engineering procurement, selection was based solely on the Technical
Proposal without reference or consideration to cost.
On June 29, 2018, seven written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:
 Geocal
 Ground Engineering Consultants, Inc. and TRIAX Engineering
 Kleinfelder, Inc.
 Kumar and Associates, Inc.
 RockSol Consulting Group, Inc.
 Vine Laboratories, Inc.
 Yeh and Associates, Inc.
On July 26, 2018, the five-member selection committee met to review and score the proposals. As a
result of this meeting and by unanimous consensus, RockSol Consulting, Inc. was selected as the best
technically qualified firm.
DISCUSSION
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. is recommended for contract award as the most technically qualified
consultant team for the following reasons:
 Project Manager is licensed Professional Engineer with 33 years experience
 Highly experienced technicians
 RockSol along with subs Vivid and ITC provide qualifications necessary to provide full spectrum
of expected services
 Capacity matrix provided available resources and commitments
 Utilization of Cost Projection Reports to track budget
 Certification to international quality management standard ISO 9001
 Team members familiar with RTD management systems such as Aconex and Quality Records
Database
 RockSol and Vivid provide two labs within the District for good coverage
 Although RockSol is a DBE, they provided a very detailed DBE Program Plan in their role as a
prime contractor for this work
Although cost was not a consideration for selection, RockSol provided a cost proposal that was
consistent with RTD’s Independent Cost Estimate. RockSol’s workscope will initially include two
upcoming projects:
 Commuter Rail Maintenance of Way Building and Related Infrastructure
 20th and Chestnut Turn Lane
DBE INVOLVEMENT
RTD specified a DBE goal of 16% for the Work to be performed under the resulting contract. Since
RockSol is a certified DBE, they have committed to exceeding the RTD goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 41

11.A

RTD began negotiations on August 6, 2018. We have concluded negotiations with an initial pricing of
$30,000 for the two tasks identified in Discussion. Funding for these tasks is included in the 2018
Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these
services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a
contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for OnCall Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four
years, with four one-year options to extend the period of performance. Funding for the initial
tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the
budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. Rather, continue utilizing the existing
consultant contract for all testing and inspection needs. This is not recommended. Although the
Board has previously authorized an extension of this consultant’s contract through 2019 to
complete their current work on the SERE and NMRL projects, the Period of Performance including
option years is approaching its end and the recommended firm provided the best proposal going
forward.

Authorization
for
Additional
Acquisition for Eagle P3 Project

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018
Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties as
necessary for constructed infrastructure on the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Goal – Task Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD issued an RFP for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the Eagle P3 Commuter
Rail Project and contractually, RTD has been required to obtain possession and make available to the
contractor right of way necessary for the construction of the project. By Resolution 001 Series of
2010, Resolution 017 Series of 2011, Resolution 006, Series of 2012 and Resolution 012 Series of
2012, the Board found and determined certain property to be necessary to be acquired within the
corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose. As construction on the project was completed, it
was determined that survey work to verify location of certain constructed infrastructure should be done
and as a result of the survey work, additional property needs have been identified as required for the
project. Specific legal descriptions will be prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This
process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of the additional property
identified.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by survey and authorize the
General Manager and/or Project Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the Eagle P3 Project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the Eagle P3 Project Team that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties

Packet Pg. 43

11.B

as necessary for construction of the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorizing staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This is not recommended as failure to acquire required
properties would be contrary to federal guidelines.

Construction Award for RFP 18 DB-001 –
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash LLC in the amount
not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract
is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals – Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The Boulder maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1978 and opened for operations in
February 1979. Original design capacity of the garage was based on 96 buses. Currently, 123 buses are
being stored and maintained including washing the busses at this facility.
DISCUSSION
The system is a two lane bus wash. The original wash was installed in 1979 and then replaced in 1995.
This new project is considered to be a full rebuild. This system has been increasingly difficult to repair as
parts are becoming obsolete. The project was advertised as an RFP. The RFP was advertised on June
14, 2018. Proposals were due on August 8, 2018. Qualifications, experience, personnel, and cost were
all a part of the award criteria. Twelve firms were originally notified of the project. Four teams ended up
on the proposers list, but only two teams submitted.
1. AutoAuto Wash LLC
AutoAuto Wash LLC – Demolition
InterClean Equipment - Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
Galloway Engineering, Inc – Engineer of Record
Security Plumbing – Plumbing
Zapplin Electrical, Inc. – Electrical
DeAndrea Concrete – Concrete
2. Gilmore Construction Corporation
Kubat – Wash Equipment Installer
NS Corporation – Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
ADK – Electrical Design Build Subcontractor
MSI – Mechanical / Plumbing Design-Build Subcontractor
ABO Group – Architect
Proposals were rated in the following manner:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Cost – 40%
Key Staff and Technical Experience – 25%
Technical Approach – 25%
Technical Innovation / Creativity – 10%

Gilmore Construction Corporation cost proposal came in at $1,174,240 and AutoAuto Wash was at
$841,111.48.
The selection committee was made up of three evaluators. The evaluators were Shayne Ford of the
Facilities Engineering Division, Anthony Romero, Boulder Maintenance Manager for Bus Operations, and
Edward Callies, Boulder Facilities Maintenance Supervisor. The evaluation meeting was held on August
22, 2018. The committee’s combined evaluations clearly identified AutoAuto Wash to be the most
qualified proposer. Their proposal was $333,129 less than Gilmore Construction Corporation and their
proposal strengths were technical approach with their proposed equipment, technical innovation,
creativity, and previous project experience with vehicle wash systems.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
There was no SBE goal set for this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Local funding for this contract is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2018
Amended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Re-advertise the project later in the year. Re-advertising
could gain additional competition, but could also lose competition or have no proposers.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Cancel the project and utilize the funds to repair the
system as it breaks down. This is not recommended because the existing system is difficult to
repair as parts are becoming more obsolete.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2019.
General Manager’s Goals
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed
Policy for development of the upcoming year’s budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November 2017
for the 2018 fiscal year. Those changes were related to 1) wording clarification, consisting of reference
to the APE where necessary, 2) the substitution of the word “monetize” for “sell” in Revenue Policies
#6, and 3) Debt Policies #5 were updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at
that date.
DISCUSSION
For 2019, the following changes are proposed:
1) Re-write of the Investment Policies section to read, “RTD financial assets are managed in accordance
with the RTD Investment Policy Statement which is reviewed and approved by the RTD Board on an
annual basis.”
2) Wording clarification consisting of substitution of the words “Mid-Term Financial Plan” for Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP and Annual Program Evaluation (APE) where necessary.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement changes as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2019
Recommended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approves and adopts the revised Fiscal Policy Statement for 2019.

Packet Pg. 52

11.D

2. Board of Directors further modifies the recommended changes.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2019 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because RTD’s
Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to best
practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

2019 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every three years in the mid and long-term budgets
to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to establish a
fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Mid-Term Financial Plan
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to monetize such property and equipment to
enhance cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax forecasting
containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter), mid-term (six-year
SBP and APE period) and long-term (30-year Financial Plan period). The purpose is
to provide RTD with expert economic analysis and sales and use tax forecasts using
sophisticated financial modeling techniques not available internally.

using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
RTD mission statement elements, Board strategic goals, and other relevant
criteria.

2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks APE and/or financial plan (see #7

programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to
provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected
increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic
downturns affecting revenue. The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System
operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:
the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining
unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund
and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately



11.D.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD
will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board-appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board
approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need
for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled
major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases.
The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted operating
reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate service or
project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment
of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish a reserve for future construction under the FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Management Reserve will be appropriated at a sufficient level each
year to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule, relating to
logistics or cost savings opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is
adopted, and will not be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital
or operating activity.
7. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding to
complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from the FISA will
be subject to Board approval. Funding of the FISA will be provided from the sources
identified in the Board approved Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and other sources
approved by the Board.

RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

11.D.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 16, 2018

8. All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve for
future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund the
(non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

1. Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures.
2. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed the
lesser of the expected useful life of the asset or a maximum of 40 years.
3. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a policy
of full disclosure on every financial report and official statement will be followed.
4. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures and the net revenue coverage ratio will be analyzed.
5. It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level
in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive
lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be possible with
lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

2018 Budget Transfer for Contracted ServicesAccess-a-Ride

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service line items of the Transdev-OnDemand budget to the service line item of the MV Transportation budget to cover the variation in costs
incurred as a result of the re-assignment of Access-a-Ride service to MV Transportation in 2018. The
total dollar amount of the budget transfer requested is $535,000.
General Manager’s 2018 goals:
 Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
 Task Goal #1 Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) service providers, MV Transportation, Via Mobility Services,
Transdev, and Transdev-On-Demand to provide Access-a-Ride (AaR) paratransit services. Three of the
service providers (MV, Via Mobility Services and Transdev) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide the
service. The fourth provider (Transdev-On-Demand) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide
AaR service. The current Access-a-Ride contracts were implemented in October of 2017 following the
re-bid of the service in 2016.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the non-dedicated-vehicle
service provider (Transdev-On-Demand) was scheduled to hire a sufficient number of operators in order
to accommodate 100% of their allotted revenue hours. Due to a variety of reason, including taxi
operators migrating to on-demand services providers such as Uber and Lyft, Transdev-On-Demand has
had a difficult time attracting and retaining enough operators in order to meet their targeted service
delivery for RTD. Despite their aggressive hiring campaigns, they continued to request route closures
due to insufficient personnel. The culmination of hiring challenges forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center
to assign more service to MV Transportation than budgeted. Note: The forces working against the nondedicated vehicle provider have not had a similar impact on our dedicated-vehicle service providers.
The reliance on MV Transportation to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that our non-dedicated vehicle
provider has been unable to deliver, has resulted in an increase in the 2018 costs for MV Transportation
and a decrease in 2018 costs for Transdev-On-Demand. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer budget
funds to ensure that MV Transportation invoices will be paid for service provided through the end of
2018.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Transdev-On-Demand
service budget that can be transferred into the MV Transportation service budget.

Packet Pg. 71

11.E

ALTERNATIVES:
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service line items of
the Transdev-On-Demand budget to the service line item of the MV Transportation budget to
cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the re-assignment of Access-a-Ride service
to MV Transportation in 2018. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer requested is
$535,000.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for MV Transportation
service.

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a cost of $276,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2019).
This action represents the fifth and final year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included
in the annual budget.
Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Core Goal #5: Effective Communications & Community Outreach
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by an evaluation committee that
recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and to date has
assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special
reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process.
The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST) was passed on December 4, 2015, and the
federal lobbyists played a key role in representing RTD’s needs in this reauthorization bill. With the build
out of FasTracks, the lobbyists need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new plans
for the Executive Office’s infrastructure bill to be introduced sometime in the near future. When the bill
is revealed, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and
monitoring the amendments and progress of the proposed language.

Packet Pg. 73

12.F

In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the US Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation, as well as
advising staff on proper protocols for these agencies.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves in an important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at cost of $276,000 (January 1 through December 31,
2019). This action represents the fifth and final year of a five-year contract. Funding for this
contract is included in the annual budget.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor (Squire
Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in liaison
services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals were reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approve proposed amendments to the existing Executive Employment Agreement,
consistent with the draft amendments considered by the Committee at its October 9, 2018 meeting.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee appointed on September 11,
2018, Chair of the Board and member of the committee Doug Tisdale and GMOC Chair Jeff Walker to
enter into discussions with the General Manager to review and discuss the consideration of various
potential amendments to be made to the current Executive Employment Agreement. These meetings
resulted in the preparation of two separate proposed versions of contract amendments, each of which
adheres to the guidelines and parameters imposed upon Board Chair Tisdale and GMOC Chair Walker in
the September 11, 2018 discussion. These proposed amendments will enhance RTD’s position as to its
leadership.
DISCUSSION
All General Manager’s Oversight and Performance Management Committee agenda’s, supporting
documentation have been sent to the full Board and the minutes, transcripts and video with closed
captioning are available on the Board of Director’s meeting portal.

twelve (12) months after the conclusion of his employment with the District, Mr. Genova will not,

Arbitration. In the event any Dispute cannot be resolved through mediation
the parties agree to submit such dispute(s) to binding non-appealable arbitration within ten (10)
business days from the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set out in Paragraph 12(a), or the

the arbitration hearing and the filing of post arbitration briefs, if any. The parties shall equally
share the American Arbitration Association’s administrative fees, arbitrator’s fees, and any other
administrative or scheduling costs charged by the American Arbitration Association or the
arbitrator, but each party shall be responsible for such party’s own attorneys’ fees and costs. The
non-prevailing party in arbitration shall reimburse the prevailing party, which prevailing party

charged by the American Arbitration Association and/or the arbitrator as described above.

thereof.
(c)
Temporary Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the alternative dispute
resolution steps and arbitration obligations of the parties provided for in Paragraphs 12(a) and (b)
above, either party may seek enforcement of this Agreement through injunctive relief in a court of
law located in Denver, Colorado to secure temporary injunctive relief until an arbitration can be
conducted with the understanding that all issues of final relief shall be decided by arbitration. To
facilitate temporary injunctive relief, a court of law shall have the authority under this Agreement
to make interim rulings of law as needed to issue temporary injunctive relief (inclusive of partial

Mid--Term

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1 and 7, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s 2018 Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis,
RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and
operating programs.” Capital Improvement Policy 7 states that “RTD will prepare an annual update of
the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE) which will be integrated with the SBP incorporating
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement costs, service
levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital and operating programs.”
The Mid-term Financial Plan is a six-year financial plan and consists of the Base System SBP and
FasTracks APE. The SBP includes only service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6%
sales/use tax, and FasTracks operations activity. The APE includes FasTracks expense and projects
(non-operational) funded from the FasTracks 0.4% sales/use tax.
Updated annually, the Mid-term Financial Plan provides important cash flow planning information used to
determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as services that the District
can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the Mid-term Financial Plan serves as
the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the planning process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the District.
The other major component of the plans is the estimate of available revenues during the six-year time
period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will have
adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use
tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (annual budget), medium term (Mid-term

Packet Pg. 90

12.H

Financial Plan) and long term (Financial Plan). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds
School of Business for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement and State of Good Repair
priorities. Projects are constrained to operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources
available for their completion and operation.
The Mid-term Financial Plan also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit
funding through the Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council
of Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the SBP/APE qualifying projects are
included in the TIP.
Projected Base and FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2025-2040 are presented
separately in the Long-Range Financial Plan.
DISCUSSION
Base System
The attached Mid-term Financial Plan for the Base System incorporates the 2018 Amended Budget with
necessary adjustments and best estimates at this time. The Base System plan drafts were presented to
the Financial Administration and Audit Committee on May 15th and July 10th for discussion. The final
presentation follows in this document on October 9th with staff recommendation for Board adoption on
October 16th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2019-2024 projected cash flow through the extension of the
2018 Amended Budget. The column titled “Amended Budget 2018” in Exhibit I incorporates
revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and subsequent proposed
amendment.
The Base System plan is balanced through the six-year period after incorporating into the
projections:
1) March-2018 sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business
2) Minimum/must-have requested capital and expense projects approved in the previous year’s
plan with costs in outlying years, including fleet requirements
3) High priority new project requests within State of Good Repair parameters, including fleet
requirements
4) Reductions, eliminations or deferrals of non-critical requested projects
5) SOGR allowance in 2024
6) Use of previously-issued debt and internal funds to support planned fleet purchases
7) New COP (Certificates of Participation) financing issued in 2022 to support planned fleet
purchases
7) Contribution to reserve funds in total in 3 of the 6 years of the plan
8) No service reductions other than reprogrammed fixed route service through this period
Exhibit I summarizes the Base System 2019-2024 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:

Packet Pg. 91

12.H

 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $125.3 million in 2019 is based on the recommended fare change
proposal presented by staff in September 2018 and adopted by the Board. Fare revenue
in 2019 is projected to be 8.8% above the 2018 budget per the recommendation. The
fare revenue through the six-year period is sourced from assumptions in the fare change
proposal. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March-2018 semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2019-2024, plus an adjustment for reinstatement of
marijuana sales tax beginning in 2019. In all years of the Mid-term Financial plan, the
medium baseline forecast from CU is used. Of the total forecasted amounts, 0.6% is
apportioned to the Base System. (Line 2)
o The CU-Leeds forecast contains confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The
mean forecast for 2018 is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $584.6 million
on the low side and $659.7 million for the upper bound (at 1% sales/use tax rate).
The upper bound estimate is 5.9% higher than the medium baseline forecast,
meaning that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat
strongly over the next year. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk to the
forecast, with a 6.1% lower bound. The values of the high and low forecast
bounds are computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability
exists that the interval between low and high forecast values will contain the actual
value of the variable being predicted.
 Grant revenue projected receipts are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area Consumer
Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA and
miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2019. (Line 4)
 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and then adjusted for known items and
necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.6%
2023:
2.6%
2024:
2.6%
 Operating expenses include higher costs for purchased transportation contracts in all years
of the plan as various contracts are re-bid. The additional costs are estimated at
approximately $7.5 million each year beginning with 2019 and then escalated.
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be operated
by RTD in 2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L and 324, Route 73
extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and Anschutz Medical Campus
Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP. RTD costs will be reimbursed in
full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from the applicable municipalities.
Determination will be made in future years whether to continue such service at RTD’s
cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, R Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, BRT, HLine extension, and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource drivers
on a full-allocation basis for all years of the plan. In addition, a portion of overhead costs

Packet Pg. 92

12.H








is also allocated for the Commuter Rail Lines. Thus, Base total expenses are reduced by
the amount of the allocation. Prior to 2017, the allocation was made on an incremental
basis; it was changed to full allocation including administrative and support costs
beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2020 and then escalated at the CPI rate for 2021-2024. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.30/gallon in 2019 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2019:
2.5%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.2%
2023:
2.3%
2024:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2019, which is same cost per gallon used in the
2018 budget, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 The line item for expense projects (O&M) includes specifically identified minimum/musthave operating and maintenance projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs
in outlying years, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities. These
projects are detailed in Exhibit III. Other projects may be added based on available cash
flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at year-end. Specific
projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV.
o It should be noted that included in the operating projects line item is an allocation to
FasTracks for certain projects that serve both the Base System and FasTracks. Also, a
SOGR allowance of $15.5 million is included in the year 2024. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year by
1) using debt amortization schedules for current debt and 2) forecasting new interest expense
on anticipated new debt issued based on forward interest rate curves. (Line 16)
The line item for capital expenditures includes specifically identified minimum/must-have
capital projects approved in the previous year’s plan with costs in outlying years, plus the
minimum required new fleet, and high priority new project requests based on SOGR priorities,
detailed in Exhibit II. Dollar amounts of the new fleet are determined so as not to exceed cash
flow constraints determined in the plan model. Other projects may be added based on
available cash flow if sales tax revenue improves or there are excess fund balances at yearend. Specific projects will be determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 19)
Regarding the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted operating
reserve:
 Staff recommends that the Board-appropriated fund be funded at a minimum of $3
million in 2019, partially drawn in 2020-2021 to help balance the Base System plan,
and funded again at $3 million each year 2022-2024. This fund is projected to reach a
balance of $22.8 million in 2024. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund not be funded until 2022 and then
at $3 million each year in 2022-2024. This fund is projected to reach a balance of
$9.0 million in 2024. Per the 2018 Amended Budget, the capital replacement fund

Packet Pg. 93

12.H










was drawn to zero in 2018 to support capital expenditures (fleet acquisition). (Lines
21 and 34)
 The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve was established in 2017 and funded
with available cash flow. Staff recommends that the unrestricted operating fund be
drawn in 2019, 2020 and minimally in 2023 to help balance the Base System plan,
and then funded with available cash flow in 2022 and 2024. The plan will apply
available dollars toward the operating fund such that it reaches $62.4 million in 2024.
(Lines 22 and 35)
 The total of these three funds is projected to be $94.2 million in 2024.
A transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of FasTracks operations is not anticipated to
be necessary over the course of this six-year plan. (Line 23)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
New debt issuance will become necessary in the plan. The combination of Base System fare
revenue revised downward and higher expenses from purchased transportation costs has
made the issuance of $23.1 million in new COPs likely in 2022. (Line 25)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt) by using debt amortization schedules. Principal
payments are forecast on both existing and new debt balances. (Line 26)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at 12/31/18,
estimated changes to restricted reserves, available project funds, and the use of previouslyissued COP-bond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
The plan is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted year-end
fund balance. The objective is to maintain a minimum unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$2 million each year through 2024 while supporting a minimum critical level of capital and
expense projects and building reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its Mid-term Financial Plan for
any Title VI impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service
changes specified in the plan will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process
prior to final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the plan, Title VI
impacts are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements
(repairs, replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided
and a statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FasTracks
The underlying assumptions for the 2018 FasTracks plan are consistent with those used in the Base
System:
 Fare revenues are projected based on the fare structure changes approved by the Board in
September 2018, adding revenue for new lines at their projected opening dates.
 Sales and use tax projections for the 0.4% sales and use tax incorporate the March 2018
Leeds forecasts, adjusted for reinstatement of the sales tax on recreational marijuana.
 Grant revenues are based on existing grant agreements and past trends, adjusted at CPI as
appropriate.
 Additional fixed guideway grants are assumed beginning nine years after corridors enter
revenue service.
 Interest income on available balance is projected using the same methodology as for the Base
System.
 The cost allocations to FasTracks from the Base System and the FasTracks “rubber tire”
service increase feed directly from the Base System plan.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the Eagle Project are derived from the Concession
Agreement.
 Operating and maintenance costs for the North Metro project include startup costs to prepare
for revenue service under RTD operation.
 Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project are assumed at
0.3% of installed asset value, starting seven years after the corridors enter revenue service.
The total FasTracks project budget through 2020 included in the FasTracks plan is approximately $5.6
billion, and is unchanged from the 2017 plan. There was one minor change to the project-by-project
costs, to reflect a transfer of $250,000 from program-wide capital costs to the Southeast Rail Extension

Packet Pg. 95

12.H

to pay for artwork along the corridor that was not eligible for reimbursement under the federal grant.
Project-by-project costs are included as Exhibit VII.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current plan would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the
FasTracks plan is a dynamic tool, which is updated annually as projects move towards completion and
any changes approved by the Board are incorporated.
The projected FasTracks cash flow through 2024 shows revenues and accumulated fund balances
sufficient to cover expenditures. Therefore, the plan does not require funding from either the Base
System or the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to support FasTracks corridor operations and
maintenance. The cash flow by year through 2024 is presented as Exhibit VIII.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended Mid-term Financial Plan provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive
unrestricted year-end fund balance in each year of the plan while growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the plan, and may challenge
staff to present new options and solutions during the 2019 budget period.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts the 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan.
2. Defer the adoption of a 2019-2024 Mid-term Financial Plan to a later date. This is not
recommended because the Mid-term Financial Plan identifies the capital programs, expenditures,
and service guidelines for the 2019 budget process and adoption of the plan serves as a
confirmation of the Board of Directors' vision for the 2019 Budget.

Packet Pg. 96

12.H

Provide staff additional direction in the selection of assumptions for the projected 2019-2024 Mid-term
Financial Plan. This is not the desired action and will result in delay of the Mid-term Financial Plan
adoption and possible delay in the 2019 budget process.

Project is to develop concept, preliminary design, possible land acquisition, final
design and construction of a 6 bus bay transfer station within the new Clear Creek
Crossing development in Wheatridge. This station will replace the current Applewood
Transfer Station that is located on property having a 3-year lease (6-month
termination clause) with WalMart at 38th Avenue and Youngfield Street. This new
transfer station will include RTD standard improvements including but not limited to:
lighting, landscaping, shelters, benches, trash receptacles, typical safety/security
components, double unit driver’s relief station, bike amenities and other
improvements based on site specific needs that will be identified as part of the Site
Plan approval process with the local agencies.

Traveler Information Systems (Real- Civic Center Plaza (CCP)
Time) Development Support + 1 FTE

Project Description
Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

Highblock Replacement @ Central

Project is demolition of the existing 22 year old concrete highblocks and replacement
with new metal and fiberglass ADA compliant highblocks on the Central Corridor from
20th & Welton to 30th & Downing. The existing highblocks are over 22 years old. Due
to the high use of magnesium chloride (MgCl) and age, the highblocks are rusting and
the concrete is cracking/breaking. They are very unsightly and are a blight on the

Project is the demolition of the existing 17 year old concrete highblocks and

Southwest Corridor. The existing highblocks are over 17 years old. Due to the high use
of magnesium chloride (MgCl) and age, the highblocks are rusting and the concrete is
cracking/breaking. They are very unsightly and are a blight on the neighborhood
which is going through a revitalization.
The proposed Cab Signaling project would enable RTD Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs) to
constantly display, on the dash of the cab, the maximum speed a train is permitted to
operate based on signal indications and track conditions ahead of the train. The
wayside signal logic transmits a 100 hertz pulsed signal into the rail using 7 unique
pulsed rates, each having a different speed limit associated with it. If an Operator fails
to comply to a reduced speed limit zone and begins braking within a predetermined
grace period, the LRV will automatically apply brakes and come to a complete stop.
The project costs are estimated to provide for new software and hardware for all of
our current LRV fleet. Additionally the project funds would provide for new signal
software for each of our existing corridors that currently have Automatic Train Stop
(ATS) functionality.

Project is to replace the bus wash at East Metro. Bus wash is 15 years old and will
have reached the end of its useful life. The bus wash is breaking down more
frequently and repair parts are getting more difficult to find.
The existing dry fire sprinkler piping is deteriorating. It is plumbed with a thin gauge
pipe that is subject to corrosion damage because of condensation in the piping
reacting with the air in the system. The piping, fittings, and other related material
required for system repairs are no longer available. RTD has a very limited stock of
these materials remaining. Deterioration will continue, so eventually spare material
will be unavailable. Renovating the existing dry fire sprinkler piping systems will
increase system reliability and safety for RTD now and in the future. Building
maintenance will be reduced as a result of a new dry fire sprinkler piping system

Project Description
Project is to replace existing particulate sensors with CO NO2 sensors to monitor air
quality and activate ventilation systems at Platte facility. The existing building
automation system (BAS) monitors air quality in the bus parking garage using
particulate sensors. The particulate sensors send a signal to the BAS to activate
ventilation systems when a programmed level of particulates is reached. Particulate
sensor technology is outdated and no longer available for this application. The current
method of determining the concentration of tailpipe emissions is using a CO NO2
sensor. CO (carbon monoxide) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) are the main components
of bus exhaust. The existing particulate sensor technology is outdated, unreliable and

Project Description
RTD owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the University
Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the existing
Security Command Center Operations to this location. This space is ideal for our needs
for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times what is currently being
used. This space will also provide for the Map 21 recommendation of an (EOC)
Emergency Operations Center for the District. The facility will be designed primarily
as a Security Command Center, but also function as an EOC (Emergency Operating
Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's operating divisions by creating
a facility that could support and operate Light Rail Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT
Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a redundant common operating
facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an EOC activation. The design will
allow for redundant face to face operations, should a large scale emergency occur.
The facility would also provide a large server room, designed to support both security
operations and corporate IT redundancies. The existing Security Command Center
would be re-purposed into the Transit Police Division as a “Field Operations” building
to consolidate services between the Transit Police Division, Allied Universal Security
and the Denver Police Department contracted police. The current view room would
be converted into a large conference and training room. The current server room
would be surrendered to the IT Division for continued use to support security and RTD

ambitious and necessary effort includes a number of elements: 1) a continuous
improvement process, 2) defining where RTD is in the life-cycle of a transit agency, 3)
integrating a comprehensive Systems Operations Assessment, 4) addressing a
changing workforce and changing demographics, 5) dealing with ridership growth
challenges and current downward bus ridership trends.

Project Description
Over the last several years, the rail system has grown significantly. As the rail system
grows so does the need for additional staff to maintain safe operations and provide
timely and reliable service to our customer base. With the growth, we are requesting
7 new positions, to include 3 Signal Traction Power Maintainers, 1 Rail Laborer, and 3
LRT Field Supervisors. Rail Ops is responsible for 5 separate corridors including West,
Downtown, East, Southeast and Southwest. With the current staffing level, it is
difficult to support and provide a timely response for each corridor. The lack of
coverage has a direct impact on our response times to incidents such as mechanical
failures, passenger accidents, requested operator assitance, etc. As we move forward,
it is imperative to have the correct number of personnel in a position where they can
assist/respond when needed to avoid major delays and maintain the safety of our
alignment. Our headcount has not kept pace and does not account for the fact that
our infrastructure is aging and requires continuous maintenance/replacement.

Mariposa Light Rail Division The drainage issue is occurring at the loading dock where there has been a settling of
the slab and upheaval of the drainage pipe which has resulted in the storm water not
being able to have a negative slope back to the main storm drainage pipe. Water is
pooling in the vicinity (up to 3 feet at times) and in the winter it is causing ice buildup
at the loading dock which makes this issue also safety related.

RTD offers to its Riders a versatile online payment system called FlexPass. The
FlexPass program helps move people by providing a fiscally sustainable program for
RTD as well as to employees of participating employers, and it helps contribute to
overall customer satisfaction. The program’s flexible nature enables employees to
choose their service level, vary passes from month-to-month, and enter or leave the
program at any time. Plus, it offers incentives for employers and employees to
participate including a pre-tax option. The program accounts for approximately $4.5
million in annual revenue and it continues to experience growth each year. In March
2010, RTD contracted with 360Media in Englewood, CO to provide and administer an
eCommerce website to provide services to FlexPass business customers and their
employees. The term of the agreement was for two (2) contract years and three (3)
one (1) year options. In 2014, RTD exercised the final option to retain the services of
360Media. It was envisioned that this eCommerce website will be replaced by RTD’s
SmartMedia system and that this function will be brought in-house in the near future.
Unfortunately, this solution is not currently budgeted for or in the immediate Smart
Card plans for implementation. It will most likely be discussed in 2020. Historically this
program was funded through a Smart Card line item which is no longer available.

After further analysis, it has been determined that the project will require $225,000 in
Operating and Maintenance Costs rather than the approved $75,000 in on-going
Operating and Maintenance. The additional funds are necessary because the cost of
the product is higher than we originally scoped. In addition, it has come to light that
there is a need for a new email service and text messaging provider in order to send
out the customized, targeted messages to riders. We are resubmitting this request to
ask for additional Operating and Maintenance funds to maintain and build upon the
product going forward. Communications is looking to implement a Rider Alert System
in order to communicate up-to-the-minute service alerts for our riders in timely
manner. The system will include a web-based interface that allows staff to create and
manage the thousands of service alerts that are sent out each year. The Alerts System
will be intuitive and fast to use, allowing simple alerts to be created in seconds. At the
same time, the system will offer fine grained control over selecting the specific route,
branch, trip, or stop an alert applies to, when an alert is in effect, and by what
channels (like emails, text messages, electronic signs, agency website, General Transit
Feed Specification real-time feeds and third party apps) the alerts should be
disseminated. The system will use templates to automatically generate appropriate
messages for all the dissemination channels.

This project will implement a District-wide comprehensive Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) solution to consolidate identified existing systems that create,
capture or store content at RTD to create a single point of access. The project scope
will include the development of policies, procedures, taxonomy and metadata for the
consistent identification, use, maintenance, retrieval, retention, and destruction of
data. The project also will include identification of personnel and tools required to
implement the policies and procedures, implementation of the system, and the
development of training and audit tools to support the ongoing utilization of the
system. The current project cost estimate beyond the approved scope for IQBG
assumes that RTD will own and maintain the hardware and software in-house. As part
of its scope, IQBG will recommend a path forward for procurement of ECM tools,
which could include externally hosted systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems
instead of in-house tools. If a hosted or SaaS system is selected, the cost structure of
the project and future staffing levels will change.

TrapezeCOM has been the only customer complaint and commendation tracking tool
in use for the past 8 years at RTD and most departments find it difficult to use and
limited in its functionality. Various departments/projects like Communications,
FasTracks, and the SmartCard system use their own customer issue
tracking/management tools to collect customer data and feedback that is not
integrated. Reporting from TrapezeCOM is also not conducive to the needs of the
District. Customer Care and other departments, including Legal, are unable to pull
reports to view a customer's overall interaction/relationship with RTD. In addition, the
current system has no analytics capabilities, so we are unable to pull reports to
understand complaints about specific routes, lines, stops, etc. The recommendation
from some of the studies like the SmartCard Business Process Re-engineering (SMT
BPR) and Fare Systems visioning exercise was that RTD procure and implement an
Enterprise Level CRM system that would meet the needs of all departments and
projects. The first phase (2018) of this project is to implement a contact center
customer relationship management tool for servicing customer needs and to replace
the TrapezeCOM functionality as a customer service case management need. The
future phases (2019 and beyond) will be to integrate and implement the service
module to other needs of the RTD district towards marketing/sales.

Real-Time Passenger Information (RTPI) provides RTD passengers with predictive
arrival times for their next bus. IT and Marketing are working toward providing
predictive arrival times for buses via three primary delivery systems: 1) General
Transit Feed Specification for Real Time or GTFS-RT (which feeds the information to
Google Maps and some third party application developers), 2) Passenger Information
Display (PID) signs, and 3) the RTD website. Additional funding will be required to
implement future phases of this project. This will include planning, design, and
development of a third party developer portal that will allow the open developer
community to access rich data based on APIs (application programming interface, as
opposed to the flat file/GTFS-RT protocol), and build interesting and contextually rich
applications for our ridership and trip planning components. Also integration with IVR
and RiderAlert data will require additional funding.

RTD’s Rider Alert system is being replaced in late 2018/early 2019 with a much more
intuitive and robust system that allows for much more detailed and refined alerts to
subscribers, including down to a route/block/stop level. With this new system, RTD
will be able to communicate information related to dropped trips, detours by
impacted stops, disruptions by rail station, etc. Customer Care’s Digital Customer
Relations Liaison team will assume responsibility for increased outbound
communication to passengers, and will also assume responsibility from Bus Ops
Dispatch on certain detours and planned disruptions. With the addition of two FTE,
the team will now be at six and will need a Lead/Supervisor rather than reporting
directly to the Senior Manager of Customer Care.

Project Description
Request is for one (1) new FTE position in Marketing to manage agency-wide
promotional item purchases, inventory and brand consistency. RTD can improve the
management of promotional items by developing a centralized promotional (promo)
item procurement program. This program would address promo item needs for all
RTD departments; manage agency purchases of promo items; manage vendor
selection in conjunction with RTD Procurement; develop an ordering and fulfillment
program for all departments; manage an inventory of surplus promotional items and
provide an efficient and cost-effective promo item program for the entire agency.

In an age where organizations across markets and industries depend heavily on
technology to operate successfully, the IT Auditor plays an increasingly important role
in helping to manage and respond to risks. Information Technology (IT) Audit was
introduced in 2015 to ensure that RTD was prepared for the current global scenario of
Information Technology. IT Audit was introduced with Board of Directors support, but
the resources that accommodate the successful introduction and ensure efficient and
effective work are still needed. This request will ensure that RTD Audit has the
resources needed to provide assurance on the protection of assets, data integrity,
system reliability and information security as required by the Board of Directors.

The project will add one (1) FTE union hourly employee for the purpose of supporting
the growth of the Finance department's responsibilities resulting from the SmartCard
contract termination with Celina Inc. The Accounting department has taken on the
additional workload of ECO/College and Stored Value production, quality control,
packaging and distribution. The process of personalizing and encoding cards is in
excess of 8 hours per day and will continue to grow with introduction of MyRide
program.
In 2019, RTD is offering tickets to the employee event for the employee + 3 for a total
of 4 tickets plus lunch. Increases after 2020 are attributed to assuming the cost of the
venue will go up or having to change venues which will be more expensive.

Security Command Center University Project

Location
Districtwide

Project Description
RTD currently owns a vacant 10,000 square foot facility which is located at the
University Station under the existing parking structure. This request is to relocate the
existing Security Command Center Operations to this location. We feel this space is
ideal for our needs for many reasons, including its size, which is more than 4 times
what is currently being used. This space will also provide for the Map 21
recommendation of an (EOC) Emergency Operations Center for the District. The
facility will be designed primarily as a Security Command Center, but also function as
an EOC (Emergency Operating Center). This design would greatly benefit the District's
operating divisions by creating a facility that could support and operate Light Rail
Control, Bus Dispatch and the IT Division during critical incidents. It would serve as a
redundant common operating facility in emergencies for all disciplines while under an
EOC activation. The design will allow for redundant face to face operations, should a
large scale emergency occur. The facility would also provide a large server room,
designed to support both security operations and corporate IT redundancies. The
existing Security Command Center would be re-purposed into the Transit Police
Division as a “Field Operations” building to consolidate services between the Transit
Police Division, Allied Universal Security and the Denver Police Department contracted
police. The current view room would be converted into a large conference and
training room. The current server room would be surrendered to the IT Division for
continued use to support security and RTD corporate networks.

Security Increase on LR Vehicles *

Districtwide

RTD currently provides armed uniform security officers along our light rail corridors,
facilities, and system wide. CR has a security officer on every train. These officers
provide security response, patrol, and conduct fare inspection for our rail system,
vehicles, and facilities. RTD Security officers are instrumental in the operation of our
department as well as provide services to keep our employees, patrons, and public
safe while on RTD. This request will provide for a staged increased such that every LRV
will have security presence.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopts the 2018 Long Range Financial Plan.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s Goals for 2018:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
The RTD Long Range Financial Plan serves as an extension of the six-year Mid-term Financial Plan
through the regional planning time horizon, which is currently 2040. This plan is submitted to the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for inclusion in the Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP), and projects must be included in order to receive federal funding. RTD’s lenders also utilize the
plan to ensure that RTD has the financial capacity to repay its debt.
DISCUSSION
The Long Range Financial Plan focuses on ensuring that RTD can fund the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the Base System and the FasTracks corridors while repaying its debt obligations. Key
elements of the plan for the years 2025-2040 include the following:






Base System Operations and Capital Replacement
o Continued operating costs based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at the Consumer
Price Index (CPI)
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation assumed based on 0.5% of installed cost of
existing asset inventory, escalated at CPI
o Additional service for the SH 119 project at its completion
o Replacement of revenue fleet and other assets based on current asset inventory and
replacement schedules, adjusted for major assets purchased in the SBP period
o Replacement of a maintenance facility in 2025 to meet projected capacity needs
FasTracks Operations and Capital Maintenance
o Cost allocations from the Base System based on the final year of the SBP, escalated at the
Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o FasTracks-funded rubber tire service increase based on the final year of the SBP, escalated
at the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
o Eagle operating and maintenance costs derived from the Concession Agreement
o North Metro operations and maintenance costs for RTD operations, escalated at CPI
o Annual allowance for major rehabilitation of corridors outside the Eagle Project assumed at
0.3%-0.5% of installed asset value based on age of corridor, escalated at CPI
Revenue Projections

Packet Pg. 126

12.I

Sales and use tax forecasts from the March 2018 Leeds forecasts, adjusted for
reinstatement of the sales tax on recreational marijuana
o Farebox revenues forecasts based on the 2019 fare change adopted by the Board in
September 2018
o Fare increases tied to the CPI assumed every third year
o Future formula grants forecast based on historic appropriations, escalated at CPI
o Additional fixed guideway grants assumed for FasTracks corridors beginning nine years
after corridors enter revenue service
FasTracks corridor construction
o Additional projects to meet commitments included in the environmental clearances for
federally-funded corridors
o



Exhibit I shows the projected cash flow for the Base System and FasTracks by 5-6 year increments
through the year 2040, including the current projections from the mid-term financial plan. The plan
shows positive fund balances on both the base system and FasTracks in every year through 2040.







No base system funding required to fund FasTracks expenditures; FasTracks is expected to be
fully funded from its own revenue streams
Need to issue COPs to finance selected Base System capital expenditures
o Bus maintenance facility in 2025
o Bus purchases in 2028
No additional COPs issued to finance FasTracks expenditures
Increase combined Board appropriated and operating reserves on Base System to reach three
months’ operating expenses by 2029
Maintain a balance of three months’ operating expenses in the combined Board appropriated
reserve, operating reserve, and the capital acquisition fund on FasTracks
Short-term use of FISA to fund FasTracks operations and maintenance in 2027
o Full balance restored to FISA in 2028

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended Long Range Financial Plan provides RTD with the means to maintain its current
system in a state of good repair through 2040. Between 2025 and 2028, RTD would not have the
capacity for service expansion or new projects beyond those needed for state of good repair, and the
FISA would not be sufficient to fund the unfunded FasTracks corridors.
Beginning in 2029, positive unrestricted fund balances begin to accumulate on both the Base System
and FasTracks, in addition to the balance in the FISA. Funding from the FISA and the unrestricted fund
balances on FasTracks would be used to fund the remaining unfunded FasTracks corridors, which have
not been prioritized.

2019

Pension

Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2019 contribution of $5.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
General Manager’s Goals:
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2018 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2019 Actuary recommended contribution is $7.3 million. If RTD contributed $5.1
million in 2019, 100% funding could be reached in 2031 with recommended contributions dropping
below $5.1 million in 2022. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7.5% per year.
The recommendation is to keep the annual fixed contribution at $5.1 million for 2019.
DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2018.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of $5.1 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit
Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2019 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $5.1 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

2019

Benefit

Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2019 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
General Manager’s Goals:
 Task Goal #2 – Workforce and Human Capital
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2019 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 4 through
November 19, 2018.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2019 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2019 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD). Following is a summary of the changes for the
2019 plan year.
Based on input from the Board in 2016, the Benefits Committee reviewed the medical premiums and
RTD/ employee share of the premium payment. The Benefits Committee is moving toward the less
expensive plans, Kaiser, as being the base plans to which employees would buy up for Cigna. In year
two, 2019, premiums for participants on the CIGNA HDHP and PPO plans, will be calculated as follows:


Cigna participants will pay 55% of the difference in premium between the Cigna plan and a like
Kaiser plan. This is an increase of 22% over the employee premium calculation for 2018.



The plan benefits have been updated to mirror recent changes in ADA recommendations, the
addition of implants to the PPO plan and some minor co-pay changes to the EPO plan. Based on
anticipated claims, we expect about a 6% increase in premium over LY.

Life & Disability


Due to poor customer service to participants, these coverage were sent out to bid for 2019. The
benefits committee saw presentations from Unum and Lincoln, the two lowest cost providers
from a field of four and determined to engage Unum to provide Life and Disability coverages for
2019.

Vision/Business Travel Accident



No changes in rates or plan for the vision plan in 2019
Business/ Travel Accident insurance, no increase in premium.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2019 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be -1.15% below the 2018
projected benefit costs.
The reduction in the cost to RTD is directly related to the following:
 Minimal increase in premium on the Cigna plans
 Increased percent of employee premium for the Cigna plans.
 Rate guarantee for Vision plan
The 2019 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $11,308,328.77.
decrease of 1.15% results in a projected decrease of $129,812.18 to the budget.

The projected

For 2019, the benefit costs meet the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Director approves the 2019 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General
Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2019. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay the
employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the organization being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase the
contract authority for the Enghouse contract by $499,055 making the total contract value $1,510,340.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD implemented the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) for both the Telephone Information Center and
Access-a-Ride to enhance the efficiency of the services being provided. The IVR technology enables
interaction between the caller and the RTD scheduling system. Callers interact by pressing numbers on
the telephone keypad or by speaking simple voice commands to answer computer voice prompts. The
IVR reduces the number of calls handled by agents by approximately 2,000 plus calls per day; thus,
achieving cost savings to the District. Without the IVR, the Telephone Information Center (TIC) would
require an additional headcount of 12-15 agents. IVR technology is commonly found in call centers to
improve customer service and reduce operational costs.
Benefits of the IVR system include:
 Improved customer service; callers avoiding hold times
 Approximately 2,000 plus calls per day processed through the IVR system
 Fewer headcount to answer inbound calls; cost savings
 Access-a-Ride has fewer “no shows” with the IVR sending reminder calls and the ability of riders
to cancel trips in advance – cost savings to RTD
Fixed Route IVR was implemented in July 2016 the Access-a-Ride IVR was implemented in October
2017.
DISCUSSION
On December 11, 2012 the Board approved the original Enghouse contract in the amount of $829,393.
The GM has exercised his authority of $200,000 (approximately $18,108 remains of GM’s authority).
The Board is requested to increase the contract authority by an additional $480,947.
The increase to contract authority will allow for enhancements and option years to extended warranty
for the IVR system to include:

The enhancement being requested are from the paratransit community to improve the usability of the
IVR system. The option years are for ongoing maintenance and support of the Enghouse IVR system.
Without the maintenance and support option years, RTD would be required to support the system which
would be costly and potentially required additional staffing to meet the support demands of the system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $1,510,880. Funding for the increase in contract authority exists
in the capital project budget. Additional funding is not required.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to increase
the contract authority for the Enghouse contract by $499,055 making the total contract value
$1,510,340.
2. Do not increase contract authority for Enghouse resulting in no enhancements requested by the
paratransit community, discontinued support and maintenance of both Fixed Route and
Paratranist IVR.

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager and his designees to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to
resolve Regional Rail Partners North Metro Project claims, as outlined in the settlement memorandum
prepared at the conclusion of the parties’ September 20, 2018 mediation; and to authorize use of the
FasTracks Management Reserve to fund the first disbursement of funds in the amount of $15 million.
General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1: Successful Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD’s North Metro Project is an approximately $390 million project involving the design and
construction of RTD’s North Metro commuter rail line to Thornton. In 2013, RTD received an unsolicited
proposal providing the opportunity to build most of the North Metro commuter rail line. RTD evaluated
the proposal and issued an RFP in the summer of 2013. Two teams bid on the RFP. In November 2013,
RTD awarded a contract to Regional Rail Partners (RRP) – a consortium currently led by Graham
Contracting Ltd. and Balfour Beatty, Inc. – to design and build the N Line from Union Station to Eastlake
& 124th. Since the award, RTD has granted RRP an additional $45,821,165 in contract directives and
change orders, resulting in a current contract value of $389,116,020. To date, RTD has paid RRP
$315,538,498 for completed work.
RTD and RRP were unable to reach agreement as to additional change orders requested by RRP, in
particular for delay, direct costs, acceleration and interest related to Burlington Northern & Santa Fe
Railroad (BNSF) and other third-party approvals of design, and disputes regarding acquisition of property.
Under the dispute resolution provisions of the contract, RTD and RRP agreed to arbitrate RRP’s claims as
of October 2017 to a three-arbitrator panel. The arbitration is scheduled for three weeks in late
November 2018, and would only resolve RRP’s claims up to October 2017. RRP’s claim totaled
$47,323,359 plus attorney fees and costs.
The parties engaged in extensive discovery to prepare for arbitration; in the meantime, the parties
continued to consult regarding potential settlement of claims. On September 20, 2018, the parties held
mediated settlement discussions and arrived at a settlement of claims as outlined below, subject to RTD
Board of Directors approval. If the settlement is not approved, the late November arbitration and pending
discovery remain scheduled.
DISCUSSION
RTD is recommending approval of an agreement which includes total payments of $32.5 million. The
payment schedule is as follows: $15 million within 15 days following Board approval, $8.75 million at

Packet Pg. 140

12.M

Substantial Completion, and $8.75 million on September 10, 2019 (current estimate for Final
Completion). In addition, subject to RRP submitting contract-required documentation showing proof of
payment to subcontractors, RTD will not withhold further retention on progress payments and will
release 50% of the current retention amount within 45 days after September 20 (i.e., November 4) with
the balance of retention released as provided by contract.
The settlement agreement further provides that the parties will release all claims and counterclaims in
the arbitration and dismiss the proceedings with prejudice. In addition, RRP agrees to cap any other
reserved claims, including all claims from October 1, 2017 to September 20, 2018 for delay, impact and
costs (excepting only issues and events arising after September 20, 2018) at $8 million. This does not
mean that RRP is guaranteed an additional $8 million; instead, RRP is to provide RTD with backup for
remaining claims, and if not resolved the parties will schedule mediation prior to further dispute
resolution as provided in the contract.
Finally, in an effort to get both sides back to a “clean slate” and promote successful completion of the
project, RRP has committed to cooperate in schedule updates and to provide a schedule with key
milestones in 2019. The settlement agreement expresses the goal for both parties to work together to
mitigate further delays to Final Completion and to strive to achieve revenue service in 2019. RRP and
RTD will work collaboratively to assure, if not improve, the milestone dates. Further schedule workshops
are planned. The settlement agreement also provides that the parties will work together to further
mitigate delays through good faith participation in monthly leadership meetings to begin no later than
October 31, 2018, and a partnering program to be developed by the parties as soon as practicable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Recommended Action grants staff authority to draw upon the FasTracks Management Reserve to
fund the settlement. It is anticipated that the first $15 million payment will be taken from the reserve.
Staff is doing a comprehensive analysis of the project funds and the cost to complete the project. Staff
is hopeful that the project will be able to absorb the remaining settlement amounts, but there may be the
need to utilize additional reserves in the future.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Finance Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and his designees to negotiate and execute all
documents necessary to resolve Regional Rail Partners North Metro Project claims, as outlined in
the settlement memorandum prepared at the conclusion of the parties’ September 20, 2018
mediation; and to authorize use of the FasTracks Management Reserve to fund the first
disbursement of funds in the amount of $15 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This alternative is not recommended because it may
result in substantial legal and operational risks. In particular, the arbitration scheduled for late
November will go forward, but it will resolve only RRP’s claims to October 2017, with RTD
continuing to be at risk for greater claims from October 2017 through the present.

Subject:

January 2019 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2019 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $243,000 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
The Recommended Action proposed falls in line with the following GM Goals.
Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
Changes to RTD transit service, have historically been measured by and related to ridership and financial
impacts. However, current labor market conditions continue to be a serious challenge to the recruitment
and retention of bus and rail operators. More to the point, the amount of service being provided by
operators working on their days off is at a level that impedes employee retention efforts and makes it
difficult to meet our commitments to our customers. To better match the RTD’s scheduled service
offerings to RTD’s available workforce, this proposal starts a process to adjust the level of service on
various routes throughout the District. The proposed service adjustments were conceived in accordance
to the Service Policies and Standards adopted by the RTD Board of Directors.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Notable changes include a
proposal to merge Route 26 – West Yale with Route 35 - Hampden. A reduction to service frequency on
the SKIP is also proposed, along with reductions in service of Routes RX and Y. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS
Six public meetings were conducted in Boulder, Englewood, Lafayette, Longmont and at the Blake
Administration Building between September 24th and October 3rd. Comments and further details from
these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment D of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US287/Route LD – Longmont/Denver:
proposed service restructure is rescinded.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 26 – West Yale Avenue/Route 35 – Hampden Avenue: merge Routes 26 and 35 into new
crosstown Route 35.
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield: extend Route 228 east to Hecla and 96th

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/ service efficiencies:
Route 0 – Broadway: reroute in downtown Denver
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: reroute into Denver Union Station
Route 15 – East Colfax: move short turn recovery, trip reduction on weekends
Route 16 – West Colfax: extend weekend short-turn trips at Zephyr-Colfax to the Oak Station
Route 16L – West Colfax: extend short-turn trips at Zephyr-Colfax to the Oak Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: change westbound routing through downtown
Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US287/Route LD – Longmont/Denver:
proposal rescinded
Route FF/FF7 – Flatiron Flyer – Boulder/Denver: trip additions and reductions, schedule adjustments.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
Route 32 – 32nd Avenue: discontinue 6:52am westbound trip
Route 46 – South Dahlia: discontinue Cherry Creek loop west of Steele Street
Route SKIP – Broadway: reduce to 10 minute frequency from current 7-8 minute peak frequencies
Route RX – Brighton/ Denver Express: discontinue mid-day roundtrips (10:43am leave Adams County
Justice Center and 12:09pm leave Civic Center Station)
Route Y – Boulder/ Lyons: discontinue mid-day roundtrips (10:57am and 12:20pm leave Downtown
Boulder Station and 11:42am and 1:02pm leave Lyons Park-n-Ride)

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments:
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: running time analysis
Route 15 – East Colfax: move short turn recovery location

Packet Pg. 144

12.N

Route 21 – Iliff/Evans: running time analysis
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: running time analysis
Route 131 – East Iliff/Seven Hills
Adjust trip times and blocking
Route AT – Arapahoe County/Denver Airport: respace southbound afternoon employee peak trips to
depart Denver Airport at 2:45pm and 3:15pm,
BOLT – Longmont/Boulder: running time adjustments
Free Metro Ride: run time analysis and review of operator respite time.
F and H Lines – Light Rail: running time analyses to address on-time performance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost increase of
approximately $243,000 annualized at current pre-CBA cost estimates.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed January 2019 service changes does
not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Route 0 - Broadway
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Standardize late night weekend trip times starting/ending inside Denver Union Station with
weekday trip times. This schedule simplification will continue to honor Denver Union Station
overnight closure times, but benefit walk-up and casual riders by having schedules that are more
consistent between the different service days, and easier to remember. Change northbound
routing through Downtown from Welton to Lawrence Street, thereby operating for a longer
segment on 15th Street and a shorter segment on 18th Street. This change is needed in an effort
to address traffic congestion impacts on on-time performance (see proposed change to Route
20). Additionally, a run time analysis is proposed to address certain early trips that have been
reported. Saturday and Sunday Collective Bargaining Agreement compliance related schedule
adjustments. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to be an increase of 880 service hours
annualized.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Reroute into Denver Union Station instead of Elitch Gardens for operator recovery after 7:00pm
weekdays and all day on weekends. A possible operational savings, to be determined.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis, no resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Move short turn recovery location from Oneida/Colfax to Leyden/Colfax, for operator restroom
access. Discontinue 1:21am westbound trip on Saturday and Sunday nights, which sees an
average of 9 and 11 boardings respectively. Alternative trips are available 15 minutes before and
after this trip. Possible running time adjustments. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to
be a savings of 132 service hours annualized.
Route 16 – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Extend the Saturday and Sunday short-turn trips currently using Zephyr/14th terminal to the Oak
LRT Station. This is to address an operator respite problem with the Zephyr/Colfax short-turns.
Additionally, a running times analysis will be conducted. Anticipated resource impacts are
estimated to be an increase of 2,040 service hours annualized.
Route 16L – West Colfax
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
For existing trips currently terminating at 14th/Oak, extend them into Oak LRT Station. For
existing through-trips to Golden, deviate them into Oak LRT Station. This change would facilitate
a known gap in system connectivity. Running times analysis, directed at westbound trips
operating early. Anticipated resource impacts are estimated to be an increase of 2,040 service
hours annualized.

Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Change westbound routing through downtown from 15th St. to 18th St. This change is
associated with the Route 0 - Broadway change, so that Route 20 will operate on the segment of
18th St. abandoned by Route 0. This change will also reduce trip times on Route 20 westbound
short-turn trips operating as far as DUS, which crosses the 16th St Mall twice to reach DUS. This
change also more closely matches-up the routing of the short-turn westbound pattern in
Downtown with the through westbound pattern. (On weekdays, there are more short-turn trips
operating into DUS than thru trips, and all trips on weekends are short trips into DUS). No
resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 21 Iliff/Evans

Route 32 – 32nd Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue 6:52am westbound trip. This trip carries 16 passengers, which does not meet the
service standard for 15 minute service. Alternative service can be found on trips 15 minutes
before and 12 minutes after the current trip time. Anticipated resource impact is estimated to be
a savings of 383 service hours annualized.
Route 46 – South Dahlia
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue Cherry Creek loop west of Steele Street, due to very low ridership (45 boardings on
27 trips averaged per weekday). Allows operator recovery at Adams/Ellsworth senior home. No
resource impacts are anticipated.
Route 131 – East Iliff/Seven Hills

to provide funding (CMAQ and local match) for the Route LD beyond the beyond the grant period.
Route 228 – Louisville/Broomfield
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Extend Route 228 east to Hecla and 96th Street, into the Boulder County Kestrel Housing
complex. This will provide service to roughly 200 low-income residents. This will also provide a

Route AT – Arapahoe County/Denver Airport
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
Respace southbound afternoon employee peak trips to depart Denver Airport at 2:45pm and
3:15pm, instead of current 3:10pm and 3:25pm. Based upon ridership data from other bus and
rail routes, 2:30pm is the larger employee quit time. No resource impacts anticipated.

Discontinue mid-day roundtrips (10:43am leave Adams County Justice Center and 12:09pm
leave Civic Center Station) due to very low ridership (less than 8 passengers per trip). Anticipated
resource impact estimated to be a cost savings of an estimated 638 service hours annualized.
Route SKIP – Broadway
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Current ridership performance overall exceeds the threshold to maintain 10 minute service
frequency during select portions of the service day. However, the majority of the peak period can

trippers between Fairview High School and 14th/Walnut, northbound between 3:00pm and
3:30pm to maintain current 7-8 minute frequency and address otherwise potential overloads
caused by BVSD and CU student ridership. No anticipated cost impact due to resource off-set.

Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Diane Marquis, Cesar Ochoa, Jeff Becker, Nataly Handlos,
Maureen Sullivan, Doug Monroe, Tegan Rice, and Dave Menter who conducted. There were 16 members
from the public in attendance, and no elected officials.
Rosemary Brown expressed the difficulty she is having boarding at Colfax and Norfolk. She has a walker
and there is only dirt and gravel. The bus drivers have difficulty deploying the lift and during inclement
weather it is very difficult for anyone with a walker or using a wheelchair. She said the drivers often go to
a Store Quest Storage driveway, but this is hit and miss. She asks RTD to correct this situation.
She also had a follow-up question regarding how passengers were counted. (It was explained to her.)
DJ had questions regarding the proposed bond issue for East Colfax. Who was behind it and how was RTD
involved? Lives by the Merchandise Mart, and uses the 12 to get around. He is in agreement with the
stop consolidation, but says RTD has missed a few stops on the list. The southbound at 31st/Downing is
an eighth of a mile from the LRT station and northbound stop at MLK/31st is also an eighth of a mile away
from another stop. Both stops need to be removed.
Kristin Bulin was frustrated with a number of things regarding RTD. She was dismayed that it took RTD 6
years to correct an issue with the Mall Shuttle Doors closing too fast and catching people’s arms and legs.
She spoke of how RTD was the 3rd worst paying transit agency in the U.S. and how RTD chops up the
Operator schedules so they don’t have any family time. They said we don’t treat our drivers right and that
we cut service and bus stops to make people walk farther because we don’t have Bus Operators. But that
it is a cheap and easy fix to treat the drivers better, but we’d rather hurt the passengers rather than treat
the drivers fairly. She said the Customer Service staff lie to customers saying the bus will be there in a few
minutes and then 30 minutes later they will admit that the trip was cut and the next one will be there in
a few. Then because of this passengers have lost their jobs, lost doctor’s appointments which they then
have to pay for and reschedule, and that others have missed court dates and then been fined by the Judge,
all because the work was dropped because we don’t have the drivers. And she claimed this is because
RTD does not want to treat its drivers fairly. She said then RTD proposes cutting service, well the reason
the ridership is bad is because the passengers have given up because they can’t rely on the bus showing
up. But the public has paid for that service through their taxes which RTD is squandering. It seemed to
her that RTD was not following its core duty.
She wanted confirmation or denial that the Board Bylaws say that it must increase fares every two to
three years. (It was explained that the Board reviews the fares every three years, but does not necessarily
change them. The law regarding recovery ratio was also explained.)
She also strongly asserted that the Bus Operators were not properly trained and that they should wait at
stations for transferring passengers from the trains.

Carol Streamer Wanted to know what the Route 11 changes were. (Staff explained the meaning of
Running Time adjustments.) She wanted to complain about a recent rain storm where the RTD Shelter at
the regional stop at US 36 & Broomfield Station did not shelter at all – everyone got wet. She said it looks
like a shelter, but it doesn’t shelter at all. She also wanted to know if fares have been set and also to know
if the Route 10 is proposed to still go to the Aquarium.
Scott Ramming Wanted to know why the Route 26 is being combined with the Route 35 now instead of
this past August when the Route 27 was split into the Routes 26 & 27. He also asked about weekend
service for the Route 35 since the Route 26 has weekend service. He also asked about limited service on
the route as well. (Jessie Carter addressed all those questions.) He also asked about the proposed service
changes for the LD family of Routes. He had a number of questions regarding interlining certain LD’s to
other LD’s. (Nataly Handlos answered his questions to his satisfaction.)
Steven Meyer wanted to know if there were any changes planned for the area around 17th and Larimer.
Are there any changes to the shoppers special, his community heavily relies on them? Asked if the old
mall shuttles are being replaced with the red buses, and if he could buy and one.

Staff in attendance was Jessie Carter, Manager, Service Planning Scheduling. A brief introduction of the
process was given before the following input was provided by the public: There were 7 members from
the public in attendance, and no elected officials.
Chris Humphries wanted to know how the weekend service would work on the new merged Route 26/35.
It was explained that the service would be provided as it is today, with the section that was formerly
known as the 26 operating on weekends. Chris also stated that there were no attendants available on
weekends at DUS and the new fares proposed are too high.
Carl Crosswhite estimates that his commute would be increased by 30 minutes with the changes proposed
for Route LD. He wants a simple way to get to Denver Union Station from the area served by the Route
LD.
Francie Crosswhite. The FF1 stops everywhere and people prefer the LD because it is more direct. The
time she has seen the LD it has been standing room only.
Robert McSherry thinks change in the R Line to one-car trains was a good idea. It looks more full now.
David Smith would like to see the midday trips on the Route Y maintained, though he uses the peak period
trips primarily. He sometimes uses the midday trips to go hiking.
Chandler Kitsen asked if there is any news on the G Line implementation date.

Karlyn Huffman request more service on Route 27 and 46 for the three senior citizen towers located at

The meeting was attended by four people. Questions included the new fares including the availability of
cash payment; service to events at outlying recreational and shopping sites; and earlier morning service
in Littleton. The only comment received regarding the January 2019 service changes was a request for
weekend service on Route 35 along Hampden Avenue.

Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Diane Marquis, and Tegan Rice. There were 59 members
from the public in attendance, along with Judy Lubow with the RTD Board.
Director Lubow expressed how thankful she was about the decision to pull the proposed service changes
to the LD, and saved the route until at least August 2019.
Abe Meza a student at DU is a frequent rider of the LD. He had several concerns about the proposed
service changes to the LD including: Inadequate shelters at the Broomfield and Flatiron Station, added
time to with the new routing, and concerned that transfers would be more timely for ADA passengers.
He also feels that this change will result in more riders leaving the LD and using cars. Abe also wanted to
know if the current driver shortage was affecting the decision to change the LD routing, and it would have
been very helpful if RTD could have provided a way to see the changes with a map along with the
description.
David ToBack is a Federal contractor who uses the LD to make a connection to get to his employment at
Colorado Tech Center. The new routing would have provided a direct, one set ride to his employment
area.
Polly Christensen from the Longmont City Counsel feels that RTD should keep coming up with
comprehensive mass transit plans. Everyone should work together from Wyoming to Colorado Springs.
We cannot just rely on ridership numbers; we need rail from North to South and East to West to help get
people off the roads.
Brian Buron said it would be very helpful to have information with maps available to have a better
understanding of the proposed changes for routing. Brian spent 40 minutes on the phone with Customer
Service trying to understand the proposed service changes, and how it would affect the 225 routing to

Lafayette PnR. He feels that everyone should keep an open mind. He felt that the routing to Flatirons
Station might be a good idea.
Mary Brill asked if the changes had been tabled.
Constance Platt had voiced her concerns about how the meeting was held.
John Keller has recently discovered RTD service to the Airport and is enjoying that. He feels that RTD
security is lacking and needs improvement as assaults are up in the district 66%.
Joe Davison said it takes him an hour and a half to get from Broomfield to Arapahoe Station and if we
make the change on the LD this will increase his travel time even more. He has personally seen 25 to 30
passengers on the buses he uses.
Jake Marsing uses the LD everyday he is a CU student and is thankful the proposal has been pulled.
Margaret Norris if ridership is low then RTD should think outside the box and buy smaller buses. This
would be a long-term solution. This would also help to improve pollution as well.
Colleen Elrod does not think that having the routing backtrack to Flatirons would be quicker. Questions
who was paying the cost to continue running the LD routing as is.
Joan Peak wanted to know more about the grant funding. The route needs more ridership to help keep
it. Feels that half the time the Eco Pass reader is not working. RTD needs to work to keep their bus
because Longmont is growing. She is not accepting that this route will be cut in the future.
Danielle Holmes takes the bus to school at Metro State and it takes her 1 hour and 45 minutes to get to
there.
Susan Foss has been in Denver for 10 years and feels that service has been declining for the last year. She
is concerned about the security at Broomfield and Flatirons station if passengers had to transfer. Wanted
to know more about the fare increases and FastTracks.
Miranda Ramirez changing the LD would make her life harder getting to school in Arvada.
Hermine Ngnomire feels that RTD should do a better job marketing the service changes through digital
campaign to reach more people.
Phil Greenwald wanted to let everyone know that Longmont is hosting a how to ride RTD at the Longmont
Museum on October 17th, from 5p – 9p.
Ed Capizzi wanted to know how people get counted on the bus.
Kristin Bell takes the LD from Longmont to Denver and uses B-cycle to complete her trip. She is concerned
about losing the later trips to get back to Longmont if she has to work late. She thinks we should post
service changes at station with maps. Also feels we have too many stops on 17th. It could improve
ridership to have less stops.

Staff in attendance included Nataly Handlos, Diane Marquis, and Tegan Rice. There were 17 members
from the public in attendance, along with Director Sisk with the RTD Board, Natalie Stiffler with the City
of Boulder, Elaine Erb with BTC, and Alex Hyde-Wright with Boulder County.
Lois Kraft was confused about the 225 service change.
David Bartlett has a grandchild that attends Manhattan and rides the 225 in the evenings regarding after
school activities and was curious about how the 225 is going to affect the child’s ability to get home.
Maurine Flory is frustrated with the counting of ridership. She can’t get a bus to get to her house from
work in less than an hour on the 209. She lives near Mohawk and with a bike can miss a couple of SKIP’s
because there is no room for her bike.
Laura Kistner is confused about the LD proposal, but if it stays as-is she is ok. She needs the late night LD
trips to get home when she gets off of work at 10:00 p.m., and would like Sunday service near
287/Midway.
David Wheeler has questions about the neighborhood EcoPass.
Derek Sampson wants Sunday service to 287/Midway area. He feels like Broomfield is isolated without
service on the weekends. He would like the 225 to operate on Saturday and Sunday between Lafayette
and Broomfield and the LD to operate on Sunday.
Alicia Karspeck has the same concerns about the 225 changes, but is happy that her kids can still at least
walk up to Baseline and still be able to catch the 225.
Jennifer Nicoll has questions about the new EcoPass program.
Tom Wilke has a question about the added trips for demand on the SKIP if they were for the whole trip
northbound and southbound. Was curious about the Y not stopping at local stops along Broadway. He

Elaine Erb the LD/225 proposal is concerning for the connectivity of the people living in Niwot. She
wanted to know if the 225 could still operate the loop to the East Boulder Recreation Center. She says
that she wants to ride the LD, but won’t because the headway is inconsistent and says that the service is

I am a frequent 0 rider (almost every day I work) and I noted
in the proposed January schedule change flyer that it is being
proposed that the 0 change from a turn at Welton to 18th to
Lawrence to 18th into Union Station, similar to the 15.
I understand the point of this proposed change, but would
encourage for someone to test the timing during the week (if
timing improvement is the desired effect), due to all the
construction down 15th at the moment. Many weekdays,
due to construction, at least one lane is blocked and
sometimes traffic gets backed up quite a bit with lane
closures. I'm not sure how long the construction lane issues
are expected to last, but if someone were able to find out, or
check the timing by having someone time the 0 currently
against perhaps the 15, from Broadway and Colfax stop down
to Union, it may give everyone a better idea of how the lane
closures and construction are affecting routes that continue
to Lawrence before turning.
This proposed change was rather confusing to me. I asked at
the downtown noon public meeting whether the proposed
change also included evening and weekend Route 10 trips
that terminate at Colfax & Federal. Then I left a voicemail for
one RTD staff member and got a voicemail reply from
another RTD staff member.
I'll ask for what I need: I've started attending a church at
32nd Ave & Wyandot Street in the Denver Highlands. In
addition to Sunday morning services, we have a lot of
meetings on Thursday evenings. At these times, the obvious
choices of Routes 32, 44 and 28 are on hourly service. In
addition, they're often within 5 or 10 minutes of each other,
meaning there could be up to 40 minutes each hour without
a bus. The current Route 10 pattern that serves the Aquarium
and Colfax & Federal transfer center gives me another option
if our meeting goes past the other bus times.
I'll also attempt to consider what other riders might need: I
suspect more people will be able to make transfers at Union
Station than at Elitch Gardens. I absolutely support providing
restroom breaks for bus drivers. I'd think there would be
better transfer opportunities at the Decatur/Federal W Line
station than the Colfax & Federal transfer center, but RTD
staff tell me there aren't enough bus berths at Decatur. I'd
like to ask RTD staff if some of the trips to Colfax & Federal
couldn't be retained on evenings and weekends - perhaps to
provide hourly service. Thank you!

Service on 20 westbound which continues on to Lakewood is
already quite unreliable. I’m all in favor of moving from 15th
to 18th street but this change is being sold as improving
service into union station, the proposed change makes no
mention of the equally important 20 westbound service that
continues out to Lakewood. Please ensure the proposed
change does not affect reliability for service continuing to
Lakewood, that bus already unreliable.
Once again you are proposing changes to route 46 which are
detrimental to all riders of the 46 ! It is bad enough that you
have reduced the Sunday service to hourly service AND start
AND end the service 30 minutes than before but now you
want to further cut the service to the whole Cherry Creek
shopping area ! You have also cut out the first 2 buses and
last 2 buses at the end of day further inconveniencing
passengers. There are many passengers who take the bus to
Cherry Creek and then connect to a limited bus downtown.
Now if there is inclement weather they can wait in the
shelter at Fillmore Place. They also connect to the 46 either
at Josephine or at Fillmore and would not be able to do this.
Worse than that is that there will be no bus service to the
businesses including Whole Food and other business on Third
Avenue along with the library. I ride this bus on the weekend
and sometimes to Whole Foods during the week and I am not
the only one that takes the 46 to this store. Many of these
stores including Whole Foods would require walking 4 plus
blocks and many times have heavy bags to carry. Walking the
additional blocks will be difficult during the winter with snow
on the ground. There are also employees that I have met on
the bus who work at the mall, Cherry Creek North, and
Whole Foods will be negatively impacted if this change is
made. I will be contacting the Cherry Creek Chamber of
Commerce and manager at Whole Foods to tell them about
your proposal. You will make it difficult for customers and
employees to reach the shops and/or place of employment.
Since many times the fare box on the buses on the 46 aren't
working you don't have an accurate idea of what the
ridership west of Steele is. In closing many of the passengers
(including me) feel that you would like to eliminate the route
46 completely. I work full time in Glendale and cannot
make it to the meetings downtown by 6:00pm or I would be
there tomorrow, Sept 24. I am sending this email on behalf
of all the riders that I have met and know from years of riding
on this bus. We would like at least one of the buses that
were cancelled in August, buses to start 30 minutes in the
morning and 30 minutes later in the evening on Sunday.

Why are you limiting the increase of 15 minute frequency
service of the 76 route to only south of Olde Town? Do you
not think people living north of Olde Town will ride the G
line?
Seriously, I do not understand you're thinking of increasing
service between Lakewood Commons and Olde Town to 15
minutes and leave everyone else out to wait. Few if any from
Lakewood Commons is going to ride the G line, why wouldn't
they just ride the W line?
Service of the 76 needs to increase to every 15 minutes north
of Olde Town too when the G line starts. How far north I'm
not sure, but I would say at least to 80th Av. That's
approximately where I believe the boundary of those using
the G line vs the FF1 exists.

I want to complain about the schedule change with the #120.
Ever since the new schedule change, this route causes me to
miss my connections with the #12 and the #120X. Next time
you have a schedule change, have the connections be better
so we don't have to wait thirty minutes to catch our
connecting buses.

I am writing to comment on the service offered along Smoky
Hill Road in Aurora. My comment is to request that service
on the 135 Route be extended beyond Southlands mall to the
intersection of Smoky Hill and Arapahoe Roads. This would
enable riders in the neighborhoods southeast of Southlands
mall to have better access to the RTD system. It is currently a
long walk from these areas to the nearest Route 135 stop.

The verbiage used to describe the proposed service changes
to route 225 is not understandable. Starting a section on 225
changes with references to LD service is confusing. Will
service between Lafayette and Boulder continue along
Baseline? How are CU faculty, staff and students to access
the Boulder Campus? How are seniors to access the East
Boulder Recreation Center and senior resources? Such
drastic changes require a thorough and clear description and
justification.

I live in Lafayette and extremely upset that you are reducing
our ability to get into Boulder via the 225. We have been
using it every week and our only other option is the Jump
which we'd have to pick up more than a mile from our house.
It seems especially unfair since up here in the north we've
been paying that extra light rail tax for years and instead of
getting more service via that unfulfilled promise of a rail line,
you are actually reducing our service! Seems like all we are
doing is subsidizing more service for Denver. Not fair.
Your proposed route changes to Lafayette and Longmont are
ludicrous! These busses are always full and are absolutely
necessary for Longmont commuters!! Many people from
Longmont and Lafayette will lose their Denver jobs!! I have
always touted the RTD EcoPass as the greatest thing since
sliced bread, but if you continue with this outrageous change
I will do everything in my power to badmouth RTD to all who
will listen! Please don’t do this!!!
I would like to express my concern regarding the proposed
changes to the 225 bus route to and from Boulder to
Louisville. My daughters go to school at CU and use the 225
route to come home as it drops them off on Baseline and
Elgin; they just walk down the bike path bordering Callahan
open space to our home on Monarch Court. It is so easy for
all of us; I don’t need to drive to and from Boulder, and we
reduce the number of trips in the car. Please do not remove
the 225 route from Boulder<>Louisville/Lafayette. It is a
great asset to our community.
I am emailing regarding the proposed service change to the
225 route that would exclude stops on Baseline road
between Lafayette Park n Ride and Boulder. I am a CU
student that lives in Louisville. I use that bus frequently to
visit home and during the summer months I use the 225
every day to get to work on the CU campus. My stop is
Baseline and Elgin Drive and I can simply walk through the
open space bordering Baseline to get to my house. Please

I heard of the proposed changes to the 225 route to no
longer travel to Lafayette on Baseline. I live in Lafayette and
my husband takes the bus often from work in Boulder to
Lafayette, this would certainly result in him having only the
opportunity to take the Jump on Arapahoe, and because he
rides his bike, if the bike holders are occupied he won't be
able to take public transit.
The plans of also not having the LD1 travel from Lafayette to
Denver would directly impact me as I commute to work at
Denver sometimes.
Pretty much it seems you are planning on isolating Lafayette,
an area of much growth, such that we all have to drive or
wait hours to switch buses. Imagine what that would do for
the students that commute from Lafayette to Boulder and for
anyone doing bike/bus ride.
I completely oppose and why aren't you holding a hearing in
Lafayette? If you are cutting services to our area, the least
you can do is listen to the taxpayers impacted.
I have rode RTD for decades.......from BOulder to Denver for
work/baseball games.....and when my MOM died and I
moved to Longmont...I used it everyday work at CU
Fitzsimmons and downtown CU campus AND for ROckies
games. They commuter buses to Denver were ALWAYS
packed....usually people sitting in the aisles as all seats were
filled (and can I say that men NOT getting UP off thei seats for
a pregnant woman was disgusting behavior)......... As for
Rockies ride....we used to have the highest ridership in the
RTD system. 4 full buses for EVERY game. I met people in line
from Ft COllins, Loveland, wyoming, etc.....who drive to
longmont for the bus service. We filled 4 buses for EVERY
game....then for NO reason...RTD just took it away...saying
NO ONE was riding the Rox Ride....A LIE!!! SUpervisors made
it clear that they did NOT want to work the ROX
RIde....well...it's you JOB........I'm sure they lied to supervisors
so they could stay home and drink beer.
We then had a wed night rox ride via the Longmont Sr Center
but NO advertisement from RTD....no one knew about the
service. we were again set up to fail I not take the RTD LD
bus to baseball games and usually the bus is pretty full by the
time we hit US 36......people obviously depend on this

service. There is NO alternative that doesn't take HOURS (via
BOUlder.....and several times I had to take the DenverBOulder then BOlt bus to get home). MOre than once we got
in LATE to BOUlder as the FF bus was packed, slowed down
and we missed the LAST BOLT .....once I even RAN to catch
the last BOLT out of BOUlder and they refused to let us on at
the stop sign....we were forced to sleep on the street that
night.
RTD is out to spread false lies about people in Longmont
using their bus service. People DO need it and use it. And IF
they advertised service at their 8th and Coffman
stop....people would use and trust them ore....they have lied
to customers and the RTD Board about usage......they want
our tax dollars but for NOTHING in return. Many have just
faith in RTD and that is NOT our fault...RTD has lied to us and
about our usage of RTD......it is robbery....RTD should be
ashamed for a job NOT well done......we pack meetings with
them in Longmont and they blow us off as unimportant....if
you can't do your job....fire the Board and get people who
want to provide service to all colorado citizens who pay taxes
to RTD.......
My family opposes deleting bus service from Longmont to
Denver. We need less cars on the major highways and within
the two cities. Traffic and pollution is bad enough already.
Our taxes should be used more wisely so that bus service can
continue.
I am writing to let you know that I am opposed to the service
changes proposed to route 225E. This route provides
transportation for the elderly, disabled, students, and
working people. I realize that it might not be heavily used
during the middle part of the day, but do believe during peak
times it is utilized. I ask that you reconsider your proposal.
This bus route provides a valuable service to our community.
I am a resident of Nyland Co-housing community, located off
Baseline Road between 75th and 95th, on the 225 route from
Boulder to Lafayette. This route is not only a lifeline for many
people here (my two children rode it to both University Hill
Elementary School and, later, to Boulder High), but it is one
of the only hopes that Baseline Road will remain navigable
for many people during rush hours. Already, traffic can back
up (in both directions) for more than a mile, and the only way
out is to encourage people to take public transit. Eliminating
this route would be a substantial step backwards for many,
many people. Please do not eliminate this route.

Are you kidding me that you plan to remove direct-route
service from the exploding population-growth area of
Lafayette (and Erie, Longmont, you name it) to Denver???
This is a major, major growth area and Denver is already
sorely behind other areas of the U.S. in planning proper
public transportation (read: trains) to get from 20-30 minuteout residential areas to the job epicenter. The RTD North
train-line expansion plans are a complete joke. Busses are the
only way that we have to get to Denver and now you are
compromising that.
When I lived 30 minutes from Chicago I had FOUR directroute options to get to Chicago's Union Station within 4
blocks of my home. Two bus, one subway (El), and one real
train (Metra). Denver is making a conscious decision to
actually regress in its sophistication of travel.
Highway 287 serves everything from Fort Collins, Loveland,
Longmont, Erie, Broomfield, and Lafayette traffic. All of which
had a direct-route to Denver. Now you are asking people to
de-queue, wait (likely 15-20 minutes added PER DIRECTION)
on the commute, endure weather and outdoor exposure,
only to overload the already overloaded busses on the FF
routes traveling to Denver. This problem will get far worse
before it gets better. You must be mismanaging budget if this
is the only alternative.
This is an absolute disgrace to riders everywhere that you
would not work to IMPROVE the direct connections from
suburbs with major population growth to Denver's citycenters. Shame on you for poor planning, poor next
generation thinking (read: trains and better bus lines), and
making decisions that will hurt ridership and access to Denver
for the citizens that you "serve".
Your website already reads "these service changes TOOK
effect January 13, 2019" even though that is IN THE FUTURE.
This shows that you must not be open to additional decisionmaking and input in the course of making your bad decisions.
So much for the public meetings that you are clearly offering
to only let people blow steam.
I'm disgusted and less proud to call Denver-metro my home
today. Please add my voice to whatever modicum of dueprocess review you have before you ruin this service.
Please be aware that the cessation of route 225 service east
of Mohawk DR will
leave thousands of residents without access to the Kaiser
Rock Creek medical center
and HOSPITAL.

The changes you have decided to make to the L1, L2, and 225
lines will effectively cut off all direct access for Longmont and
Lafayette residents to use RTD to get to and from Denver.
Flatiron park and ride has no parking garage, no inclement
weather protection, and the FF busses are already often
standing room only to/from Boulder.
The 225 going out of its way to Flatirons does not make any
sense to those of us who ride it. It just makes the trip that
much longer.
Why are you not just decreasing the frequency of our routes,
instead of cutting us off altogether? Longmont and Lafayette
matter just as much as Boulder or any other community.
Please leave us one direct route to Denver!
Can you give me some more detail on the changes to the 225.
I just want to confirm that it will still be running all the way
from the Boulder Station to the Lafayette Park-n-Ride. The
description of the changes seems like it will only run from the
Boulder Station to Mohawk and Talbot.
I recently discovered that major changes are being
considered for the 225 bus route. As a regular rider of this
bus, I find the proposed changes to be unacceptable. They
would majorly impact the large number of people who use
the 225 to commute from Lafayette to Boulder, including
myself. For me, re-working my travel to use other buses like
the Jump or Dash would more than double my total travel
time. Please do not cancel the section of the route that
connects these two towns.
I would like to understand more about this decision, and
would appreciate if someone could reply to this email to
provide ridership data for the 225 route, particularly the
westbound direction during morning rush hours and the
eastbound direction during evening rush hours, or to let me
know where that data might be available online. Additionally,
if there are documents spelling out the official rationale for
this choice, please send me a copy. As a regular rider of this
bus during rush hour, my experience has been that it is
always relatively full for the section between Lafayette and
Boulder. I could understand the proposed changes for nonpeak hours, but I find it hard to accept that there is
insufficient ridership to at least maintain the full service
during rush hour.
I am not happy to hear about the change to 225 come
January 2019. I have been riding the bus since 2001 and I live
over at 665 Manhattan Drive. I do not have a car and rely on
the bus to get to work and around the town, I use the bus 7
days during the week. The bus in the morning is used by
students, working people and seniors. There is no other bus I

I just learned that RTD has proposed a change in service for
the 225 route. The elimination of the bus running between
Mohawk and the Lafayette PNR would leave the only option
for going east-west between Boulder and the eastern cities to
be the Dash or the Jump. The distance between South
Boulder Road and Arapahoe is quite large. That distance is
only serviced by the 209, which goes towards downtown
Boulder, and does not come close to Arapahoe nor South
Boulder Road, or the 206, which does not run on the weekends and is limited in the runs as far as South Boulder Road.
This change therefore isolates the area east of Mohawk from
any means of getting to Lafayette directly.
My husband and I have taken this bus to go to our daughter's
place in Lafayette. While the ridership is smaller than other
routes, it has always seemed to us to have a fair number of
passengers. We have also used it on occasions to return to
our house when the 206 is not running and we are taking an
AB bus from the airport or an FF bus to Denver. If the bus
stops at Mohawk, passengers currently using the 225 to go
further east would now have to walk from Mohawk across
the Foothills parkway, not the safest passage. As the
population in eastern Boulder county continues to grow, it
seems ill-advised to curtail service in this eastern section of
the service area. The increase in frequency would be
welcome for the 225, but I realize it could not be
accomplished without the decrease in area covered. I am
hopeful that some alternative can be found that still allows
for travel to Lafayette via Baseline. I have found the bus to
be a practical, reliable, and generally pleasant means of
travel in the area. To lose that option would be disappointing
to say the least.
I unfortunately can’t attend any of the service planning
meetings, but I wanted to add my input around the proposed
service changes to the LD routes. I commute daily from the
Miramonte Blv. & 287 stop, and rely on the LD route to
reliably get to work on time. I realize the 225 would still be
available as an option to Broomfield station, but if that
frequency is being reduced to hourly, I find it hard to believe
that my commute would be anything but much longer than it
currently is. I realize the operator shortage is an issue, but
perhaps maintaining the current routing with reduced service

would be an option?
Thank you for your work, I can imagine how difficult it must
be planning these services, but I hope you consider my
comments.
It is proposed to discontinue service on routes LD1 and LD2
south of US 36 due to low ridership and duplicate service on
FF routes. Service would also be rerouted south of Lafayette
Park-n-Ride via US 287, west Dillon Road, SH42 (96th Street),
Interlocken Parkway, Vara and into US 36 & Flatiron Station.
Service frequency would be increased to 60 minutes all day
between 5:30 a.m. and 10:30 p.m., combined with LD1 and
LD3 rush-hour frequency, 30-minute frequency would be
created between both routes between 8th & Coffman Park-nRide and US 287 and Dillon Road. Route 225 would be
renamed between Lafayette Park-n-Ride and US 36 &
Broomfield Station to Route LD3 and reduce service
frequency between US 36 & Broomfield Station and Lafayette
Park-n-Ride to 60 minutes, maintaining the current service
span. Route 225 would be retained between Downtown
Boulder Station and Mohawk and Talbot. Additionally, Route
225 service would move from East Boulder Recreation Center
to Mohawk and Talbot and weekday rush-hour service
frequency would increase to 15 minutes in both directions.
Can you help me understand it? I take the 225 from Baseline
Rd & Indian Peaks Trail West Stop ID: 33365 to Downtown
Boulder.
Is that stop going to be affected? Is Lafayette to Downtown
Boulder service frequency decreasing? I think this is a popular
route as a lot of people live in Lafayette and work downtown
in Boulder.
I support the proposed change. I originally had some
questions and reservations, but my discussions with RTD staff
at the downtown noon public meeting have convinced me
that they've considered all the reasonable options for
minimizing inconvenience to passengers.
Drawing from my travel behavior analyst training, I'd also
advise RTD staff to expect some current LD1/LD2 riders to
switch to Routes LX1 or LX2. This hopefully results in stronger
weekday peak ridership for those routes rather than
overcrowding.

My name is Raine Roberts and I’m a student at the University
of Colorado at Boulder. It has come to my attention that a
proposed change involves the 225 bus route no longer
stopping at and around the East Boulder Rec Center and
Manhattan Dr. I urge you to reconsider this change. I take
this bus almost daily to get to my classes on time, and to take
me home after a long day. I can assure you that many people
at my bus stop (Manhattan Dr and Baseline) and myself
would be very disappointed if this route is no longer is
commission. This change would make my commute more
difficult, especially during the colder parts of the year. I do
not have a car, and this is an extremely helpful form of
transportation for me to get to campus. Again, please
reconsider this proposed change.

Eric

Rohlinger

I'm writing you today to express my concerns and opposition
to the proposed new route of RTD 228 buses through
Louisville's neighborhoods. Before I get into my reasons why
I'm against it, I would like to propose an alternative that
would be more suitable. The bus should continue east on
South Boulder Rd to north on Plaza Drive, continuing west
onto E. Hecla Dr and then closing the loop by turning south
onto 96th (Hwy 42). My proposed route would have easy
traffic flow patterns with a turn light onto Plaza and light
traffic turning onto E. Hecla Drive. After a pedestrian death
and several near misses crossing at Hecla and 96th, a
stoplight would be welcomed by the community and make
for an easy turn onto southbound 96th for a bus. This route
that I'm proposing would serve Kestrel and may further
increase ridership by including the neighborhoods east of
Plaza Drive and the retirement communities along E. Hecla
Dr, while avoiding the completely residential areas of Paschal
and W. Hecla Drive.
Here are some of my reasons why I, and large number of my
neighbors, are opposed to the change in RTD route 228 as
currently proposed. Most of them concern safety of the
residents near the proposed route.
1) The route runs through a residential neighborhood with
little likelihood of ridership from its residents. Instead it
appears to just be a convenient turn around for the route. 2)
Heavy traffic and speeding is already a concern on W. Hecla
Drive near Cowboy Park due to the incredible number of
young children in this neighborhood and visitors to the park.
Adding a bus route would surely make this worse.
3) Noise pollution would be a problem as this bus route starts
at 6:00am and continues until 11:00pm. This is a quiet
neighborhood with homes that aren't set back very far from
the street, particularly on W. Hecla Drive. 4) West Hecla Dr
near Kestrel is currently too narrow of a street for normal
street traffic due to parking on both sides of the street and
limited sight lines. Speeds over 15mph through this
bottleneck are already a problem, buses should not navigate
this roadway. 5) Traffic will have a hard time seeing a
southbound bus on W Hecla Dr at the corners of Treece St
and at Magpie Lane due to houses blocking sight lines. Very
dangerous situation. 6) Damage is likely to occur to the
roundabout infrastructure at Paschal due to the bus trying to
navigate the turn. Construction vehicles have had a very
hard time dealing with the turn without causing damage, it
will be even more difficult for a bus. I appreciate your serious
consideration of my concerns and hope that you find my
proposal worth a deeper look.

What exactly will you be doing to continue servicing our
area?
It is also my understanding that Longmont residents have
been paying RTD for YEARS to get a train route; not only do
we not have a train, now you’re cutting routes?
Please explain.

I just heard about the proposed change to RTD Route 225
between Boulder and Lafayette. My husband and I live in
Anna's Farm, just off Baseline Road in Lafayette, and we take
the 225 into and home from Boulder on a regular basis. Ever
since the JUMP discontinued its route up Baseline Road, the
closest JUMP stop to our neighborhood is 1.3 miles away - so
the 225 is our only realistic option to avoid driving into
Boulder. Please reconsider this route discontinuation in the
interests of the people of Lafayette and the environment.
This email is to inform RTD that myself and many others use
the 225 bus every day to go from my house on Manhattan to
the University and back. It would be devastating if it stopped
servicing this area. There are no other bus routes going in
that direction, and we can't afford anything more than public
transport, since it's provided by the university.
Please continue 225 service to Manhattan drive. We all really
need it, especially in the winter.
I am concerned about your 2019 proposed change to the 225
RTD schedule in Boulder. I take the bus to and from work
each day from 55th and Pueblo to Baseline and Broadway. I
am also concerned for the seniors not being able to take the
bus to the Senior Center at the East Boulder Rec Center, and
the many people of all ages who take the bus to the East
Boulder Rec Center for exercise.
Also, I am wondering if you will still have a bus stop at
Baseline & 55th Street, that will then take people west on
Baseline to CU campus at Baseline & Broadway? Your
description on your website about the proposed changes to
the 225 bus is very confusing. It would be helpful if you could
show proposed maps. I am wondering if the new Route LD3
would come west on Baseline Road from Lafayette and stop
at Baseline & 55th, continuing west to the CU campus? There
are many CU students who are picked up along Baseline Road
(between Baseline & 55th and Baseline & Broadway) that use
this route, sometimes the bus is so full there are many
people standing. I would appreciate an answer back
regarding details for the 2019 proposal for the 225 route, and
the new LD3 route. The way it is written on your website is
very confusing
I am unable to attend the community meeting scheduled for
Lafayette, but wanted to submit some input. I am strongly
opposed to changing the 228 to routing down Hecla, to
accommodate the residents of Kestrel. I understand that
there are a few handicapped residents that find it
inconvenient to get to the South Boulder Rd. bus stop.
However, I think there are other options that Boulder County
could explore that would not impact the other residents in

this neighborhood. Having the bus go down Hecla only adds
to an already busy vehicle area due to the apartments,
Kestrel and "regular homeowners". In addition there are a
lot of children that ride their bikes and play in the area.
It seems to make more sense to have a bus stop on the
southwest corner of 95th/Hwy 42 and Hecla. There is already
a "merge lane" there, where the bus could stop.
Another suggestion would be for Boulder County to work
with the property owners south of Kestrel. If they could
install a short sidewalk, to accommodate wheel chairs, it
would be much more convenient for the residents to reach
the bus stop on South Boulder Rd.
I absolutely oppose this suggestion. You are proposing to
drive a big bus through a neighborhood. Not only will you add
noise pollution through the day, compromise kids and bike
riding safety but also trigger a decline in home values in our
neighborhood. It is unpresedented that a bus would drive
through a neighborhood. Please consider alternatives to
turn the bus around. You could go into the appartment
section via South Boulder and continue on to Kestrel and exit
to the left. Yes, perhaps a slightly longer turn but you will be
saving many headaches in our neighborhood for years to
come . Thank you in advance for your consideration.
I have been using the 120x or 122x bus to go downtown for
years. As more and more of the north area is developed, the
Wagon Road PNR is full by 7:30am. Most of these people
use these two buses to get downtown. We would appreciate
having more buses go straight downtown and not stop at
Thornton PNR. By the time we load at Wagon Road, the bus
is full and there isn't any room for the Thornton people
anyway. Why not have separate buses start at Thornton PNR
and take them downtown. It's pretty plain to see that during
peak hours, there are not enough buses for the PNRs.
Besides, the people who start at the Wagon Road PNR pay a
regional fare....so please give us more direct buses on both
the 120x and 122x.
I support this change. Extending these routes to Oak Station
will allow for more connections for passengers.

I use both the 225 and LD in areas that are being proposed to
cut, I am highly against that cut.

I support the part of the proposal to interline weekday Route
26 and Route 35 service. However, I oppose the proposal to
renumber the new Route 26 as Route 35.
New Route 26 was created during the last (August 2018)
service change from the part of former Route 27 west of
Englewood Station. I think riders in this corridor should have
around a year to become familiar with the new route number
before making further changes.
Further, current Route 35 does not offer weekend service
between Englewood and Nine Mile Stations. RTD staff tell me
that on weekends the new route wouldn't go east of
Englewood Station. I think the fact that new weekend Route
35 doesn't go anywhere that current weekday Route 35 does
would cause further confusion among riders.
It's regrettable that the opportunity to interline these routes
wasn't realized for the August schedule change, which would
allow the Route 35 number to be applied to the portion of
former Route 27 west of Englewood Station without having
to introduce the Route 26 designation. However, now that
Route 26 has been introduced, I think it should be allowed to
retain and develop its new identity.
Frequent flyer on the 35 here. I saw that it is proposed to
merge routes 35 and 26 into a crosstown route 35, and upon
first glance, I think this could be very beneficial. However,
there are not any details listed as to what the scheduling
would look like. Is there any information on what days of the
week this route will be running?
The 26 is current every day, 35 is M-F. For long while, I've
wanted to see the 5 run on weekends. Will the new route be
running its full trip all days of the week, or will only part of
the trip be run on weekends? Any information you have
would be great. I'd love to have an easy trip from the east
side of Englewood over to Southmoor, or straight to SW
plaza, on the weekends. Let me know.
I am very distressed that you are both raising rates and
cutting services in Boulder County. Please don't do it.

Thanks for opportunity to give feedback on proposed RTD
service changes. I moved from Austin Texas to boulder in
2017 and commute from boulder to uptown Denver every
day on the FF2, FF4, 0 and metroride. Generally I am very
pleased with rtd service. Buses come so regularly that I never
check schedules and timing is pretty consistent at about 55
min-1hr versus 40 min to drive. This is one of the things that
makes rtd vastly superior to capital metro service in Austin. It
takes roughly the same amount of time for me to commute
25 miles from boulder to Denver that it took me to commute
3 miles in downtown Austin. I support additional eastbound
service of ff2 and ff4, particularly if it extends beyond 930am.
I would also support additional 0 service during the morning
commute hours from union station or extended metro ride
service beyond 909am. It should dovetail off of the ff2 service
and be available until at least 945. I feel like I never have to
wait long for metro ride in evenings heading to union station
but often I am waiting 10-15 min for metro ride from union
station. That timing can be improved in the mornings.
Last I would just like to comment that rtd should try to
coordinate so that city construction does not so significantly
affect service. There was a period during summer 2018 when
metro rides that normally took 10minutes were taking 30+
minutes due to downtown construction. Surely there is a way
to coordinate so that such significant delays can be avoided.
Thanks for the opportunity to provide feedback. Do not
hesitate to contact me if I can provide further input.

I am writing you to express my extreme disappointment that
FF1 trips will not be added for the January 2019 adjustment. I
feel that the FF1 service has degraded consistently over the
last few years while the FF2 is consistently adding trips during
the peak commuter hours.
The lack of FF1 service is an insult to to the commuters in
Broomfield and Westminster. Continuing to add FF2 trips
only serves Denver to Boulder commuters while ignoring the
dire need for more FF1 trips. Every time I step on an FF1 it's
completely packed, often requiring passengers to deboard
and reboard so people can depart the over capacity bus. The
fact that FF1 frequency during peak commute times has been
reduced from every 15 minutes or quicker to often times
more then 20 minutes is a slap in the face for US36 corridor
tax payers while the FF2 buses pass half full.
RTD is failing the US36 corridor. FF1 trips must be restored to
a maximum of every 15 minutes wait during peak commute
times and should come ever 7 minutes to alleviate severe

overcrowding and full buses which simply drive by
commuters leaving them out in the cold to wait for the next
bus.
Additionally the service at the us 36&flatiron station is
consistently degraded due to the lack of the FF1 service and
the utterly disgraceful FF4, which never ever comes on time.
When the Flatiron Flyer service was launched you could take
either an FF4 or FF1 into Boulder their schedules alternated
so there was a bus every 7.5 minuted during peak commuting
times. That is no longer the case.
At this point I feel that a ballot measure for the US36 corridor
and Longmont to leave RTD and set up our own transit
system is the best solution to the problem. RTD has no idea
how to deal with the massive amount of commuters on the
us36 corridor and consistently takes the tax revenue
generated by our area and dumps it into fast tracking light
rail projects in other parts of the Denver metro area.

RTD IS A FAILURE.
FF4: Thank you for increasing the frequency of the FF4 buses
in the morning. Most buses have 6-15 people standing from
Broomfield to Denver.
FF2: Will you please consider adding a couple of buses to
the FF2 PM westbound service? A 2:30 and 3:00 FF2 would
relieve the FF1 afternoon buses. When I need to leave work
early for a doctor’s appointment, I’ve found that the 2:32,
2:47 and 3:02 FF1 buses are packed. Many times they are
standing room only.
The FF5 route is poorly scheduled. Heading westbound there
is a seven hour gap from the morning to afternoon where
there is no bus. I understand that this schedule is mostly
catered to a working population, but as a student my only
other option is to take the 15 from campus to Union station
and then the FF1 back up US-36 which takes well over an
hour and a half, not to mention is far less convenient than
the FF5 route. There certainly doesn't need to be a bus every
hour but more frequently in the afternoon would be far more
reasonable and alleviate how packed the 3:55 is every day.
(For example having a 1:15 and 3:00).

As you can see by my work address below, I work about a
block away from Civic Center bus station (which offers no
shelter from the elements in bad weather but that’s another
story). I live 3 miles from the Sheridan/Boulder Turnpike Park
& Ride around 99th and Lowell. I use the parking garage at
88th & Yates. The only bus that goes direct to and from
those locations is the FF7. I work 9:30-6:00 and if I miss the
8:54 FF7 in the morning due to unexpected overflow traffic
from construction on Federal diverted onto Lowell, I have to
take an FF1 or FF3 to Union Station, then transfer to the O or
the 15 to get up to 17th & Broadway where I work. This
takes considerably more time and is inconvenient, especially
when your local buses are not always on time. I hate getting
to that west-side Gate C more than 5 minutes early because
there is NO SHELTER from the blazing heat in summer or the
howling wind in winter, in addition to the place always being
dirty and disgusting with so many local buses stopping there
(lots of cigarette butts, spit on the ground, litter, etc.). But I
digress. So I try to get to the P&R and walk over with about 5
minutes to spare before my bus comes. I would like to see
another FF7 or two running after 9:00 a.m. Also, there need
to be more FF7s from Civic outbound in the evening.
Yesterday my 6:10pm FF7 was 20 minutes late due to traffic
or something, probably to do with the Rockies game. (This
happens time and time again – it’s the last bus home and we
(my fellow FF7 riders) are stuck there with no one telling us
what the delay is or if the bus is even coming). Yet about SIX
FF4’s came by from 6:06 to 6:30! I understand you have a
driver shortage, but how about taking a few of the FF4s and
converting them to FF7 runs? OR change the FF4 routes so
that they have to stop at Sheridan P&R? You might ask why I
don’t just park at Broomfield and catch an FF4? Well, by the
time I get up to Broomfield and catch a bus, I could drive my
own vehicle downtown, so it does not make sense.
Bottom line: We need more buses on the FF7 line, more
frequently and longer into the morning and evening. Or
make the FF4s stop at our Park & Ride in Westminster. Just
because I live in Westminster instead of Broomfield or
Boulder and work on the unpopular side of downtown (not
LoDo), doesn’t mean I should have such skimpy and
unreliable service.

I currently ride the FF7 at 6:54 am and 4:35 pm every day.
We have multiple people standing each morning (some days,
it’s over 25). It’s so bad that if I don’t get in line 10 minutes
early, I will not get a seat which I pay for. The 4:35 bus home
has up to 25 people standing each night. A few people
standing is one thing but when the entire aisle of the bus is
full of people standing, it starts to feel unsafe. We need
more FF7 buses around this time!
RTD delays rail service to Longmont until 2042, and now RTD
wants to cut 2018 bus service to Longmont. Longmont should
cut all its money to RTD and use the money to support
Longmont city minivans and hire Longmont drivers to replace
RTD.
I am extremely disappointed to hear that RTD is "proposing"
to change the LD route from Longmont to Denver. You are
claiming low ridership, but reports and photos have indicated
otherwise. The "proposed" changes will make for a much
longer and much more inconvenient commute for those who
rely on LD to travel between Longmont and Denver.
Considering the taxes that Longmont residents of Boulder
County have been paying to RTD for years for a so called rail
service that has never happened, this is absolutely
unacceptable! There is a meeting scheduled for Longmont as
follows:
I’m writing to ask that you not discontinue service on the LD
south of 36. I use this route for work and to get to Denver
and my ridership times would be significantly increased if I
had to change to an FF bus (+10-20 min). This change would
also reduce overall ridership on the LD since the nearly full
buses I ride during the weekday are mostly people riding into
Denver. We know from research that having to change buses
disuades people from riding. If you make this change you will
hurt dedicated riders, reduce LD ridership and reduce Denver
access for many people in the Longmont and Lafayette areas.
Please reconsider this change.
Asking to please NOT discontinue the 4:56pm LD bus from
Union Station to Broomfield!

I would like to ask that you keep the route for the LD1 and
LD2, this route helps assist alot of people with using our
public transportation to commute home. We are trying to
push public transportation in Colorado to help with pollution
levels, and for some this is their only route home. Eliminating
this route could force some into a bad situation. Thank you
for your time in this matter.

Please, please, please do NOT discontinue the LD1 and LD2
bus routes from Denver to Longmont. I ride both these buses
at least 4 days a week. The alternative of taking two buses
to get home would force me to drive.

Nancy

Good afternoon, Please, please, please do NOT discontinue
the LD1 and LD2 bus routes from Denver to Longmont. I was
on the LD1 last night. There were a lot of us on the bus that
would have been affected by this discontinuation.

Our bus driver this morning told us that he has heard that the
discontinuation will go through. Please don’t do this. I work
late and am not able to make one of the express buses, and
adding another hour to my commute would force me to
drive. Since I have to work late this week I won’t be able to
be at the meeting in Longmont. I will however be riding one
of the LD buses home. Please, please, please reconsider.
Hi, my name is David Chamberlain and I am a daily commuter
using the LD1 and LD2 routes to commute from Denver to
Longmont in the morning and the opposite in the evening.
Please do not discontinue full bus service to Longmont from
Denver. This is incredibly important to me.
I strongly oppose the suggested discontinuation of the LD1
routes. This bus route makes it possible to live in Longmont
and work in Denver without adding to congestion on our
existing roads. Eliminating it would impose a hardship on me
and my family.
Consider the following:
1. Based on promises RTD made to the public at the time
FastTraks was approved, Longmont would already have
commuter train service. To eliminate the regular single-seat
service currently serving Longmont - to even lower levels
than it was in 2004 is unconscionable.
2. Eliminating the only evening and late evening bus service
from Denver to Longmont will REDUCE ridership on the LX
routes as people, like me, who often work late or at the very
least, past 545pm when the last LX leaves Denver, will stop
using it.
3. Reducing transit options is inconsistent with Colorado’s
goals to reduce carbon emissions.
4. Reducing transit options is a hardship on the disabled
community who don’t drive.

As you are the Lead Service Planner & Schedule for the
Northern routes, please accept this email as my vehement
opposition to the proposed service cuts for the LD routes! I
am outraged! The additional time added to the (already)
time-consuming LD commute, along with the increased
risk/danger to passengers having to transfer at a Broomfield
station, is completely unacceptable. We (Longmont) do not
have our rail, and now we're told that our our LD bus service
is going discontinued.
I've been dependent upon, and supportive of RTD route for
over 15 years. Though I mainly commute during peak hours,
it is relatively often that I need to utilize the LD routes with a
late morning commute; early in the afternoon, or even late
into the evening.
Many frustrating (if not dangerous) scenarios come to mind
with this proposed change. For example, evening commuters
risk being stranded overnight at an Broomfield stop if the FF
is behind schedule and a rider misses the last connection to
Longmont. Even if one doesn't miss the connection, a rider
could be forced to wait at an outdoor stop in Broomfield for
up to an hour. This could be in darkness, and/or in the cold
of winter. This increased risk to personal safety alone, is
unacceptable.
I also think of the many riders who do not drive at all.
Currently, they must coordinate a Longmont City route with
an LD route. As of January, they will have to also add a
coordinating stop with an FF route. This can easily turn oneway of their Longmont-Denver commute into 2 hours!
I do take note that all fingers are pointing to a Grant that will
expire, as the culprit. If this is true, I must ask why it was not
pursued beyond 2018? Who would be responsible for
pursuing this Grant? Why would RTD allow this to happen,
even if not their responsibility? Why are we only hearing of
this now? Does RTD not have any concern for their Longmont
community??!
I understand the staffing issues that RTD has been plagued
with, as you and I have discussed at prior Longmont RTD
meetings. However, it seems increasingly apparent that
Longmont (and all of the NW Boulder County area) continues
to be the target of RTD reductions, yet we continue to pay
the same in fares and taxes for the vanishing service.
Please share this with your peers at RTD, as I'm not aware of
everyone who is involved in this (atrocious) decision -making
process. Also, if you have Judy Lubow's email address, please
share it with me. The link to her email on the RTD site, will
not work for me.

I must ask that RTD takes a long and hard look about the
elimination of the LD line going into Denver. Longmont only
has a few express buses to take us to Denver and back home.
Now it is being proposed to take more routes from us. I
would be fine with deleting the LDs if you were adding some
more LXs. Many nights I have to work late and take the LD at
6:30PM or even the 7:30. This doesn’t put me home until 8 or
9 PM. With the proposed changes I can assume it would even
be longer and I would have to take two or three busses to get
home. It is not safe for a woman to be waiting in the dark for
busses. Longmont put up a lot of money to keep RTD running
between Denver and Longmont and RTD is talking about
canceling our service. This doesn’t seem fair. Many of the
Longmont riders will probably stop riding in January between
the price hikes and eliminating our service. PLEASE I AM
BAGGING PLEASE DON’T TAKE OUR BUSSES.
I am writing to provide comments on the proposed LD route
changes for January 2019. The proposal to discontinue direct
service to Denver Union Station will sever Longmont's access
to the RTD network and make an already long trip completely
prohibitive on public transit. Today, when I ride an LD1 or LD2
bus, the overwhelming majority of customers
boarding/exiting along 287 are riding the bus to/from Union
Station. By forcing these customers to now take a much
longer route and add a change of bus, it now is easier to
simply drive to Denver and puts more cars on area roads.
I am extremely disappointed in RTD's proposal and feel that it
does not serve the community of Longmont. Personally, this
change will force me to abandon taking the LD route into
downtown and limit the times I can even use the LX buses
during commute hours since I often need to take an LD bus
one-way due to already limited schedules.
I strongly encourage RTD to re-evaluate this change and
maintain Longmont's link to the Denver area's primary transit
hub and not isolate Longmont from the greater RTD network.
Please don't get rid of these services between Longmont and
Denver!
I was reading your Proposed January 2019 Service Changes
for the LD liines and it makes several references to LD3. Is
LD3 going to be a new route? Does it already exist? I see no
reference to route LD3 anywhere in your current schedules.
I plan on attending the Oct 3 public meeting in Lafayette, but
before going I want to make sure I am not missing something
already available (Route LD3).

The LD buses that come out of Union Station in the afternoon
between 4:15, 4:20, 4:56, 5:16 and 5:31 are usually always
crowded. Some of them may not be completely full, but
neither are the Boulder FF buses. I know because I also go
down to Boulder from time to time.
I’ve taken McCaslin buses in the morning on occasion, and
they come every 8-10 minutes and are not always crowded,
maybe one person per double seat.
I find RTDs proposal to eliminate the LDs that takes
passengers from Lafayette straight to Union Station very
disturbing to say the least. It will require all people to change
buses at least once, if not twice, when service has been
seamless. It will greatly increase commuting time for many,
many people, and force a lot of us to begin driving to other
PNRs to get straight bus service from point A to point B.
Currently, I walk to one of the stops along 287 and now will
have to consider driving 4-5 miles to get to McCaslin PNR to
make it to work on time, thereby defeating the purpose of
taking mass transit and keeping extra cars off of the roadway.
If the LD did not exist, I would never have accepted
employment commuting down to Denver. It is too congested
on the roadways and expensive to drive and park. I have
been taking the L to and from Denver every weekday for the
past 10 years. The direct trip down to Union Station on one
bus makes it convenient. I cannot see supporting RTD with
my tax dollars if direct service is not continued. It seems that
RTD could continue direct service to and from
Longmont/Lafayette/Denver at least during rush hour. Those
buses are crowded.
The Flatiron bus service doesn't start until 6 am in the
morning. A lot of us need a bus prior to that time. Perhaps
the L could eliminate one of the bus between 5-6 am and fill
those buses, make other adjustments to the schedule and
eliminate so many buses on Saturday.
Please don't end the LD1/LD2 bus route. At a time when
metro denver traffic is getting worse, at a time when we
need to be expanding public transportation (for many
reasons including helping the climate), at a time when cities
like Lafayette and Longmont are growing and Denver is

adding jobs, now is not the time to cut these lines. It's the
time to expand and try to add new riders. These routes are
used and needed by many people. Ending these lines will hurt
RTD more by forcing people to find alternative (non RTD)
means of transportation. More people will be lost than those
who will deal with the bus transfer(s). RTD should be
expanding service and making it easier for people to ride.
RTD should be trying to grow and not shrink. We can't just
keep cutting service and hoping that things will get better.
Boulder county needs this route and I am sure I am not alone
in saying, please keep this route.
How many different ways are you going to find to screw
Longmont and it’s residents? First, you fail to live up to your
promise to the community on Northwest Rail. Now, you’re
cutting our city’s direct service to Denver in more than half.
It’s absolutely wrong. If I were the City, this would be the
final straw in our relationship. But, I’m not the city. I’m a CU
Denver student who relies on the LD1 and LD2 for reliable
transportation to get to class on time. Without the 9:26 and
1:01 LD on Tuesday/Thursday I wouldn’t be able to make it to
class those days. You say it’s a ridership issue. But, my LD
busses consistently are at least 50% full, even I non-peak
hours. That’s better than lots of routes you aren’t
threatening. Yet, because this is a Longmont-centric Route,
you want it gone. It’s really shameful. Essentially ending
non-peak hour direct service between Denver and Longmont
hurts RTD’s perception in our community and hurts RTD’s
long-term bottom line. Please retain the LD1 and LD2 direct
service between Denver and Union Station.
My bus driver just announced that there is a plan in January
to eliminate these routes that I use Monday - Friday to get to
work.. why???? How am I going to get to an from work and
home ? Please explain to me why these routes are being
eliminated and what else I can do to stop these routes from
being eliminated. I will write everyday until I get a valid
response.
I was at last night’s Longmont meeting, and I felt the need to
write in to say that at least 2 of us in the audience were
actually paying attention.
I’m not usually in favor of changes that add a transfer,
because it can intimidate newbie bus riders. But after hearing
the explanation of the proposed changes, I’m a bit sad they
got delayed. It sounded like they were faster, more frequent,
and cheaper, which is a hard combination to hit! And both
“faster” and “more frequent” helps a route appeal to
newbies. I was very impressed with the solution overall, it
seemed like not only a cost-saving measure, but a genuine

improvement in service. I know you folks probably can’t
endorse any specific initiatives, but I’ll be on the lookout for
ballot measures that increase RTD’s funding. I’m pleased with

like having a bigger pool for driver/mechanic salaries would

My name is Sarah and I am a patron who often uses the LD1
to commute from Lafayette to Union Station. I would like to
voice my opinion for the proposed route change for the LD1. I
am not in favor of any change that would alter the route or
frequency of this bus. It is the only bus that does not require
several transfers to get downtown in a timely manner. Any
other route adds a significant amount of time to my daily
commute. Please do not remove one of the best forms of
transportation for myself and those who take this bus along
with me.
I appose the cancellation of LD1 and LD2. I live in Old Town
Erie and catch the LD2 @ Diamond and 287 in the morning
to get to work @ 16th and Larimer and return by the LD1 or
LD2 after work. Canceling these routes would create great
hardship for my self and many other bus riders. There are
many passengers that get on or off through out Lafayette.
The 7:33 LD 2 at Diamond and 287 in the morning typically
has 8+ riders that get on there. I know people that would
like to take the bus if there were more time options in the
morning and evening. One specifically would be getting to
Denver before 8am.
I hope you take this in to consideration and NOT cancel the
route.
I work in downtown Denver and am a frequent rider of the
LX1/2 lines. There are times when I cannot make the last LX
bus leaving at 5:45 P.M. from Union Station and am forced to
take the LD line back to Longmont. Despite the low ridership
of the LD lines it is the only option I have going from Union
Station/ Work to Longmont/ Home. I don't drive and don't
own a car so I depend on the Longmont/ Denver routes on a
daily basis, to include Saturdays. Adding an additional line
(the 225) would add to my already lengthy commute. In my
opinion the Longmont/ Denver routes should not be changed
at all. As a rider I do see how many people ride and depend
on all the LD and LX routes on a daily basis and these changes
would effect the riders negatively. Longmont is the only city
that have limited bus lines to and from the city unlike Boulder
or Denver. If lines are cut or changed it may require riders to

To RTD regarding proposed service changes to Route LD1 and
LD2. As more commuters travel from the Longmont area to
Downtown Denver for work and school, it is important to
have several public transportation options. Unfortunately,
light rail has not been established in Longmont; therefore,
commuters must rely on RTD Regional Routes to get to
Downtown Denver and back. The LD Southbound Routes are
very important to morning commuters when the LX Route
does not run. The LD Northbound Routes are very important
during the afternoon commute back to Longmont. If a
situation is happening along I-25, many riders choose to
avoid the area (avoid the LX) and take the LD routes. Also, the
final LX route is at 5:45 pm, whereas the LD has several later
options. Additionally, the LX Northbound Routes seem to be
at or near capacity during the afternoon rush hour. It would
be very beneficial to add additional northbound rush hour LX
routes if the proposed changes are implemented.
In conclusion, my feedback is the proposed service changes
to the LD routes would have an adverse impact on riders. If
the proposed changes are implemented, additional LX routes
are strongly recommended for the northbound
afternoon/evening rush hours.

I understand that the proposed change to the above routes is
that they will end at the Broomfield exit. Here are my
Comments: I take the bus to Denver every day and have
gotten off at Broomfield several times to catch a FFlyer to
Denver. They are always packed and I’ve had to stand each
time. So I no longer attempt to catch a FFlyer. If you
discontinue the bus as is I will have to take 3 buses to work.
From Lafayette to Broomfield to Union Station and then hop
on the Metro Ride. The ride home will be very inconvenient.
I will have to get off the bus at Broomfield and cross over the
bridge to catch a LDI or LD2.. It’s going to extend the length
of time it takes me to get home in addition to being out in
the elements for longer periods of time both coming and
going to work. In bad weather I already am at an
unprotected bus stop. Longmont/Lafayette LD1/LD2 always
seems to be the ugly stepchild. In recent years they finally
adjusted the schedules so that both of these routes stop
along 287 and Empire Road and have more than just three
Saturday buses. There is still no service on Sundays. I
propose that the routes stay as they are.
I would like to ask that you keep the route for the LD1 and LD
2, this route helps assist a lot of people with using our public
transportation to commute home. We are trying to push
public transportation in Colorado to help with pollution
levels, and for some this is their only way home. Eliminating
this route could force some into a bad situation.
I commute from Broomfield to Denver each weekday, and I
purchase a $171 monthly pass every month. I understand
the logic of eliminating the LD routes south of US-36 as these
duplicate FF routes. This will require me to transfer at
Broomfield station, but I think that is reasonable. My
concern, however is the proposed decrease in frequency of
225 (which will be renamed LD3). Today during rush-hour,
either an LD bus or 225 stops at 287 & 10th Ave (which is
where I live) every 15 to 20 minutes. The proposed changes
indicate that 225's frequency will be every 60 minutes. This
change in frequency in addition to the transfer required at
Broomfield station, will have a significant negative impact on
my commute next year. If at all possible please increase the
frequency of the 225 (which will be renamed LD3) to less
than every 60 minutes.

I oppose the January 2019 “LD” proposed service changes.
You have taken away from Longmont (and Lafayette and
Niwot) so many promises that have been made through the
years, and now this?
I have been commuting from Longmont CO from the
ParkNRide on south Main Street (Hwy 287) to downtown
Denver either via thru Market Street and now Union Station
since February of 2007. I have had both knee replacements
which now need to be replaced again, as well as needing a
hip replacement. The LD1, LD2 and LX buses have given me
mobility to keep my job in Denver. (Why we ended up with
LD1 and LD2 busses has been a mystery to me. It seemed to
run smooth and fine with just L and LX buses.) The complete
removal of the LD1 and LD2 busses south of US36 will only
bring me hardship and exposure waiting in the weather
elements. This not only affects me but and all the other
disabled people, both those unstable in their walking gait, a
blind gentleman and others with vision problems that ride,
and those that are wheel chair confined. Our winter
weather can be particularly cold blustery weather, and some
years much snow, let alone there be any ice that may have all
of the handicapped such as myself unstable on our feet or in
their wheelchairs.
It is my understanding that either going south or north (I am
not sure at this time) that there will be some tunnel I will
have to walk through under US36 to get to the other side of
US36 to get on another bus? This could put me at risk of
injury, and even the possibility of not being able to get to my
job.
The suggestion of using the FF buses will be a joke,
particularly when there are sports events in downtown
Denver. Tell me it is not so that there are often times FF
buses that have only standing room only? I am not able to
stand very long, let alone an entire trip. Would you also
propose that I wait again in the weather elements for the
next FF bus that might have a place to sit? I have been on the
LD busses with drivers who have jockeyed up and helped out
the FF bus drivers whose busses were too full.
Do we even need the LD2 Northbound from Union Station
bus times and the LD2 Southbound to Union Station bus
times? It seems the LD2 travel the same routes as LD1 except
skip a couple of stops along the way. (Except please consider
changing the 10:16 pm from an LD2 to an LD1.) Whoever
dreamed up not stopping in Lafayette on the last run north
must of not gotten enough sleep the night before making
that decision.
At the same time, why not look at having fewer LD1

Northbound from Union Station bus times and fewer LD1
Southbound to Union Stations. Right now Northbound to
Longmont there are 3:15, 4:15, 4:55, 5:25, 6:01, 6:31, 7:31,
8:31 and 10:16 pm (a total of 9 LD1 runs). Why not change
that to 3:30, 4:30, 5:30, 6:30, 7:30, 8:30 and 10:16 pm (and
eliminate 2 of them for a total of 7 LD1 runs)? Look at doing
much the same for Southbound from Longmont to Union
Station.
There are many better proposals than what is being
suggested in your brochure on proposed changes. Please and
thanks for considering other means of saving money for RTD,
or at least try a different schedule eliminating some of the
runs and their times first.

I oppose the proposed changes for the LD1 route. I am a
single mother of 2 school age children. We are dependent on
the LD1 bus route to get my children to school and for myself
to work since we cannot afford a car. It would bring undue
hardship to my family if this route were to be eliminated.
Having to take alternate routes would mean a longer
commute time, less sleep for my family, longer exposure to
the elements which is definitely a major factor taking into
consideration our climate in Colorado. The LD1 is a very
frequently used route and has multiple users who are
handicapped as well and this would also leave them exposed
to the elements for a prolonged time and longer commutes
for them as well.
An alternative option could possibly be to reduce the amount
of trips instead of completely eliminating the route and all
scheduled times. It would be helpful to choose these times
based off of amount passengers. Eliminating the LD1 is unfair
to the community that lives in the Lafayette and Longmont
areas. Many of the people who use this route are doing so to
commute to work and or school. It would bring so many
people who are dependent upon public transportation undue
hardship. I have extreme respect for the drivers and
understand the shortage of drivers and appreciate all the
service RTD provides. It would greatly affect and sadden the
Lafayette and Longmont community if the LD1 service were
to be discontinued.
Thank you for your time and I hope RTD takes the publics
concerns and needs into consideration.
When Is RTD Denver To Add Underground Subway Rail
System?
Last year I submitted several email requests for a look into
the Majestic Commercenter Business Park (off of Tower and
32nd Pkwy) which has been steadily growing over the past 10
years. There are no bus routes that drive through the
business park, although many of the employees utilize bus
services to get to work, but are often walking 1-2 miles to
reach their place of business from the nearest bus stop.
There are over 1000 employees, including an Amazon
distribution center and a Fed Ex warehouse, both of which
have said they have many employees who currently use the
bus system.
If possible, I would love to see a route come down E. 32nd
Parkway, at least stopping around Himalaya Road, which is
our main intersection within the business park. I believe this
would put most employees within 0.5-0.75 miles from their
work, and I think many more employees would consider
taking the bus if it was more convenient to do so. The route

could turn around at either Lisbon or 31st Circle to take it
back to Tower Road, or even come up Windsor for an
additional stop closer to 38th and Windsor where many large
warehouses are clustered. Please let me know if there is
anything else I can do to assist in this consideration!

I would like to request that the 12:09 bus leaving Civic Center
Station NOT be discontinued. This is the only option for
people on the east end of Denver to get back to Brighton
before the 3:15 bus.
I have been riding the RX bus the past 7 years (the old RC and
R routes too). I have seen the ebb’s and tides of this route.
For people working downtown, many work a “4-9’s” and 4”
schedule. The midday bus allows for these people to continue
to work that 4 hour day and still be able to use the bus to
return home.
The only option for bus service would be for these folks to
travel from the east end of Denver to Union Station, ride the
120x to Wagon Road, then take the 120 to Brighton.
The 120 bus has been extremely unreliable in schedules and
runs altogether. And it only runs every hour. This option will
increase the travel time by at least 30 to 45 minutes, if
everything is perfect.
Also, there are a lot of students at local colleges that ride the
“noon” bus out of Denver. By elimin ating this bus, will place
a hardship on these students. The 12:09 bus leaving Civic
Center also allows for early return trips to Brighton due to
weather conditions. This is more prevalent in the winter
months. There have been several times in the past when
severe snow storms have shut down businesses in downtown
Denver. The 12:09 will allow for folks to get out. If eliminated
(12:09 bus), the 3:15 bus and all after that, will be extremely
over-loaded, not to mention the interior of Civic Center
building becoming over-crowded.
If you want to discontinue the 10:30 am route from Brighton,
that’s fine, but don’t eliminate the 12:09 from Civic Center
Station - PLEASE And please get the North end rail line built
and running asap! Once that is up and running, modifying the
RX route would have less impact on people. Don’t leave the
North end of metro Denver out of the loop. We have been
the last on the list for many, many years and are tired of
getting the short straw. We have paid our RTD taxes for
years and years, and continue to do so. We’d like to get
something back for that money we have paid in.

I wish to echo the concerns of Boulder County Alternative
Transportation Coordinator Scott McCarey. At the August 21,
2018 Board of Directors meeting, Coordinator McCarey spoke
in opposition to the midday cuts proposed for Route Y. The
reason for the cuts given as being "low ridership" rings
hollow, since Boulder County wishes to pay for the service
beyond what it warranted by RTD service standards. The
underlying reason for the cuts appears to be the continuing
operator shortage.
I'm also shocked that a representative of Boulder County had
to make this request during the portion of RTD Board of
Directors meetings reserved for comments by members of
the general public. I hope that RTD has since been able to
work directly with Boulder County to achieve a more
mutually satisfactory proposal.
