Eighth Amendment to GM/CEO Employment Agreement

December 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
December 10, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an Eighth Amendment to the Employment Agreement with General
Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson (contract) to extend the term of the contract for a period
of 18 months, through and including May 8, 2027, as set forth in the attached proposed amendment.
REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On September 29, 2020, the Board and Ms. Johnson entered into the contract, and subsequently the
parties executed seven amendments thereto. The contract currently expires on November 8, 2025.
On September 26, 2023, the Board adopted the Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO, attached as
Exhibit F to the proposed amendment (Compensation Philosophy). The Compensation Philosophy
provides that the Board will endeavor to hold meaningful discussions about extending the term of the
contract no later than 18 months prior to the expiration of the contract’s term. The Board and GM/CEO
have engaged in such discussion consistent with the Compensation Philosophy.
Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment to the contract, the Board engaged a third party by competitive
solicitation to conduct a total compensation analysis (Compensation Study). Among other findings, the
August 30, 2024 Compensation Study found that on average, comparator agencies include an additional
$10,000 in executive perquisites in their CEO’s total compensation.
On December 4, 2024, the Board unanimously approved the 2024 GM/CEO performance appraisal with
the Board’s assessment that GM/CEO Johnson met expectations with respect to the Board-adopted
2024 Performance Assessment Framework.
DISCUSSION
Because GM/CEO Johnson has met the Board’s performance expectations, and with the agency’s best
interests in mind, it is recommended that the Board extend the contract for 18 months through and
including May 8, 2027. In addition to this extension, the proposed Eighth Amendment includes the
following terms:

•

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,
and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however the Board will endeavor
to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation Philosophy
Effective November 9, 2024, and through the Term Extension, GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for
annual Standard and Elective Executive Perquisites as set forth in Exhibit E, with Annual Elective
Perquisites not to exceed $5,750
During the Term Extension, if the Board terminates the contract other than for Cause, RTD must
pay GM/CEO Johnson the salary at the rate then in effect for the lesser of the remaining Term
Extension period or 12 months, but in no case less than three months’ salary
RTD will reimburse GM/CEO Johnson up to $5,000 for all reasonable and necessary costs
associated with the legal review of the Eighth Amendment by external legal counsel of her choice

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with this Recommended Action is set forth in Exhibit E to the proposed
amendment and the Annual Total Compensation table attachment. Any future potential Adjusted Base
Salary increase would be recognized following Board action on the annual GM/CEO performance
assessment.

(18) months through and including May 8, 2027 (“Term Extension”).
3.
Amendment of Article III. (a) of the Original Agreement. Article III. (a) is
hereby replaced with the following:
As compensation to Ms. Johnson for the services to be rendered to RTD during the term of the
Agreement, she shall be paid an annual base salary of Three Hundred Fifteen Thousand Dollars
($315,000.00) ("Base Salary"), beginning on the 9th day of November, 2020, payable in
accordance with RTD's regular payroll procedures, and subject to such payroll deductions and
withholdings as are required by law or authorized by Ms. Johnson. Following the annual
performance evaluations outlined in Article III (b), Ms. Johnson shall be eligible for an “Adjusted
Base Salary” and “Incentive Compensation One-Time Payment” as set forth in Exhibit B to
this Agreement. In order to set Ms. Johnson’s Adjusted Base Salary and Incentive Compensation
One-Time Payment for performance periods beginning January 1, 2023, RTD will engage a third
party by competitive solicitation to conduct a compensation and benchmarking analysis
(“Compensation Analysis”). Consistent with the Compensation Analysis, effective November 9,
2023, the Base Salary shall be increased by 1.8% from $395,120 to $402,325. For performance
periods beginning January 1, 2023, Ms. Johnson shall be eligible for a compensation increase of a
percentage of the Adjusted Base Salary to be determined by the Board in consultation with Ms.
Johnson based on the Compensation Analysis (“Compensation Increase”), of which the
distribution between base salary and incentive compensation may be adjusted annually. If RTD

additional 2% Over-Performance Goal incentive payment. For the performance period beginning
January 1, 2024, Ms. Johnson shall be eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary as set

to conduct a total compensation study (“Total Compensation Study”) and take appropriate action

Study findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of the Compensation Philosophy
principles, consideration of any information provided by Ms. Johnson, and consultation with Ms.
Johnson prior to the Board taking any action. Such review and action does not require the Board
to adopt any Adjusted Base Salary or other compensation increase. For the annual performance
periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension, Ms. Johnson shall be eligible
for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set by the Board in accordance
with Article III. (b). For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through

with an evaluation of her performance based upon the criteria set forth in the Job Description

recruitment in the form found in Exhibit C to this Agreement (“Job Description”). If the Board
does not provide an evaluation to Ms. Johnson by December 31, 2021, and by December 31 of
each year thereafter, Ms. Johnson will be deemed to have met all performance expectations for
that performance period. For performance periods beginning January 1, 2022, the annual
performance appraisal score shall be comprised of 50% objective Success Outcomes and 50%
subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the Board pursuant to the Strategic Plan, including
any amendments thereto. For the performance period of January 1, 2022 through December 31,
2022, the Success Outcomes shall include only Community Value, Customer Excellence, and
Financial Success, with equal weight being given to each for a total of 50% of the appraisal score.
Beginning on November 1, 2022, and each November 1 thereafter for the remainder of the
Agreement, Ms. Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to the Weighted Success
Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between base salary and
incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the Board’s consideration. By January
31, 2024, and each January 31 thereafter for the remainder of the Agreement, after consideration
of Ms. Johnson’s proposal and consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board shall adopt the Weighted
Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, and Goals and the distribution of the Compensation
Increase between base salary and incentive compensation for that year’s performance period. If

compensation, Ms. Johnson shall be evaluated and compensated based upon the criteria for the
prior performance period. By January 31, 2025, and each January 31 thereafter through the Term
Extension, after consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board shall adopt the Agency Values, Shortterm Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with corresponding point distribution

for that year’s performance period. If the Board fails to do so, Ms. Johnson shall be evaluated and
compensated based upon the criteria for the prior performance period. Beginning January 1, 2025,
and thereafter through the Term Extension, the Board shall meet with Ms. Johnson each quarter to
discuss her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals. The Board shall
make reasonable efforts to confer with Ms. Johnson to ensure such meetings are scheduled at
mutually agreed times.

States Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, or its
successor index, on each employment anniversary date thereafter. For the performance period
beginning January 1, 2024, Ms. Johnson shall not be eligible for the COLA, unless the Board fails
to complete the Total Compensation Study as set forth in Article III (a). In such case, Ms. Johnson
shall receive the COLA in an amount not to exceed 5% and remain eligible for the Pay-forPerformance increase to the Adjusted Base Salary. For the annual performance periods beginning
January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension, Ms. Johnson shall not be eligible for the COLA.
The Board will endeavor to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the
Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023, attached

Executive Perquisites, including both Standard and Elective Perquisites as set forth in Exhibit E.

no later than 30 days after her employment anniversary date.

Article IV(e), RTD shall continue to pay to Ms. Johnson the salary at the rate then in effect for
twelve (12) consecutive months following such termination (“Severance Period”). During the

those set forth in Article IV(e), RTD shall pay to Ms. Johnson the salary at the rate then in effect
for the lesser of the remaining Term Extension period or twelve (12) consecutive months following
such termination, but in no case shall Ms. Johnson receive less than three (3) months’ salary

Extension Period, Ms. Johnson (and her spouse and eligible dependents) shall be entitled to

each year thereafter, Ms. Johnson will be deemed to have met all performance expectations for
that performance period. For performance periods beginning January 1, 2022, the annual
performance appraisal score shall be comprised of 50% objective Success Outcomes and 50%
subjective Organizational Values as adopted by the Board pursuant to the Strategic Plan, including
any amendments thereto. For the performance period of January 1, 2022 through December 31,
2022, the Success Outcomes shall include only Community Value, Customer Excellence, and
Financial Success, with equal weight being given to each for a total of 50% of the appraisal score.
Beginning on November 1, 2022, and each November 1 thereafter for the remainder of the
Agreement, Ms. Johnson shall propose any suggested adjustments to the Weighted Success
Outcomes, Organizational Values, or Goals and the proposed distribution between base salary and
incentive compensation of the Compensation Increase for the Board’s consideration. By January
31, 2024, after consideration of Ms. Johnson’s proposal and consultation with Ms. Johnson, the
Board shall adopt the Weighted Success Outcomes, Organizational Values, and Goals and the
distribution of the Compensation Increase between base salary and incentive compensation for that
year’s performance period. If the Board fails to adopt that year’s Weighted Success Outcomes,
Organizational Values, and Goals and the distribution of the Compensation Increase between base
salary and incentive compensation, Ms. Johnson shall be evaluated and compensated based upon
the criteria for the prior performance period. By January 31, 2025, and each January 31 thereafter
through the Term Extension, after consultation with Ms. Johnson, the Board shall adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,
and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which Ms. Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period. If the Board fails to do so, Ms.
Johnson shall be evaluated and compensated based upon the criteria for the prior performance
period. Beginning January 1, 2025, and thereafter through the Term Extension, the Board shall
meet with Ms. Johnson each quarter to discuss her performance, including her progress toward the
Short-term Goals. The Board shall make reasonable efforts to confer with Ms. Johnson to ensure
such meetings are scheduled at mutually agreed times.

Amendment of Article III. (c) of the Original Agreement. Article III. (c) is
hereby replaced with the following:
In addition to any incentive awards and annual increases as outlined in Article III(b), during the
term of the Agreement and periods of continuation thereafter, the Base Salary shall be
automatically increased by a cost-of-living adjustment (“COLA”) as measured by the United
States Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Denver-Aurora-Lakewood, or its
successor index, on each employment anniversary date thereafter. For the performance period
beginning January 1, 2024, Ms. Johnson shall not be eligible for the COLA, unless the Board fails
to complete the Total Compensation Study as set forth in Article III (a). In such case, Ms. Johnson
shall receive the COLA in an amount not to exceed 5% and remain eligible for the Pay-forPerformance increase to the Adjusted Base Salary. For the annual performance periods beginning
January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension, Ms. Johnson shall not be eligible for the COLA.
The Board will endeavor to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the
Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023, attached

Executive Perquisites, including both Standard and Elective Perquisites as set forth in Exhibit E.
The values of Standard Perquisites are based on currently available information and may fluctuate
over time due to service adjustments and insurance premium increases. Ms. Johnson shall
nonetheless be entitled to receive the annual Standard Perquisites regardless of any future increase.
Annual Elective Perquisites shall not exceed $5,750. Ms. Johnson shall make elections annually
no later than 30 days after her employment anniversary date.

twelve (12) consecutive months following such termination (“Severance Period”). During the

those set forth in Article IV(e), RTD shall pay to Ms. Johnson the salary at the rate then in effect
for the lesser of the remaining Term Extension period or twelve (12) consecutive months following

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi‐modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:












Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay‐for‐performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay‐for‐performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.

Denver Regional Transportation District

ABOUT RTD:
The Denver metropolitan area and the State of Colorado are world-renowned destinations for recreation,
sports and culture. The entire region is welcoming, diverse and offers fantastic places to live and raise a family
with some of the best public schools, colleges and universities that the nation has to offer. Whether enjoying
restaurants and breweries, taking in iconic scenery, or experiencing culture and history, the surrounding region
is an excellent place to live and work.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is the region’s public transit agency created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly, connecting Denver residents through an affordable, safe, clean, reliable, accessible, and
customer friendly community-oriented transportation network. As a nationally recognized leader, RTD
provides public transit services, including rail, bus, access, and shuttle services across 2,400 square miles to 40
municipalities (3.1 million people) within eight counties including Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Jefferson and
parts of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas and Weld Counties. RTD is governed by a 15-member, publicly elected
Board of Directors each serving a four-year term.
The region prides itself on innovation, inclusion, multi-culturalism, diversity, and environmental sustainability
and RTD’s vision is further enhance the region’s quality of life as well as to augment the pattern of urban
development throughout the region. RTD continues to develop dynamic programs to benefit both business
and the community it serves, making RTD an important cornerstone for the Denver community.
In 2004, RTD embarked upon the nation’s largest public transportation capital expansion program. RTD has
been steadily working on its commitment to deliver on this voter-approved program, known as FasTracks.
While, circumstances have changed and budgets have been stressed with economic events occurring such as
the 2008 recession, in 2019, RTD embarked upon a two-year “Reimagine RTD” effort. Even with this effort
underway, uncertainties still exist with COVID-19 and other unforeseen factors arising.
As such, RTD is continuously listening to its communities’ needs and striving to find necessary funding and cost
savings that will support creative transit solutions in order to uphold its commitment to provide safe, timely,
affordable, convenient, accessible and equitable transit solutions to the entire region. By reimaging transit and
creating a new vision, RTD is committed to supporting the economic engine that the greater Denver region has
become while also being a key partner in social, economic, environmental, and sustainable development
programs.
