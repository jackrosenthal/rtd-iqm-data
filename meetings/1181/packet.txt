BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: June 12, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

Date:

Board Meeting Date: June 18, 2013

Subject:

Approval for Increase in Contract Not-toExceed Amount for Smart Card Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase the current contract not-to-exceed amount
by $1,719,512.81 with Xerox, Inc. (Formerly ACS Transportation Solutions, Inc.). The total new
contract not-to-exceed amount is $17,381,470.23.
BACKGROUND
The Smart Card Implementation transitioned EcoPass, CollegePass, and NeighborhoodPass programs
from cards with decals to electronic smart cards this past January, 2013. The next phase of the
Smart Card Program is to transition all other retail pass products to stored value on MyRide Smart
Cards. RTD Retail Sales locations will begin selling the MyRide products in fall of 2013, while the
retail network including King Soopers, Safeway and other retailers will begin selling the MyRide
Products in spring of 2014.
As the Smart Card Program progresses, additional equipment is required to provide for program and
FasTracks advances, enhancements and growth. Therefore additional funds are needed to acquire
and install a variety of equipment including:










Installation of platform validators at existing rail stations
Enhancements to the handheld smart media readers used by Fare Enforcement
Integration costs to allow the CAD/AVL driver display to provide Smart Card information
(eliminating the need for two driver displays)
Modification of the mounting device on buses ensuring the bus validator is properly positioned
for riders
Maintenance terminals for maintaining all Smart Media validators at light rail locations
Purchase of an additional Smart Media Encoder to provide redundancy needed at the
Customer Service Center for producing cards.
Purchase of additional smart media cards to meet the needs of current EcoPass and
CollegePass holders through the end of 2013
Purchase of additional Smart Media Validators over the course of several years to meet
FasTracks expansion needs.
Additional web portal enhancements to improve customer experience and management of
their own MyRide card.

DISCUSSION
This equipment will ensure customers are provided convenient access to station platform validators as
RTD’s use of the Smart Media increases. Additionally, the maintenance equipment and encoding
equipment will allow RTD to improve customer service by more expediently addressing issues and
producing cards.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

This equipment must be purchased by Xerox, Inc. for multiple reasons:




The equipment is unique to the Xerox/RTD installed systems and it would be extremely
difficult if not impossible to acquire from other vendors.
The card purchase addresses demands for this year and future card purchases will be
procured in an open competition.
Xerox has developed the software for this specific equipment being used at transit agencies
around the globe and have proven the stability and effectiveness of their product.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the estimated purchase of eight (8) maintenance terminals,
one (1) Smart Media Encoder, 80,000 cards, 1500 hours of web portal development, 170 platform
validators, installation of 24 platform validators, development hours to enhance the Handheld Smart
Media Readers (HSMRs), development hours to create the CAD/AVL and Smart Card interface, and
50 stanchion modifications. The funding is included in the Proposed 2014 - 2019 SBP Capital
Program and the proposed 2013 Amended Budget Request.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to Xerox, Inc., as recommended
2)
Do not purchase equipment. Validators would need to be reduced and redistributed
from the existing locations, impairing convenience for customer to tap before boarding
light rail. Not purchasing maintenance equipment will result in delayed response to
validator issues. Not purchasing an encoder could result in lengthy delays of delivering
cards ordered via the web due to equipment malfunction. Not purchasing smart cards
in the near term could result in not having cards available for employers and colleges to
distribute to their riders.
3)
A partial award to Xerox, Inc., for the validators, maintenance terminals and encoder,
as recommended. Issue an RFP for bid on additional smart cards. An RFP is currently
planned for distribution in June, 2013; however, the lengthy process for establishing
the proper encoding of security keys will result in a shortage of cards prior to the end
of 2013.

Subject:

Board Report August 2013 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the proposed August 2013 Service Change as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of $1,108,900 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee
to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose services are impacted by
these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. For this year we will continue adjusting
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a
whole while also focusing attention on the recent implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service
and the associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the
West Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the
appropriate level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer
response to the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The proposed August 2013 Service Changes reflect the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD.
The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are proposed to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent changes proposed to the service
changes initially proposed to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of August 2013 service
changes:
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: add one Weekday AM trip eastbound
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton: schedule adjustments

1.B.2.a

Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Extend 8:00am weekday westbound trip from 8th/Colorado to instead originate at
Centrepoint & Sable Transfer Center at 7:21am. Relieves overloads on the following trip
at 7:36am from Centrepoint & Sable. The cost is estimated to be $10,300 annualized
Route 9 – West Tenth Avenue
School trippers would be discontinued due to parallel Light Rail service. (Offset against
part of cost of Route 100W trippers added.)
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Schedule adjustments and add an additional trip eastbound to address passenger
overloads.
The cost is estimated to be $6,900
Route 12 – Downing/N Washington
Add 3:20pm northbound trip from Downing/Colfax to 106th/Melody, relieving overloads
on the following trip. Cost impact estimated at $8,300 annualized.
Route 14 – West Florida
It is proposed to extend the weekday trip that (in April) starts at Wadsworth/West
Arkansas at 6:39 a.m. to instead begin service at Lakewood Commons at 6:24 a.m.
Estimated cost are projected to be $2,600 annualized
Route 16 – West Colfax
Peak and midday overloads are occurring at a level which clearly exceeds RTD service
standards. These overloads occur on a regular basis on the link between Decatur-Federal
Station and the Civic Center. This segment carries a heavy burden of social services and
court traffic throughout the day, with space needed for disabled customers and strollers or
walkers. West between Decatur-Federal Station and Wadsworth, peak period overloads
are occurring, but more data is needed in order to place extra trips.
RTD will add shuttle trips as soon as possible (June 9, 2013) to lead every Route 16 trip
between Decatur-Federal and the 10th/Broadway route terminal on weekdays between the
hours of 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This will not only add back capacity, but also improve
W-Line connections for Civic Center with matching headways, making the use of Light Rail
more practical for trips west of Federal.
Proposed for August runboard:
It is proposed to extend peak period extra service to the Zephyr Street terminal
(Wadsworth Blvd.) and to extend one additional AM trip from Golden to Oak Station and
one additional PM trip from Oak Station to Golden. Projected cost impacts for this proposal
total $840,000 and 8 peak buses, including requirements for the Golden trip extensions.

1.B.2.a

Route 17 – Red Rocks College
With the extension to Indiana Street, the span of service that was appropriate for college
hours begins too late for most commuting purposes. It is proposed to add a round-trip
from Federal Center Station to Indiana Street on weekdays at 5:37 a.m. Estimated
weekday cost $5,200 annualized weekday
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Add 7:21am westbound trip from Centrepoint & Sable to Evans Station. Relieves
overloads on both the 7:06am and 7:36am westbound trips. Weekday cost impact
estimated at $15,500
Route 46 – Cherry Creek/Dahlia/DTC
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments.
No cost impacts anticipated
Route 76 – Wadsworth Crosstown
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline
Cut weekday routing of the Route 76 back from Lafayette to US 36 & Broomfield PnR.
Replace current Route 76 service with Route 225 extension from Broomfield to Lafayette
PnR. Extend Route 225 to US 36 & Broomfield PnR from Lafayette PnR, hourly headway,
weekday only, to replace current Route 76 segment. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 87X –South Wadsworth Express
The former Route 87 Express had three trips into CCS in the morning peak and three trips
out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 128 boardings. The portion of the route
west of Wadsworth near Hampden was replaced by Route 30Ltd, which has twice as long
a span of service and a one-seat ride to the center of Downtown, as well as good transfer
connections to the Union Station and Civic Center. Although slower than Route 87X, that
portion of the change has received little criticism.
It is proposed to restore the route on its former alignment, with the exception of the
segment south of Yale Avenue, which was replaced by Route 30Ltd. That portion would
be replaced by running on Wadsworth to and from the Wadsworth & Hampden Park-nRide.
Requirements for restoring the route, based on the August 2012 Service Recap with
interlines, rounded up to 2 peak buses and $82,800 annualized.
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton
Schedule adjustments. No cost anticipated
Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus
Schedule adjustments. No cost anticipated

1.B.2.a

Route 100 – Kipling Crosstown
A deviation from the current route on Quail Street is proposed to bring service closer to
the new Jefferson County Public Health location at 645 Parfet Street. Both northbound
and southbound buses would loop from Quail & Eighth via West Eighth Avenue, Parfet
Street, West Sixth Avenue Access Road and Quail Street. A minor adjustment would be
made in the Route 100W – North Kipling school tripper service to mesh with this change.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Kipling Express
The former Route 100X had four trips into Civic Center Station (CCS) in the morning peak
and five trips out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 191 boardings. Its service
pattern was replicated by the Route 100Ltd at all of the neighborhood walk-on stops made
by Route 100X, as well as at the Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride. Route 100Ltd is heavily interlined
and would require time changes for conversion to Route 100X.
In order to maintain connectivity for non-Civic Center Station bound riders, it is proposed
to re-create Route 100X via the Route 100Ltd alignment between Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride
and Federal Center Station, and via the Regional routes alignment between Federal Center
Station and Civic Center, with a short dwell at Federal Center Station (FCS). Minor
schedule adjustments would be made. The fifth (final) trip in the evening would operate
between FCS and Ken Caryl and the reverse peak trips would also operate only between
FCS and Ken Caryl and return.
Requirements for revising the route, incremental to the current costs for Route 100Ltd and
for special service that is replacing Route KC, are estimated at 1 peak bus and 6 weekday
hours. Gate assignments would be adjusted at Federal Center Station. The newly
implemented Route CS – Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station short turns trips
would be reduced where replaced by Route 100X. Annualized weekday cost estimated to
be $76,400
Route 116X – South Simms Express
The reinstated Route 116X would be maintained as restored; with further modification
anticipated in January 2014, when Route 116Ltd and the Green Mountain call-n-Ride
service can be analyzed. The cost of reinstating this service is estimated at $76,400
annualized.
Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add a SB AM trip from Thornton Park-n-Ride at about 8:40am, to alleviate
the consistent 20+ passenger overloads on the current 8:45am SB trip. Weekday cost
impact estimated to be $12,700.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
Reduce peak frequency between Nine Mile Station and Ulster/Tufts from every 15 to every
30 minutes. Ridership on peak direction trips averages between 2 and 3 passengers/trip.
Savings = 5.0 hours.

Add 1:37pm and 2:07pm northbound trips from Nine Mile, and 1:45pm southbound trip
from Montbello, to relieve standing loads on current 30 minute midday frequency. Cost:
3.7 hours weekday.
Anticipated weekday savings estimated to be $13,400 annualized
Route 130 – Yale/Buckley
Modify service through Heather Gardens as follows:
Weekdays southbound, service will operate via Yale and Peoria to Nine Mile Station during
the AM peak and evenings after 7:00pm. Service will operate via Heather Gardens midday
and PM peak.
Weekdays northbound, service will operate via Heather Gardens during the AM peak and
midday, and via Peoria and Yale during the PM peak and evenings.
All Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service will operate via Yale and Peoria.
No cost impact anticipated.
Route 131 – Iliff
Reroute off of Vaughn Way between Iliff and Yale, use Abilene instead.
neighborhood impact on Vaughn Way, will better serve future Iliff LRT Station.
No cost impact anticipated.

Eliminates

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Add 4:41am southbound trip from Centrepoint/Sable (feeds H-Line train at 5:23am), and
add 4:55am and 5:25am northbound trips from Nine Mile (this productive route – 35
boardings/hour - does not start northbound service until nearly 6:00am currently).
Weekday cost impacts estimated to be $23,800 annualized.
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Extend northbound evening service one hour later to 11:42pm from Arapahoe Crossing.
Cost impacts estimated to be $14,500 annualized.
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/North 19th
Running time adjustment; remove Vassar loop. No additional cost impact anticipated
Route 209 – CU/Table Mesa PnR
Re-route back through CU campus, via clockwise routing along Regent and Colorado to
alleviate overloads occurring on Route Stampede; move south-end layover to Manhattan
Circle, due to City of Boulder installation of a traffic signal at South Boulder Road.
Remove the ‘Adams Circle’ loop and service to Golden West from the route. Golden West
is served by VIA, special services.
No cost impact anticipated
Route 225 – Boulder/Lafayette Via Baseline

Route 228 –Louisville/Broomfield
Discontinue first Sunday morning southbound morning trip and add a Saturday southbound
PM trip from Flatiron Mall to US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Reroute north-end layover/recovery location to Pace/17th SB, FS and remove current
Deerwood loop, due to constituent complaints received; create deadhead for NB to SB
north-end turn-around via Pace, Olympia, Pace routing. In addition, due to a request by the
City of Longmont, it is proposed to add an AM school tripper on this route by using the
current BOLT block 27 pull-out. Weekday annualized cost estimated to be $5,300
Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this Fall.
Minor schedule adjustments will be made in preparation for this change. Weekday cost
impact estimated to be $5,900 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow RTD to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
the former location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table
Mesa PnR back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips.
No cost impact anticipated
Route JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
It is proposed to remove the excess layover at Erie Community Center in the mid-day and
balance the current trips at Lafayette PnR, WB to ½ hour frequency; will result in some
mid-day schedule adjustments. No resource impact anticipated.
Route KC – Ken Caryl/FC/Denver
This service has been cancelled in favor of operating reinstated service on the Route 116X
– South Simms Express. The annualized savings of $70,300 would be used to operate the
6 weekday trips (3 in each peak period) on the Route 116X.
Route SKIP – Broadway
It is proposed to add one school tripper in the PM from Fairview High School to
Broadway/Walnut at 3:29pm (or as warranted by the BVSD bell-times) due to overloads on
the current 3:25pm trip. Additionally it is proposed that schedule adjustments be made to
the weekday afternoon/evening peak period. Cost impacts include an additional PM bus
and $50,000 annualized.
W-Line Call-n-Rides: Belmar, Golden and Green Mountain:
With the opening of the West Line Light Rail, three new Call-n-Rides began operations on
April 27, 2013. As with all new services, actual operations may require adjustments after
a few months in operation. Adjustments will be made based on customer travel patterns
and customer requests. There should be no additional costs associated with these
modifications except for the Golden Call-n-Ride. Annual weekday cost: $8,025.

Customer Complaint Analysis

Information

RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, address and monitor customer complaints on a daily basis.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 1st Quarter of 2013. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the first quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of
2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were consistently
meeting the performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In
2009, RTD began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and implemented a new stroller policy which
advised passengers with strollers that they would need to move from the priority seating area if those
seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses and light rail
vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for operators to
call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures, customer complaints
increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors performed, for the most
part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012, the performance goal for
passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger boarding, and the goal for 2013
remains at .0003 complaints per passenger boarding.
For the 1st quarter of 2013, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0003 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Commerce City had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding, First
Transit Denver had .0004 passenger complaints per passenger boarding, and Veolia had .0004
passenger complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private
contractors was .0003 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL playbacks and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure

Packet Pg. 24

1.C.2

Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Market Street Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2013, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure By Operator
Passed Up Passenger At Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:

Packet Pg. 25

1.C.2

Bus Did Not Show – There was a slight decrease in this category in the first quarter of 2013 compared
to the first quarter of 2012. In many cases, CAD/AVL playbacks confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show.
Bus Early – There was an increase in this category from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of
2013. Playbacks for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible passengers see
the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. On-time performance statistics
for the 1st quarter of 2013 show just 2.8% of all time point observations were in the “early” category.
Bus Late – There was a decrease in this category in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the first
quarter of 2012. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons
including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same
number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address runningtime issues.
Careless Driving/Operator – There was a slight increase in this category from the first quarter of 2012 to
the first quarter of 2013. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed to determine if operators are
driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition, all of the private contractors have “G-force
activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart Drive) installed on their buses. These incidents
are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to
improve driving performance.
Discourtesy/Operator – There was an increase in this category from the first quarter of 2012 to the first
quarter of 2013. In the majority of cases, the investigation into these complaints proves the operator
not at fault. Video evidence usually confirms that the operator followed proper procedures and treated
the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown enforcing or explaining policies (fares,
strollers, inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a negative
manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. The
1st quarter 2013 statistics show complaints in this category average 9 per month for RTD and the
private contractors combined. This represents a slight decrease over the first quarter of 2012 (average
of 14 per month). Investigation into “discrimination” complaints usually shows the operator not at fault.
Fare Dispute – This category showed a slight increase from first quarter 2012 to first quarter 2013 and
overall, the number of complaints remains low (average of 40 complaints per month in 2013). It
appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting fares to be paid upon
boarding. Investigation into “fare dispute” complaints oftentimes shows passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies.
Improper Procedure/Operator – There was a decrease in this category from the first quarter 2012 to the
first quarter 2013. There were several complaints in this category in 2012 related to the January
runboard service changes. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel are developing
procedures to ensure operators are familiar with route and schedule changes at the beginning of each
runboard. Some of the complaints in this category are related to the enforcement of the fare policies.
Other complaints relate to the issues that arise when disabled passengers and passengers with strollers

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.2

compete for use of the priority seating area. In most cases, video evidence shows operators following
proper procedures.
Incorrect Info/Operator –This category was established to identify possible trends with operators
providing incorrect information to passengers. The total numbers in this category remain small (an
average of 14 complaints per month for the first quarter of 2013 and 15 complaints per month for the
first quarter of 2012), which indicates this area is not a problem.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – There was a slight decrease in this category from first quarter 2012 to
first quarter 2013. Oftentimes, playbacks for these complaints will confirm buses are on route and on
time. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint
comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to
stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition,
operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a passenger is passed up due to the bus being
full. Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the Service Planning & Scheduling
Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will allow.
Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st Quarter 2013

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the first quarter of 2013 for
the fixed-route services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable
Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 1st quarter. First Transit and Veolia
Transportation continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and postaccident investigations for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to
emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic
campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
First Transit Denver, First Transit Longmont and Veolia Transportation met the
target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 1st quarter. Even
though First Transit Commerce City did not meet this goal for 1st quarter, three of
four passenger accidents during the 1st quarter were classified as non-preventable.
First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct proactive retraining to
increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the number of
passenger accidents per 100,000 miles. Increased passenger awareness training
continues to be a primary focus for all contractors in this area.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive
Maintenance Inspections completed as scheduled in the 1st quarter. The
contractor organizations place a high emphasis on completing preventive
maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operations are diligent
about completing these inspections on time.

Memorandum



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Denver and First Transit Longmont met the target of 88.0% Local OnTime Service in the 1st quarter. First Transit Commerce City and Veolia
Transportation did show continued improvement in on-time performance (OTP)
during the 1st quarter when compared with 4th quarter 2012. RTD is working with
the private contractors to use the OTP report to identify and campaign routes with
on-time performance issues. The contractors also report that they continue to
experience route delays due to construction and detours. Increased passenger
loads and associated boarding delays also contribute to running behind schedule.
The contractors continue to address on-time performance issues with operators,
but always tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to
have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles
Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 1st quarter. The contractors
continue to improve in this area by completing preventive maintenance inspections
on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing
additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining
the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0003 Complaints per Boarding. First
Transit Commerce City, First Transit Denver, and Veolia Transportation continue to
investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors
utilize onboard video surveillance and automatic vehicle location software to retrain
operators on the importance of good customer service and continue to address
complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Information

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership decreased by 5% through the 1st quarter of 2013 compared to the same period
of 2012. Productivity decreased from 1.28 to 1.21 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 14%. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride
passengers continues to allow RTD to provide increased service without an increase in resources.
Revenue Hours

first quarter of 2013. Access-a-Ride is approximately 5% under budgeted revenue hours through the
first quarter of 2013.
On-Time Performance
On time performance through the first quarter of 2013 improved during the same period in 2012. Our
private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges in order to continue meeting and
exceeding this standard of performance.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger decreased through the 1st quarter of 2013 as compared to the same period in
2012. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

Smart Card Project Status Update

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program continues to successfully gather taps for EcoPass and CollegePass riders.
During the month of May, 2013, 1.1M taps were recorded, a slight reduction from April due to a
reduction in college pass use as many colleges and universities reached their semester end. The
Smartcard Customer Service Center, (Operated under an RTD contract with Xerox by Celina, Inc.)
continues to distribute new cards upon request, issue replacement cards and answer riders’ questions as
they arise.
All bus installations are completed. A technical Support Team meets weekly to discuss reported issues
as well as determine steps required to address issues that arise. A work effort is under way to
repair/replace defective stanchions on which the Smart Card readers are mounted.
All one-hundred-nine Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Work on the
installation of two additional validators at 16th/California and 18th/California is underway. An RFP
(Request for Proposal) has been published to retain a work order contractor to provide on-call installation
electrical services for additional validators as needed.
The Fare Inspector software used to confirm that passengers have tapped prior to boarding is
functioning sporadically and requires adjustments currently being addressed by Xerox. Xerox has
suggested solutions to the issues and they are working to have them implemented by July 31, 2013;
RTD is encouraging Xerox to implement the solutions sooner. Fare Inspectors continue to operate in an
“educate & inform” mode, and will receive additional training on the software improvements when
implemented.
300 Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals were delivered to RTD on May 10, 2013. Detailed testing
scenarios are being developed to ensure a seamless integration of the point-of sale units into the existing
Smart Media Technology platform. Efforts continue to complete the Retailer’s Agreement/Application
for Legal review. RTD Marketing staff plan to meet with Safeway and King Soopers after a contract is
signed to develop the appropriate marketing campaign. In addition to the web portal already in place,
approximately 150 locations will be established throughout the region for riders to purchase monthly
passes and/or add value to their cards. Planning for Phase 2 of the program is in full-swing and the
schedule continues to be evaluated to ensure adequate timing for a successful Phase 2 launch.
On May 28, 2013 a new Xerox Project Manager joined the team, and will be working closely with the
Smart Media Program Team to manage vendor activities.

problems. Vendor engineers are working on a “power
save management” feature that would shut down the
handhelds in an effort to save battery power. This fix is
due on 6/19/13. The device requires a daily update, and
in order to keep the device current, the fare inspectors
must cradle the hand-held and manually request an
update to each device.
Xerox is investigating
improvements to this process.
The SMT Program Team conducted a “ride-a-long” with
Xerox, Security Fare Inspectors and technicians. Two
teams of people shadowed four Fare Inspectors in action,
and observed and documented issues encountered during
the trips. The handheld devices worked as designed;
however there were issues identified with the cradles in
which the handheld devices are placed in order to receive
their updates. Training issues were also identified and the
SMT Program Team will collaborate with Fare Inspector
leadership to make arrangements for training.
A user manual for the HSMRs has been written and
delivered to the Fare Inspectors. A “train the trainer”
approached will be used to ensure that all Fare Inspectors
receive the training they need to correctly use the
HSMRs.

Safeway has committed to continue selling RTD
products. Safeway has a moratorium on all changes
during the months of November and December.
Meeting with King Soopers held in early March. They
have indicated they would like to avoid their busy months
of November and December for implementation and
training of their staff. Installations of the units may be
done during this time as long as the work is done during
the overnight hours.
No response from 7-Eleven; may possibly pursue a
partnership with Walgreens.
Design document has been approved. RTD will provide a
cellular modem for communication to the RTD network.
All 300 RPOS Units were delivered to RTD on time.
Network installations at all RTD Retail outlets have been
completed and the sites are ready for RPOS installation at
the appropriate time.
Testing is scheduled for the week of June 24th. Xerox
will be onsite for testing and test plans will be developed
prior to commencing.

1st Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, Allied Barton Security officers conduct random,
unannounced fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of January, February, and March. These
tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion
rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers.
Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion.
This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have

the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the
bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Security Officer Use of Force Incidents
Use of Force is defined as any hands on touching of a suspect by a security officer to detain a suspect
or make a citizen’s arrest. The majority of these issues are minor in nature. No injuries to any suspect
or officer occurred in this reporting quarter. The following table summarizes the use of force incidents
per month.
