BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: August 29, 2014

From:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

August 29, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Transfer Funds to Support the Light Rail
Gearbox Overhaul Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to transfer $676,745 from the event recorder capital
project (10360) to the Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance campaign expense line item.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations has been in the process of
overhauling the gearboxes on the existing fleet for several years in order to maintain the cars in the
proper manner. We have determined that additional funds are needed in order to keep this process going
for the remainder of 2014.
The event recorder project was budgeted as a capital item and it was determined that this project did
not meet the criteria for a capital project. As a result, we are requesting authorization to transfer the
capital funds to the appropriate expense line.
DISCUSSION
The gearbox overhaul program ensures that the Light Rail Vehicles are kept in good repair by
following OEM and accepted industry guidelines that dictate when this process should take place.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This is simply a transfer from capital to expense so there is no financial impact.
DBE PARTICIPATION
DBE requirements do not apply in the case of a funds transfer.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to request the funds transfer. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the transfer as requested. This will cause work to stop on the gearbox
overhaul program for the remainder of 2014.

Board Meeting Date: September 9, 2014

Subject:

Board Report January 2015 Service Changes

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, system maintenance actions and several service reductions. The proposals regarding the
cancellation of certain Call-n-Ride services are ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD
Service Standards. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes
and propose adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendation.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
* Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
* The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
* The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
* Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance
service when possible;
* Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
* Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride currently
serves the Garrison Station. The boundaries can best be described as 13th on the north
and one stop on Colfax at Garrison, Wadsworth on the east, Kipling on the west and
Morrison Road to the south. The Call-n-Ride also runs a Flex Route on Garrison during the
peak hours. The ridership has been averaging 1.6 passenger boarding’s per hour. This
proposal calls for discontinuing the Garrison Flex route and for the changing of the north
boundary to be moved south to 10th Avenue. The boundary will be adjusted west of
Kipling and north of 13th to the Oak Station.
Additionally, the south boundary at
Morrison Road will be moved up to Jewell. This change to the Oak Station will now allow
customers to transfer to the Route 16 and 100 at a station and alleviate neighborhood
concerns regarding the safety and the vehicle traffic in the neighborhood in and around the
Garrison Station. No additional costs impacts are anticipated.
Route DD – Colorado Blvd
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance are proposed. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Dry Creek Call-n-Ride
The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail. The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. The
Call-n-Ride currently serves the Dry Creek Station. The boundaries can best be described
as Arapahoe Road on the north, I-25 on the east, County Line Road to the south and Holly
on the west. During off peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak
hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. This proposal calls for changing the
boundaries by not serving west of Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been
very unproductive and by removing this section may allow better productivity in the
remaining area. No costs associated with this change.

1.C.1.a

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
The Federal Heights Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) grant. The Cities of Federal Heights,
Thornton, Northglenn and Adams County applied for and contribute financially to operate
the Call-n-Ride. The municipalities requested the RTD to operate the service with all
parties agreeing that as part of the Call-n-Ride branding and operating within the RTD
family of services, the opportunity to succeed would be greatly increased. The costs to
operate the service is approximately $191,950 annually (includes fuel). The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. Currently, Weekday ridership is at 2.9
passenger boarding’s per hour. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-nRide due to low ridership. Alternative service is available using the Routes 6, 8, 31, 80,
92 and 104. No costs associated with this change as the RTD operates this Call-n-Ride
under contract to the above listed municipalities through a CMAQ grant.
Free MetroRide
To improve reliability in the afternoon peak, it is proposed to add one-bus and make minor
schedule adjustments. Service will still be offered every 6 minutes.
Projected cost: +893 hours,
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of
the Southeast Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm.
Currently, weekday ridership is at 2.1 passenger boarding’s per hour. RTD requires a
minimum of 3 boardings per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour
since operations began in November 2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of
the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service is available using the Routes
401, 402Ltd and 403. Savings: Annual hours saved: 3,072 hours, saving $175,342
(includes fuel).
Route HX – 28th Street/ Civic Center
Add 2 AM southbound trips and 1 PM northbound trip to address overload and pass-up
issues; AM trips would be at about 7:16 am and 7:46am, both starting at Pearl and 29th
PnR; PM trip would be at about 4:45pm leaving from 18th/California
Route P – Parker/Denver

Southeast Light Rail line.
The Call-n-Ride operates weekdays 5:30am – 6:00pm.
Currently weekday ridership is at 1.8 passenger boarding’s per hour. RTD requires a
minimum of 3 boardings per hour. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-nRide due to low ridership. Some alternative service is available using the Route 153.
Savings: Annual hours saved: 3,200, saving $183,312 (includes fuel).
Route STAMPEDE – CU East Campus
Add 5 trips between 18th/Euclid and East Campus/Discovery Drive, as warranted and
supported by a Transit Improvement Plan grant funding extension (2012-2018) through
DRCOG). Cost impact offset by grant ($61,996 annualized)
Route T – Boulder/ Glenwood Village
Schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance issues. No cost
impacts are anticipated.

Light Rail
W – Line (West Corridor Light Rail)
It is proposed to use the Mariposa yard as a garage for Weekday W-Line trains. Under the
proposed changes, this will require capacity for 9 peak trains and 22 peak light rail vehicles. This
proposal will greatly reduce the strain placed on the I-25 & Broadway Junction before the
morning peak and reduce deadhead and livehead travel times; however, it will also reduce some
early-morning “C-Line” pullout trains from Evans to Union Station, which are currently lightly
patronized.
Total hours saved: (Mondays-Thursdays) 425 annualized.
It is also proposed to discontinue ten additional Monday-Friday trips on the fringes of the AM and
PM peak periods: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:31 AM, 8:31 AM, 3:46 PM,
4:16 PM, and 6:16 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:11 AM, 8:11 AM, 3:26 PM,
3:56 PM, and 5:56 PM. This proposed change effects approximately 529 passengers that will
need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
Total hours saved: (Mondays-Thursdays) 1,275 annualized.
Route 102 Loop Extras – it is proposed to make minor adjustments to the Loop Extras, trains 10,
50, and 70, to adjust times and service based on early information gathered from the August
2014 runboard. Changes to hours are not anticipated.
Savings 1,700 annual hours, $314,500

W-Line: It is proposed to extend the existing Denver Union Station (DUS) Weekday hostler
hours so that there is coverage all day for one hostler (currently there are two hostlers in
each AM and PM peak). This would change the existing four splits to two splits and two
straights. This change helps provide layover and relief for W-Line operators at DUS.
Costs 2,040 annual hours, $377,400
Total net proposal cost is estimated to be 340 hours, $62,900 annualized.

US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is the only non-rail, major corridor investment in FasTracks. Our goal is
to increase service reliability and accessibility in the US 36 corridor by implementing strategic capital and
operational improvements.
Length:
18 miles
Stations:
6
Service Type:
All-Stop and Non-Stop (Express)
Service Frequency: 4-12 min (peak)/15-20 min (off-peak)
Projected Ridership: 20,400
Opening:
2016
As part of the implementation of this project, RTD has committed to developing a service identity to
establish BRT as a new class of service in the RTD family.
DISCUSSION
Service identity, or Branding, is a key component of BRT. Branding is used to give BRT a unique identity
and to distinguish BRT from other types of bus service. RTD staff conducted an extensive process,
described below, with substantial stakeholder involvement to develop the final branding for this project.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Discussion

INTRODUCTION
The Eco Pass and College Pass programs continue to gather valuable data through the taps registered
through the Bus Validators and Platform Validators. During the month of August 2014, over 950,000
first boardings were registered through the Smart Media validators. This represents a slight decline from
historical monthly averages but is in keeping with our expectations as area Colleges and Universities
were just returning to class during the month of August.
College/EcoPass Programs
With fall semesters beginning at the colleges and universities that are members of the CollegePass
Program, the SMT Team is working closely with the manager of the CollegePass Program to ensure that
new students are obtaining their SmartCards, as well as ensuring that returning students are getting
their cards “recharged” which will extend the validity of their SmartCard until they graduate. EcoPass
program support continues, and business participant renewals will begin again in Q3-Q4 2014.
Update on Smart Action List and File Compression
We previously described a system constraint identified in the Smart Media Technology relating to the
number of cards that the system can process when a SmartCard needs to be deactivated, suspended,
recharged or when a monthly subscription needs to be placed on the card. Working closely with our
Xerox Vendor Partners, we have launched two initiatives to remediate this issue
 A method by which we can increase the amount of memory on both bus and platform validators
 A “smart action list” that will prioritize frequently used cared and remove infrequently tapped
cards from validator memory
Work is under way on both solutions and progress updates are provided by Xerox on a weekly basis.
Establish Business Processes in Support of the MyRide Program
With guidance from Smart Media experts from IBI Group, multiple departments within RTD are
developing process, roles and responsibilities in support of the MyRide Program. MyRide will consist of
the Stored Value product, as well as monthly and yearly passes. The areas of SmartCard Production,
Customer Service, Marketing & Sales, and many others are being examined. The end result of this
exercise will be a documented playbook that clearly outlines how RTD business units will manage and
support the SmartCard program.

SMT Engagement with Fare Study Committee
Members of the SMT Program Team are working closely with the RTD Fare Study Committee to provide
system-related guidance as the study progresses. The team has participated in meetings with the vendor
leading the Fare Study activities, and has provided guidance to the SMT Executive Sponsors as to the
impact fare changes will have on the SMT System. As a result of these meetings, the SMT Program
Team is targeting a “Product” rollout that will coincide with the activities of the Fare Study. Our current

Packet Pg. 31

1.C.4

goals include the go-live of Stored Value in Q3 2015, and we are targeting the go-live of pre-paid media
such as monthly and yearly passes as part of the potential January 2016 fare policy adjustments.

SMT Involvement in the 2016 Rail Line Openings
The SMT Program Team continues to collaborate with FasTracks in preparation for the 2016 Rail Line
Openings. Platform validators for the new rail stations have been ordered, and we are scheduling the
installation and configuration of the new devices with internal Information Technology and FasTracks
Teams. We have also conducted initial discussions with RTD Security regarding the necessity for
increasing the number of Handheld Smart Media Readers used by the Fare Inspection Team. Additional
network capabilities will be required in order for the fare inspectors to recharge the handheld units and to
ensure that the units receive their daily updates.
Phase 1 Web Portal Enhancements
Collaboration continues on the Phase 1 Web Portal Enhancements. The first series of tests on the new
functionality passed. The team has elected to conduct some additional testing on the new defined user
roles capabilities to ensure the new functionality is working according to the specifications. The
enhancements being implemented are outlined below:
 Ticket Management changes that will help manage requests for assistance with SmartCard.
 Increased search capabilities within the web portal.
 Inventory Management changes that will create a better audit train of SmartCard transfers from
one warehouse to another.
 User Role enhancements that limit the actions a Web Portal user can access based on their job
responsibilities.

Focus Group Research Objectives
As a component of the Fare Study initial phases, a series of research efforts
were conducted to identify opportunities for improving the fare structure and
fare media across a range of internal and external stakeholders.

• Objectives of this research included:
– Current perceptions, knowledge and issues with both fare structure and fare media
– Identifying opportunities for improving the fare structure and fare media

• To address these objectives, RTD conducted focus groups amongst
four key stakeholder groups:
–
–
–
–

Fare inspectors, selected by Fare Enforcement management, held on July 14th
Customers, through the customer panel, held on July 16th
Bus Operators, as assigned by Bus Operations management, held on July 22nd
Local Governments/TMOs/TMAs, attendees at the quarterly meeting on July 24th

• Following the customer focus group, RTD conducted an online
survey with its RTD Online Customer Community to gather more
customer perceptions on fare media and fare structure
– An online survey was made available for one week, beginning July 21st.
– An excellent 82.4% response rate was achieved, with 164 of 199 invited participants
providing input before the deadline of July 28th.

Fare Structure Attitudes by Audience
Online Customer
Community

Customer Panel

•

•

•

Most users only
understand the
services they use the
most and are
uncertain about
services and/or
discounts they don’t
use.
Consider distance,
vehicle type and
number of stops as
acceptable reasons
for fare structure
differences.
Information on light
rail fare structure
predominantly comes
from TVMs and
system maps.

•

•

•

Being current riders
this group expressed
familiarity with the
current fare
structure.
Tendency to
characterize the
current fare structure
as “usable,” “logical,”
and “fair.”
Distance, number of
stops, cost of
operation and area
served were
indicated as the
factors differentiating
service levels within
the current structure.

Fare Inspectors

•

•

•

Feel confident that
they understand the
fare structure, but
are unable to explain
why fares differ to
customers.
Feel that fare noncompliance is
generally intentional,
rather than a lack of
understanding of fare
structure among
customers.
Do not feel as though
the current zone
structure for light rail
fares is obeyed or
enforceable.

Bus Operators

•

•

•

•

See a level of fare
structure complexity
that few others do.
The combination of
customer education
and fare
enforcement duties
are made difficult by
the fare structure
complexity.
Feel that available
training leaves
significant gaps in
fare structure
comprehension
among many
operators.
Simplification was
highly desired.

Government Officials

indicated they refer
to the RTD website
for information.
Many indicated the
light rail zone
structure resulted in
confusion among
their constituents.
Fare level, rather

Fare Media Challenges by Audience
Online Customer
Community

Customer Panel

•

•

•

•

Paper tickets and
passes cause issues
when value cannot
be recovered when
damaged or lost.
Expected RTD use
and convenience of a
fare media option are
the largest influences
on media choice.
Some customers
can’t buy a monthly
pass at the beginning
of the month, and
wind up spending
more on their trips as
a result.
Monthly passes
encourage additional
discretionary trips
and other fare media
types like 10-Ride
Tickets inhibit
additional use
beyond what was
purchased.

•

•

Awareness of the
most commonly used
fare media types are
high among current
riders, cash, 10-Ride
and Monthly Pass
were known by
nearly all
respondents, zone
receipts, discount
fare products and
smart card were the
least recognized
terms.
Being predominantly
frequent riders,
online community
members tend to use
monthly passes and
10-Ride tickets.

Fare Inspectors

•

•

•

•

Different fare media
types have different
impacts on what can
be easily enforced.
Different fare media
options provide
different levels of
fare evasion
opportunity.
Fare inspectors are
generally satisfied
that something has
been paid when
inspecting monthly
passes and 10-Ride
tickets and do not
attempt to enforce
zone compliance.
Validators do not aid
in easily determining
the station at which
the validation
occurred, inhibiting
their ability to know
if a validated fare
media is truly valid.

Bus Operators

•

•

•

Currently have
difficulty enforcing
bus fares due to
issues with each type
of fare media.
Transfers are a
frequent source of
confusion and
conflict between
customers and
drivers.
Discount fare
products also cause
conflict between
drivers and
customers ineligible
for these discounts.

Government Officials

•

•

•

•

Transfers were
thought to be a
source of difficulty
for their constituents.
Local government
meeting attendees
generally refer
constituents to RTD
for questions
regarding the fare
structure. Many
indicated they refer
to the RTD website
for information.
Both smart media
and Eco Pass are
seen as potential
ways to address fare
media issues.
Issues with cash
fares, including the
requirement for
exact change and
reduced speed of
boarding with cash
fares were explored.

2nd Quarter 2014 Security Statistics & Fare
Inspection Summary

Information

DISCUSSION:
Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons contacted during the
quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area and conduct an onboard enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables summarize information for the months of April, May, & June. These tables lists the
number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the estimated fare evasion rate, the
number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests made by police officers. Arrests
include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations other than fare evasion. This is
an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection program as peace officers have the

authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law enforcement action. This quarter the bus
routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.

Access-a-Ride 2nd Quarter 2014 Report

Discussion

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership increased by 2% through the 2nd quarter of 2014 compared to the same period
of 2013. Productivity increased from 1.23 to 1.25 passengers per hour. During the same period,
Access-a-Cab ridership increased by 11%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab ridership
increased 4%, from 434,024 total boardings thru Q2 of 2013 to 449,781 total boardings thru Q2 of
2014. The increased use of Access-a-Cab by Access-a-Ride passengers continues to allow RTD to
provide increased mobility for our customers while managing to maintain a relatively steady level of
resources devoted to the service.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride remained relatively even during the 2nd quarter of
2014. Access-a-Ride is approximately 4% under budgeted revenue hours through the second quarter of
2014.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2014 decreased as compared to the same period
in 2013. Our private contractors continue to address on time performance challenges. Staff continues to
work with our carriers to address operator shortages, scheduling issues, and passenger boarding times.
Several of the carriers have begun utilizing the radio as a means of advertising for operators. The
passenger on time performance through the 2nd quarter of 2014 decreased as compared to the same
period in 2013; however we are showing an improvement over the 1st quarter of 2014.
Customer Complaints
Complaints per passenger increased slightly through the 2nd quarter of 2014 as compared to the same
period in 2013. Staff continues to work with our carriers and passengers to improve overall customer
satisfaction.

Special Services Report 2nd Quarter 2014

RTD currently provides Call-n-Ride service in 22 Call-n-Ride service areas throughout the District. The
following is a discussion of Call-n-Ride performance for the Second Quarter of 2014.

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Belmar CnR - Call-n-Ride ridership had not met minimum expectations of 3 boarding’s per hour since
opening in April 2013. The January 2015 service changes propose changing the Call-n-Ride boundary
and discontinuing the flex route.
Dry Creek CnR – The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the
Southeast Light Rail. The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. The Call-n-Ride
currently serves the Dry Creek Station. The boundaries can best be described as Arapahoe Road on the
north, I-25 on the east, County Line Road to the south and Holly on the west. During off peak hours the
Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. The
January 2015 recommended service changes propose changing the boundaries by not serving west of
Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been very unproductive and by removing this section may
allow better productivity in the remaining area.
Evergreen CnR – This Call-n-Ride began in March 2002 and ridership has always been above the
minimum boardings per hour until 2013. In 2013 the ridership began to drop off. This was due to
numerous reasons: Many of our older regular customers passed away, a school that routinely used the
service closed down and an organization that works with the disabled that used our bus for over 10
years decided to purchase their own bus. This past May we started a concentrated effort to market to
the children for use over the summer and for the new school year.

Subject:

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 2nd
Quarter 2014

Information

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the second quarter of 2014 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue
to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of
operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety
meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per
100,000 miles in the 2nd quarter. Five of the six passenger accidents during the 2nd quarter
were classified as non-preventable. First Transit and Veolia Transportation continue to conduct
proactive retraining to increase operator awareness of passenger mobility issues to reduce the
number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 2nd quarter. The contractor organizations place a high
emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local
operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors as a group did not meet the target of 88% Local On-Time Service in the 2nd
quarter. First Transit Denver and Veolia met this goal with 88.3% and 89.2% Local On-Time
Service. RTD continues to work with the private contractors to use the OTP report to identify
and campaign routes with on-time performance issues. The contractors also report that they
continue to experience route delays due to construction and detours. Increased passenger loads
and associated boarding delays also contribute to running behind schedule. The contractors
continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always tie safety to the
discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 26,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 2nd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors as a group met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding in the 2nd quarter.
First Transit Commerce City and First Transit Longmont met the goal with .0004 and .0003
complaints per boarding in the 2nd quarter. First Transit Denver and Veolia Transportation
continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The contractors utilize
onboard video surveillance to retrain operators on the importance of good customer service and
automatic vehicle location software to improve on time performance. The contractors also
continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Customer Complaint Analysis 2nd Quarter
2014

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 2nd Quarter of 2014. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2013.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The goal for 2014 is .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding.
For the 2nd Quarter of 2014, RTD, First Transit Commerce City, and First Transit Longmont met the goal
of .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit Denver and Veolia had .0005 complaints per
passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was .0004 complaints
per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private contractors was .0004
complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per playback
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to a snow day
There was no video evidence to support the complaint
RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.

Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
disabled passengers.
Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.

Historically, and in 2014, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – For 2nd Quarter 2014, the complaints in this category decreased 32.5% compared
to the same period in 2013. In many cases, CAD/AVL “flashbacks” confirm that buses are on route, but
running late. However, from the passenger’s perspective, the bus did not show. The YTD average in
this category for 2014 is 4.6 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 6.7 complaints
per day.
Bus Early – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 27.4% compared to the same
period in 2013. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The

Packet Pg. 66

1.C.10

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 5.1 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 7.0 complaints per day.
Bus Late – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 0.1% compared to the same
period in 2013. Improving on-time performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons
including construction, traffic and heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same
number of passengers on fewer trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address runningtime issues. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 11.1 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 11.0 complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 15.4%
compared to the same period in 2013. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and
undercover ride checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate
manner. In addition, the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive
Cam, Smart Drive) installed on the buses and RTD is in the process of installing a system on its buses.
These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to be counseled and retrained as
needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe
driving habits. The YTD average in this category is 4.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for
2013 was 3.9 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 3.4% compared to
the same period in 2013. In the majority of cases, video evidence usually confirms that the operator
followed proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 10.9 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2013 was 10.5 complaints per day.
Discrimination – This category was created in 2009 to track complaints related to Title VI issues. For
2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 9.2% compared to the same period in 2013.
Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at fault. The YTD
average in this category for 2014 is 0.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was 0.4
complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category decreased 14.2% compared to the
same period in 2013. It appears passengers have come to accept the fact that operators are expecting
fares to be paid upon boarding. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that
passengers presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of
the fare policies. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 1.2 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2013 was 1.4 complaints per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 20.5%
compared to the same period in 2013. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the recently completed ADA refresher training provided information to remind operators of the
procedures to follow to ensure passengers in mobility devices are able to board the bus. In cases where
video evidence shows operators are not following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The

YTD average in this category for 2014 is 8.3 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013
was 6.8 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator –For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 7.3% compared to
the same period in 2013. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the
Bus Operator Training Newsletter Team, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers are providing operators with
up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average
in the category for 2014 is 0.5 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2013 was also 0.5
complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – For 2nd Quarter 2014, complaints in this category increased 12.5%
compared to the same period in 2013. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop
as the bus passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be
waiting directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (78 of the total 1831). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to the
Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2014 is 10.1 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2013 was 9.0 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops
