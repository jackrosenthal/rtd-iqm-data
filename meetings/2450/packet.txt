RESOLUTION NO. ____ SERIES OF 2016
(RTD Position on Senate Bill 16-123)

WHEREAS, Senate Bill 16-123 was introduced in the Colorado Senate on February 1, 2016, and
assigned to the Senate Committee on Transportation. The bill was heard in the Senate
Transportation Committee on February 18, 2016, and passed amended to the Committee of the
Whole for second reading on the Senate floor.
WHEREAS, The provisions of SB 16-123 prohibit the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) from requiring a high occupancy vehicle (HOV) to use a switchable transponder or
other device in order to drive on a HOV lane or high occupancy toll (HOT) lane on a state
highway on a toll-free basis.
WHEREAS, This bill will negatively impact the High Performance Enterprise’s (HPTE)
contract with Plenary Roads Denver and their revenue projections for Plenary to collect tolls
throughout the 50-year life of the contract.
WHEREAS, Prohibiting the requirement that HOV lane users carry a transponder will lead to
an increase in HOV lane use by vehicles without transponders. Adding the HOV lanes was
part of the voter-approved FasTracks program, and RTD was the single largest funding
source.
WHEREAS, Increased traffic in the HOV lane could impact the Flatiron Flyer BRT schedules
and slow the buses progress to a similar speed of the general purpose lanes.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that RTD Board of Directors adopts a position in opposition
of Senate Bill 16-123.
Passed and adopted by the Board of Directors of the Regional Transportation District on this
29th day of March 2016.

Resolution No. __ Series of 2016, North
Metro Project Property Acquisition

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro
Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Project the
right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs will be identified and specific
legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith
negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like
to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or additions
required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 20, 2011, June 11, 2013, and March 25, 2014, the RTD Board approved the acquisition
of properties for the North Metro Project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build
contractor, additional acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the approved North Metro cost to complete budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Project and authorizing staff to proceed with all
requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
NORTH METRO PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Project;
and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans and tabulation
sheets, which list the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to
obtain immediate possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the North Metro Project, although financially compensated according to the law,
makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the additional
acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.

Packet Pg. 11

2.11.B

The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any
property through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property
through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate
with property owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to
address concerns of owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively
impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the Properties as soon as permitted by law.

Purchase of Six (6) Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to exercise an option and amend contract 13-FK001 in an amount not to exceed $4,127,000 with New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of six (6)
additional 60’ articulated buses and associated spare components.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $4,127,000 from the
intercity bus procurement project to cover the cost of the requested 6 new articulated buses.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance NABI sub-fleet of 60’ articulated buses.
On August 20, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 52 New Flyer 60’
articulated buses. This procurement was for the replacement of 40 existing NABI 60’ articulated buses
and also supplied 12 - 60’ articulated buses for the Free MetroRide service. The original procurement
was the result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP 13-FK-001). Proposals were received on May 17,
2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 162 additional buses over a five year
period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 40 New
Flyer articulated buses.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved the contract amendment for additional 18
New Flyer articulated buses.
The six (6) requested articulated buses will be used to implement service adjustments. These
adjustments are necessary for addressing changes in ridership and customer response to the new US 36
BRT service implementation. The service adjustments call for reducing the number of intercity buses to
be purchased this year and adding more articulated buses as replacement of the old NABI articulated
buses being retired.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to New Flyer to exercise the
purchase option for a quantity of six (6) additional articulated buses and to transfer funds from the
intercity bus procurement project to cover for the cost.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 19

2.11.C

The 60’ articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance.
Their clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up
to 90% from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger
counting system and a security digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors, 55
passenger seats and two spaces for storage of large items such as walker, child stroller and shopping
caddy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The quantity of intercity buses was reduced to forty-two (42) from the budgeted quantity of forty-six
(46). This left $4,127,000 in the intercity project.
Service changes have increased the need for six (6) additional articulated buses. As a result we are
recommending the transfer of capital funds in the amount of $4,127,000 from the intercity bus project
to the articulated bus project. No additional funds are required so the capital budget impact is zero.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to New Flyer for the purchase of six
(6) additional articulated buses and transfer the capital funds. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $72,700 in addition to the cost of the B and G Line
commuter rail service cost as included in the Concession Agreement, and, further, to authorize the
Interim General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming
Northwest and Gold rail lines also known as the B Line and G Line respectively will represent significant
milestones in achieving improved connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The B & G Line Bus
and Rail Service Plan (Northwest and Gold Line Service Plan) contains recommendations for developing a
restructured bus network capable of meeting the demand and mobility needs generated by the expansion
of commuter rail and light rail services. Recommendations in this proposal were formulated based on a
comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area demographics, transit market research,
route performance and analysis, and stakeholder input.
The project area is defined by the RTD West Line to the south, the US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride to
the north, Interstate 25 and downtown Denver to the east, and the City of Golden to the west. The
study area included the cities of Arvada, Denver, Thornton, Westminster, and Wheat Ridge, as well as
unincorporated areas in Denver and Jefferson Counties.
The first 6.2-mile segment of the Northwest Corridor, from DUS to south Westminster is expected to be
completed in the Summer of 2016. This segment will serve two stations including Denver Union Station
and Westminster/71st Ave. The expected travel time from Westminster to Denver Union Station is
expected to be 11 minutes. While the corridor will not replace existing bus services, there are a number
of changes to the existing bus network that are proposed in concert with the implementation of the B
Line service in order to better serve B Line stations.
The G-Line is a future 11.2-mile commuter rail line that will run along the BNSF Railway and Union
Pacific Railroad right of way from Denver Union Station (DUS) to the City of Wheat Ridge. The G-Line
will serve eight stations, including DUS, 41st/Fox, Pecos Junction, Clear Creek/Federal, 60th &
Sheridan/Arvada Gold Strike, Olde Town Arvada, Arvada Ridge, and Wheat Ridge/Ward. The G-Line is
expected to open in the Fall of 2016. Total travel time between DUS and the Wheat Ridge/Ward terminal
station is approximately 25 minutes. By the nature of its alignment and planned services, this rail service
will replace Routes 55L and 72L.

DISCUSSION
The critical goal for the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is to build a simple, easy-to-use network
that is comprised of a family of bus and rail services, all focusing on delivering the overall network
experience desired by existing and potential customers.
To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of limited operating resources, it is
imperative that the recommendations are congruent with RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit
network that will improve mobility.
Significant investments have been made in new rail alignments to improve regional mobility. The Gold
Line Corridor offers new fast regional train service between Wheatridge and downtown Denver,
providing new transit network opportunities. The Northwest Corridor also opens new network
opportunities for both rail and bus transit from Westminster to downtown Denver with the potential for
future expansion. Adjacent or intersecting bus routes to these corridors have been considered for
realignment to serve the new rail stations, resources of duplicative bus service reallocated, and bus route
alignment changes made to refocus network coverage. Through these actions, an integrated transit
network is proposed that will attract riders, reduce operating costs, and strengthen regional and
community mobility.
The following route design strategies were used in the development of this proposal, which focus not
only maintaining high operating efficiency, but providing an improved customer experience that will
attract more riders and operating revenue:
Route Streamlining
The Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan calls for limiting deviations to just areas that can
justify the additional travel time and costs by high ridership on the deviation – areas such as rail
stations, transit hubs, and major destinations in order make individual routes, as well as the
transit network, more productive and attractive to riders. In cases where the deviation was
providing needed lifeline coverage, alternative service was proposed while also proposing
streamlined corridor bus transit.
Short-Lining
Routes often vary in terms of ridership and performance along the length of their alignments.
Generally, areas with higher population and employment densities generate more ridership than
areas with lower densities. For example, Route 76 serves the Wadsworth Boulevard corridor
where ridership is much stronger between the Olde Town Arvada and Lakewood City Commons.
Cost-effective short-lining has been proposed in such instances using either an interior short-line
(long-line running the full length with the short-line between Olde Town and Lakewood) or a
service overlap (north terminal to Lakewood and south terminal to Olde Town) depending on the
off-peak ridership pattern and customer through-riding.
Stop Consolidation
One of the greatest sources of operating delay and on-time performance impacts is dwell time at
bus stops. While closely-spaced bus stops increase the ease in which riders can access the
transit system that convenience comes at the expense of operating speed and service reliability.
Closely spaced stops not only impact route
performance, increase stop maintenance costs, and accelerate bus maintenance costs, but they
can significantly reduce the competitiveness of the service. By finding an optimal balance of stop
spacing to maintain convenient access to transit service while reducing potential for delay, the
efficiency and effectiveness of transit can be increased significantly. While stop consolidation is

Packet Pg. 22

2.11.D

not proposed per se as part of the Gold and Northwest Corridor Service Plan, it is recommended
that RTD continue is stop consolidation program throughout the bus network
Corridor Segment Consolidation
In some instances where multiple routes serve the same corridor at different points, it is more
intuitive for the customer to have one streamlined route that serves the corridor continuously. If
general travel patterns on the corridor show a higher degree of through travel relative to local
mobility, routes that link complimentary origins and destinations together were consolidated to
increase rider convenience by eliminating or reducing transfers required to complete their trip
along a natural transit corridor. In some cases this results in restructuring the corridor into routes
with consistent roles: one is streamlined to serve the main arterial with frequent service while one
or more are designed to serve the neighborhood interior with less direct service where walk
access to the main corridor is not feasible.
Route Segmentation
In contrast to the segment consolidation strategy, where routes exhibited a very high proportion
of rider transfer activity at a single point, the benefits of separating those routes into two distinct
routes at that point to improve schedule adherence or scheduling efficiency was evaluated. This
was primarily due to the low number of riders remaining on the bus and traveling through the
point in question. These actions also results in routes with more balanced service levels on either
side of this midpoint based on demand.
Low Performing Service Replacement
If a route or route segment performed poorly and the potential to improve performance appeared
to be limited within the existing configuration, then alternatives to fixed route service were
considered.
The B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is anticipated to be implemented Summer 2016 with the
opening of B Line service from Westminster to downtown Denver. The G Line is currently expected to
open later in the Fall of 2016. The Northwest and Gold Line Preliminary Service Plan was completed on
June 29, 2015. Stakeholder meetings to review the preliminary plan were held between June 29 and
July 24. 2015. A review of the preliminary plan was presented in the August 11, 2015 RTD Board
Operations and Customer Service Committee meeting, resulting in revisions to the preliminary plan prior
to the public meeting process. Public comments were taken up to November 18, 2015, along with
subsequent meetings with municipal and community organizations leading to an update to the RTD
Operations Committee, provided on February 9, 2016.
The Final B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is proposed herein is as result of an extensive study of
the area conducted by RTD Staff and consultants; ongoing interactions with RTD (Board Members and
staff), community and municipal organizations. This proposal can be viewed as a starting point for a
continued effort to improve overall transportation mobility and increase transit market share in the
Northwestern Metro area, through a multi-modal integrated transit network.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from November 9th
through November 18th of last year. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public meetings
and a number of comments were also heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the
municipal, civic and community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern
for the proposal. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report. Letters received are contained in Attachment C.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the A
and R Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 8 – North Broadway: service frequency enhancements deferred
Route 17 – Red Rocks College: route service merged with the new Route 125
Route 19 - North Pecos: change of routing between 33rd and 46th Avenues
Route 51 – Sheridan Crosstown: proposal to deviate to Harlan Street
Route 55 – South Arvada: off peak service frequency revised
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: SW Plaza extension proposal eliminated
Route 92 – 92nd Avenue: discontinuance of service west of Sheridan eliminated
Route 95 – South Westminster: proposal postponed until Westminster Mall underway
Route 100 – Kipling Street: hourly Sunday service proposed
Route 125 –Youngfield/Ward new service proposal
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the B and G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is estimated to be $72,700
annualized. The operating and maintenance costs of the B and G Lines are a part of the Eagle P3
contract to be paid from the FasTracks budget on a defined schedule.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed B and G Line Bus and Rail Service
Plan service changes do not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income
populations.
A LOOK AHEAD – Fall 2016
The following items are service concepts currently under consideration or are planned events that impact
operations in the next service change period:
 refinements to the A and R Line bus and rail service plan implemented in April 2016

Public Meeting Comments

Monday, November 9th, 2015
Blake Administrative Downtown Denver
12:00 noon
Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff members Cooper Langdon, Nataly Erving,
Dave Menter and Chris Marko were also in attendance. There were no elected officials in
attendance and there was a count of 8 members of the public who signed in.
Most of the comments were in the nature of questions going after specifics on the service
changes as follows:
Route 92: The planned cut of route 92 between Sheridan Station and Wadsworth Blvd
caused concern to Prentice Ehret because it will leave only the route 104 serving where
he lives near 92nd & Piece. There will be no service on the weekends. He has two bad
knees and the walk that he would need to get to the route 100 on 88th Ave would be very
difficult for him. When it was mentioned that this was due to low ridership in this area,
Mr. Ehret suggested that being that this is an “end” of the route would be a likely cause of
the low ridership compared to the rest or central parts of the route.
Other:
Train Noise Raoul Martinez, who lives near 80th & Sheridan was concerned about how
much noise the new train will cause in his neighborhood.
Call-n-Ride Services Charlene Corson who lives in Wheat Ridge uses light rail trains to get
to classes at Marilyn Hickey ministries, located just south from Orchard Station. She has
no problem when the call-n-Ride vehicle is situated at that station, but when it’s not there,
walking to the ministry building is difficult as many of the property owners near the station
“forbid” RTD riders from walking across their property. RTD staff suggested that she use
the phone number to schedule trips from the LRT station to her classes when needed.
Applewood Village Transfers Lisa Myers inquired if the current transfers between the
buses at Applewood Village (Youngfield & 38th) continue to operate after the changes are
made.

Route 100 and Oak Street Station. Helen Bushnell wanted to voice her concern about
splitting the Route 100 and discontinuing service to Oak Street Station. She stated that
there are a lot of passengers who transfer to the Route 100 at Oak Station and that the
portion of the route 100 between (Oak Station and 56thAve) has the highest ridership.
She also feels that ridership will increase at Oak Station when the fairs are restructured on
the W-Line.
She suggests that if we split the Route 100, we should continue service to Oak Station
and split it there. Helen said that sometimes the bus will get stuck in bad weather on the
southern portion of the route, so splitting the route at Oak Street Station would benefit
passengers who sometimes are affected by adverse weather.
Helen also feels that RTD should monitor that the private contractors are notifying
passengers concerning upcoming Service Change, and that the passengers have not be
notified about the proposed changes on the route 100. She also thinks that we should be
holding a meeting somewhere in the Lakewood area concerning these changes on the
route 100.
Helen said that the clocks that are on the private contractors buses are not correct, but
the operators say they have to go by that time.
Route 32 and North Arvada Service. Marilyn Rittenhouse is concerned about any changes
that could affect her getting to North Arvada from her residence at 21st & High. She is
very unhappy about the service reduction on the route 32. She sometimes needs to get to
Rose Hospital and now has to use three buses to get there.
A few years ago we combined the route 7 and the route 12 making it more convenient for
passengers riding through not having to transfer, why are we now proposing to do just
the opposite with the route 6 and 100.
Route 100 and 51 – Operational issues - Kenny Shepard does not see the point of splitting
the route 100. He feels that a lot of passengers would be inconvenienced having to make
a transfer. Kenny said that this was proposed with the opening of the W-Line and that it
was not split then do too many passengers complaint.
He was also concerned with the restructure of the route 51 on Sheridan, as well as the
routes on Federal.
Kenny would like to see RTD have better coverage at the train platforms for waiting
passengers during adverse weather in Colorado. He also thinks that we should have
turnstiles for fare collection. He is concerned because he rarely sees fare inspectors on the
trains.
RTD should place the Ticket vending machine down in DUS so passengers can buy tickets
with their credit cards because they do not have the exact change for the fares for the
bus. Sometimes he tells passengers to go up to the train platform to get there tickets for

He would like to see something done with the way the passengers are lining up at the
gates in DUS. He said sometimes you can’t tell which line to get into, and that the
passengers are blocking the walk way for people walking through the Station.

Route 9 - Bruce Bazo lives at 9th & Vrain St and rides the route 9. He would like to see the
service extended on this route later in the evening. It is difficult to make it home before
the last bus. He thinks RTD should add one more trip that would run closer to 10pm in
order for residents to stay out later.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff member Nataly Erving was attendance.
There were no elected officials in attendance and there was a count of 6 members of the
public who signed in.
Route 92 - Roger Sillars is concerned about proposed discontinuation of Route 92 west of
US 36 & Sheridan Station. Provided write up of comments (‘Concerns with proposed RTD
2016 Service Changes’) to staff and reiterated that a discontinuation of Route 92 service
west of Sheridan would create a hardship for many residents in that area and force a twotransfer trip. He added that Route 100 is not an alternative to Route 92 in this area, due to
the steep hill along Wadsworth between 88th and 92nd streets, which is almost impossible
to maneuver by passengers in wheelchairs or other ADA challenges. There are no other
direct connections through the neighborhood. Mr. Sillars suggested that staff look at
extending Route 92 to Vance and perhaps even Yarrow, west of Wadsworth in order to
better serve the Covenant Village community, which has a number of residents and staff
depending on public transportation.
ParknRide Locations – Doug McGee: question about changes to Park-n-Ride locations
associated with the opening of the B and G lines. Mr. Magee asked if any other stations,
besides current Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-n-Rides where going to experience
significant changes in location or access. He suggested that that information be included
in the final brochure and marketing information for these two projects.
Route 125 - Duncan Smith was concerned with north/south route at end of line in Wheat
Ridge. Mr. Smith was very pleased to see the addition of Route 125 to the plan and
commended staff for this. He did ask for clarification of routes represented on the map
provided to the public by gray lines vs. the colored lines, in order to make sure that all
routes represented by gray lines were to be continued and not experience any changes
associated with the opening of the B and G lines. Mr. Smith was happy to see the split of
Route 100 and addition of Route 99, as well as Route 51 and addition of Route 53. Lastly,
he requested for staff to consider Express service along Federal (Route 31) and perhaps
even Sheridan (Route 51).
Route 92 - Pat Hall is concerned about discontinuation of service on Route 92
(misunderstood that it was only to be west of US 36 & Sheridan). Ms. Hall also asked for
clarification as to why there were only going to be two stops/stations on the B line and
that Westminster Station was going to be the only train access to Downtown Denver from
Westminster. She also asked for clarification on the proposed changes to Route 31 north
of US 36, as well as Route 72 and mentioned that there is a community of low income

and several homeless people who depend on these routes to get to places they need to
get to (area near Westminster High School). Mr. Hall also commented that the fare
changes were a negative impact to this specific low income or no-income community.

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff member Cooper Langdon and RTD Board
Member Natalie Menter were in attendance. There was a count of 21 members of the
public who signed in.
Routes 72, 52, 92,100, 51 - Teresa was interested in finding help navigating the routes.
Route 86X - Lindsay asked if the 86X was being discontinued. She was informed that the
86X was being absorbed by the new FF routes RTD has implemented. She also asked if
the buses leaving Union Station could be better timed with buses coming from the Boulder
area. Specifically mentioned the Rte. 0 as it leaves Union Station.
Route AB – Cokie mentioned that she was concerned that the AB was going to be
discontinued from Westminster Park-n-Ride when the new A Line opens. Doug explained
how the new service to DIA will be covered by the A Line.
Bicycle Access - Michael rides a bike and finds it difficult to take a bike on any of the RTD
Light Rail trains because there is very little room to store a bike and the doors are not open
long enough to find a location if there are a lot of bikes already on the train. He wanted to
know if any addition space or consideration has been given to the new commuter rail cars
that are going to be used on the new rail lines. He also wanted to know if the train
operators could wait if passengers are having a difficult time loading bikes. Doug
mentioned the expense of adding additional rail cars just to handle bikes. Additionally, he
wanted to mention that it is sometimes difficult to plan a trip on our buses, with his bike,
because if a bus bike rack is full he has to wait for the next bus which negatively impacts
his plans for the day. Finally, he asked if the Route 44 could go all the way to Golden.
Doug mentioned the low ridership and high cost associated with extending the route to
Golden.
Route 125 - Mrs. Brenan wanted additional information regarding the proposed new Rte.
125. She wanted to know exactly how far the route would go and if our call-n-ride would
cover passengers who live in the area currently serviced by the 72X, which is scheduled
to be discontinued. She also wanted to know if RTD was planning any new service to
cover additional housing growth. Doug mentioned that RTD is always looking at growth
and the need for new RTD bus service.

Subject: Proposed RTD bus service changes
Dear Mr. Monroe:
Thank you for visiting the City of Arvada and presenting the preliminary bus service plan to city staff in
our public works department, as well as the Arvada Citizen Transportation Advisory Committee. The city,
along with Arvada's Citizen Transportation and Gold Line Advisory Committees, appreciates RTD's
willingness to meet with us in advance of the official release of the proposed service plan changes as a
result of initiating Gold Line commuter rail service. We also appreciate information about the recent
update to the proposed service plan changes which proposes a new route to provide service between Olde
Town Arvada and the Arvada-Ridge Gold Line Station located on Kipling Street.
This letter is presented in response to the city' s concern that the proposed changes to the service plan will
eliminate fixed route and Access-A-Ride service to large portions of the community. We anticipated and
agree with the elimination of some bus services that parallel the Gold Line; we do not agree with
eliminating the 52 and 72X routes that currently provide service to the west side of Arvada. We also hoped
to see additional routes incorporated in the service plan update that would increase connectivity between
neighborhoods in Arvada and the FasTracks transit network and we do not feel that the one additional route
proposed meets that objective.
We are concerned with the current proposal for the following reasons:

Population growth in west Arvada: Arvada is experiencing heavy growth in the west and
northwest sections of the city. As of July 2015, 21 development projects are under design and
construction west of Ward Road. The 52 and 72X RTD bus routes serve an area with a population
of approximately 50,000. The current proposed service plan change would eliminate these two bus
routes which would require residents who live in the western half of the city to drive to park and
ride locations in order to access transit. The city is concerned that this would present barriers to
transit ridership on the west side and would leave a large portion of our community effectively
without adequate access to transit service.
Arvada Comprehensive Plan goals and recent zoning changes: During the 2005 and 2014
comprehensive planning efforts, the Arvada community supported multimodal travel and requested
that the land use and transportation plans integrate transit elements. This is reflected in several of
the goals set forth in the City of Arvada Comprehensive Plan adopted by the Arvada City Council
in September 2014. This is also reflected in recent zoning changes which allow for clusters of high
density and mixed-use zoning nodes on major streets throughout the city, including in northwest

Arvada. In addition, the Candelas development located in northwest Arvada was designated as an
Urban Center in 2011 by DRCOG. The current service plan changes proposed by RTD are
counterproductive with many of the goals in the comprehensive plan and recent zoning changes
because it will leave a large portion of west Arvada without R TD bus service and it does not
provide sufficient connector routes between neighborhoods.
Past and future investment in multimodal infrastructure in support of transit: In support of
the comprehensive plan goals and recent zoning changes, the city has invested, and continues to
invest, significant resources in multimodal infrastructure such as bike lanes and sidewalk
connections in support of transit. We feel strongly that the community needs "feeder bus routes"
and high frequency bus service to complement the recent and future multimodal infrastructure
investments the city has made, as well as to provide adequate transit service for all of our citizens.
Demand by Arvada's aging population and individuals with disabilities: The housing and
transportation needs of senior citizens and individuals with disabilities are becoming a concern for
Arvada and Jefferson County. The Senior Resource Center (SRC) is reporting that nearly 600
requests for SRC buses in Arvada were unfilled in 2014 due to high demand. Our understanding of
RTD's policy is that ADA transit service is only provided within the areas serviced by fixed route
buses. The current proposed service plan changes would eliminate fixed route service and therefore
eliminate Access-A-Ride transit services for the western half of Arvada, despite the documented
demand for such service. Fixed route bus service must continue in this area so that Access-A-Ride
options remain available for the elderly and individuals with disabilities.

In summary, the City of Arvada is concerned that the proposed service plan changes will result in a lack of
transit service and a lack of Access-A-Ride service for a significant portion of the city. The Preliminary
Gold and Northwest Corridors Service Plan, June 2015, states on page 45 that if a poorly performing route
is eliminated, alternatives to fixed route service such as Call-n-Rides, special shuttles, service routes or
commuter oriented programs will be considered. The proposed service plan does not show that these
alternatives have been offered for this area. Furthermore, we feel that the proposed changes are
counterproductive to many of the goals in the recently adopted Arvada Comprehensive Plan and will result
in increased traffic congestion and unwanted environmental impacts. The city recommends that RTD
revise the service plan update so that it adheres to the community's expectations for a well-connected and
strong bus service. The plan should maintain existing bus patrons and attract new riders with the opening
of the Gold Line. The plan should also support Arvada's past and future bicycle and pedestrian
infrastructure investments.
We appreciate your consideration and look forward to a revised bus service plan that reflects the interests
of the Arvada community.

Subject: Proposed RTD Bus Service Changes

Dear Mr. Monroe:
As Chair of the Jefferson County Transportation Action and Advocacy Group (JEFFTAAG), I
have been asked to write you concerning bus routes near and around the new Gold Line.
JEFFTAAG is a consortium of Jefferson County communities including the cities of Arvada,
Wheat Ridge, Golden, and Lakewood in addition to unincorporated Jefferson County. The
membership of JEFFTAAG is excited about the new commuter rail line and the great
enhancement it will be for our communities. However, we want to ensure that changes to
RTD's bus service plan do not create negative impacts to our citizens.
We anticipate and agree with the elimination of some bus service that parallel the Gold Line.
However, we want to make sure RTD preserves adequate service to the west side of Arvada
and portions of unincorporated Jefferson County. JEFFTAAG members also request routes be
incorporated in the service plan update that would increase connectivity between nearby
neighborhoods in west Arvada and the FasTracks transit network. We are encouraged that one
additional route is proposed to help meet this objective, but with the significant growth in this
large area, additional routes are necessary. We are also concerned about the service that has
already been eliminated to the west of the end of line station in Wheat Ridge, unincorporated
Jefferson County, and Golden .
Jurisdictions throughout Jefferson County have invested in multi-modal infrastructure that
supports transit. We are supportive of feeder bus routes and high frequency bus service that
meets the needs of our citizens and that will provide access to the new commuter rail lines.

consideration of a robust bus service plan that supports the new commuter rail line and meets
the of Jefferson County communities.

Douglas Monroe, Senior Service Planner

FROM:

Mark Westberg, PE, CFM, Project Supervisor

DATE:

November 19, 2015

SUBJECT:

Preliminary Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan – June 2015

We have reviewed the Preliminary Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan dated June
2015 for the proposed bus service to the Wheat Ridge Ward Station. The comments below
also incorporate the exhibits from your e-mail on November 9, 2015, discussion at our
meeting on November 10, 2015, Lee Cryer’s e-mail on November 17, 2015, and the traffic
information that was part of the approval of the Special Use Permit (SUP) for the Station.
We have the following concerns regarding this submittal:
1. Gold Line Corridor Transit Operations Plan (October 7, 2009) – The data shown in
this document is consistent with our understanding of the proposed design of the
Station. These assumptions were what formed the basis for the Record of Decision
(ROD) for the Gold Line project dated November 2009 and the SUP for the Station
that was approved on September 9, 2014.
a. Figures 5.2 and 5.3 on pages 49 and 50 show that the opening day boardings were
estimated at 700 per day and the 2030 boardings were estimated at 1,100 per day.
According to Cryer’s e-mail, the 2030 boardings are now estimated at 800 per
day.
b. Figure 5.4 on page 51 shows that it was estimated that 37% of the passengers
would be arriving by bus and 62% of the passengers would be arriving by car. For
opening day, this equates to 259 bus passengers and 434 car passengers. For 2030,
the bus passengers increase to 296 and the car passengers increases to 496.
2. Ward Road Station – Traffic Impact Study Summary (May 19, 2014)
a. Exhibit A – Bus Circulation Map (October 2013) shows a total of 7 bus routes
serving the Station with a total of 19 buses during the peak hours and 15 buses
during the off-peak hours.
b. The number of buses and high percentage of ridership was the basis for the
Station design, most notably the 8 bus bays and a relatively small parking lot with
290 parking spaces.
3. Wheat Ridge Ward Road Station SUP
a. Work on the latest service plan started in March 2014. This SUP was approved by
the City six months later on September 9, 2014. An important part of the approval
of this SUP was that the traffic impacts would be as assumed in the ROD and the
Traffic Impact Study Summary.

4. Ridge Road Catalytic Study (December 2014)
a. This study focused on future transportation needs related to the Gold Line Station,
including future improvement recommendations for Ridge Road and bicycle and
pedestrian access between the station and surrounding destinations.
b. Also included in this study was the completion of a comprehensive traffic study
that utilized available data from the Gold Line EIS process and more recent traffic
information from RTD, which consistently assumed that access to the station
would be by automobile and bus, with a significant percentage by bus.
c. Based on that information, the traffic study by the City’s consultant determined
that a traffic signal will be warranted at the intersection of Ward Road and 50th
Avenue (Ridge Road) on opening day.
d. The City met with RTD and CDOT to discuss this issue on March 16, 2015, with
any willingness to participate in the construction of a signal being essentially
dismissed by staff of those agencies.
5. Gold Line Bus Service Recommendations
a. Map 10 in the service plan shows no bus routes serving the Station. See
discussion on the reinstatement of Route 125 below.
b. Route 51 Diversion to Harlan Street – We have had several requests to improve
the stops along the diversion to Harlan Street. One of the stops currently has a
shelter which we placed based on high ridership and that RTD currently helped us
enhance. During our meeting, keeping the diversion was discussed because of
high ridership.
c. Route 52 – This route was proposed to be eliminated in the 2009 plan, but was to
be replaced by a feeder route to the Station.
d. Route 55 – This route appears to have been added between the Arvada Ridge and
Olde Town Arvada stations.
e. Route 72 – This route was proposed to be replaced by a feeder route to the Station
from the west. It appears that this route has also been revised in the updated plan
to better serve central Arvada, but no service for west of the Station.
f. Route 125 – The reinstatement of this route provides a valuable connection to the
Station. Although, in the previous plans, the frequency of service was higher for
both the peak and non-peak hours.
6. Process – This section in the latest service plan opens with a statement that “RTD is
developing this service plan in concert with” “municipal” “stakeholders”.
a. We certainly do not feel that adequate contact was initiated by RTD, especially
given the drastic reduction in bus service compared what was presented during the
SUP process.
b. We are also astonished that the drastic reduction in bus service was not mentioned
at the City’s Town Hall Meeting on August 31, 2015 that was held a few months
after the draft plan was completed by the RTD representatives that were present to
provide an update on the Gold Line.
c. Had we been adequately notified of this plan and the public meetings that were
recently completed, we would have helped with the advertisement of the meetings
through our normal outlets.
7. Observations and Concerns
a. With the reinstatement of Route 125, there is only one bus route serving the
Station with a total of two buses during the peak hours and one bus during the offPacket Pg. 47

peak hours. This is a major departure from all of the information that was
received by the City over the last six years.
b. The drastic reduction in bus service compared to the assumptions in the ROD
does not deliver what was promised during that process. Is there a need to revisit
the ROD to reflect the revised service plan?
c. We are surprised that this service plan was started several months before the
approval of the SUP and that the drastic reduction in bus service was not
discussed prior to the SUP being approved. It seems likely that some preliminary
data concerning the drastic reduction in bus service was known prior to the SUP
being approved.
d. We are even more surprised that the drastic reduction in bus service was not
discussed during the meeting on March 16, 2015, just a couple of months before
the latest service plan was completed. Especially given the fact that the purpose of
this meeting was to discuss potential traffic impacts. Surely some of the RTD
representatives at that meeting were aware of the drastic reduction being planned
in bus service to the Station.
e. Presumably, the vast majority of the 700 boardings on opening day will arrive by
car, which increases the number of car trips by around 60%. This increase in car
trips likely elevates the need for a traffic signal and other surrounding roadway
improvements for access and public safety needs as much more critical.
f. We also wonder what has changed in the service area to cause the drastic
reduction in bus service, particularly since the Bus Circulation Map (October
2013) that was submitted with the Traffic Impact Study Summary for the SUP. If
anything, the population and employment density has increased with a resurgence
of development within our Northwest Sub-area since 2009 and continued growth
in the western portions of the City of Arvada since 2009.
8. Recommendations
a. The drastic reduction in bus service compared to the information included with
the SUP requires that a revised traffic impact study be provided to evaluate the
adverse impacts of the large increase in car traffic.
b. Mitigation of those adverse impacts could result in a revaluation of both the size
of the parking lot for opening day and the need for additional improvements at the
Ward Road intersections prior to opening day.
c. The diversion for Route 51 along 38th and 44th Avenues to Harlan Street needs to
be reinstated.
d. Could Route 55 be extended to the west to the Station possibly by way of Miller
Street, I-70 Frontage Road North, and Tabor Street?

Subject:

Construction Amendment for Contract 35 DP003 – Platte Hoist Replacement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 35 DP-003 with Precision Construction
Services for an additional $1,687,083, increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433.
BACKGROUND
The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in
December of 1976. The design capacity of the garage was based on 40-foot buses for a total of 250
buses. Currently, the facility supports 260 buses.
There are a total of 15 in-ground hoists within the facility. Original construction did not account for pit
drainage. Over the years, this omission has caused excessive corrosion and has compromised safety. In
addition, the lifts have lived their useful life. All lifts need to be replaced.
DISCUSSION
Bids for the project were received on December 18, 2015. There were four bidders with Precision
Construction Services being low in the amount of $635,350. There are four hoist replacements within
the base bid. This amendment authorization replaces 11 additional hoists for an additional $1,687,083.
The costs were identified within the initial bid therefore assuring RTD a competitive price for this
amendment. These new lifts have the capacity to accommodate various bus dimensions and the scope
also includes adding drains within the pits. With each new lift concrete work is required to construct a
new pit that accommodates the new lift mechanisms. In addition, having all lifts fabricated by the same
manufacturer allows for a more efficient operations and maintenance program.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
The IFB specified a SBE requirement of 7% of the construction contract. Precision Construction Services
is exceeding the SBE goal for the project and is providing 8% SBE participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funds for the project are 100% local. Approved funds for 2015 and 2016 allows for seven hoists to
be completed by the end of 2016 and totals $1,349,424. The current SBP contains $600,000 for year
2017 and $600,000 for 2018. The eight additional lifts would be amended into the contract pending
Board budget approval for 2017 and 2018.

increasing the contract not-to-exceed amount to $2,322,433. Alternatively, complete the base
bid scope of four lifts and rebid all remaining 11 lifts in 2016 through 2018. This alternative is
not recommended due to the potential of over burdening the operations and maintenance program
by installing lifts from different manufacturers.

Architectural / Engineering Contract with Short
Elliot Hendrickson (SEH), Contract 11 DO-025 Contract Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional
architectural / engineering design services in the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed
contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended
amount is to be funded by various Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing
projects under contract.
BACKGROUND
Services rendered under this contract provide mechanical, civil, architectural, electrical, structural, and
landscaping, design and engineering services for the development of selected projects included in RTD's
SBP program and grant funded projects. The contract duration was specified for a three year term from
October 13, 2011 to October 13, 2014 with award being in the amount of $500,000. Allowable, are
two, one-year extensions to the contract and these extensions have been authorized. This board action
is to increase the existing not-to-exceed limit in the contract. All other terms and conditions of the
contract remain unchanged. Consultant responsibilities include preparation of drawings and
specifications for construction in addition to estimating and other construction related services such as
change order documentation, preparation of as-built drawings, and site inspections. The purpose of this
contract is to assist the Facilities Engineering Division with design services that cannot be completed
with in-house staff.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract amount awarded in October 2011 was $500,000. In May of 2012 the Board
approved an additional $1,500,000 that was based primarily on the Civic Center rehabilitation project. In
December 2013 the Board approved an additional $1,000,000 which anticipated 2014 and 2015 SBP
projects. To date, the contract has obligated $2,982,737 for twenty one projects leaving a contractual
balance of $17,263. Additional funding to the contract is required to accommodate approved 2016 SBP
projects.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
This contract does not have a SBE/DBE goal. Regardless, the consultant has retained SBE/DBE subconsultants and currently is maintaining a 12.2% participation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 51

2.11.F

This contract utilizes grant and local funds. The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source
of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager to amend contract
11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in the
amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
2. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract. Not
accepting the recommended action is not recommended because it would delay the schedule of
the approved 2016 SBP projects.
3. Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the Interim General Manager to amend
contract 11 DO-025 with SEH to allow for additional architectural / engineering design services in
the amount of $1,000,000 for a new, not-to-exceed contract amount of $4,000,000. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. The amended amount is to be funded by various
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) approved future projects and existing projects under contract.
Instead, proceed with the implementation of a new Architectural / Engineering RFP for a contract
with a new consultant team. This is not recommended because of the delay it will cause on the
approved 2016 SBP projects.

Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), expressing the intent of the Board to
be reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project.
BACKGROUND:
The FasTracks financial plan anticipates a 2016 FasTracks bond issuance for approximately $150
million to finance certain components of the FasTracks projects including the District’s Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project, I-225, North Metro, Longmont Station, EAGLE and US 36 BRT, Phase 2.
Related costs of issuance of the bonds are also anticipated to be financed through these bonds.
DISCUSSION:
In anticipation of fully funding the SERE project in 2016, certain preliminary expenses are being
incurred today such as right of way acquisition and final design work to facilitate a quick start to the
project once all funding is in place. In order for these preliminary SERE expenses and ongoing
expenses of the other projects listed above to be reimbursed by a future FasTracks bond issuance, a
reimbursement resolution such as the one being recommended must be adopted by the Board.
Once the Federal Small Starts Construction Grant for the SERE project is fully secured, the Chief
Financial Officer will take preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance of FasTracks bonds,
including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting preliminary documents
and a Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. Drafts of these documents and the Resolution
authorizing issuance of the 2016 FasTracks bonds will be brought to the Board for consideration at a
future time.
The Board is being requested, through this Resolution, to express the intent of the Board to be
reimbursed for certain expenses relating to the financing of the FasTracks Project through the future
issuance of FasTracks Bonds.

RTD is receiving the advice of Butler Snow as Bond Counsel in regard to this reimbursement
resolution.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Principal and interest costs related to the 2016 issuance of FasTracks Bonds are included in the
budget and the FasTracks financial plan adopted by the Board in August 2015.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Authorize the attached Resolution No. __, Series of 2016, expressing the intent of the

Resolution No. __ Series of 2016,
Operations and Maintenance – North Metro
Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors for the operation and maintenance and
any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail Line in accord with the Board approved
annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of the North Metro Rail Line.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. The Concession Agreement also anticipated that the
Concessionaire may be required to participate in other RTD commuter rail projects.
The Concession Agreement authorizes the Concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), to enter into
an operations and maintenance subcontract for the Eagle Project, and DTP has done so with Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). That subcontract does not cover the North Metro Rail Line. The attached
resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work orders, change
orders and amendments for operations and maintenance services required to complete testing and
commissioning and to maintain the rail vehicles and other systems as needed prior to revenue passenger
service of the North Metro Rail Line, all within the Board approved annual budget. This grant of
authority will avoid the need for a separate Board action for contract amendments or change orders to
implement those Board approved expenditures.
DISCUSSION
RTD had the opportunity of acquiring the rail vehicles needed for operation on the North Metro Rail Line
at a commercially attractive cost and assuring consistency within the commuter rail fleet. The rail
vehicles acquired will be delivered during 2016 and will require maintenance to assure they are kept fully
serviceable. It is proposed that the fleet be utilized on the Eagle Project in the interim period prior to the
start of revenue passenger operations on the North Metro Rail Line as this will assure the best possible
condition is maintained.

Packet Pg. 59

2.12.H

As the North Metro Rail Line approaches final test and commissioning there will be a need to dispatch
and operate rail vehicles on the line as part of the system proving. Certain of the rail systems such as
the overhead contact system, train control and at-grade crossing system will require maintenance in
accordance with safety and FRA requirements. Denver Transit Partners through DTO has the facility,
equipment and labor capable of providing these services efficiently.
Staff has commenced the process of acquiring the operations and maintenance services required for
revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line and will seek approval of the recommended
approach when that has been determined.
Each year, up to the start of revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line, staff will include
the annual amount for these services in the RTD annual budget. Without the attached Resolution,
contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General Manager’s
Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s approval of the
budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget by the Board, staff will notify DTP
and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the required commuter rail operations and
maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the coming year. This process is clearly
defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the General Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors
for the operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail
Line in accord with the Board approved annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of
the North Metro Rail Line.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change as
frequently as may be required.

GENERAL MANAGER AUTHORITY FOR PRE-REVENUE PASSENGER SERVICE
MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS FOR NORTH METRO RAIL LINE
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution 10, Series of 2010 the RTD Board of Directors
authorized entry into a Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for the
design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the Eagle Project which
includes the East, Gold and a portion of the Northwest Rail lines; and,
Whereas, the Concession Agreement anticipated the possibility of the
Concessionaire participating in other RTD commuter rail lines; and,
Whereas, the North Metro Rail Line procured rail vehicles through the Concession
Agreement that are being delivered in 2016 and such rail vehicles will require maintenance
prior to providing revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line; and,
Whereas, the North Metro Rail Line has certain other systems that will require
maintenance prior to revenue passenger service; and,
Whereas, as part of the final testing and commissioning of the North Metro Rail
Line rail vehicles will be required to be dispatched and operated; and,
Whereas, the Concessionaire through its operations and maintenance subcontractor
DTO has the facility, the equipment and the labor to maintain the North Metro Rail Line
including the rail vehicles; and,
Whereas, the Board may authorize service adjustments and capital expenditures
that require modifications to the availability payments or other payments to DTP or its
subsidiaries (including DTP’s O&M subcontractor DTO); and
Whereas the Board retains oversight of all payments and their purposes through the
annual budget process and the service change process,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
The General Manager is authorized to execute contract amendments, change orders
and other necessary modifications to the Concession Agreement or enter into contracts
with subsidiaries and subcontractors of DTP for purposes of North Metro Rail Line vehicle
and systems maintenance, dispatching and operations, up to the start of revenue
passenger operations on the North Metro Rail Line included in the RTD annual budget and
service plans.

Resolution No. __ Series of 2016,
Southeast Rail Extension Project Property
Acquisition

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the Southeast Rail
Extension Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the Southeast Rail Extension
Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs will be identified
and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins
with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law.
Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or
additions required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
On July 28, 2015 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for the Southeast Rail Extension
Project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, additional acquisitions
have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary for project construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the approved Southeast Rail Extension cost to complete
budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the Southeast Rail Extension Project and authorizing staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
SOUTHEAST RAIL EXTENSION PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Southeast Rail
Extension Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans and tabulation
sheets, which list the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to
obtain immediate possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Southeast Light Rail Extension Project, although financially compensated
according to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a
sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the additional
acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.

Packet Pg. 65

2.12.I

The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any
property through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property
through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate
with property owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to
address concerns of owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively
impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the Properties as soon as permitted by law.

Subject:

Anschutz Shuttle Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the University of Colorado in an amount not to exceed $2,157,000 for the purpose
of distributing grant funds in order to fund the Anschutz Shuttle. This Agreement is for the period 20162019.
BACKGROUND:
With the relocation of the Fitzsimons Light Rail Station on the new R Line, the University of Colorado
agreed to operate a shuttle to transport customers around the Anschutz Campus. In 2015, the
University of Colorado applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant for a shuttle to
operate on the Anschutz Campus. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019. Total
funding for the project was approved at $2,157,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,509,000 and local
matching funds are committed at $648,000. The University of Colorado will contribute the entire local
match.
Because the RTD has been designated as the agency responsible for distributing CMAQ grant funds to
local recipients, the RTD will receive the federal funds and in turn will reimburse the University of
Colorado for the federal share of the grant.
The Anschutz Shuttle will operate on the campus serving the Fitzsimons Station. The shuttle will
operate seven days a week, 5:30am-8:00pm.
DISCUSSION:
RTD is the designated recipient of federal funds in the metropolitan area. The RTD will provide local
RTD local funds to reimburse the University of Colorado for the federal share only of the CMAQ
grant. In turn, RTD will draw down the federal funds to cover the RTD cost. RTD’s responsibility
will be to track expenditures over the course of the grant and reimburse the federal share. The
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) approved this grant and the approach for
reimbursement in the 2016-2021 Transportation Improvement Program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds to reimburse the University of Colorado Anschutz shuttle for the federal share of the CMAQ
Grant for 2016 were included as local funds in the 2016 RTD budget. All funds expended by the
RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Route 62 Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with Commerce City in an amount not to exceed $1,695,000 for RTD to provide the new
Route 62 service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match funds
provided by Commerce City. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, Commerce City applied for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant to extend the
existing Route 73. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019. Total funding for the
project was approved at $1,695,000. CMAQ funds account for $1,355,000 and local funds are
committed at $340.000. Commerce City will contribute the entire local match.
The Route 73 currently operates between the Denver Tech Center and Central Park Station. Under the
grant, service will be extended north from the Central Park Station to Parkway Drive and 60th Avenue.
In February 2016, RTD, Commerce City and the Denver Regional Council of Governments agreed that
the creation of a new Route 62 would take place rather than extending the Route 73.
DISCUSSION:
The Route 62 will offer connections to the University of Colorado A-Line and numerous RTD routes
at the Central Park Station. This new route will provide service to a new high school in the area and
special event service to Dick’s Sporting Goods Park.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the new Route 62 (extension of the Route 73) service are included in the
2016 budget. All funds expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Superior Call-n-Ride Pass through Funds

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
an Agreement with the City of Superior in an amount not to exceed $530,000 for RTD to provide
Superior Call-n-Ride service. This service will be funded through CMAQ grant funding and local match
funds from the City of Superior. This Agreement is for the period 2016-2019.
BACKGROUND:
In 2015, the City of Superior applied to DRCOG for a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant
for a new Superior Call-n-Ride service. This grant was approved with funding available 2016-2019.
Total funding for the project was approved at $530,000. CMAQ funds account for $423,000 and local
funds are committed at $107,000. The City of Superior will contribute the entire local match.
The Superior Call-n-Ride will operate weekdays 5:30am – 7:00pm.
DISCUSSION:
The original Superior Call-n-Ride operated March 2000 – January 2012 and was discontinued due to
low ridership. The City of Superior determined that the Call-n-Ride was instrumental in the
community and submitted the grant application to DRCOG to reestablish the Call-n-Ride.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Funds for the provision of the new Superior Call-n-Ride are included in the 2016 budget. All funds
expended by the RTD will be reimbursed through the grant process.

Construction Award for RFP 14 FH - 050 –
Civic Center Renovation Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager to award a contract to the most qualified proposer, Mortensen
Construction, in the amount of $26,526,319.50 for the Civic Center Renovation project. Additionally,
the Interim General Manager shall be authorized to issue contract amendments within the approved
budget of $30,882,564.
BACKGROUND
Civic Center opened to the public in December 1984 and was built as a part of the 16th Street Mall
project as the south end terminus. The Market Street station was the north end terminus. The original
source of funds were 41% federal and 59% local for a total capital investment of $28,093,307. Routes
that serve the facility are local, limited, regional, and the mall shuttle. Since 2004, both the Maintenance
and Operations Departments have observed degrading conditions of the station. These concerns were
focused on structural and performance elements of the facility which are based on the age of the facility
in addition to original design characteristics.
DISCUSSION
In June of 2011 a report was completed by Merrick & Company that surveyed the facility and made
recommendations for immediate issues, short-term recommendations, and long-term projects. After
reviewing the report and evaluating the estimated costs for repairs it made sense to evaluate the
possibility for an entire replacement. The costs for repairing and keeping the same design were
comparable to redesigning and building a new facility. With a new design there would also be permanent
solutions for problems based on design technology of the late 1970’s. In addition, a new design would
offer solutions to urban design issues that are also considered deficient within the entire site.
With the commitment to redesign the facility and the entire site, RTD held several stakeholder meetings
for site concepts and stakeholder input. The stakeholders included Denver Planning, Denver Parks &
Recreation, Denver Public Works, Downtown Denver Partnership, and the State of Colorado. Goals that
were addressed within the new design are as follows:
1. It gives the option to locate the Free Metro Ride within the station block, upgrades the bus
bays to our current standards to accommodate our current fleet, and gives us some additional
flexibility from a routing and scheduling standpoint.
2. It has a straightforward building structure that will be easier to maintain and repair over the
long term with a smaller more efficient station footprint.

Packet Pg. 79

2.12.P

3. It provides a more open and welcoming station environment that is easier to police and
manage, and provides clear visual connections between the mall shuttle, the station, and the
on-street routes at Broadway and Colfax.
4. It preserves a parcel for development opportunities along Colfax.
Due to the complexity and location of the project the decision was made to procure a builder through a
two-phase, qualifications/best value based process. The Request for Qualifications was solicited on
September 10, 2014. The submittals were due on October 17, 2014 and four proposers submitted their
qualifications. They were:
1. Milender White Construction Co.
2. Kiewit Building Group, Inc.
3. PCL Construction
4. Mortensen Construction
All of the proposers were determined to be qualified. The second phase which was the Request for
Proposals was issued on March 27, 2015. Through this RFP process, alternative technical concepts
were solicited. The goal of this process was for RTD to take advantage and own certain technical
concepts that could better the project through means & methods, phasing, logistics, schedule, and cost.
Proposals were due on January 28, 2016. Only two proposals were received. They were from Kiewit
Building Group, Inc. and Mortensen Construction. Both Milender White Construction Co. and PCL
Construction declined to pursue the project. There were thirteen options that were identified within the
scope that were priced separately. Mortensen’s proposed construction duration is 414 calendar days.
Amendment authority of the approved budget for the Interim General Manager is necessary to ensure
schedule adherence. Any unforeseen obstructions will need to be handled in an expeditious manner to
minimize delays as all patrons will be utilizing street-side bus stops without shelters throughout the
construction period.
