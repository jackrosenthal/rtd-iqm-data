II.

Cost Sharing Agreements $250,000 and Under – Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for
Customer and Contracted Services introduced this item. There is no Board action required,
this is just a communication with the Committee that the agreements are being executed.
There were no questions from the Committee on this item.

III.

CAD/AVL Briefing – Mr. Washington introduced this item. A few Board members have asked
about procurement that RTD has out and why the District was going with Motorola.
Eric Farrington, IT Project Manager, gave an overview of the procurement. Staff has chosen
the Digital Trunk Radio System (DTRS) based on numerous technical issues which were
previous covered at the September 2009 Operations/Customer Services Committee. There
are two procurements that are relevant to this issue; one is the CAD/AVL with subscriber
radios, data radios, and integration. This is a competitive procurement that includes a
significant radio purchase. There are five radio manufactures that have approved mobile and
portable radios. The Radio Fixed-Hardware portion is the focus of this issue and the second
procurement. The DTRS is an existing public safety network managed by the Consolidated
Communications Network of Colorado (CCNC). The managing network requires that the
equipment be Motorola (it was chosen by a competitive process in 1999). It will not be sole
source as it will be Motorola resellers competing for this procurement.
No other
manufacturer is allowed. This procurement is only 25% of the total radio portion
procurement. This is a very complicated procurement; opening up this portion of the
procurement puts the District at risk for not meeting the FCC deadline. This is the least
expense option in both capital and life cycle costs.
Director Christopher wanted to know the dollar value and Mr. Farrington said that was on
purpose due to the upcoming procurement. The total amount of the project is approximately
55 million dollars and the radio portion is in the 13-14 million range, the fixed hardware is
25% of that cost.
Director Cohen asked if the lifecycle could be longer than ten years. Mr. Farrington
responded that with the pace of changing technology, it is hard to predict.
He expects a lot of the equipment can be maintained over a longer time period than ten
years. The platform allows for some adaptability and flexibility. If we need more radios in
the future, there are several vendors that are authorized and we can do a competitive bid and
do not have to buy the same radios.
Director Tayer had a request, this is such an important project could the Board have a more
visible timeline for the implementation of this project including milestones hit. This is a
customer service issue as the new radios will provide real time GPS information. Director
Tayer would like to see publicity about this project.

Mr. Farrington said the timeline is to have the RFP for the first procurement out on the
streets in the next month and the vendor selected September - November 2010. Mr.
Washington said the timeline will be outlined in the General Manager’s Report as well as the
PI newsletter.
Mr. Abel said the timeline for the project to be finished is the end of 2012.
IV.

2008 Service Performance Review – Mr. Abel apologized for the delay in issuing the report
as there were some problems with data computation. Service changes that have been made
on an ongoing basis were included in the memorandum.
Director Christopher wanted to know how soon the Board would receive the report for 2009.
Mr. Abel said he is hoping the report will be ready by the second quarter of 2010.

V.

Next Meeting Date – The next meeting of the Operations and Customer Services Committee
will be February 2, 2010.

VI.

Other Matters – Chair Brohl had an action item from John Shonsey.
c. Budget Transfer for Cherry Creek LRT Bridge Repairs – John Shonsey, Senior Manager of
Engineering introduced this action item. The original MAC line was put into operations in
1994. As part of the ongoing transportation maintenance program for the light rail
system, RTD is proceeding with plans to repair existing Cherry Creek LRT Bridge between
North and South bound lanes of Speer Boulevard for the Central Corridor.
To
accommodate continued operations of light rail service in downtown, it is necessary to
repair the existing bridge approach rail support between the existing curb and the bridge.
This work consists of the removal of existing rack, ballast and other track supporting
material (currently concrete) and soils, replacement/compaction of soils, installing
additional subsoil drainage, new ballast and ties and reinstall rail. It has been found that
the rails are moving up and down excessively causing rail connection on the bridge to fail.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $380,141 from the CPV Pocket Track capital project to
the expense budget to cover repairs to the Cherry Creek LRT Bridge between north and
south bound Speer Boulevard on the Central Corridor. Funding for the CPV pocket track
project is included in the 2010 Adopted Budget.
Motion:

Director Busck made a motion to forward this
item to the January 19, 2010 Board meeting
agenda.

Second:

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Director Daly wanted to know how long the light rail line would need
to close. Cal Shankster responded that it will be mostly night
closures without affecting the main flow of traffic. The repairs
should not affect the bike path underneath it. Approximately 12 – 14
people would be employed to fix the bridge.

Director Christopher wanted to know what have been the cumulative
repair costs. Mr. Shonsey was unsure of the total costs as the
District has been repairing this bridge since 1994.
Vote on Motion:

VII.

The motion passed unanimously.

Adjourn to Financial Administration Committee - Hearing no objection, Committee Chair Brohl
adjourned to the Financial Administration Committee at 6:12 p.m.
