## X. Chair's Report

Chair Anderson provided this report following her arrival at 5:45 p.m.

- Chair Anderson reported she was at the State Legislature to testify on HB 1272 on Sales Tax Parity.  She apologized for being late to this meeting.

- Chair Anderson complimented the staff for the outstanding employee celebration day on the West Line.  This was one of the best days of her life and marked the first corridor rollout from the FasTracks program.  Brenda Tierney, FasTracks Public Information had done a fantastic job.

- Last month, Director Hoy hosted an extremely successful North Metro tour.  One of the highlights from this tour was the relationship building and people (i.e. elected officials in the North and Board members), getting a chance to dialog and know each other.

- Chair Anderson and Director Sisk attended the Metro Mayors TaskForce meeting.  They are in support of RTD plans for FasTracks.

## XI. General Manager's Report

- General Manager Washington stated the West Corridor Employee Event day was a success with over 4200 employees who had RSVP’d.  He thanked all the volunteers including Director Rivera-Malpiede and stated he had received numerous emails from employees who were proud of this organization and its accomplishments.

- General Manager Washington announced that RTD is in queue for Federal funds in the next phase of MAP-21 New Starts process for the Southeast Corridor Extension.  He stated we have been accepted into the project development phase and that RTD is the only new start in the country for the new MAP 21.  This new MAP-21 looks at some different factors such as current ridership versus projections.

- General Manager Washington announced that RTD did not get the full $150M from the FFGA as hoped for 2013.  RTD was part of the across-the- board cut (haircut) of 5.489%.Nevertheless we will figure out how to stay the course and he believes we will ultimately get the full amount.

- General Manager Washington indicated there have been some questions or confusion about the operations and maintenance portion of FasTracks.  O&M is a part of the .4% of FasTracks and we will retain what is needed of the .4% for operations and maintenance.  He stated that RTD has taken an aggressive stance on state of good repair with emphasis on asset management.  This is a priority for us and continuing to be proactive in this area will help us in the operations and maintenance area.

- North Metro—we are moving in the direction with the assumption of no federal funds; however, we will remain open so if an opportunity exists to apply for federal funds.

Questions from Board Members:

- Director Lubow asked if this was the second cut RTD has experience for the FFGA.  General Manager Washington indicated that it is; the first cut was $10M which is more than this second cut.  We have done well with FFGA and he believes it hinges on when we get the funds, not if.

- Director Sisk asked for an update on the NAMS study and if we were on target with the timelines.  General Manager Washington replied we are still on schedule with a target submittal date of May 14.

- Director Solano asked assurance that we are still moving forward with North Metro, with or without federal funds.  General Manager Washington assured him we will be moving forward.

- Director Folska complimented General Manager Washington and staff for a phenomenal employee event for the West Corridor.

- Director Bagley commented on the Directors who attended this event, Folska, Anderson, Tobiassen, Hoy, and Rivera-Malpiede and stated it was a great event.  He also declared how pleased he was to hear about Southeast Corridor extension being accepted into the first phase of MAP-21.  This is absolutely critical.

### B. US 36 Bus Rapid Transit – Use of Contingency Funds from Phase I and II Commitments

### C. Donation of Vintage Rolling Stock

It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.

Primary motion:              Director Folska made the motion to approve the donation of the vintage rolling stock to Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation in Colorado Springs.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Substitute Motion:              Director Lasater asked for a 6 month postponement of this decision while he lead the effort to rally support and funds for the preservations of these vintage rolling stock.

Director Solano seconded this motion.

Discussion:              Director Lasater stated his position that this is part of RTD history and that we need to retain our history. He brings a passion to this issue that perhaps others do not share. He wanted time to put together a group to look at preservation options and to try to do this without cost to RTD. He referred to a letter by Robert Brewster that spoke also to this being Denver legacy and not Colorado Springs.

Director Lubow thanked Director Lasater for putting this option on the table.  She strongly supports this and stated that Brewster felt we could turn this into an asset for RTD.

Director Daly shared that this is not a new discussion.   He also shares the passion for history but the last time this came up, staff had been instructed to issue a RFP for possible interests.  Staff sent out letters of inquiries to every historical group.  The only one expressing any interest was Pikes Peak.  AGM Genova stated he had put a list of the people who the letter had gone to in the Board report.  Director Daly stated now is not the time for RTD to spend on historical preservation.  What is being offered is a compromise.

Director Menten inquired about acquisition costs.  AGM Genova stated he has no other information other than what he provided.  Director Menten asked if we could be creative in our approach.  Perhaps trade schools such as Emily Griffith could have their students work on the preservation, donate materials, etc.  General Manager Washington responded that he is not sure who all was on the list of 18 names but he questions if trade schools such as Emily Griffith would have capability.

Director Solano commented there is a lot of cultural history here and the trolley is an instrumental part of Denver history that should be retained.

Director Walker stated he is in favor of preserving the past as long as it does not risk our future.  Given all the issues with time, storage, determining who might want them, etc., it is time to move on and make a decision.

Director Lubow clarified her understanding that we had two approaches.  The first with the RFP was to give them away and have someone take them off our hands.  What Lasater was proposing was preservation and a different approach.

Director Folska stated that she appreciated history but was more concerned that the opportunity to do something with these vehicles might go away.

Director Hoy stated his experience in restoration of vehicles and stated the costs could easily go into millions of dollars. He could not foresee spending any funds in this direction when we need buses and services on the road.  He would not support.

Director Bagley stated he supported Director Folska’s position that this is an opportunity on the table that could be lost if we postpone.  He could not support postponement.

Director Lasater re-stated that he is not asking RTD to spend any money.  He is simply asking for time to look at the feasibility for putting a group together for preservation.  He also has extensive experience in restoring and preservation and he understands fully what is involved.  Over the years, he has managed to restore lots of things that others would have thrown out.  He can also be a fundraiser and knows how to make his way around the block when it comes to putting this kind of thing together.

Chair Anderson called the question and asked for a vote on the substitute motion.

Vote on

Substitute motion:              There were 4 members in favor of the substitute motion (Lasater, Lubow, Menten and Solano) and 9 opposed (Anderson, Bagley, Daly, Folska, Hoy, Rivera-Malpiede, Sisk, Tobiassen and Walker).

## XIV. Old Business

- Director Hoy indicated that four Directors, Hoy, Bagley, Lasater and Daly attended the DUS tour this afternoon.  They are about 80% complete.  When you look at the progress in that area, we are building a city that is changing the face of Denver.  We are about 6 years ahead of where we thought we might be and the progress is significant.

## XV. New Business

- Director Lasater passed out a map of District G and directed the Board members to a section in his District where there is a small protrusion off Main St.  He indicated this is a residential area where these homes are not in the District.  He wanted to know if the Board members would have any aversions to annexing this area into the district.  Chair Anderson directed staff to look at this and provide direction to the Board on the appropriate action.  General Manager Washington indicated they will put a package together and get back to the Board as to action required.

- Director Menten expressed interest in this discussion on annexation and wanted to make sure that we knew and followed the requirements of annexation to the law.  We need to be very clear on process and notice that needs to be given to the residents.

- Director Sisk indicated that he had met the residents in the mountainous community of Nederland north of Boulder.  He stated this is a community that is heavily dependent on transit and that RTD is the lifeblood of that community.

- Director Folska expressed that we review our policy on wheelchairs and strollers on buses and light rail.  She wants to see if this policy might need to be revised.
