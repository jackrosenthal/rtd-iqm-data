C. Updates

• Government Relations Update
Local – Sherry Ellebracht
Sherry Ellebracht explained that Roger Sherman was unable to attend the
meeting so she would brief the Board on CRL Associates’ activities. She
stated that Roger Sherman and CRL have been spending a lot of time
working on the interim transportation funding solutions. This is a State-wide
effort possibly going to the ballot for funding transportation. The initiative
would be a 0.7% sales tax increase with 2/3 going to highways and 1/3
going to transit. Sherry explained that the western slope and mountain

6.A

communities continue to be concerned about the sales tax; the resort
communities already have very high sales tax rates.

Federal – Patton Boggs
Mike Dino stated that since the Directors were last in Washington, D.C. the
House and Senate did pass the Continuing Resolution (CR) for Fiscal Year
2013. This Resolution funds the Federal Government through the rest of the
Fiscal Year which is through the end of September, 2013. He explained that
this is minus the $85 billion in automatic cuts related to Sequestration. All
Federal agencies need to have a plan by April 25th as to how they will deal
with these cuts.
Mike Dino said the positive elements of the Continuing Resolution (CR) are
that the transit formula was set to levels authorized in MAP-21. The final
CR provides $117 million more for transit than the House originally
proposed. He stated that there will ultimately be $1.855 billion going to the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for New Starts and Small Starts grants
and $10 million that was put in the Transit Oriented Development Planning
Pilot Program. Mike Dino stated that the Transportation Investment
Generating Economic Recovery Grant Program (TIGER) also received $475
million in funding. He explained this is good since RTD has had designs on
looking at how to get more funding through the TIGER Program and partner
with other agencies.
Mike Dino stated that our top advocacy issue is to make sure RTD receives
the $150 million that was asked for in Fiscal Year 2013 for the Eagle P3
project. He explained that because the Sequestration did reduce New Starts
by $100 million they are concerned that the FTA will give all the Full
Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) a cut.
Mike Dino shared that they are working with our delegation to send a letter
to FTA Administrator Peter Rogoff as well as US Department of
Transportation (DOT) Secretary Ray LaHood asking them to honor the Full
Funding Grant Agreement Request for $150 million this Fiscal Year. He
stated that our Senators have agreed to sign a letter and Congresswoman
Diana DeGette is working to have her House associates write a similar letter.
Senator Michael Bennet and Congressmen Ed Perlmutter said they would
make phone calls.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Sherry Ellebracht stated that Roger Sherman attended the Metro Mayor’s
Task Force that met on March 5th and there will be another meeting on April
10th. She shared that he has also been attending all the Citizens Advisory
Committee (CAC) meetings and the meetings between CAC members and
RTD Directors. Sherry Ellebracht said that 7 meetings were completed in
March with the balance to be scheduled in April.

6.A

Mike Dino said that the President announced his Rebuild America Partnership
that will focus on more money for transportation infrastructure by creating a
National Infrastructure Bank with $10 billion dollars. This replaces the Build
America Bonds Program with America Fast-forward Bonds. He said the
President is also proposing $4 billion in new competitive funding for TIGER
Grants as well as TIFIA loan money. Mike Dino stated that the Marketplace
Fairness Act, which is an opportunity for states to collect sales tax on
internet sales, did pass in the Budget Resolution for the Senate. This could
lead to more revenue for RTD if it is enacted by the president. He said that
we are still waiting for a new United States Department of Transportation
Secretary to be nominated.
Mike Dino shared that on April 10th, 2013 the President will introduce his
Budget Resolution; RTD has asked for $160 million for Fiscal Year 2014. He
stated that the House and Senate both passed their Fiscal Year 2014 Budget
Resolutions. The Senate has called for Tax Credit Bonds and Infrastructure
Bank to help transportation while the House wants to eliminate funding for
high speed rail.
State – Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry shared that the House passed Senate Bill 13-027 with
44 yes votes. She explained that because there was an amendment that
was put into the Legislative Declaration by the House Committee it will have
to go back to the Senate for concurrence. Jenifer Brandeberry said that our
Senate Sponsor, Senator Todd, is working on the Bill so she does not
anticipate any problems. She thanked everyone at RTD who worked with
Brandeberry~McKenna in getting this Bill through.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated they are also working on House Bill 1272. This is
the Sales Tax Parity Bill that is a product of the Board adopted Risk
Allocation Matrix (RAM). She said there were many meetings prior to the
introduction of HB1272 with the Majority Leader and Department of
Revenue. This Bill will make tax collection in the State of Colorado uniform.
Jenifer Brandeberry explained that her team worked very hard with members
of the business community, the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, and
the Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry knowing that for a long
time they have been at the General Assembly talking about this policy;
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mike Dino explained that our messaging in the letter requests the allocation
of the full $150 million for Fiscal Year 2013. He stated that they are
stressing that this is the only major transit public-private partnership going
on right now and that it is in the best interest of the FTA to support it. They
are also highlighting how RTD has managed all our other FFGAs on time and
within budget.

6.A

Jenifer Brandeberry informed the Board that we had a joint presentation to
the Transportation Committees. It was attended by Chair Anderson and
Directors Daly and Tobiassen. She said that General Manager Washington
and Terry Howerter gave the presentation. The Transportation Committees
are holding a series of early morning meetings about how the State can look
at innovative financing. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that it is a compliment to
the District that we were asked to present. RTD provided some interesting
testimony and conversation about how we have been incredibly visionary.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated she received many comments from the
Committee following the presentation that the education provided is very
beneficial.
Jenifer Brandeberry shared that the Budget has passed from the Senate and
is now in the House. She believes that a big part of the Budget will be done
by the end of the week (April 5, 2013).

D. Other Matters
There were no other matters.

having consistency in what is collected is important to them. She shared
that Tom Clarke came to the House Committee and testified in favor of this
Bill. The Bill was heard today on second reading in the House and passed
on voice vote. It should continue to move along in the process. Jenifer
Brandeberry thanked Terry Howerter, Marla Lien and Director Sisk for
working on this complicated piece of legislation. She believes this will
create a clearer idea of what is collected.

B. CAC Update

• Citizens Advisory Committee Update
David Lewis, CAC Co-Chair introduced Hugh Wilson, CAC Co-chair for
2013. Hugh Wilson stated that they held their quarterly community
outreach meeting on March 20th in Highlands Ranch. He thanked Director
Bagley for attending and answering questions. The constituents attending
had concerns about the last mile of connectivity and specifically issues
about parking on the Southwest Corridor. Some people were very vocal
about parking being problematic along the corridor, particularly at Mineral.
They voiced issues about bus connections in terms of timing, people getting
off the train are seeing their bus leave. He thinks that maybe some
educational meetings for those constituents would be helpful. He stated
that the staff mentioned a task force that will be looking at the Southwest
extension, as another issue of concern is the delay in its construction, which
is not a priority at this point. Citizens feel that they are having parking
problems, trains are full and there doesn’t seem to be any relief in the short
term. Susan Woods took the names of those residents and she will follow
up with them. There is a great deal of support for FasTracks, but they are
concerned for when they are going to get what they need.
David Lewis spoke specifically to the parking issue. They have been trying
to do their job and are delighted about the outcome of SB27 and will
continue their focus on public education. He also mentioned that they are
having one-on-one meetings with the Board members and he encourages the
Directors to make the time to meet the committee members and help them
understand their priorities and concerns. The CAC will continue to work on
being a conduit for RTD in the communities.

Director Bagley thanked the CAC for coming to Highlands Ranch. They had
representatives from different parts of the district. It is very important for
members of the CAC as well as the Board Members to go to the different
areas of the district and hear the concerns of the community’s. It was
worthwhile to list the comments made by the citizens and have the CAC
members understand the issues and bring them to the Board.

Director Tobiassen thanked the CAC members for their ongoing support on
the I-225 Corridor. They are always involved with the different events
supporting the FasTracks program.
Director Sisk thanked the CAC for the breakfast. He thinks that the Board
and RTD have a great opportunity in utilizing the CAC to reach out, hear the
citizens’ concerns and be a think tank in terms of possibilities for RTD. He is
very enthusiastic about the potential of the CAC.
Director Solano thanked the CAC for directing their interest in the South
Corridor. However, he is an advocate for the North Corridor and the tide has
shifted north and they need to stay on that focus and get the North Corridor
done before talking about any extensions.
Director Folska also had the opportunity to meet with CAC members and she
feels that there is a lot of common ground between what we do as the
Board and how the CAC is an extension of the Board to reach the
community. The challenge for the Board and the CAC is to have a
productive, constructive and positive dialogue with the staff. She
acknowledged that there is a lot going on at RTD and the Directors need to
be patient and work with the staff, as she believes that they do want to
move forward with outreach. A patient long term dialogue and interaction
between the CAC, the Board and the staff would be best.
Director Lasater also thanked Roger and the CAC members. He suggested
having these meetings in a bi-yearly basis. This is a great starting point and
he would like to continue meeting various members of the CAC and getting
their input.
Chair Anderson thanked them for the hard work and she also enjoyed the
meeting and appreciates all the work they do for furthering FasTracks.

Director Daly thanked Roger and the CAC members for the one-on-one
meetings with the Board members. His meeting was very rewarding, he
learned from the CAC members and they took away a couple pieces of
information from him.

6.B

Director Hoy stated that the one-on-one process was great and shows the
CAC’s commitment and the Board enjoys the dialogue. He also mentioned
that the Board has an opportunity to meet together with the CAC every year
in December.

C. Recommended Actions
Commitments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors modify the formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and
July 24, 2012 concerning RTD funding provided to the Colorado Department
of Transportation (CDOT) and the Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise
(HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes Project.
Specifically, it is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors allow the
following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for
the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and
Phase II will be used for acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles
for the corridor.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at
the April 16th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded
the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager stated that staff is
bringing this action because the previous Board action
allocating $120 million of FasTracks funds to Phase I of US36
and $15 million for Phase II did not address the use of excess
revenue from those commitments if any. They have been
advised that there might be some money left from Phase I and
CDOT has requested to keep the funding in the corridor to
support Phase II implementation. Also, if there is any money
left after Phase II, they were asked to keep that money in the
corridor as well. In this case, the RTD funds would be used to
purchase additional vehicles for US36 BRT.
Director Folska asked Bill if he was presenting because Rick
Clarke was not here. Bill Van Meter stated that the Planning
and Department has shared responsibilities with both the Base

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• US 36 Bus Rapid Transit – Use of Contingency Funds from Phase I and II

6.B

System and FasTracks. Rick Clark as head of Capital
Programs also has shared responsibilities with the base
system. They both bring issues through either FasTracks or
Planning and Development as it pertains to the planning and
programming of the different Base and FasTracks projects.

Director Lubow stated that her impression is that the Board did
not want funds from Phase I to be used in Phase II. Bill stated
that the Board was silent.
Director Deadwyler asked if they are expecting any leftovers
from Phase I and if that includes contingency funds. Bill Van
Meter stated that completion of Phase I is scheduled for next
year. There are potential unforeseen issues that might arise
and that are not included in the current contract which might
require using the contingency funds; however the current
projection is that there will be some money left over. Director
Deadwyler asked if they know what the amount of money is
and if this means that we overstated what this project would
cost. Marla Lien stated that they have about $7-8 million in
contingency funds. What would be left over will depend on
what happens in the next few years, including any immediate
repairs after opening. They have to hold on to the
contingency and if there is anything left over they would roll
over to Phase II. Director Deadwyler asked if the $7-8 million
were additional to the $120 million. Marla Lien stated that the
money went into the $350 total amount and from that they
allocated the contingency funds. Director Deadwyler stated
that she has more questions and will address them offline with
the staff.
Director Solano asked if Phase I and II overlap with the
Northwest Area Mobility Study. Bill Van Meter stated that the
study has just been given notice to proceed and it will address
elements in the Northwest and North Metro potential
extensions beyond the US36 construction project. This report
is not looking at the US36 BRT. They do touch on each other,
as they would be able to build out on the infrastructure that
the US36 will provide.
Director Lasater stated that CDOT and HPTE are infrastructure
builders and he doesn’t understand what they have to do with
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 2, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy stated that this will always happen, as there are
some projects that are dealt with in different committees.

BRT vehicles and asking RTD for the funds. He doesn’t like
being mandated and doesn’t understand why they are asking
RTD to commit to buy buses. Bill Van Meter stated that it is
not a request from CDOT; this is the staff’s recommendation
to keep the dollar commitment that has already been
established. Director Lasater stated that he understands that
they want to build the corridor, but doesn’t understand the
connectivity to the buses. General Manager Phil Washington
stated that the project has the infrastructure part, the building
of the managed lanes and that RTD has a remaining
commitment of about $77 million, which much of it will go to
the BRT vehicles that will run on those lanes. This is part of
the FasTracks plan. If there is money left over, the money
from our share of this should go to satisfy our remaining
commitment. Director Lasater asked if given that we already
have the $77 million in the budget, would this mean that if
there are $3 million left from the Phase I and II, we are going
to spend 80 million. GM Washington stated that whatever the
amount leftover is, it will be subtracted from RTD’s $77
million commitment.
Director Sisk appreciates the questions and the concerns.
However, if we build the lanes but don’t have the BRT buses
in place we will not have the system we want. This keeps the
money in the corridor to assure that by its opening in 2015 we
have a BRT system that we will be proud of. Also, we are
trying to get money from them. Staff has made presentation
to DRCOG to get money for the cars. Phil Washington has
done a wonderful job in bringing people together.
Director Walker asked if the CDOT commission has already
voted on this. Bill Van Meter stated that they have not, and
that RTD is trying to set a precedent and have made request
for DRCOG and CDOT to keep their money in the project.
Director Walker asked if they would need to vote. Marla Lien
stated that DRCOG has to vote, but by statue HPTE and CDOT
money needs to stay in the corridor. Director Walker stated
that it sounds that all the money allocated would stay in the
corridor. GM Washington stated that even though CDOT and
HPTE don’t have to go back to their boards, the staff
recommendations from all the agencies is consistent with
what the staff is asking tonight from our Board.
Director Solano stated that he knows there is a lot of dialogue
about rail versus BRT in the Northwest and wants to know

D. Updates

• I-225 Rail Line Update
Chuck Culig, Project Manager and Tina Jaquez from the PI Team stated that
this is the first time they provide an update since the approval. The I-225
Rail Line project includes a 10.5 mile light rail extension, starting at the
existing Nine Mile Station and adding 8 new stations. It serves the Aurora
City Center, Anschutz/Fitzsimons Campus and the new VA Hospital. It also
provides connectivity to East Rail Line at the Peoria Station and is expected
to open in 2016.
Tina stated that the project includes a Public Information and Outreach
component, which held a public meeting with over 150-200 attendees on
January 30th, covering several issues including CDOT widening. On March
1st they conducted the groundbreaking ceremony with over 250 attendees
and on March 22nd they held an elected officials briefing. Their next briefing
will be on June 14th. RTD message is what we are providing to the
community. Aurora provides information on how the city will look. They
have established a construction information line and email (720-863-8505, I225@rtd-fastracks.com) and have also created different panels that will be
displayed at the Aurora History Museum’s “Green revolution” exhibit from
April 9 to June 20.

how this would balance out. Bill Van Meter stated that this is
a follow through with the core commitment from all
stakeholders to complete the US36 BRT. This is not in
question included in the NAMS. The question is about the
Northwest Rail additional BRT beyond what is on the US36
North Metro extension. Director Solano asked if this means
that BRT is taking priority over the Northwest Mobility Study.
GM Washington stated that it is not, and that there is no
correlation between them. The US36 corridor is a standalone
project that has always been in the FasTracks plan and has no
link to extending BRT or rail in the North area.

They provided an overview of the construction process and schedule. RTD
and Aurora staff are reviewing design packages. The joint project with
CDOT is ongoing and they also coordinate with SEMA and Kiewit.
Construction will continue down the corridor. They’ve held several task
force meetings with all the different stakeholders with a lot of coordination
efforts for the Montview Station which would be located in the center of the
Anschutz/Fitzsimons Medical Campus. Staff is identifying properties that
will need to be acquired and going through the ROW process. Though start
dates and areas might change during the design process, they are working
under the following targets: Segment 1(9 Mile to Iliff Ave) and Area A: (Iliff
Ave to Exposition Ave) starting in the spring of 2013; Area C (2nd & Abilene
Station to South Toll Gate Bridge) and Area D (South Toll Gate Bridge to
North Toll Gate Bridge) in the summer of 2013. During the Fall of 2013
they expect to begin Areas B (Exposition Ave to 2nd & Abilene Station) and E
(Fitzsimmons Parkway) with the Areas G (Peoria St) and F (Montview Blvd)
by spring of 2014. All work is expected to be completed by October 2015
for RTD testing.
I-225 highway traffic shifts are planned for spring/summer phase 1c
estimated to begin in early May will shift SSB traffic to new SB pavement.
Phase 2 estimated to begin in late June.
Kiewit has provided several SBE opportunities, as of January they have 40
SBE subs with a $14 million commitment. The SBE goal for this project is
25.
Kiewit was also committed to about 30 WIN participants in the project
ranging from admin staff to control crew and engineering staff. They have
embraced that program. They are also requesting their subs to have this in
their contract.
Director Tobiassen commended the I-225 PI and project team for their hard
work, as well as the East Corridor team. Both teams have been stellar. He
thanked the CAC for supporting this project on the outreach activities. They
are working with the City of Aurora to unify the message. Sometimes it is a
struggle because of the many PI teams involved, but the project is moving
forward. There will be some challenges but the team is working very hard
to stay ahead.
Director Daly asked where the VA hospital is located from the station.
Chuck stated that it is west of I-225 and Colfax.

Director Folska agreed with Director Tobiassen and this is just a huge
enterprise and she knows that it will continue to be a lot of work. She
thinks that Tina’s numbers are low for the people they reached out. She
recalls a couple of events with almost 250 participants each. She asked if it
is possible to keep the display longer at the museum. Tina stated that she
will check with the museum. Director Folska asked if building a pedestrian
bridge over the Regata Plaza across Parker is something that we could do as
part of the joint project with the City of Aurora and if we can we put a
similar bridge to have access to the VA hospital. She also mentioned that
the Congressman Coffman is concerned and he would like his Chief of Staff
Dustin to attend the meetings with the VA. She wonders if a Tiger grant
would be something that can be used for that.
Director Bagley stated that he is excited to see that this corridor is moving
forward. Part of the reason that this corridor makes sense to be developed
was the economic development driven by the three new hospitals. It is
important to recognize that the area north of Colfax is all in Director
Deadwyler’s district.
Director Menten asked how does RTD deal with expansive soils such as
bentonite, and who is responsible. Chuck stated that the contractor is
responsible for that kind of elements. It is a problem in Colorado, but we
make the studies to try to avoid that. It is part of the contract and has a
one year warranty. Director Menten asked if one year covers very well and
if there have been issues in other lines. Chuck stated there has been some,
but they have asked Kiewit and they have come back and fix the problem.
After that, it is primary our staff’s job to provide maintenance and do proper
inspections.
Director Hoy stated that it is exciting to see it underway.

C. Updates

• Transit Oriented Development Update
Bill Sirois, TOD Planning Coordinator introduced the TOD team Kate Iverson,
TOD Manager and Patrick McLaughlin TOD Associate. He stated that the
pilot program was initiated at the end of 2010. Their TOD Annual Status
Reports will be coming out shortly covering all of the activities going on
around existing and planned stations from the development standpoint. The
report covers developments that are under construction or in process of
being approved at the local jurisdiction level. Staff uses this report as a
resource when trying to inform the community and help them understand
RTD goals.
The TOD program provides new Board members an overview and works
with local jurisdictions in planning issues. Over 40 stationary plans have
been developed since FasTracks was passed and the TOD staff has provided
input for those plans. They also provide support to the different corridors
like the I-225. They try to facilitate the implementation of TOD and how to
best integrate development with RTD station locations.
On March 1 they released a RFQ for a master development plan for Olde
Town Arvada Station. Staff has been working with the City of Arvada and
has several developers showing interest. They expect to have a developer
selected by mid-June.

With regard to the University of Denver garage and the retail space, they
have reached out to some subject matter experts in retail and commercial
development to look at how they would position that space and what we
can do as an agency to help. Once they have their input they will come
back to the Board with ideas.

Director Lubow asked how the TOD program matches up to what was
expected or what TOD does in general. She wonders if we have measured
our program against the existing statistics on increase for retail and
residential building. Bill Sirois stated that the report that will come out in a
week or two which covers the trends they have seen in the last couple of
years in terms of the levels of development. He clarified that though transit
does have an influence on development, it is not the only element’ there has
to be some other elements in place like market, vehicular access, etc. The
report also covers a lot of what has happened regionally. A section of the
report includes trends both at the regional and national levels in terms of
demographics, general building and where the market is going. At this point
apartments are hot and everybody is building multi-family apartments, in a
year from now demand could be for office space. There is an expectation
for TOD with FasTracks, staff is trying to follow those plans and see what
happens. For the TOD perspective it is going to take 50 years beyond
FasTracks to realize the full impact.
Director Folska asked who the SMA that provided the information with
regard to the retail space is. Bill Sirois stated that they contacted Larimer
Associates, Axio Commercial Real Estate and the Denver Housing Authority
to get a different perspective from a non-profit institution. Director Folska
asked if any of them were actual developers. Bill Sirois stated that Larimer
is a developer. Director Folska asked what the parking requirement is for
multi-family housing for the University Station specifically. Bill Sirois stated
that he thinks it allows up to 50% reduction in terms of parking, but he did
not have that information. Denver requirement is 1½ parking spaces per
unit. He will provide the information to Director Folska. Director Folska
asked if they have looked into facilitating mixed-used development. She
also asked if they have considered a cross-walk on the south side of the
parking structure at the Buchtel Station. Bill Sirois stated that they can talk
to the city as it is their purview. Staff can reach out to the city to look into
connections from an accessibility stand point.

On the I-225 they have initiated a process with the city to look at a TOD
market assessment. The city has expressed great interest in the 13th
Avenue Station where RTD owns 10 acres of property which will only
partially be needed for transit. They are trying to see if there is an
opportunity for development.

6.C

Chair Anderson stated that everybody in Arvada is very excited about what
is going on at Olde Town and appreciate what the RTD staff does.

Director Tobiassen stated that based on the different pilot projects that have
been a success and with opportunities for TOD projects on the 225 corridor,
he wonders if RTD has a potential site to influence development at 13th to
create a pilot program and some aggressive development. He knows the
city of Aurora is very interested in doing something at each station. Also, at
the Road Ahead Conference last week, there was a lot of discussion about
TOD and he suggested reaching out nationally since Denver has so much
potential. We can bring developers from around the world to move us to the
next level in development. Bill Sirois stated that last year we had a great
opportunity when the Urban Land Institute hosted its fall meeting here in
Denver. They brought 6,000 developers from around the world and
FasTracks was a big part of it. RTD had a lot of exposure, different staff
members were part of the different panels. RTD has also reached out to
developers in and out of Denver; we try to market ourselves as much as we
can. Director Tobiassen stated that he also mentioned the concept of a
Road Show, taking RTD along with other economic development partners
making presentations to bring that kind of investment to the region.
Director Hoy stated that about 9 months ago, there was a lot of activity
with regard to the Alameda Denver Design District. He was at the station
and it doesn’t look like anything has happened. Kate Iverson stated that a
large part of the Alameda project was attached to the City of Denver storm
water Pipe, that portion of the project came in slightly over the estimated
amount. The city and developer have been at the table and the city has
contributed an extra $3.8 million and anticipates breaking ground soon on
the storm water portion. Staff is meeting with them tomorrow to do some
initial coordination within the next month. They expect closing in Q3 of this
year and break ground shortly thereafter.
Director Daly thanked Bill for his presentation at Transit Solutions in
Glendale. He also thanked Director James for inviting the Board members to
the Road Ahead; he found the presentations very refreshing.

Director Walker stated that when the Denver Planning Board wrote the new
zoning code they were not trying to reduce for building close, they were
trying to get the zoning right so that a lot of guess work wouldn’t have to
be done. He thinks that the change was from 1 space per 300ft. to 1 space
per 500ft. They were trying to make it easy for developers to have an exact
number of parking spaces or square footage that they can have near a
transit station. He also thanked Bill Sirois for the comments that transit
itself is not the only element required to sprout development.

6.C

Director Walker stated that there are so many characteristics for each
project. These are conversations that are great to have; he likes the
enthusiasm folks have for Denver and TOD.
Director Bagley stated that with so many TOD opportunities, they are not on
our property; they surround our properties, which is why the Chambers of
Commerce and other entities need to promote them.
Director James thanked the staff for their presentation. He stated that the
job of the TOD staff is to be a catalyst for TOD to happen around the transit
stations we are developing so the communities can benefit more from our
development. There is a distinction between TOD and Transit Proximate
development, where you can be close to a station, but if it has not been
planned in advance, it won’t be a “place maker” where people want to go
and conveniently get there with seamless transition between modes of
transportation. He is pleased that RTD staff is doing a great job. The Board
needs to stay on track of what the staff is doing, they are trying to
encourage the different stakeholder to work together and have a plan for
each station. The Alameda station is a great example; with much work the
station is going to evolve, though it is a complex process. He also
mentioned that parking requirements are becoming less important, as they
are focusing in good design and have access to a location and it makes a
difference if you are close to a station. With regard to the strip malls, he
stated that it is a challenge to find people that can do the development, but
that also the lenders might be a constraint as there are different fronts to
operate. The Board has an opportunity to work with the staff to make this
happen. The Board needs to use all the resources available to encourage
good development to happen around or stations as early as it possibly can.
Director James thanked everybody for their participation.
Director Folska stated it is important that the different kinds of development
are used for TOD. She also mentioned that the reason multi-family rentals
are being developed is that financing is not available for owner occupied at
units for TOD. She thinks that the Board might want to consider the
DRCOG study for SB52 which hopefully will be submitted looking at liability
Packet Pg. 23

Director Bagley stated that what the TOD team has done is exemplary in
getting this off the ground. He also stated that every station with TOD
would be different, there would never be another Fitzsimmons, and TOD is
by itself something that depends on access, residential development and
other elements. In reference to the pilot programs, he hopes that staff
knows where they will go once the pilot programs are initiated. Every
corridor in the metro area is looking at what the TOD opportunities are and
that is why every community changes their comprehensive plans to grow
around the stations. He looks forward to seeing the report.

issues to encourage developers and financiers to build owner occupied units
at TODs.
Director James stated that Senate Bill 52 is an important piece of
legislations. Bill Sirois stated that they will be sending a memo to address
the real property with regard to the acquisition and disposition of property.
This will be sent to the Board this week.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Highlights and Updates Report
Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager for the Civil Rights Division stated that they
have had several great achievements in the WIN program. Martell Dyles,
acting WIN Program Manager reviewed a Power Point Presentation with the
Board that can be found in the April 9, 2013 Civil Rights Committee Agenda
Packet.
Kenn stated that they had shown the WIN participants’ perspective before
and now they wanted to provide the employer perspective of the benefits of
the WIN program. Mr. Martin C. Willie of Civil Technologies, a construction
management professional service firm, stated that they have worked in
different projects with RTD. To date, they have 7 employees out of the WIN
program and expect it to grow. They received incredible support from the
WIN project managers with ongoing professional development for the staff.
They also have support from two of their partners to make sure that 100%
of the I-225 staff comes from the WIN program. They applaud GM
Washington, the Board and staff for the vision and direction of the WIN
program.
Kenn stated the Small and Disadvantage Enterprise Advisory Council
(S/DBEAC) was created by an MOU. This group meets quarterly and has
approximately 50 people, of which 45 represent small business organizations
and minority contractors. Some of the businesses are already doing work
with RTD and others want to do business with RTD. They come together to
provide information about contracting opportunities that are available at

During the last Civil Rights Committee meeting staff recognized a number of
contractors that participated in the West Rail Line, such as Denver Transit
Construction Group, for doing such an outstanding job with all the DBEs
(over 200). They put together a trucker consortium to allow truckers to
participate on a rotating basis and they had more truckers that ever before.
They also recognized the internal staff that assisted with special programs.
Director Hoy asked if the Community College of Denver (CCD) is also
affiliated with Front Range Community Colleges and if it gets any bigger
than just CCD. Kenn stated that the CCD is one of the founding partners
while the Front Range Community College is one of the network partners.
Director Hoy asked Martin Willie what type of jobs they offer and how many
employees they have from the WIN program. Mr. Willie stated that they
have a total of 35 employees and 7 people have come from the WIN
program. He also mentioned that these employees range from
administration and field personnel to very technical positions such as
construction lab manager.
Director Folska commended Kenn for what they have done so far. She can
see that there is a tremendous impact in the communities. She asked how
many employees RTD has in the WIN program. Martell stated that there are
120 employees and that the project started with 25. They come from
different training providers, network and neighborhoods; there is a very good
pool of people. Director Folska commented that the average starting salary
looks great and asked what the range for the salaries is. Martell stated that
salaries range from $12.00 to $18.00 in some cases and that the FasTracks
projects start at $13.00 and move to $16.00. Director Folska asked if
aside from the capital infrastructure projects are there any plans to expand
to other types of jobs. Martell stated that they are looking to expanding
depending on the participants that come into the program. They are
creating career pathways so that people coming in have a starting and end
points. Director Folska stated that it would be a shame for the program to
go away when FasTracks is finished. We need to see how to keep the
program going past FasTracks. Kenn reminded them that RTD is also one of
the employers, and that is why the pathway program was created. They
started at rail operations, but there are many areas where they can go within

RTD. S/DBEAC helps increase relationships with RTD and provides notices
of upcoming opportunities in the corridors. S/DBEAC also provides
information about outreach in the community, as well as information on
courses on how to do business with RTD and how to get certified. It
includes collaboration with other entities. They have nominated a Co-Chair,
Ms. Helga Grunerud. She is with the Hispanic Contractors of Colorado. She
will be working with the S/DBEAC group to guide them to make sure they
provide good opportunities.

the career pathways. Director Folska mentioned that the veteran’s
administration might be a good source to help provide candidates.

Director Deadwyler thanked Kenn and the staff. She stated that we have
come a long way; they have done a wonderful job, though we still have a
long way to go. She knows that many people in the WIN project still have a
job, and she’s proud of the accomplishments.
Director Lubow commended the staff for the two programs; they are both
admirable in concept and execution.
Director Rivera-Malpiede invited the Board members to attend the DBEAC
meeting. It is a standing room only, and it is such a tremendous asset for
the community and the contractors trying to work with RTD. The Civil
Rights Division is focusing on communication, inclusionary and transparency.
She thanked the staff.

• RTD Subcontractor Performance Bond Program
Bob Medina and Jim Stadler were recognized for their efforts. Marla Lien
stated that the Subcontractor Performance Self-insured Program (SPSP) was
designed to get smaller subcontractor to participate in the RTD West Line
Project. RTD took a financial risk and it was 100% successful. The SPSP
will also be implemented in the I-225 corridor. She mentioned that payment
and performance bonds are required by statue for the Prime contractor but
not for lower tier contractors. Both the Prime and small tier contractors
mentioned that sometimes for the Prime contractors to get their bonds, they
would flow down the requirements to the smaller tier contractor; therefore,
some of the smallest contractors that did not have the history or were just
starting could not get into the project. RTD wanted to fix that and we did it
in a way that took some risk for RTD. Marla is happy to report that it was
successful; we did not lose any of the funds invested. RTD has a very good
history of self-insurance.
For new companies it can be hard to get those bonds. We developed the
program where we would say to the prime contractor that they could not
require the smaller subcontractor contractually to get the bonds. RTD could
not charge the subcontractor for the bonds; otherwise we would become an

GM Washington stated that with regard to the maintenance of the project,
the original idea was to tie the WIN program to the maintenance operation
piece. They are already talking to maintenance transit partners to think
about WIN candidates moving over from the construction side. Staff is also
to encourage companies doing transit oriented development to bring WIN
candidates.

6.D

Every contractor below the $500,000 level had to be in the pool. In the
end, the West Corridor is near completion and there have not been any
claims. They had 37 subcontractors in the program, 23 of them DBE
subcontractors. They had 13 new subcontractors to RTD and 9
subcontractors that had never qualified for a bond. The contract maximum
value increased to about $1 million with an estimated savings to RTD of
$243,681 compared to construction bonds. The fund will be rolled over to
I-225 and Kiewit has asked to be in the program.
Kenn stated that those subcontractors are all over Colorado and there are
some great stories.
Director Hoy asked if the risk for the SPSP has been minimized because of
the pool. Marla Lien stated that the risk was having to pay if any of the
contractors defaulted. The pool is still there and it rolls out to the next
project. The hope is that they will not have to pay. Director Hoy stated
that he understands that the risk doesn’t go away as there is always a
chance that we would need to pay.
Director Anderson commented that it is great that no one defaulted at the
West Corridor and asked if we have any recourse in case someone defaults.
Marla Lien stated that there is a bond, but we guarantee to the Prime that
they would have access to the fund. Director Anderson asked if the
qualification to be an SBE has changed. She remembers that if a company
had $775,000 in assets it didn’t qualified as an SBE. Kenn stated that it has
been increased to almost $1.2 million.

 ADA Program Update
Kenn stated that they are working on the development of this program.
They expect to have some more information by the May meeting. They are
working with the legal team and will come to the Board with updates.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley stated that the Board members should have received the Survey
Monkey last Friday, April 9 for the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee. He reported that 9 out of 15 have responded already.
The deadline to respond is April 19. He thanked those who responded.
Director Menten stated that she was present over the phone though she couldn’t
hear the Board members, only the presenters.

could claim against subcontractors. Staff developed the implementation
manual and a very robust program to qualify and monitor the SBE/DBEs.

B. Recommended Actions

• Adoption of 2014 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors adopt the attached 2014 Performance
Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 22 performance measures in total.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board Meeting on April 26,
2013.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter explained that the Board Report provided in the
April 2, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Packet highlights the proposed changes under the discussion
items. He stated that Jannette Scarpino was present to
answer any questions.
Jannette Scarpino explained that the Performance Measures
are set early in 2013 because staff incorporates them into our
2014 Adopted Budget. She stated that the first change is
average facilities maintenance complaints per month. This will
increase to < 14.0 from < 12.0 per month to reflect full year
revenue service on the West Line and actual experience with
West Line maintenance incidents to date. Jannette Scarpino
also stated that the second change is the customer complaints
per boardings. This will increase to .0004 from .0003 due to
a static higher level of complaints reached over the last 2-3
years from the strollers/wheelchairs policy, fare enforcement

campaign, TIC availability, the introduction of SmartCards, and
the new West Line which will bring with it additional
complaints.

Director Menten stated that we subsidize ridership a lot. She
is trying to determine how much we are actually getting from
riders who use the system. She is trying to understand why
we are going from 30% to 20%. Terry Howerter said that the
goal is being set based on the legislature; from there it is
strictly a calculation based on financial information and results.
He stated this is based on certain revenues; it excludes grants
and some of the variable revenues and brings in the operating
expenses. Terry Howerter explained that this Cost Recovery
Ratio does not impact any funds left over but it could reflect
that based on purely operating calculations.
Director Menten noted that in 2013 we have a goal of 0% for
an increase in EcoPass revenue and that the 2014 is not yet
available. She asked how many government bodies were
subsidizing the EcoPass versus private companies. Jannette
Scarpino explained that the EcoPass revenue has shown flat
growth so staff is not forecasting any growth for 2013 and
probably will not for 2014 either. Terry Howerter said that
staff does not have a breakdown of government riders versus
private riders immediately available but they will get Director
Menten the information.
Director Menten said she would be interested in that because
on the West Corridor she is facing regular riders who have not
been given much information on the schedule changes and
eliminated routes. She believes we would have a good way to
communicate with these people based on them having
EcoPasses.
Director Lasater highlighted that these Performance Measures
are for the entire District. He has recommended a subset for
the Measures that would be broken down by geographical
areas, route areas, etc. because it could be that we have 12
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten noted a 30% Operating Cost Recovery Ratio
in 2010 while just 20% is the proposed goal for 2014. She
asked if this was to meet a statute or because in the past we
were trying to put more money in the coffers. Jannette
Scarpino explained that the 2010 number is the actual
Recovery Ratio while the goal of 20% is set by a statute.

complaints but all 12 of those complaints are from the
Southwest line. Director Lasater shared that this happened in
his own District but now staff is working on it. He feels the
Board needs to see this in a geographical breakdown to get a
better handle on where the complaints are coming from.
Jannette Scarpino said that staff discussed his suggestion at
the Senior Leadership Team level. She stated that staff can
report numbers that Director Lasater might be looking for
offline but these Key Performance Indicators are for the Board
to measure District wide performance. At this time staff is
recommending that the Performance Measurers stay at that
level.
Director Folska stated that under Goal 6.2, Increase Ridership,
the proposed goal is still to be determined. She asked what
would need to happen for the goal to be set. Director Folska
noted that the Board is being asked to vote on this item
tonight only they do not have all the information. Jannette
Scarpino explained that the goal is derived from our 2014
Adopted Budget; the 2014 goal is just a placeholder at this
point. She said that once an appropriate goal is determined
staff will inform the Board. Terry Howerter said there are 4 or
5 goals that are determined as part of the 2014 Adopted
Budget. Staff is asking for this item to be sent to the full
Board meeting for approval so that the other goals can be
incorporated into the Budget. Terry Howerter stated that any
goals that would come out of the Budget would be presented
to the Board once they were determined.
General Manager Washington believes this particular goal is
unique because it is a strategic objective that came out of the
Advance. General Manager shared that at the April Study
Session he will be presenting to the Board the tactical plan to
reach the strategic goal of increased ridership. He explained
that staff is asking for approval or the overall Performance
Measures because it is very important that we get this passed
to move forward with the Budget. This is just a placeholder
and staff will come back to the board later in the year once
the remaining goals are determined.
Director Deadwyler asked if this would be brought back to the
Board for approval once the remaining numbers were
determined. General Manager Washington stated that this
would not come back for Board approval. He explained that
the idea is that staff will come back to the Board to discuss

6.E

Director Deadwyler highlighted that the increase in fare
revenue, the EcoPass revenue, and total operating revenue had
not yet been figured out. She is concerned when we talk
about increasing the fare revenue and EcoPass revenue.
Director Deadwyler knows many people whose companies
subsidize the EcoPass but they still pay a tremendous amount
of money. She feels there is nothing in the Board Report that
provides the Board with any indication what was the increase
in fare/EcoPass revenue would be. Terry Howerter explained
that Board approval would be required to change fares.
Director Deadwyler said that she is very concerned about the
stroller and wheelchair policy. This policy has not worked
since it was put into place. She is wondering what the plan is
to improve this area so that we do not need to increase our
Complaint per Boardings goal. General Manager Washington
stated that there is a reality factor that goes with opening a
new corridor; that reality factor is that we will likely have more
complaints on both the facility and customer side. He
explained that staff is proposing a slight increase in this area
because we are opening a new line; staff is not saying that we
are not going to strive to improve in this area. General
Manager said that we had the same experience with opening
T-Rex.
Director Lubow expressed concern over two of the goal 6
objectives: maintaining cost recovery ratios and improving
route efficiency. She noted that when Senior Leadership and
the Board had the advance Board priorities were identified, the
first of which was innovative and fiscally sustainable service
delivery. She had also asked for equitable but people felt that
was included in innovative. Director Lubow worries that if we
are only concerned with cost recovery ratios and improving
route efficiency that is not the same as tempering that with
being concerned about vulnerable populations. She asked how
these Performance Measures relates to the identified Board
priorities. Jannette Scarpino shared that the Board priorities
are addressed in the development of the 2014 Budget.
General Manager Washington explained that these
Performance Measures are in addition to the Board priorities.
Terry Howerter believes the goals more align with RTD’s

Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

the ridership goal but the overall Performance Measures will
have already been approved by the Board.

6.E

Chair Anderson asked what would happen if the Board did not
approve the Performance Measures. She wondered if staff
would need to present new Performance Measures to the
Board. Chair Anderson also commented that Goal 6.3 is
incorporating the increase in service that we think we will get
when the West Line opens; this is not from a fare increase but
an increase in fare revenue from increased ridership. Terry
Howerter stated that if the Performance Measures were not
approved staff would take the Board’s recommendations on
changes and present the Measures for approval at another
time. He also confirmed that the increase in fare revenue
would be from increased ridership unless the Board wanted to
increase fares. General Manager Washington stated that
increasing fares was not a staff recommendation.
Director Folska said that she is stuck on having goals listed as
“to be determined” in the Performance Measures the Board is
being asked to approve. She really wishes there was some
number in those categories. Director Folska noted that the
West Rail is opening April 26, 2013 and that these
Performance Measures are for 2014. She asked if staff really
anticipated an increase in customer complaints that long after
the line opened. Terry Howerter explained that they will look
at ridership numbers for 2013 and use that to extrapolate
ridership for 2014. Director Folska thinks this is a very
passive process. She believes if we develop an aggressive
campaign to increase ridership then we could say were going
to invest X amount of dollars to get Y amount of riders. Terry
Howerter said that this will be information presented by
General Manager Washington and Scott Reed during the April
Study Session. General Manager Washington stated that in
regards to complaints from the West Rail Line the answer is
yes that we will still be getting complaints a year from now.
Our history and experience with opening lines is that there are
going to be some things planned now that need to change; the
original condition will create complaints and then our fixes will
generate complaints.
Director James stated that what is being planned is an
increase of the goals to accommodate what we have
experienced the in past. He believes goals need to be
attainable otherwise they do not make any sense. He feels

Mission Statement and this is a way for us to measure our
customer satisfaction.

6.E

Director Sisk expressed that part of his concern with this is
that when there are goals he wants a way to measure the
goals. He said that as other Directors have accurately noted,
we do not have some goal numbers. He asked staff to look at
this differently going forward. He feels that these
Performance Measures are being looked at with some
trepidation because not all the goals are available. Terry
Howerter said that staff can take out the goals that are not
available next time and approve everything else.
Director Menten asked for numbers on people that were
moved from eliminated bus routes to light rail service. She
wants this information to be considered when we discuss
increased ridership. Terry Howerter explained that if someone
was moved from a bus to light rail service we would not see a
change in ridership; there may be a decrease in bus ridership
and an increase in light rail ridership. He said that it may be
difficult to obtain numbers on people riding the light rail
because their bus route was eliminated. There are many
factors that determine if someone begins riding the light rail.
Terry Howerter thought staff might be able to address this as
we move forward with smart media.
Director Solano stated that he supports this Recommended
Action. This is an exercise in probability. As you go into any
new venture there is going to be a margin of error. He
explained that as you narrow your margins, look at your
variables, and recalculate your probability then you can refine
your goals.

Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

this is a good way of managing these goals. If the
performance is unsatisfactory then the Board will be asked to
approve other variables to continue to pursue the goals in the
future. General Manager Washington added that staff updates
the Board quarterly on how RTD is doing in meeting the
Performance Measures. This allows us to look at a goal that is
not being met and focus on improving that area. General
Manager said that if we know we have an on time
performance issue and we know the where, then we can send
more supervisors to that area.

C. Updates

• Review of 2014-2019 SBP Development Process and 2014 Budget
Assumptions
Terry Howerter explained that this is an information item that is being
presented tonight.
Jannette Scarpino reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that
can be found in the April 9, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Hoy noted that sales tax revenues were up 2.8% in January but
that does not appear to be the way things are holding. He is wondering if
we are off on our projections for this year already. Terry Howerter stated
that February receipts just came in. He said that we are up 1.7% over last
February but Director Hoy is correct that January to February is down.

• February 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod handed out the most recent Sales Tax Report to the Board
that can be found in the April 9, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet.
Doug MacLeod noted that on the Dashboard there are some red categories.
He stated that ridership is down 4.4% versus February of last year and
down 2.9% for year-to-date. Doug MacLeod explained that there was one
less day in February this year due to Leap Year. Also, New Year’s Day fell
on a Tuesday whereas it fell on a Saturday and Sunday the previous years.
He believes these factors contributed to our decrease in ridership.
Doug MacLeod stated that fare revenue was up 0.5% for the month and
down 0.1% year-to-date. He said that with ridership being down the

Packet Pg. 38

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

6.E

percentage it was that would indicate about $550 thousand loss so we were
able to offset the loss with some additional revenues.

Doug MacLeod pointed out that the cash on hand has decreased by $118
million. He explained that on an annual basis we make a payment to Denver
Transit Partners for the Eagle P3 Project. He stated that payment went out
in January. He said that staff is keeping a close eye on cash but do not
expect any problems.
Doug MacLeod highlighted the line item that was added for the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) under the net position section. This is
where any dollars that are set aside from the Risk Allocation Matric (RAM)
for the FISA will be tracked.
Doug MacLeod said that $3 million has been added to the Board
appropriated and capital replacement fund.
Director Bagley stated that the increases in our actual Sales and Use Tax
collections could drop because of the Sequestration at the Federal level. He
noted that Sequestration really relates to Federal monies but it flows through
the entire economy. Director Bagley asked if this was taken into
consideration by CU Leeds when doing their forecasts. Doug MacLeod said
this was one of the factors they considered. At the time the forecast was
done there was an assumption that there would be an initial drop-off at the
beginning of the year.
Director Deadwyler noted that for operating expenses Doug MacLeod said
we were operating at 90 days cash. She asked where this information was
in the report for FasTracks because the Board approval of the RAM changed
this to 60 days. Doug MacLeod explained that FasTracks is different from
Base System because their operating costs are such a small proportion of
overall costs. He said that the operating expense balance is shown in the
net position section under the FISA line. That is the portion of cash that
cannot be spent so it stays there as a reserve. Terry Howerter explained
that next month when staff begins reporting on the FISA one month will be
moved from that line up to the FISA line.
Director Deadwyler asked about reducing the FasTracks Base System
funding by 1%. Terry Howerter stated that does not take effect until
January of 2014. At that time there will be a FISA amount growing on the
Base and a FISA amount growing on the FasTracks. He explained that there
Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 9, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Doug MacLeod shared that for Sales and Use Tax we were up 2.8% for
January and 1.6% for February. He explained that year-to-date that
averages out to 2.2% so we are right around what CU Leeds forecasted.

6.E

were certain items like our one time land sales that were identified to go into
Base and FasTracks. He offered to talk through this offline with Director
Deadwyler.

D. Other Matters
General Manager Washington informed the Board that Bill Holmes will be retiring.
He said that we are currently in the process of recruiting someone to fill his
positions. General Manager said that he does not think it will impact our audit
calendar but he will keep the Board informed.

B. Recommended Actions

• Donation of Vintage Rolling Stock
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes
Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs &
Interurban Railway.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to
move this to the full Board at the
April 16th, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety and
Security and Robin McIntosh, Senior Manager of Facilities
stated that in 2012 when they discussed the opportunity for
disposal of these vehicles, the Board had asked them to look
for other alternatives. They contacted different vendors and
the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation (PPHSRF)
has offered to accept all vehicles. PPHSRF has the funding
and resources to restore and operate the electric trolleys in
Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. The historical report is
attached to the Board packet.
Director James thanked staff for their effort to reach out to
other organizations. Director James also thanked Scott Reed
for agreeing to maximize the public relations value by making

Directors Daly and Menten were absent.

6.F

Director Lasater stated that he understands that we have
fiscal constraints, but he doesn’t like the idea of our history
going somewhere else. Though he understands there is a
huge cost for restoration, without one’s past we have no
future. We are selling off the past and he doesn’t like it. He
believes that RTD should preserve, promote and put those
vehicles where they can be seen. It can be done even if it is
done one car at a time. This is giving up previous
organizational history; the vehicles represent a phenomenal
background of how we got where we are today. He was not
here when they talked about this previously but he thinks that
we need to have passion about our history because it is
important for our future.
Director Folska agrees with Director Lasater that our history is
important. RTD is so energized and should embrace its
history. She mentioned that John Elias has a lot of knowledge
about this. The vehicles are not going to Dubai but Colorado
Springs. Director Folska did note there is a working trolley
that is probably owned by the Platte Valley Railroad over by
R.E.I. She does not want to see them go, but it is really
important to do something with the vehicles.
Director Deadwyler agrees with Director Lasater. She
remembers when the Board talked about this issue it was
agreed that we keep at least one piece so we could display it
to show where RTD has been and where we are going in the
future. She is surprised that staff is recommending sending all
of the vehicles to Colorado Springs.
Director Solano asked if we have considered the Golden Rail
Museum and the Forney Museum of Transportation that Henry
Stopplecamp had mentioned during Railroad 201 class. David
Genova responded that they did send letters to those
museums. The Platte Valley was interested in the vehicles but
do not have the resources to restore the cars. RTD Staff
advised them to contact the Colorado Spring Organization
when they are able to take any of the vehicles.
Director Bagley stated that he supports the action. The Board
spent a good amount of time going over this issue last year
and we need to do the right thing.

great deal of positive publicity out of this donation.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager stated that the report
is part of the Board Packet. They have worked with Via
Mobility Services on a Travel Training pilot program. There are
working with individuals with disabilities and helping them
understand which services are available as well as how to use
fixed route services in lieu of paratransit (Access-a-Ride)
services, which might help them improve their accessibility
and independence.

Director Tobiassen stated that he assisted with the restoration
of the trolley in Aurora. It was restored by volunteers and
contributions, and the association paid $1,500 a month to
store the trolley. Then once it was restored they had to find a
location to display it. He doesn’t think that we are losing our
heritage; these trollies need enormous amounts of restoration
work. If we find somebody that loves them it is great.

6.F

Staff issued an RFP for travel training services in February of
this year. After reviewing the responses received, staff
recommends awarding the contract to Via Mobility Services.

Director Sisk encouraged the Directors to go and see how Via
Mobility Services is training the people to use the services.
They are doing an amazing job with different companies and
people in the area. This is a state of the art program that is
well beyond anything we ever imagined.
Chair Anderson stated that the whole project is wonderful;
many people need to be independent and if we can help them,
then that should be our goal.
General Manager (GM) Washington stated that this will be a
part of the tactical plan to increase ridership.
Director Tobiassen mentioned that he has been working with
the Denver Regional Mobility and Access Council (DRMAC) in
a program to help people move from Access-a-Ride to
independent services. If we can help them use fixed routes
instead of Access-a-Ride that is great.

He thanked the Board and everybody at RTD. GM Washington stated that
for the employee day they have about 4,000 people that will be present.
This shows the great morale that our staff has. The VIP reception on
Thursday before opening is sold out. This is a big deal. He also mentioned
that the Governor will sign two bills at the Grand Opening. This was
requested by the Governor’s office. Also, the Conference of Minority
Officials Scholarship Banquet will be on Friday after the opening.

Director Folska stated that this is very exciting. Director Folska, Director
Tobiassen and Director Rivera-Malpiede had a private tour with Brenda
Tierney, who was amazing. She stated that the community at RTD is
remarkable.
Director Deadwyler stated that this is very exciting. She has received
requests from her family members to be part of the celebration. She
thanked the staff for bringing this project to completion.
Director James mentioned that this has been in construction for such a long
time. The business community is eagerly anticipating it and looking forward
to the economic growth. He asked who will operate the line. Austin stated
that the line will be operated by RTD personnel. The commuter rail transit
will be operated by PTO and RTD light rail personnel will operate I-225.
Director Bagley confirmed that that the Governor will be at the opening
signing the two bills.
Director Solano stated that this is good news for the North Metro. We can
now move forward to the North Metro. He wanted to know if there were
more passes available.
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that her community wanted her to say thank
you. This has made a tremendous change in the community. They are very
thankful for the re-alignment that was done as part of the project.

and Development Committee meeting and continue it at the May study session.
GM Washington stated that there has been a lot of activity on the surplus
properties; they have received requests for discounted prices or even to give the

April Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Anderson acknowledged Director Solano’s presence and stated to him that if
he has any questions or comments to please raise his hands and she would
recognize him.
Chair Anderson asked if there were any questions related to the April 16 Board
agenda. Director Bagley asked General Manager Washington about item B, US 36
Bus Rapid Transit-Use of Contingency Funds, under recommended action. General
Manager Washington explained there are three entities who are part of this
partnership: DRCOG, RTD and HPTE (CDOT). Under Phase 2, the RTD and
DRCOG leftover will be used for the purchase of BRT buses. CDOT plans to keep
their leftovers in the US 36 corridor but use the funds for structural rehab for
bridges, etc. between the US 36 corridor and DUS Station. In the first action
taken, it was silent relative to the use of any leftover funds so this action is to
define the use of those funds. Director Hoy added his understanding that there will
be concessionaire operating the toll road and this road will need to be turned over
to them in good working order. General Manager Washington indicated there is a
potential issue where some members of the US 36 Commuting Solutions want to
use the leftovers for transit demand solutions (TDM)that will go to the US 36
Commuting Solutions. RTD is clear in its position that these funds should be used

for the remaining commitment for FasTracks. DRCOG is amicable to how these
funds get used as long as there is total consensus for using these funds for buses.
Director Bagley inquired about the fund split. General Manager Washington stated
it is generally 1/3 for each of the partners. He also emphasized that these funds
would not be immediately available since the project will not be completed until
2015, and it is an unknown what contingencies, if any, may appear. Director Daly
inquired what was the proposed use of the funds by TDM and General Manager
Washington responded there are some nonprofit entities in the corridor who may
have a need.
Director Hoy stated that a key lesson for the future is to define the use of any
leftover funds upfront in the process from a partnership relationship.
Pertaining to item D, adoption of 2014 performance measures, General Manager
Washington indicated that staff will make it easier for the Board to understand by
incorporating this with the budget where the numbers should be available. Director
Walker commented that we really need a policy where the Board can be focused on
the policy and not necessarily the numbers.
Director Anderson stated there was mass confusion on the Board from the
discussion on the 2014 performance measure. Many of the Board members are
new and do not understand the budget process. Some of the discussion did not
need to happen. She would really like us to focus on the K.I.S.S. principle which
can reduce the confusion and misinterpretation of the measures. There was one
sentence in the report that was not clear and could have led the Board members to
believe there will be a fare increase. This needs to be simple to understand.
Director Daly commented on item C that Dave Genova had given him a copy of the
historical background on the vintage rolling stock.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to approve moving the April Board
agenda to the April 16 Board meeting.
Director Daly seconded the motion.

Introduction of Youth in Arts
Chair Anderson presented an idea that she had to get more youth involved in our
Board meetings by inviting them to come and showcase their talent to the Board.
She thought this might help to generate interest in transit by the youth as well as
mellow out the meetings. They would only come to the Board meetings periodically
and spend only a few minutes. The first group she is considering is called Sound

General Manager Washington expressed there need to be some tight criteria around
this program and what it is about. The Committee members stated they were in
support of this as a good PR effort but agreed that a policy with criteria should be
established.
Other Matters







Director Daly shared that constituents in his district had expressed concerns
over the change in route 116X which will be changing with the rollout of the
West Corridor. Many of the concern centers around the concept of the one
seat ride and now this route will feed into the Federal Center where they will
have to catch the light rail into downtown. There is concern over the fare
changing from express to regional which is a higher cost; there is also concern
that the bus will terminate at DUS in lower downtown versus at Civic Center
where most of the users need to connect. He has talked to our service-planning
department and has asked them to keep an eye on this for flexibility to change
should this have a negative impact on ridership. Director Hoy stated that he
had talked to a previous driver on this route who stated the ridership was not
there for this route.
Director Walker shared there is also a discussion on a route 14 which staff is
looking at and addressing some of the concerns of the constituents.
Director Hoy referenced the white paper on TOD and encouraged all the Board
members to read and become acquainted with the issues. He and Director
James are pushing for a plan to dispose of unused land. They are not concerned
about trying to sell the land cheap but that we are doing all we can to
effectively market the land. They are pushing for a strategy so that the buying
market will know what is for sale. Director Bagley added that the May or June
study session appears to be a good time to have a discussion on the TOD white
paper. Director Solano added that he has been in touch with a Newsflight
nonprofit group who are interested in the property in Ft. Lupton. They want an
opportunity to present their plan.
Director Bagley identified multiple items he had for discussion:
o Trip report-need a policy on every Board member doing a trip report
o Survey monkey-appreciates the response thus far from 11 of the 15 Board
members
o Board resolution 05, series of 2008 on Board operating conduct. Need to
review this item in a study session. Chair Anderson indicated she is
reviewing with everyone in the one-on-one’s and has asked for feedback
from them.

Hansen shared that this has been a long process of which he personally has been
involved. He has garnished a reputation for calling things as they are and there have
been times that he has been critical of the process. Nevertheless, he believes in giving
credit where credit is due and he applauds General Manager Washington and staff for
staying true to their word. General Manager Washington has been a constant force on
moving forward with getting the FasTracks project done. He is optimistic that we will
complete the project. The cities/counties that he represents, namely, Adams,
Northglenn and Thornton, are committed to moving this effort forward and are willing
to look at contributions over and above the 1% if necessary for the completion of the
North Metro. He thanked the Board for their consideration.
Bernard Celestin, current RTD employee, stated that he had joined the RTD family
about 4 years ago. He is running in Ward 2 for the City Council of Aurora. He has also
provided oversight for the Civil Service Commission and Human Relations Commission
in Aurora and has a history for being a strong advocate for the community and transit.
If elected, he will do whatever in his power to help make RTD successful.
Former Director William “Bill” McMullen spoke about two things: First, he
congratulated General Manager Washington and ATU President Julio Riviera for the
outstanding job they did on securing a five-year collective bargaining agreement. In his
8 years on the Board, the relationships between union and management have improved
and securing such an agreement is unprecedented. He is proud of the RTD leadership
and the Union relationship. Secondly, he commented to the new Board members on
their journey. He stated that it takes lots of energy and working together on this Board
to make those critical decisions to move the agency forward. He referenced the APTA
legislative conference in Washington that the Board members had just attended and
noted there is lots of work to be done. He encouraged them to ask many questions
and to learn everything that they could.
Gene Putman, Transportation Planner for Thornton, spoke to how disheartened he has
been especially over the amendment to DRCOG. However, he is very encouraged by
this unsolicited proposal and he believes we can work together to get the North Metro
completed. He asked RTD to look at the proposal favorably and he promised to do
everything in his power to get this done. He thanked General Manager Washington for
his efforts.
Amy Bennett from District N, shared that she is a daily commuter on route 116X. She
provided a petition from approximately 116 riders on this route of which 103 opposed
the proposed changes. She anticipates this will increase the travel time by about 15
minutes and that the fare cost will increase. She provided copies of these petitions
which can be found in the Board office and requested staff to consider the impact of
the proposed change to route 116X.
Martha Harvey, Englewood, stated that she had talked to the Board in an earlier
meeting where she expressed concerns on the lack of kiosks at the Auraria campus for
the disabled using the ramps. She stated that she had spoken to someone there who

Packet Pg. 55

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 26, 2013 7:30 PM (Approval of Regular Board Meeting Minutes of March 26, 2013)

8.A

had indicated power was a concern for the location she was indicating; however, she
sees the overhead electrical wiring for the trains so power must be available. She
believes not having kiosks located close to the handicap ramp creates an undue
hardship on the disabled. Chair Anderson indicated someone from staff would followup with her.

Chair's Report





Chair Anderson shared that the Board members had a very productive time at the
APTA Legislative conference in Washington D.C. from March 10-14.
Chair Anderson indicated that she attended a number of good sessions at this
conference including one on the transit ADA challenges and issues and how to comply
with the paratransit requirements. She noted that Director Dr. Claudia Folska has been
asked to serve on this transit ADA committee. She also indicated that she had
attended the PPP session where RTD continues to be recognized for having the only
transit PPP in the country. Chair Anderson recognized Director Walker for being
selected as the Region V APTA Transit Board Member Committee.
Chair Anderson shared that fourteen of the current Board members and two of the
former Board members participated in a tour of the West Corridor Rail Line. They were
very impressed with the work that has been done and how it has changed the
landscape for that area. We are looking forward to the grand opening.

XI.

On April 2nd, Larry Hoy and staff will host a tour of the North Metro for the Board and
approximately 10 elected officials in that area. With the recent announcement of the
technical merit for the unsolicited proposal, this may spark additional interest.
Chair Anderson indicated that she attended the Jefferson County All Starts Industry
Appreciation Awards where RTD was recognized for providing value- add to
transportation.
Chair Anderson attended the DRCOG Sustainable Communities Initiative Forum last
week. Mayor Murphy talked about lessons learned for the West Corridor.
Chair Anderson asked Director Bagley to read something from a book by Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor. In this book, Justice O’Connor spoke about the
judicial handshake that each member extends to each other as an act of professional
courtesy before the meeting begins. This creates decorum of professionalism and
signals an agreement that they will work together regardless of differences.

General Manager's Report



General Manager Washington shared they received only one response to the RFP for
the Downtown Denver Circulator (DDC) Vehicle Procurement. The staff is evaluating
this request and will look at other options such as piggybacking off an existing contract
if this does not prove feasible.
The Federal Transit Administration quarterly meeting was held March 21. During this
time they look at the projects that are federally funded. The meeting went well. The
big issue for RTD right now is the ASK that they took to the FTA administrator that
RTD receive the full $150M for the FFGA for 2013. The continuing resolution passed
and the FTA was given $1.8B for their distribution.
General Manager Washington and staff met with members of the City of Longmont
Council and Deputy City Managers. They discussed bus service and the northwest
mobility study.
On Thursday, RTD will present to the joint Transportation Committee at the State
Capitol on the innovative financial tools used for Eagle P3, DUS, etc.
RTD received the Unsolicited Proposal from Graham for the North Metro and
determined that it has technical merit. This being said, RTD will follow their process
for competitive bidding. They will accelerate the release of the RFP in July 2013 and
will move more aggressively to get it out. The proposal is confidential and conceptual
and RTD will treat it as such to protect the proposer. RTD has challenged the industry
and private sector for innovative funding solutions and they have responded
appropriately. They would like to leave room in the RFP for creative ideas.
Questions and comments from Board members:
Director Daly asked about what we might contribute the low response to for the
downtown circulator. General Manager Washington stated he does not know but
suspect that it may be due to the low number of vehicles we are asking for this

request. Manufacturers in this space would like to see a higher volume for their
efforts.
Director Sisk stated that he is excited about the technical merit of the unsolicited
proposal. He reflected on how hard the Metro Mayors that consisted of himself and
Erik Hansen at the time worked to get the passage of FasTracks in the 2003/4
timeframe. He asked for more information on Graham. General Manager Washington
stated this is a reputable Canadian firm.
Director Lubow offered her congratulations and asked if it was possible using the
creative options to extend this into Longmont and end of line. General Manager
Washington responded that he did not know and this would have to be looked at. He
wants to leave it open. He did state that it is possible that the RFP will be closed off
before the results of the Northwest Area Mobility Study are known.
Director James offered his congratulations on the technical merit of the unsolicited
proposal. He asked General Manager to speak to the issues of the downtown
circulator and the mall shuttles. General Manager Washington commented that it is
believed the mall shuttle is too slow for 17th Street or use for the downtown circulator;
however, it still may be feasible to piggyback off this contract and do a design that will
fit our needs. This needs to be explored.
Director Solano commented that this is great news. He is optimistic about the creative
financing and the possibility we could get the North Metro completed sooner.
Director Walker asked about potential issues if the RFP is moved up while the
Northwest Mobility study is still being complete. General Manager Washington
indicated they will keep an open mind and we do not want to muddy the waters right
now.
Director Hoy stated this is a good day and it is wonderful to hear the commitment from
Commissioner Hansen. This is a true spirit of cooperation. He asked General Manager
how long the RFP will remain open. General Manager Washington replied 60 days.
General Manager Washington commented that this has been a true team effort-the
RTD staff, stakeholders, regional support of the North and South and the private sector
who believes in RTD. He reflected on one of the reasons why private sector will invest
in public transportation has to do with the leadership and the perception that Board
support and staff commitment is strong. The private sector has been a huge partner
for RTD.

to riders in general. The communities feel their
comments are not listened to.
 Major service change policy-She believes the 25% is
too high for a major service change
 She will vote yes on this action.

Recommended Action
RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF UNIFORM SALES TAX
Chair Anderson called for a motion to approve the resolution No___ Series of 2013,
Resolution I support of Uniform Sales Tax
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the
resolution in support of Uniform Sales Tax.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Menten asked for clarification on the
procedure relative to calling a Special Board
meeting. Marla Lien, legal counsel stated that a
Special Board meeting can be called by the Chair
of the Board or by 3 Board members in writing.
A Special Board meeting must be noticed at
least 24 hours in advance and posted. This
specific Special Board meeting did meet this
requirement.
Director Walker noted a couple of typographical
errors which will be corrected before the
resolution is signed.
Director Daly stated his support and shared that
Eric Hansen had testified before the committee
in favor of this bill. He also stated that it passed
Committee 8-4.

Director Sisk thanked all of the Board members
for their support and stated his belief that this
bill will simplify and take the complexity out of
the sales tax process and allow RTD to get its
fair share. He stated that this bill is being
sponsored by Hullingshorst in the House and
Steadman in the Senate. He stated this
represents a true partnership. The question has
been asked of RTD “what can you do to help
yourself at home?” Well, this bill is one of those
things we are doing to help ourselves to
generate more funds.
Director Menten inquired about the authority to
dedicate the funding to the northwest. This is a
forever tax increase which does not sunset. It
will have a negative impact on people who are
already struggling. How do we determine where
this money is going and what is our priority?
General Manager Washington reminded the
Board that in December, they had approved the
Risk Allocation Matrix which identified 8 items
staff was looking at to move forward the build
out of FasTracks. This RAM identified 3 of the
items that are now stated in this resolution. The
Board authorized staff to pursue the Parity bill.
He stated that is how we can insure the funds
will be spent in the north by putting it in writing.
Staff will come back to the Board to award a
contract; what they have tried to do in this
resolution is to provide a level of flexibility that
will allow the market to be creative in their
approach to leveraging money.
Director Hoy stated that he testified before the
House Representative Committee. He perceived
a sense of fairness and this allows RTD and the
state to be aligned in how they collect sales tax.
He stated that the Downtown Denver Chamber
is in favor of this bill also.

Director Deadwyler stated she had many
challenges with this bill. We are relying on
politicians to tell us what to do when they do
not have a pulse on the community. When she
looks at her corridor in Five Points, she sees her
corridor being put last in this priority which
affects those transit dependent people who can
least afford it. We are wanting to impose taxes
and we need to re-consider this position. She
took the north tour this afternoon and what
struck her were the farmlands, scarcity and lack
of population density along this corridor. If
density is one of the factors that we look at, she
does not understand why this corridor has
moved up in priority. We need to be thinking
more clearly in terms of equity. The African
American community continues to be left behind
and taken advantage of because they have no
voice in these type of decisions being made.
She cannot support this resolution.
Director Daly pointed out that this bill just
extends to candy and pop. It does not affect
things more substantive or life blood.
Chair Anderson stated her support for this
uniform sales tax resolution. She believes it is
more uniform for the small mom & pop
businesses who can now complete one form for
taxes versus the different ones they are
currently providing.

Chair Anderson shared that she had attended the WIN media event that morning
and congratulated Director Deadwyler and Rivera-Malpiede for their role in
promoting this program.
Chair Anderson shared that Director Folska has been selected as one of the 12
Colorado Women of Influence by the Denver Post. The Board extends its
congratulations to Director Folska.
Director Bagley stated that he also attended the WIN event. What was
impressive to him is the number of staff and media who were involved in this
event. What he thinks is important as a major part of FasTracks is being an
economic development engine for this region that also impacts the full Front
Range, state and other states in proximity to Colorado. We are putting people
to work and they are getting jobs.
Director Bagley stated that as he makes presentations in various communities
(i.e. Highlands Ranch, St. Andrews, etc) he includes a slide in his presentation
about the WIN program and how this program is in partnership with other
employers in this area.
Director Lubow wanted to underscore that Director Folska was honored in the
Denver Post. She felt this was a great honor for Director Folska and RTD and
asked if staff might consider doing a press release.
Director Menten referenced the polling by the Board office on changing the start
time for meeting from 5:30 to 5:00 p.m. She stated that she was not in favor
as a number of her constituents work from 8-5 p.m. and would not be able to
get here. She estimates that for every 1 person who speaks at public
participation, there are another 20 who could not get here but had something
they would like to say. She believes this will create an unnecessary hardship
for our constituents.
Paula Perdue shared that of the 8 Directors who had responded, 2 had stated
they were OK with the time change but indicated some concerns and 1 had
indicated not in favor. The others were good for the change.

Subject:

Access-a-Ride Travel Training Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into a contract with Via Mobility Services for the provision of
Travel Training services. Performance under the contract is for a three (3) year period and the total
contract amount shall not exceed $396,288.00.

BACKGROUND
Several years ago, RTD received an FTA New Freedom grant to, among other things, develop a Travel
Training Program. The program, designed to travel train individuals with disabilities, was to be a catalyst
for motivating individuals to use fixed route services in lieu of ADA paratransit (Access-a-Ride) service.
RTD collaborated with Via Mobility Services (formerly known as Special Transit), an established RTD
paratransit service provider and nationally recognized as a travel training pioneer, to provide travel
training services during an experimental phase in order to assess travel training as a feasible service
offered by the District. It was staff’s intention to work with Via for a short duration in order to build a
program worthy of releasing a Request for Proposals with viable and defined requirements. Having
never provided travel training as a service, staff was initially unable to craft an RFP with sufficient data
allowing companies to intelligently bid on such a proposal.
In April 2010, Via commenced travel training services to a select group of paratransit passengers.
Focusing their attention on individuals with cognitive challenges offered Via a controlled environment in
which they could accurately measure training outcomes. Unfortunately, this group failed to yield a high
number of participants partly due to safety concerns raised by family members. As a result, an
insufficient number of travel training candidates meant staff was unable to gauge whether the program
was a success or failure. Believing in the concept of travel training, Via was asked to continue their
efforts, but this time, using a larger passenger base. Starting in April 2011, Via focused their attention
on any Access-a-Ride eligible passenger and sought the assistance of our eligibility contractor, Easter
Seals of Colorado, to identify travel training candidates during the initial phase of the eligibility
assessment process. The combined efforts of Via and Easter Seals resulted in a more positive return
and Via was able to average 5-8 trainings per month. As a result, staff determined that it would be
appropriate to prepare an official Request for Proposal (RFP) so that established procurement protocols
could be followed and a comprehensive travel training program could be implemented.

DISCUSSION
On February 11, 2013, RTD issued RFP 13-DH-003 for travel training services. Two responses were
received in response to the RFP for travel training services. The Proposers were Via Mobility
Services and Medical Transportation Management (MTM).

Packet Pg. 71

12.A

The evaluation team formed to evaluate the RFP responses consisted of Larry Buter, Manager of
Paratransit Services; Carol Coe, Paratransit Services Coordinator; and Carolyn Conover, Sr. Manager
of Contracted Services. The evaluation team reviewed the RFP responses according to the
evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement, which were:
a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%), b) experience/qualifications and
safety record (35%), and c) price (30%).
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the
two proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the
evaluative criteria and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for “Experience and
Qualifications.” The score for the “Price” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of each proposal to determine the
overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in Via Mobility being the
highest rated proposal. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that Via Mobility presented the
best proposal in terms of understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed
organization/business plan/approach to deliver the requested service, and proposed price.
Overall, both proposals were similar with regard to the understanding of the project and the proposed
operational plan, as detailed in the RFP scope of services. The Via Mobility proposal included a
unique approach for identifying prospective trainees which included placing one of their staff
members at the Access-a-Ride Eligibility Center in order to make contact with and promote travel
training to new paratransit passengers. The evaluation team identified a key weakness of the MTM
proposal was that MTM was not able to identify the local management and training staff that would
be responsible for the day-to-day operations.
Both cost proposals provided a similar hourly training rate; however, the fixed-cost component of the
MTM proposal was over two times higher than the Via Mobility proposal. The total cost for the
three-year contract period proposed by MTM was $589,896.00 compared to $396,288.00 proposed
by Via Mobility. Therefore, it is the recommendation of the evaluation team that RTD award the
travel training contract to Via Mobility Services.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for 2013 are included in the adopted 2013 RTD budget.
subject to Board budget approvals.

Funds for subsequent years are

ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to Via Mobility Services, as recommended.
2)
Resolicit the travel training service package. This is not recommended as this would delay the
implementation of this program and have a negative impact on the momentum and positive
results Via was beginning to realize.
3)
Do not award the contract and do not resolicit. This is not recommended as RTD would
forfeit the New Freedom Funds set aside for this project. In addition, RTD would not have a
program in place to provide assistance for Access-a-Ride passengers that want to learn to use
fixed-route service.

Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

BACKGROUND
On August 23, 2011 the RTD Board of Directors authorized funding in the amount of $120 million for
Phase I of CDOT’s Managed Lanes project, which extends from the current High Occupancy Vehicle
lanes ending at approximately US 36 and Pecos to approximately US 36 and Broomfield between
Flatirons and 88th Street in Louisville. On July 24, 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an
additional $15 million for CDOT’s Phase II project, which will extend from 88th Street to Table Mesa.
The Board Report for Phase II funding included the following language, “Should less than $15 million be
required by HPTE to complete the second phase of the project, RTD staff has requested and remains
firm in the conviction that HPTE should reduce RTD’s commitment – prior to that of any of the other
funding partners. In this case, RTD would reprogram any remaining funds into additional BRT
improvements in the corridor.”
DISCUSSION
HPTE and CDOT have advised RTD that the completion of Phase II will require the use of contingency
funds remaining from Phase I, and CDOT and HPTE have requested that RTD authorize the use of
remaining Phase I funds for Phase II. In light of that request and assuming it is authorized by the RTD
Board of Directors, CDOT, RTD and HPTE have developed a proposed framework to allocate any funds
remaining after Phase II is complete. CDOT will use its funds for the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes,
which includes capital rehabilitation of I-25 High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes structures on the segment
between US 36 and Denver Union Station on which the majority of US 36 BRT services will operate.
The rehabilitation of these structures will be included in the total cost of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. The three entities propose that any funds remaining after cost of construction of the entire
Project (Phase I, Phase II, and I-25 HOT lanes structure rehabilitation) will be spent by all parties, for
additional elements to enhance/build out the I-25 and US 36 Managed Lanes and BRT.
CDOT would not use any of its remaining Project funds (other than Bridge Enterprise Funds that are
statutorily restricted) except on projects selected, with RTD concurrence, within the US 36 and I-25
corridors. RTD would use its share of remaining funds solely on BRT vehicle acquisition. DRCOG will be

Packet Pg. 74

13.B

asked to commit that any remaining grant funds it has provided to the project remain in the corridor and
be allocated to RTD for BRT vehicle acquisition. HPTE will use all funds (not including shared toll
revenues which may be received by HPTE in the future and which are in any event subject to
expenditure approval by RTD) in the corridor for maintenance and capital reserve or any remaining capital
infrastructure needed for BRT that can be implemented under CDOT/HPTE’s authority.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact resulting from the recommended action, because RTD has already authorized
the full $135 million to CDOT/HPTE for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors modify the formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012
concerning RTD funding provided to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) and the
Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise (HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. Specifically, it is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be used for
acquisition of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicles for the corridor.

2. Do not approve the modifications to how RTD funding may be applied to the US 36 Managed Lanes
Project. This action is not recommended. The requested use of Phase I remaining funds to complete
Phase II of the US 36 Managed Lanes project, when combined with available grant funds and funds from
other parties, will allow the completion of the managed lanes to Table Mesa, thereby completing the
primary capital improvements required to achieve BRT in the US 36 Corridor.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 4, 2013

From:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

April 4, 2013

Board Meeting Date: April 16, 2013

Subject:

Donation of Vintage Rolling Stock

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to
the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
BACKGROUND
Over the past few decades RTD has taken possession of seven vintage trolleys and buses. RTD has never
restored them or put them in service. They have been moved several times and are currently stored at the
Weston property adjacent to District Shops. With no long-term plan for restoration or use, a constrained
budget, and limited RTD property for storage, the opportunity for disposal was considered in the fall of 2012.
The inventory of vehicles consists of the following: Denver Tramway Streetcars 107 & 329, Denver Tramway
Electric Trolley 519 & 553, British Bristol Double-decker Bus, and two Mack buses numbers 132 and 140. Two
of the vehicles are being stored in a building scheduled to be demolished later this year.
In summer of 2012, RTD received a letter from the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation stating
their desire to receive the vehicles, restore them and place them for display. The Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1982 and has a primary mission of
restoration and operation of electric trolleys in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs. Over the years, several
organizations have expressed interest in acquisition of some of the vehicles. All previous offers have not been
pursued due to a lack of funding and resources. This is the first organization that has offered to accept all
vehicles and has adequate funding and resources to do so.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vehicles be donated
to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation. The Board asked staff to review possible local and
regional opportunities to keep the vehicles in the Denver area, and to gather information on the historical use of
the vehicles. RTD staff developed an advertisement method, described below under Discussion, and compiled
a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of these vehicles was a Request for Expression of Interest and Information
(REFII). REFII 12 JB-004 was issued on 09/24/12 and copies of the REFII were provided to 18 prospective
vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency. The vendor list was:

Advertisement was closed on 10/12/12 with only one proposal received from the Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
On 11/01/12 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Pikes Peak Proposal more than qualifies them for the project of the removal, restoration and transit use
or display of these vintage vehicles.
Pikes Peak is willing to accept all the vehicles listed in the advertisement.
Pikes Peak funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Pikes Peak will show credit to RTD by restoring one of the trolleys for display with reference to “RTDTramway”.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars with removal, restoration, and display of the vehicles
to be the responsibility of the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation. The Pikes Peak Historical
Street Railway Foundation is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1982 and has a primary mission of
restoration and operation of electric trolleys in Colorado Springs and Manitou Springs.
DBE INVOLVEMENT
Not applicable for transfer of ownership.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage
trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation,
(dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
donate seven vintage trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street
Railway Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway. Instead, continue to store the
vehicles within the Weston property. This alternative is not recommended as RTD has no long-term
plan or budget for restoration or reuse. In addition, the Weston property is being reduced in size to
accommodate new track installation for FasTracks, and a building in which two of the vehicles are
stored needs to be demolished to comply with building codes.

Introduction ............................................................................................................................................................................... 3

13.C.a

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in 1969 by the Colorado General Assembly
to provide eight counties in the greater Denver area with bus and light rail transit. The agency’s
history is integrally linked to Denver’s economic and physical development, and its vintage rolling
stock is an iconic representation of that history. Over the past few decades, RTD has acquired seven
vintage trolley cars and buses that are currently stored at the Weston District maintenance and
storage facility. The inventory consists of two Denver Tramway Streetcars (nos. 117 and 329), two
Denver Electric Trolley Buses (nos. 519 and 553), a British Bristol Double‐decker Bus, and two
Mack buses (nos. 132 and 140).
With no long‐term plan for use or restoration of the stored vehicles, a constrained budget, and
limited RTD storage space, the option of disposal became imminent. In view of these
circumstances, the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway Foundation has initiated interest in
restoring and displaying the vehicles; the RTD Board of Directors is evaluating donating the stock to
the foundation for these purposes. This report serves as documentation of the history of the seven
vintage vehicles remaining in RTD’s inventory.

Documentation and Report Methodology
To understand and convey the significance of the vintage rolling stock, a historic context was
developed within which the RTD and its vintage vehicles could be understood. Historic contexts
provide a framework for identifying and evaluating historic resources through the focused
explanation of important aspects of geography, history, and culture which significantly shape the
development of a community’s or region’s land use patterns and built environment over time.
A literature review was conducted to begin establishing the historic context for the agency and its
vintage vehicles. Information was obtained from the RTD, Denver Tramway Heritage Society, the
Colorado Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation’s (OAHP) Compass database, archives at
History Colorado and the Western Historic and Genealogy Room at the Denver Public Library, and
historic newspaper databases.
After a context was developed, fieldwork was conducted including photographic and written
documentation of RTD’s vintage historic rolling stock resources. Historic photographs, schematics,
newspaper articles, and other relevant documentation were compiled. One major research gap was
identified during the research and documentation process: primary resources were not identified
for the British double‐decker bus. An interview with a former RTD employee lent some insight into
this particular vehicle, as documented below, and secondary resources helped complete the history;
however, further interviews with additional RTD employees/retirees could prove beneficial in
filling in identified gaps.

RTD Vintage Rolling Stock Historic Context
The story of RTD’s vintage rolling stock is the story of transportation in Denver beginning with
cable operation, converting to electricity, and finally transitioning to gasoline power. The entire
Denver streetcar railway system has been determined officially eligible for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (site number 5DV.9217 ‐ Denver Street Car/Tramway) under
Criterion A. The Denver streetcar railway system played an extremely important role in the early

Introduction

13.C.a

In 1871, the Denver City Railway Company began providing horse‐drawn streetcars for
transportation. Around 1890, after enough tracks had been laid, the company began operating
cable car (also called street car) service. Meanwhile, a competing group called the Denver Tramway
Company (DTC) formed to offer additional animal‐ and cable‐powered cars, and also began
studying electric‐powered transportation. Miles of tracks were laid by both companies during this
time. By 1900, the DTC began converting its cable lines to electric operation using the overhead
trolley system, and in 1901 the Tramway Power facility opened to begin operation. When
electrification was completed, cable cars became surplus. Some were converted for electric
operation and those that were not were burned to salvage metal parts.

Figure 1: Drivers in front of streetcars, circa 1920. Courtesy, History Colorado (Scan #10041590).

In 1893, General Electric introduced a control mechanism for street cars known as the type‐K
controller, which so greatly improved the electric car that most American cities with cable systems
converted to electricity within the first four years of availability. DTC was one of the first firms to
electrify (Hilton 1967, 48). Eventually, the DTC consolidated with its rival companies and formed
the Denver City Tramway Company, which now owned the entire 156 miles of city railway system.
The street cars inherited the cable car’s 3’6” gauge. The South Broadway line was the first
electrified trolley car line to operate in Denver. It continued in operation from December 1889 to
June 1950. In 1909, DTC purchased the Denver and Intermountain Railroad and converted it from
steam to electric power, providing another route to Golden, Colo. (one had already been

transportation history of Denver as it facilitated the development of the urban center and of
suburban neighborhoods by allowing residents an inexpensive way to travel.

13.C.a

In 1919 buses slowly began service. Streetcars were replaced with trolley coaches (buses operated
by overhead electric lines) and the cars were in operation by June 1, 1940. Thirty‐six trolley
coaches replaced street cars on four important lines and showed revenue gains of twenty per cent.
More were ordered through 1942
(http://www.trolleybuses.net/den/htm/usa_h_den_misc_ad_ob_trolleycoachesfit_194507_bt.htm).

After WWII, personal automobile sales increased dramatically, and in 1950 streetcar service—both
cable and electric—ended. Tracks were covered under asphalt to convert routes to automobile and
bus traffic use (Jacobs Engineering 2008). In June 1950 the DTC completed the conversion from rail
to rubber‐tire transit with the purchase of approximately 450 trolley coaches, diesel motor coaches
and gasoline buses. The reasons for moving to “rubber transit” were that trolley coaches provided
curbside stops; the system relieved traffic congestion because of the greater maneuverability of the
equipment; and the coaches were quieter in general. These electric buses, which did not require
tracks, operated until 1955, when the DTC announced that diesel buses would replace all electric
coaches (Jones, McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest 1965), reasons for which included lower costs
associated with diesel vehicles, and also the conversion of several major downtown streets to one‐
way.

established) as well as a branch line to Barnum (Lusky 1968). Peak performance for the electric
streetcars was during the period between WWI and the end of WWII.

In 1971 remnants of the DTC were sold to the City of Denver, and in 1974 the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) was created. In 1994 light rail began service. All that remains of the
Denver Tramway rail system is the standard gauge line of the one‐time Denver and Intermountain
Railroad to the Denver Federal Center near Lakewood. This line is currently under construction to
serve as the new light rail West line.

Denver Tramway Streetcars were built in the early twentieth century after the conversion from
cable to electricity and often called “big yellows”. These cars rode on tracks, like railroad and cable
cars, but were operated with electricity via a pole connected to electric overhead lines. Many were
furnished with rattan seating; a copy of As U‐Go, published by the DTC, was slipped into the black
containers of the streetcar interiors, providing transit information. Peak performance for the
electric streetcar was during the period between WWI and the end of WWII. Operation ended June
4, 1950 (Lusky 1968).
While the DTC built some of its streetcars, most were built by the Woeber Carriage Company of
Denver (“Woeber Brothers”) which was founded in Iowa in 1853. In 1867, a Woeber Bros. shop
was opened in Denver on 11th Street. Between 1898 and 1913, Woeber built all of Denver’s
streetcars (http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/woeberbros.htm).
Woeber was responsible for the invention of the unique center‐entrance electric trolley, whereby
two single‐truck bodies were merged on one double‐truck frame. The process involved mounting
the body of a single‐truck closed streetcar on one end of a 39‐foot frame and the body of a single‐
truck open streetcar on the other. A center entrance was constructed between the two. Using
single‐truck cars that were outdated, but not inoperable, solved the problem of financing newer,
larger, and expensive double‐truck cars. These center‐entrance cars rode on a pair of Brill 27‐
General Electric (GE) motor trucks. Some operated as late as 1920
(http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/woeberbros.htm). Later these cars were
fully enclosed (Jones, McKeever, Wagner and Forrest 1965).

Figure 4: Center entrance on car no. 117.

Two examples of Denver Tramway’s streetcars from the period after the conversion from cable to
electricity are located at an RTD storage facility ‐‐ streetcars No. 117 and 239. Car no. 117 was built
in 1911 by Woeber Bros. (Robertson and Forrest 2010) at West Colorado Ave. and South Bannock
Street (Figures 3 through 6). It was a Denver Tramway City (DTC) car with a 47‐passenger
capacity, weighing 38,300 lbs (Jones, McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest 1965). It is a narrow gauge,
double truck car with four K36G controller–K type engines. These were a direct drum type
controller with the voltage passing directly through copper and brass fingers pressing against a
rotating drum; K‐36 controllers were usually used with Interpole traction motors. The 117 has a
GE 58 motor with 37.5 horsepower, weighing 2,225 lbs and a Brill 27G truck with a 4’ 0” wheel
base. It was a two‐man car, with a motor man up front and a conductor in the middle. The car
could seat 47, but would allow for 90 with standing room. Seats were made of stationary rattan and
oak slat. The roof was a monitor roof, with windows on either side of the roofline. Car windows
featured drop sashes. Other specifics include a total horsepower of 150; a gear ratio of 1:3.94; track
gauge of 3’‐6”; and Type A1 Form 2 Tomlinson couplers (Robertson and Forrest 2010).
The car ran the Englewood route which travelled along South Broadway Avenue (two‐man cars
were limited to Broadway Avenue). It was sold in 1947 to a private owner who used it as a fishing
cabin, and then in 1975 was donated to James E. Kunkle, a former RTD employee and RTD historian.
Kunkle, in turn, donated the car back to RTD, and brought it to the Alameda Division for restoration
for the next two years. Kunkle restored the bus to mint condition, seeking out over one hundred
abandoned trolley cars around Colorado to gather seats and other materials for Car no. 117. It was
pulled for the next five years in downtown parades. According to Kunkle, earlier directors of RTD
promised him they would place the car inside the new RTD Headquarters building at 1600 Blake
Street and then place it in the new Civic Center building at Colfax and Broadway – neither of which
happened. The car is currently in poor condition.

Car #329 was built in 1910, also by Woeber Bros., with a capacity of 47 and weighing 35,350 lbs. It
has two K35B controller engines which operated the same as the K36G above. It has a GE218A
motor with 60 horsepower, weighing 3,000 lbs, and a Brill 27GE1 truck with a 4’ 6” wheelbase. It
was a single‐end, center‐entrance P.A.Y.E. (pay‐as‐you‐enter), Passenger Moter and travelled the
narrow‐gauge city route, which could be different every day. It was sold for scrap between 1949
and 1950 (Robertson and Forrest 2010). The car is in very poor condition.

Electric trolleys (also called “trolley coaches” and “trackless trolleys”) were a hybrid of rubber‐tire
operation and electric overhead operation. In 1930, the number of trolley cars in use in the United
States tripled from 58 to 174 (Brill 2001). Operation began by the DTC on June 1, 1940 when 36
trolley coaches replaced street cars on four important lines and showed revenue gains of 20 per
cent. More were ordered through 1942
(http://www.trolleybuses.net/den/htm/usa_h_den_misc_ad_ob_trolleycoachesfit_194507_bt.htm).
“Rubber transit” provided curbside stops; a system which relieved traffic congestion because of the
greater maneuverability of the equipment; and a quieter system in general. According to Jones,
McKeever, Wagner, and Forrest, the electric trolley coaches were the backbone of the routes after
the streetcars ended service and were busy day and night with standing room only on trips to and
from downtown.
The RDT has two of the rubber‐tire trolley coaches in storage. Trolley coach no. 519 was a Brill‐
Westinghouse (WH), model no. 44SMT (44‐seat capacity) built in 1940. Like streetcar no. 117, this
trolley car was restored by James Kunkle and is the only one left intact from the Denver fleet that
was in service from April 1940‐1955. It was placed on display at the Denver Union Station for
Transportation Week along with the DTC trolley car 117.
Trolley coach nos. 501 to 592 (including 510 and 553) operated out of the Central Division and
were used for the following routes: Route 5 – Berkeley to South Gaylord; Route 11 – E. 11th Ave. to
W. 29th Ave.; Route 13 – E. 13th Ave. to W. 39th Ave.; Route 28 – E. 28th Ave. to W. 44th Ave.; and
Route 40 – Park Hill. The electric buses were put out of circulation by diesel buses in 1950.

Trolley coach no. 553 was a Brill‐GE, model no. 44SMT, built in 1942. J. G. Brill Company was an
American manufacturer of streetcars and buses founded by John George Brill in 1868 as a horse car
manufacturing firm in Philadelphia, Penn. It merged with the American Car and Foundry Company
in 1944 to become ACF‐Brill and ceased production in 1954 (Brill 2001). The company produced
over 45,000 streetcars, motor buses, trolleybuses, and railroad cars.

In forty odd years of DTC bus operation, in excess of 1,000 different buses have been operated.
Mack is an American truck, bus, and trolley bus manufacturing company founded in 1900 in
Macungie, Penn., where all Mack products are made (the company has assembly plants in
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Australia, and Venezuela). Mack was one of the first manufacturers to
mount a cab directly over the engine, which increased driver visibility and maneuverability,
particularly on crowded city streets (“Mack History”). The first Mack bus was built in 1900,
ordered by a sightseeing company. In 1934, production of electric trolley coach buses began,
ending in 1943 with a total of only 290 built, Portland, Oregon being the biggest customer (“Mack
Trucks”).
Mack bus production began in the late 1920s and ended in 1960, producing over 22,000 units
(Eckhart 2000). Buses were typically run until their useful life was complete and then scrapped;
relatively few have been restored or preserved (Eckhart 2000); however, the RTD has two Mack
busses in storage. Mack buses 132 and 140 were C‐47‐DT models built in 1959 (Forrest 1969, 15)
with a seating capacity of 45, a length of 35 feet and a width of 102 inches. According to Kunkle,
Bus 140 served as an information and promotional bus when RTD took over Denver Metro Transit
in 1975. The bus was emptied of its seats and installed with racks for brochures, schedules, and
other RTD information. The driver would take it to park‐n‐ride stations and serve coffee and
doughnuts to customers. Only senior drivers were able to operate this route.

The Bristol Lodekka was a low‐height double‐decker bus built by Bristol Commercial Vehicles of
England. This bus was a revolutionary design because of its low floor. A low chassis design
removed the need for a step up from curb level to the entrance platform. This allowed for an
overall lower height at around 13 ft 6 in compared to a typical height of around 14 ft 6 in for a
conventional highbridge double‐decker. Bristol manufactured over 5,200 Lodekkas between 1949
and 1968. These busses were only available to nationalized bus companies.
The RDT stores a Bristol Lodekka LD (low decker) series with chassis number LD6G 100127, body
serial no. ECW 7067 Series 2, and a Gardner 6LW engine (http://bcv.robsly.com/lodsvocl.html). It
features the traditional rear entrance and half cab
(http://classicbristolbuses.thornet.co.uk/lodekka.htm.) It appears to have been built in 1954 and
was part of the Southern Vectis Omnibus Company fleet which served on the Isle of Wight in
England. In 1976 it was sold or donated to government in Williamsburg, VA, for use in bicentenary
celebrations. Around 1987, the bus was parked at Denver’s 16th Street Shopping Mall and used as
the “Ticket Bus” for theater and transport tickets and as a tourist information bureau. Finally, in
1998, the RTD procured the bus, having been abandoned by its previous owners, and parked it at
the current storage facility (http://bcv.robsly.com/lodsvocl.htm).
No primary or resources were identified for this vehicle, but James Kunkle (2012) confirmed that
the bus was not part of the RTD system and was owned by a private touring company that took
customers around Lamar Square.

The vintage rolling stock described and documented in this report comprises an important piece of
transportation history for the RTD and the city of Denver. It is an iconic representation of Denver’s
economic and physical development over five decades beginning in 1910, when Denver Tramway
Electric Streetcar No. 329 was built, and stretching to 1959, when Mack Buses 132 and 140 were
built. The RTD Board of Directors is currently evaluating options for the preservation and reuse of
the vehicles, including the option of donating them to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway
Foundation.
All seven of the vehicles stored at the RTD Weston District maintenance and storage facility have
suffered damage to their interiors and exteriors from weather and years of neglect. The restoration
of the vehicles would impede further deterioration and also allow for potential use in a
museum/educational setting. Regardless of the Board’s decision to move forward with restoration
of the vehicles via the Pikes Peak Foundation or some other entity, the vehicles should be stored
such that they are protected from weather damage and can receive regular maintenance. Further
research should be done on the British Double‐Decker bus which was privately‐owned.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 3, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

April 3, 2013

Board Meeting Date: April 16, 2013

Subject:

Adoption of 2014 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached 2014 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 22 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.

DISCUSSION
Recommended changes from 2013 to the 2014 adopted goals are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for average facilities maintenance complaints per month is increased to < 14.0
from < 12.0 per month to reflect full year revenue service on the West Line and actual
experience with West Line maintenance incidents to date. Pre-opening maintenance has
included graffiti and materials theft.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints
o The goal for customer complaints per boardings is increased to .0004 from .0003 due
to a static higher level of complaints reached over the last 2-3 years from the
strollers/wheelchairs policy, fare enforcement campaign, TIC availability, the
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line which will bring with it additional
complaints.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o This measure will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and is noted as a placeholder until that point.
It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue, EcoPass revenue, and total operating revenue

Packet Pg. 100

13.D

o

Each of these measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and are noted as placeholders
until that point. These are forecasts.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2014 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2014 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2014 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2014 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2014 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2014 Performance Report.

chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing

Complaints by type were being monitored by Bus Operations; however, they were unable to gather information from the Trapeze

The goal is increased in 2014 to account for static higher level of complaints due to the stroller/wheelchair policy, fare
enforcement campaign, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line.
