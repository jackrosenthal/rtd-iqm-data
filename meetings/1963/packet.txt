BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 2, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 2, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Utility Easement for South Weld Metropolitan
District for City of Dacono and St. Vrain
Sanitation District

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive
utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acres, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of
the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono,
County of Weld, State of Colorado.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2015 goal of fiscal sustainability in leveraging RTD assets. In 2009, RTD
acquired the railroad track and land known as the Boulder Industrial Lead (BIL) in the counties of Adams,
Boulder, Broomfield and Weld. The railroad corridor is 32.7 miles in length and an average width of 161
feet. The BIL is divided into two segments: the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch. The North
Metro line extends from Colorado Blvd at East 64th Avenue in Commerce City, Adams County,
northward to 164th Avenue just east of I-25 in unincorporated Weld County. The Boulder Branch
extends from 164th Avenue just east of I-25, Weld County, westward 17.7 miles to Boulder’s Valmont
Power Station.
In February 2014, RTD granted two Licenses on the BIL Boulder Branch to Ranchview Investment Co,
for consideration of a one-time License fee of $2,500 per License, to construct a water line and a
sanitary sewer pipeline crossing the railroad right-of-way under the track in Weld County Road 8 to serve
the Ranchview Subdivision adjacent to CR 8, City of Dacono. By the terms of a Subdivision Agreement
between Ranchview Investment Co and the City of Dacono to govern the development, the City of
Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District will undertake ownership and maintenance of the water line
and sewer line, respectively, upon completion and approval of the utilities. Two additional License
Agreements between RTD and the City of Dacono and St. Vrain Sanitation District were concurrently
executed to become effective upon final approval and acceptance of the utilities at which time the
License Agreements with Ranchview Investment Co will terminate.
DISCUSSION
The City of Dacono and the St. Vrain Sanitation District are concerned with License Agreements that are
revocable and terminable and initially sought a permanent interest in the property to ensure the
continued use and operation of the pipelines; however, with time constraints of the subdivision
development, they agreed to execute the Licenses to facilitate the installations while continuing to
pursue an easement.
The 2009 appraisal of the BIL rail corridor, conducted by Brad A. Weiman, MAI, and John P. Baker, MAI,
of Integra Realty Resources, further divided the North Metro Line and the Boulder Branch into land use
segments for valuation. Segments 1 through 14 of the North Metro Line that are highly developed and
urban ranged in value from $1.65 to $19.30 per square foot. Segments 15 through 21 of the Boulder

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Branch, with rural locations and no immediate demand for rail development, ranged in value from $0.75
to $6.00 per square foot. The requested easement area is located in Segment 15 of the Boulder Branch
that was valued at $1.50 per square foot.
South Weld Metropolitan District proposes a value based on 50% of the fee value of $1.50 per square
foot for the subsurface utility easement with an escalator of 10% or $3,100 for the 3,769 square foot
easement area.
RTD shall retain all rights in and usage of the property as necessary to ensure RTD’s use for mass
transportation system purposes. The utilities are subject to modification or relocation whenever RTD
finds it necessary or desirable in the use and improvement of the property. The utility owners shall be
required to modify, adjust or relocate all or any portion of the utilities, as RTD may designate. The utility
owners shall bear the entire cost and expense incurred in connection with the construction,
maintenance, repair and renewal and any and all modifications, revisions, relocations or reconstructions
of the utilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $3,100 in compensation for the non-exclusive utility easement.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086
acre, more or less) on the Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section
14, Township 1 North, Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to execute all documents necessary to
convey a non-exclusive utility easement over 3,769 square feet (0.086 acre, more or less) on the
Boulder Branch segment of the Boulder Industrial Lead in the SE¼ Section 14, Township 1 North,
Range 68 West, City of Dacono, County of Weld, State of Colorado. This is not recommended as
RTD is receiving fair market value for the easement and the easement does not limit current or future
RTD actions.

What drove changes in 2010?

1.C.2.a

Attachment: TOC PD Presentation 10-7-14_FINAL_accessible (2080 : TOC Update)

Lessons Learned since 2010
• Public-private partnerships
- RTD can’t do it alone

• Real estate fundamentals
- Trains don’t create markets

• Know your design
principles and stick to them
• Dedicate Resources
- Need a TOC champion, a
primary point of contact, and
access to outside expertise

1.C.2.a

Attachment: TOC PD Presentation 10-7-14_FINAL_accessible (2080 : TOC Update)

Lessons Learned since 2010
• Value Capture is more than
just ridership and revenue
- Other benefits of TOC may
include affordable housing,
urban design, station amenities

• Each TOD project is unique
• Ensure everyone
understands process
- FTA rules, RTD Board role,
RTD staff review, etc.

• Growing emphasis on station
area community
development, not just real
estate development

TOD and Planning Coordination Division will now
be called Transit Oriented Communities (TOC)
- The Planning Coordination group has historically focused
Quality of Life, first and final mile connectivity, Regional
Planning and Community Involvement
- Synergy generated by creating closer connections
between RTD’s community planning work and transitoriented development projects.
- RTD has an important role in building transit oriented
communities (FasTracks a “game changer”)
- Bringing a broad, community focused perspective will
enable staff to focus on more than just the “D” in TOD
