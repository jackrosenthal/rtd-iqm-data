BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 6, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2013

Subject:

April 2013 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an
annualized cost increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
With the completion of construction of the West Light Rail Line and Board adoption of the West Corridor
Service Plan, significant changes in bus and light service are slated to begin April 28, 2013. Attachment
C of this report is a copy of the Board Report containing the West Corridor Service Plan as adopted by
the Board of Directors on October 23, 2012.
Additional routine service changes not associated with or included in the West Corridor Service Plan are
necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the appropriate level of service
according to customer demand. For this year we will continue to focus on adjusting services in response
to the January 2012 service revisions and changes in ridership and operational performance.
The proposed April 2013 Service Changes contained herein reflect the continued budgetary challenges
faced by RTD. The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
•
Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
•
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
•
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
•
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services
•
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin
•
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Given the limited nature of the proposed service changes, the E-Alert system was employed to alert
customers of schedule changes to affected services. A summary of customer comments from the
Service Change website is contained in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are proposed to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent changes proposed to the service
changes initially proposed to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of January 2013 service
changes:

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.
The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

1.B.1.b

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan Limited: schedule changes to coordinate with Route 30Ltd
Route 49 – North Lowell: proposed new route was deleted from the proposal
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown: replaces the Route 49 proposal providing a connection to
the West Line at Sheridan Station

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

1.B.1.b

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

West Corridor Service Plan – April 2013

ACTION X

DISCUSSION

INFO

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the West Corridor Service Plan package as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by
these changes.
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board policy on service changes, service plans for the implementation of
the West Light Rail Line and connecting transit network are included herein. The primary
objectives of this plan are to:
 provide the appropriate level of service to the West Line Light Rail stations
 provide reliable and convenient transit service from within the residential,
commercial and governmental areas surrounding the West Line
 establish convenient connections between Call-n-Ride, bus and rail service to
accommodate passenger travel patterns throughout the day.
 Establish new W-Line light rail service within the corridor.
DISCUSSION
The West Line light rail service is slated to begin April 28, 2013. While diverse
suggestions for service changes routinely are offered and considered, a formal public input
process for the West Corridor began with the Environmental Impact Study in 2002-2003.
This included discussions with the public that determined which stations would be
equipped with bus gates, how many would be provided, etc. It also introduced the
concept of replacing “line haul” bus service with light rail service and using buses for local
access.
The Preliminary West Corridor Service Plan was updated and taken to local governments
and stakeholders in mid/late 2011 and was also available for anyone to review on RTD’s
Website. E-mail contacts were also made with local governments, including supplying
them with links to the preliminary draft plan. Revisions were made with the information
gleaned from these sources and the Draft Plan was brought to the RTD Board in February

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

1.B.1.c

Attachment A details the West Line service plan and Attachment B contains the public
meeting summaries.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Eight public meetings were held between April 16th-28th in order to obtain comments on
the proposed service plan for the West Corridor, including the West Rail Line (W-Line) and
bus and call-n-Ride services. 201 public participants offered their views or attended to ask
questions. Information from the hearings and additional field work was then taken into
account where resources permit and the plan was modified.
Based on input received during the public comment process and additional analysis
conducted, the non-highlighted changes were recommended to the Board of Directors in
July 2012. The Board requested additional changes to the plan and a summary these are
highlighted in yellow below. The details of these changes are presented in Attachment A:
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: is proposed to operate as the existing Route 9 between
Sakura Square and the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station
Route 20 – 20th Avenue: routing west of Wadsworth would be retained
Route 21 – Evans Crosstown: routing change in the Federal Center
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue : new fixed route service connecting Applewood Village to
Wadsworth Station
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: rerouted to serve Lakewood/Wadsworth Station
Route 30Ltd – South Federal Limited: routing change west of Wadsworth
Route 32 – West 32nd Avenue/City Park: is proposed to continue on its current route and
schedule
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan Limited: schedule changes to coordinate with Route 30Ltd

2012 for review and permission to proceed to public meetings for the West Corridor
service. The public meetings were held in April 2012 and further revisions were made to
the draft plan. Staff also met in this period with City of Wheat Ridge staff members to
determine adjustments in that city’s service, met with City and County of Denver staff
members and related agencies in the Denver Livability Partnership, corresponded in detail
with an interested Edgewater council member, met with Jefferson County Local
Coordinating Committee and JeffTAAG (Jefferson County Transportation Action and
Advocacy Group). Throughout this period, suggestions and questions from the general
public continued to be received. Briefings with the RTD Board also continued during this
period (May 2012 and June 2012) and adjustments to the Draft plan continued to be
made during this period.

1.B.1.c

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The annual change in cost of for the base system budget due to the West Line Service
Plan was intended to be revenue neutral. The changes listed herein represent a 1.27%
increase in annual service hours over current West Corridor service or an estimated
$371,000 annual. The Golden Call-n-Ride will be funded under a CMAQ grant from 2013
to 2016, thereby reducing the operational cost impact by $ 263,000 during the grant
funded period, the resultant net cost impact to the base system will be $108,000
annually. The annual cost for the West Line Light Rail service will be sourced from the
FasTracks budget.

Green Mountain call-n-Ride is proposed to be based at Federal Center Station, serving
areas roughly defined by Union Boulevard, Cedar Drive, Green Mountain Park, Alameda
Parkway, Indiana Street, Morrison Road, and Kipling Parkway. It would enter the Denver
Federal Center for passengers ending or beginning their trips in that facility. Services
would operate on weekdays between 5:30 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., with additional hours or
days in special situations indicated below.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Individuals expressed support for retaining a one-seat ride on Local Route 9 from the area
of the Garrison Station to the Market Street Station vicinity, criticized the alignment of the
Light Rail line at Union Station, suppoRouted the alignment of the Light Rail line at Union
Station and asked neutral questions about changes proposed for Route AF. Six RTD staff
members attended the meeting and answered numerous questions afterward.
Clements Community Center - Lakewood
Wednesday, April 18, 2012
The 52 members of the public who attended the Lakewood meeting represented diverse
interests. Common concerns were the proposed loss of direct bus service into Downtown
on Routes 20, 28, 32 in the area to be covered by the Applewood call-n-Ride and
expected inadequacies in the call-n-Ride services for that area and replacing Route 17 for
the Jefferson County Human Services complex. Division Director Lynnae Flora of the
Jefferson County Department of Human Services stated that the call-n-Ride will be
inadequate to access their campus. Two customers also spoke in favor of retaining Route
100X as a one-seat ride to Civic Center Station.
Individuals covered a number of issues: Discontinuance of Route 9 between Wadsworth
and Federal was opposed due to the poor sidewalks leading to light rail stations, with a
circulator route for those neighborhoods proposed as an alternative; objections to the slow
speed of the 16th Street Mall Ride; concern about possible travel times on the proposed
Route AF. Non-service issues raised included a suggestion that an intense safety program
be adopted along the line. One speaker objected to call-n-Ride vans operating in the
vicinity of Garrison Station as a betrayal of RTD’s commitment not to operate bus service
on Garrison Street. RTD Director Matt Cohen heard the testimony, along with six RTD
staff members.
Written testimony prepared for this meeting and submitted in lieu of making statements
included support for the idea of extending Route 76Ltd from West Colfax to Olde Town
Arvada; a proposal to replace Route 17 in the Jeffco Government Center with a fixed
route, rather than a call-n-Ride; adding a deviation to Route 49 to serve Regis University’s
campus.

Jeffco Government Center
Monday, April 16, 2012
The goal of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X drew the most interest
from the 26 members of the public attending the Golden meeting. Participants felt that
the proposed alternatives were too slow and worried that adding a Regional Route KC
from the Ken Caryl area would divide ridership up, rather than attracting customers. Two
speakers, including Tim Young (Jefferson County Human Services Manager for Child
Services), expressed concern about the proposed Golden call-n-Ride’s ability to handle the
family traffic on the mile stretch between their buildings and the light rail terminal.
(Service is presently provided by Route 17.)

Individual concerns were voiced, including the needs of Wheat Ridge High School students
on Route 32 in the segment proposed to be replaced by a call-n-Ride; concern was also
expressed by a satisfied user of the Dry Creek call-n-Ride who did not feel that call-n-Ride
service areas as large as proposed in the West Corridor plan were workable. Five staff
participated in the meeting.
Hadley Branch – Denver Public Library
Saturday, April 21, 2012
Diverse comments were offered by the eight members of the public who attended the
meeting. One person was critical of the Union Station alignment, versus going into the
central Downtown loop. Another had questions about where the new line would go in
Downtown. Others opposed removing Route 14 west of Wadsworth, but asked that it be
scheduled for favorable connections with Route 76; supported restoring Route 100 service
on Sundays; opposed discontinuing Route 17 service on West 44th Avenue at the Colorado
Railroad Museum; expressed concern about replacing Route 17 at the Human Services
building with the Golden call-n-Ride; supported 7-day a week operation of the Golden calln-Ride. Three RTD staff members and one City and County of Denver planner heard the
testimony and answered questions.
Blair-Caldwell Library – Five Points
Saturday, April 21, 2012
The most commonly expressed concern among the 14 members of the public at this
meeting regarded the call-n-Ride service proposed to replace Route 17 for Jeffco Human
Services buildings and in Applewood replacing segments of Routes 20, 28, and 32. In
brief, the concern regarding the former is that the special needs of Human Services clients
could not be met and for the latter that capacity would be insufficient. A written proposal
was presented describing a merger of segments of Routes 20 and 28 to continue serving
NREL. Two speakers also objected to the lack of rail service between Five Points and the
West Line/Union Station and favored a shuttle route of some type.
Individual statements were made in support of retaining Route 9 east to Sheridan
Boulevard instead of introducing the new Route 49; in support of the Route 16 service
change proposal if the first weekday morning trip remains in the current time frame; in
favor of signaling changes on Welton Street to cure schedule adherence problems; in favor
of moving the proposed B-C fare zone boundary west one station in order to lower fares at
Oak Station; opposed removing Route 3 from Green Mountain; opposed the proposed

Retaining through service to Civic Center Station on Routes 100X and 116X was the top
concern among the 32 members of the public who attended the Bear Valley meeting.
Similar concerns were raised on behalf of Route 2X service in the Green Mountain area.
The route alternatives in the service proposal were opposed, but suggestions were made
by customers for other alternatives. The majority favored – if the Express routes were not
retained as they are – adding a stop on the proposed Regional Route KC at the unofficial
park-n-Ride at C-470/Quincy. The proposed discontinuance of Route 21 in the area to be
served by the Green Mountain call-n-Ride was also a concern of many, especially in regard
to service for Green Mountain High School.

Wednesday, April 25, 2012
The most urgently expressed interest in the noon meeting in Downtown Denver was in
support of retaining a one-seat ride on Routes 100X and 116X between western
Lakewood and Ken Caryl points and Civic Center Station. Six of the 26 members of the
public attending named this as their concern. Alternatives were offered by some,
including adding a stop at Federal Center Station or adding an unofficial Park-n-Ride at the
C-470/Quincy interchange to the proposed Route KC. Individuals raised issues regarding
the loss of Route 2X service to Morrison that can be used for hiking into concerts at Red
Rocks Amphitheater, Route 21 travel needs of Green Mountain High School students, a
potential shortage of space on Route 16 if customers do not switch to Light Rail,
replacement of Route 17 service with call-n-Ride, the double transfer required to get
between the new W-Line and the Southeast F/H-Lines0, and a lack of capacity for
wheelchair customers running into other customers on the ramp at Littleton/Downtown
Station. Ten RTD staff members attended the meeting.
Conifer Library, Conifer
Wednesday, April 25, 2012
Support for the proposed West Corridor service plan as related to Routes CV/CS/CX
serving the Conifer area was the theme of much of the Conifer meeting. One speaker
spoke in support of retaining Route 6X. Other issues were raised by individuals, including
requests for improvements in specific connections, interest in information about the plans
for Pine Junction Park-n-Ride, and requests to go back to using glass in shelters. Twenty
members of the public, plus RTD Board Director Bruce Daly, were in attendance. Four
RTD staff members participated in the meeting.
Evergreen Library, Evergreen
Saturday, April 28, 2012
The major interest of the 23 attendees was in supporting the proposed retention of
through Regional Routes EV/ES/EX service into Civic Center Station. Two attendees
spoke in support of retaining Route AF service at the Federal Center Station. Individual
comments included: anxiety about security for passengers with luggage at Union Station;
a request to add a round trip to Denver from Evergreen on Saturdays and Sundays; a
request to run the Evergreen call-n-Ride till 9:00 p.m.; a request to extend skyRide to
Evergreen; noted a need for information on how to get to the Performing Arts complex
from the West Line.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 6, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 6, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2013

Subject:

Amendment to MV Public Transportation ADA
Contract ADA 17-DH-007 for award of the
Belmar, Green Mountain and Golden Call-nRides.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract amendment with MV Public
Transportation for the provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride
contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public Transportation ADA
contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9) month period from April 2013 through December
2013. The cost for the Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-nRide will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to
exceed amount will be $710,806. These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated
as “pass through” expenses.
BACKGROUND
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, RTD also operates “Call-n-Ride” service in various
locations throughout the District. Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand
responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in
a defined service area that requires that the passenger telephone the service provider to arrange for
pick-up. In addition to having a Call-n-Ride vehicle in a service area, Call-n-Rides can also operate as
Flex Routes. A Flex Route is an established route that has assigned stops and times just like a
regular route.
With the opening of the West Line on April 28, 2013, Call-n-Ride service has been planned to serve
areas along the corridor and to provide feeder service to West Rail Line stations. The Belmar Call-n-Ride
will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be bounded on the
north by 13th Avenue, Wadsworth Blvd. on the east, Kipling Street on the west and Morrison Road on
the south. The Belmar Call-n-Ride will also operate a Flex Route on Garrison Street during peak hours
and will serve the Garrison Station. The Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday,
5:30am – 8:00pm. The base Call-n-Ride service area will be 6th Avenue on the north, Kipling Blvd. on
the east, Union Blvd to Alameda Pkwy on the west and Morrision Road on the south. Two Flex Routes
have been established: one will cover parts of the discontinued Route 2X and will operate into the
Federal Center. A second Flex Route will cover discontinued parts of the Route 14 between Kipling and
the Federal Center Station. The Golden Call-n-Ride will operate Monday-Friday, 5:30am-8:00pm and
Saturday 8:00am-11:00pm. The base service area will cover most of the City of Golden. A Flex Route
will operate in Golden serving the Jefferson County Government Center/Golden Station, Human
Services, Colorado School of Mines, 10th & Washington and Golden High School. Other RTD services in
the areas consist of fixed route, Access-a-Ride and the new light rail.
DISCUSSION
MV Transportation currently operates Access-a-Ride services and eleven (11) other Call-n-Rides that
serve the southern and western areas of the RTD District under their existing ADA contract. MV

Packet Pg. 33

1.B.2

Transportation is an experienced provider in Call-n-Ride service, and in opening new services it is
imperative that our customers receive the best service possible. With the opening of the light rail,
customers will be learning a new system and these Call-n-Rides will provide an integral part of their
commute. Having an experienced Call-n-Ride provider on opening day is crucial. MV has the
additional resources to handle issues that come up with opening new services. MV Transportation
operates all the Call-n-Rides on the southeast and southwest light rail lines. Maintaining the same
contractor to operate all the Call-n-Rides in the south and west areas, allows for better transfers and
coordination among the Call-n-Rides.
Assigning the West Line Call-n-Rides to MV Transportation is in RTD’s best interest as 1) they are an
experienced Call-n-Ride provider, 2) the continued provision of these services allows for the efficient
utilization of vehicles, including spares, and allows for dependable service delivery, and 3) the provision
of these Call-n-Ride services through the existing ADA contract will enable the RTD to keep the cost at
$41.96 per revenue service hour.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of the West Line Call-n-Rides services are included in the adopted 2013 RTD
budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years. The
City of Golden did receive a CMAQ grant for the Golden Call-n-Ride service. The grant funds will be
used to offset the costs of the Golden Call-n-Ride service.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to MV Transportation under their ADA contract. This is recommended
as it is in the best interest of our customer and the best use of vehicle resources.
2)
Award the contract to another ADA service provider through an existing ADA contract at
existing rates. This is not recommended as the customer would ultimately suffer because
there is no other contractor with the Call-n-Ride experience that MV Transportation offers.

Smart Card Project Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Smart Card Program continues to address issues identified as a result of the January 1, 2013
implementation of the smart card program for Business Eco Pass customers, Neighborhood Eco Pass
Customers and College Pass customers. Overall, we believe that the Smart card program has attained
several significant milestones despite a number of technical challenges and late delivery of software,
card stock, and bus installations. Over 135,000 cards with personalized photos have been printed and
distributed to hundreds of companies, all colleges, and dozens of neighborhoods. The effort to gather
photos, print, and distribute the cards was no small feat, especially given the short timeframe it was all
done in. RTD staff and Xerox’s sub-contractor Celina, Inc. should be commended for the extra hours
worked and the effort putforth to ensure these cards were produced and delivered. All smart cards have
been produced for which RTD has received photos. There are still some companies and neighborhoods
that have not submitted some photos and as soon as they submit them, cards will be produced and
distributed as quickly as possible (typically within 5 business days).
All bus installations are completed. There are still various issues with about 5% of the fleet and these
issues have been documented and RTD staff and Xerox are in the process of working on those vehicles
to implement solutions. Customers may receive an inadvertent red “Invalid” indication upon tapping.
The cause of this has yet to be fully identified, but it can happen if the customer taps incorrectly. Some
customers are unsure how exactly to hold their card to the reader. Other issues may exist with a select
group of cards. Data currently shows that a fraction of a percent of the taps is having a problem. We
have now exceeded 50,000 transactions (taps) recorded on a typical weekday and less than 200
refusals per day are being recorded. We are monitoring the entire system and responding to issues as
quickly as possible. The implementation of this phase of the Smart Card program has taken more time
and staff resources than originally anticipated, but the major effort for the implementation of the Eco
Pass program and College Pass program is beginning to wind down to more manageable levels of effort.
The integration of the INIT CAD/AVL (Computer Aided Dispatch/Automated Vehicle Location) system
with the Xerox SmartCard system is a unique risk to the programs going forward. To ensure that these
systems continue to maintain interoperability for the long-term, RTD is going to be crafting a 3-way
operating agreement including support and maintenance on the interface whereby RTD will be the prime
integrator.
All Light Rail validators have been installed and are operational. Additional (over and above the original
plan) validators are in the process of being installed at the following locations:
 16th/Stout (2) -- Complete
 18th/Stout (2) -- Complete
 16th/California (1) -- To be Complete by 2/15/13
 18th/California (1) – To be Complete by 2/15/13
The RTD Network Team and Light Rail SCADA network Team are working together to connect the
validators to the existing network for the Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) to accept credit cards by 2nd

Packet Pg. 35

1.C.1

Quarter 2013. Validators for West Corridor and expansion of existing stations, as needed, have been
ordered and are expected to be delivered in March, 2013. A Request For Proposals (RFP) will be going
out to bring on a work order contractor to be on-call to install additional validators or relocate any
validators as needed.
The software for Fare Inspectors is in the final process of being installed. Fare inspectors are operating
in an “educate & inform” mode through the end of February and will transition to enforcement of the
smart card tapping in the near future.
RTD staff conducted a planning meeting with Safeway and will be meeting with King Soopers in the
near future to plan the installation and roll-out of electronic Smart Card Retail Point of Sale Terminals
(RPOS) at their stores to sell RTD passes and load stored value in the Fall of 2013. Planning for Phase 2
of the program is in full-swing.
The Board has previously approved several fare changes and administrative policies regarding the
implementation of Smart Card. The Smart Card Program Team will continue to add policy and
procedures to this list and distribute to The Board as needed (New Fare Policy Item):


Product Returns, Exchanges, & Upgrades: Since all products sold are non-refundable once
purchased, customers will also not be able to exchange or upgrade passes. If a customer
purchases a local pass for a month and in the middle of the month needs to upgrade to express,
they can purchase stored value for the remainder of the month to upgrade the fare from the local
to the express fare. Provided the customer loads at least $20 on their stored value purse, they
will receive the 10% bonus. This policy will reduce confusion and wait times at the station
windows, ensure accurate accounting of pass revenue, and compliment the no-refund policy
previously adopted.

Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and
Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project
Status Update

Information

INTRODUCTION
The Radio and CAD/AVL Replacement Project is replacing a 1993-era radio and dispatch system. The
radio system had to be replaced because of Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules that
narrowed the bandwidth of radio channels. The old CAD/AVL system was tightly integrated with the
radio system.
RTD joined a state-wide public safety radio network, saving money and improving coverage over an RTD
owned and operated system. INIT, Innovations in Transportation was selected as the CAD/AVL vendor.
In 2012, the CAD/AVL and Radio Replacement Project completed the radio-only deployment for Light
Rail, Transit Police, Paratransit and non-revenue vehicles. The CAD/AVL central system was factory
tested and installed. System integration testing was completed and mini-fleet testing started. About
42% of the fixed-route bus fleet has been installed.
Completion of testing is delayed pending a few missing features that are scheduled for delivery by next
month. Bus installations were originally scheduled for completion in December 2012. However, the bus
installations take significantly longer than the vendor had projected. Onboard installation rates have
improved over the past month. Projections are that bus installations will be completed in July. Below is a
capsulated summary that is followed by a list of current and upcoming activities.
