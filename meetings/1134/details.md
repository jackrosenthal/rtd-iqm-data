#### 1. April 2013 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the April 2013 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost increase of approximately $53,200 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

Motion:              Director Daly made the motion to move this to the full Board at the February 19, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel stated that the April 2013 Service Changes were included in the Board Packet along with a refresher of the West Corridor Service Plan adopted by the Board on October 23, 2012.  He also mentioned that several Directors have had a one-on-one meeting with the staff to review the changes.

Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, stated that based on the limited nature of the proposed changes, they did not have public hearings; however, they did open this item for public comments.  There are only two substantial changes.  Staff continues to do analysis and listen to customers about what they would like to see changed.  Based on customer feedback there are several changes staff would like to incorporate in the proposal.  These include Route 45 in the Green Valley Ranch area; Route 72X out West; Route 89 serving Stapleton; and Route 133.  These changes are slight and do not impact the cost.

Director Menten asked about the closing of the 29th and Welton station.  Jessie Carter stated that staff proposed an evaluation period to determine if this closing would improve the situation created when City of Denver changed the traffic light timing.  The light rail could end up dwelling at Park Avenue for up to 7-8 minutes.  Closing that station reduces the amount of time the vehicles are on the single track section.  Bruce stated that the change was implemented in January, and it seems to have been beneficial as feedback has been positive.  Jesse also commented that many of the complaints are from people parking in the garage across from the station, which is not a park-n-ride; it was provided for the businesses in that area.  Bruce stated that they intend to extend the observation period to see if the outcome continues to be beneficial.  So far the closure seems to be working as delays in the light rail have been reduced.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. Attachment A

##### b. Attachment B

##### c. Attachment C

#### 2. Amendment to MV Public Transportation ADA Contract ADA 17-DH-007 for award of the Belmar, Green Mountain and Golden Call-n-Rides.

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute a contract amendment with MV Public Transportation for the provision of the “Belmar”, “Green Mountain” and “Golden” Call-n-Ride contracted demand response transit services under the existing MV Public Transportation ADA contract. This contract amendment is for a nine (9) month period from April 2013 through December 2013.  The cost for the Belmar Call-n-Ride service will not exceed $183,420, Green Mountain Call-n-Ride will not exceed $293,172 and Golden Call-n-Ride will not exceed $234,214. The total not to exceed amount will be $710,806.  These amounts include estimates for fuel costs that are treated as “pass through” expenses.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move this to the full Board at the February 19, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel stated that when RTD went out to procure paratransit services for ADA contracts, they added the option for Call-n-Ride services.  RTD was trying to generate economies of scale from having the provider of paratransit services also provide services for the Call-n-Ride if they were in similar service areas.  With the opening of the West Corridor, staff is requesting to add three Call-n-Rides to the contract of MV Public Transportation at the previously negotiated rate.

Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, stated that they are recommending this addition for MV Transit because it is a very experienced transportation provider that currently provides ADA services and 11 Call-n-Rides for RTD.

Director Lubow stated that MV Transit seems to be very experienced and have provided a good service.  She asked if there is a process to determine if there might be other providers that could be as good as MV at a lesser price.  Bruce Abel stated that when they sent out the initial RFP, it included the option for Call-n-Ride.  At that time, they did the price comparison and selected from among the various proposals.   Additionally, when Call-n-Rides do not fall within an appropriate geographic scope, they have gone out to shop for Call-n-Ride providers.  It was determined that when RTD generates economies of scale, the cost will be lower when going with the existing contractors because they have the infrastructure, facilities and management team in place.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. Smart Card Project Status Update

Bruce Abel stated that the first phase of the Smart Cards went live on January 1st.  This stage included several components: on the hardware side it required installing the on-bus validators and light rail validators; IT infrastructure including servers and garage equipment to allow buses to communicate to the back-office; and issuance of card for the Business EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass programs.   Stage two, which is the issuance of general fare media on Smart Cards, is targeted for the fall of 2013.

They have worked on the development of software for the web portal for users of the EcoPass programs to go online and monitor the status of their account.  IT has also worked on the generation of reports to gather the information necessary to track the use of Smart Cards.

Bruce Abel explained that the biggest challenge was that we received the cards late from the vendor which put staff behind on getting the cards produced.  This lead RTD to extend the 2012 pass deadline to January 31.  The cards must be coded to the proper fare depending on the program and be customized with a photo as they are customer specific.   Bruce stated that customers had three options available for people to submit their photos.  If RTD had their digital photo on file, they could authorize RTD to use the existing photo to create the card.  Another option was for the company to take the photos and submit them to RTD.  Finally people could go and have their passes produced at certain RTD sites such as Boulder Transit Center and other RTD locations.   Another challenge was people submitting their photos on time or in an incorrect format.  As of January 25 we have produced every card for which the photo was received.   With regard to the complaints received by Director Lubow, these issues have been addressed.

Staff is monitoring the entire system and trying to respond to issues as quickly as possible.  They are verifying that the cards are tapping correctly and are generating above 55,000 taps a day; they have a benchmark of 70,000 when all the programs are up to speed, which means we are getting close to the benchmark.

Director Lubow asked if the other cards that we will be rolling out will have photos as well.  She is wondering if we have a lessons learned from this process.  Bruce Abel stated that the next phase is general populous such as selling monthly passes on Smart Card or  having store value cards; these cards are not personalized.  They have done lessons learned internally as well as with the Xerox contractors.

Director Sisk congratulated Bruce and the staff on the Smart Card program as it has been very well received.  He asked how do they communicate to the users.  He also asked if staff have considered extending the deadline to January 31 for the college program to allow Boulder students to participate.  Bruce stated that they chose the Business Eco Pass, Neighborhood Eco Pass and College Pass because these are targeted groups and each organization, company, college, etc. have coordinators that work with RTD.  In each case they worked with the RTD marketing department in creating targeted marketing materials on how to use the card for each group.  With regard to the College program, one of the reasons that ridership has been growing is because schools come back online by mid-January.  At this time most of the colleges have distributed their cards; staff has not heard that there will be any issues with the colleges meeting the January 31st deadline.

Director Daly stated that the 200 refusals out of 50,000 transactions completed is impressive.  He also asked how the operators are instructed to handle a fail on a Smart Card.  Bruce stated that if the failure is intended or the card is hot listed (has been reported lost/stolen) the driver is advised to refuse boarding and collect the card.  On an unintentional red “invalid”, the operator is advised to allow the person to board and ask them to contact RTD’s customer service center to identify if it is a card or validator problem.  Staff has worked very hard to address all the drivers to ensure they know the procedures.  Supervisors have also done gate checks to reach each driver.  Since the checks were implemented they have seen a reduction on the number of issues related to extending the 2012 deadline, failures, etc.

Director Hoy stated that it is important to understand that this is a giant beta test for the rollout in August for people that have cards that pay for each trip.  The cards are pre-paid so if the tap is unsuccessful we are not losing revenue.  Therefore it is important that in August we have all issues resolved so that when people tap their card they will get charged.

Bruce Abel stated that Gary Googins was not able to attend and that is why he took the lead on the updates.

#### 2. Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) Project Status Update

Eric Farrington, Project Manager for the CAD/AVL, stated that there is a status report provided to the Board in the Operations and Customer Service Agenda Packet from February 12, 2013.  He said that since the report was written there was a failure of the data radio cellular system operated by Sprint.  Sprint made the mistake of resetting all the cards to factory settings.  This means that staff has to go out and reprogram each card.  They are working on this and he will work with Sprint to ensure RTD is compensated for the work required to correct the issue.

Director Hoy asked if this has to do with the stop requested announcement.  Eric stated that this is the equipment that will do the voice announcement.  Once the new system is installed on all the buses it will actually make an announcement for the next stop.

### D. Other Matters

Director Hoy asked if there had been any feedback on the new route 104X which has been on the road for about a month.  Bruce stated that it has been on the road for 5 weeks so it is early in the process to have much feedback.  Jessie Carter said that currently the ridership is about 5-6 people per trip but we expect that to grow.

Director Daly stated that he attended the State Capitol where Directors Folska and Tobiassen testified on the Parking Bill 13-027 in the Senate Transportation Committee.  This is the bill that the Board passed the consent to support.  The bill passed 5-0 and now moves onto the second reading in the Senate.

Director Daly thanked Paula and Barbara for giving up their Saturday and taking care of everything associated with the teambuilding exercise.  He thought they did a great job with this event.

### F. Motion to Move Into Executive Session

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move to Executive Session.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Solano declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
