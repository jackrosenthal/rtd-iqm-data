#### 1. Denver Union Station Wynkoop Plaza Update

Mike Turner introduced himself as the Manager of Planning and Coordination.  He stated that he was speaking to the Board on behalf of Bill Sirois who was unable to attend the meeting.  Mike reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that can be found in the February 5, 2013 Planning and Development Agenda Packet.

Director Lubow asked if we knew the cost of the four management options considered and asked if that factored into RTD’s recommendation.  Mike Turner explained that the proposals had to be fiscally sustainable.  He stated that staff was looking to see what kind of success each entity had in fundraising, what revenues have been generated in programming other public spaces, etc.

Director Walker wondered how many people the public area of the plaza could hold.  Mike Turner stated that the capacity was as many people as would fit in 40,000 square feet of space.

Director Daly asked if a committee was formed to handle the civic entertainment and duties and a conflict arose, would the committee come back to the RTD Board for resolution.  Mike Turner said that it would be very important for any issues to come back to the Board, especially if there was a proposal that conflicted with RTD’s goals.  He explained that the RFP was also structured to try to address that very thing: recognizing the work RTD has done with the stakeholder process, managing anything that conflicts with maintenance issues, not conflicting with transit patrons, etc.

Director Solano noted that under Management Option 4 it states that the existing organization selected can be either profit or non-profit.  He asked if there had been a cost analysis done as to what the difference would be in selecting one over the other.  Mike Turner stated that staff had not gone into that level of detail with an analysis.

Director Bagley thanked staff for their presentation.  He noted that the process for the public comment and the outcome for the Station building was outstanding.  He feels the activities that occurred after the selection of the group to do the Station building were phenomenal.  He believes staff will do something as good as that on this project.  He stated that being the RTD Board member that is assigned to the DUSPA Board, he takes great pleasure in realizing this project is in good hands because of our experience.  Mike Turner shared that we had a public meeting on December 12th, 2012 where about 50 or 60 people attended; this high attendance was because we had a good list of people we could draw on from our past work.  He believes we got a lot of good input as to how people want to see the space used.

Director Folska asked if this was a privately owned public space.  She also asked what kinds of controls and regulations for mediating issues, problems and concerns were in place.   Mike Turner stated that the space is owned by RTD.

Director Folska stated that in looking at someone else managing the space she thought it would be interesting to see how that would fit into the Risk Allocation Matrix for the monetization of revenue streams.

Director Hoy wondered what community organizations we reached out to.  Mike Turner stated that we used Union Station Alliance’s mailing list, our mailing list from our past work, it was posted on DUSPA and DUS’s websites, and we asked the Lower Downtown Neighborhood Association to provide the information to their members.  He explained that it was more of a targeted effort around Denver Union Station.

Committee Chair James expressed that he believes the outreach efforts are going very well and thanked staff for their work.

### C. Other Matters

General Manager Washington shared with the Board that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, has been selected to attend the ENOS Center for Transportation Leadership Executive Leadership.  Bill will attend this and represent RTD in April.  General Manager explained that those selected are really the pinnacle of transportation leadership.  He believes this is another great example of RTD being the farm team for the industry.

Director Solano requested that the Board begin each meeting by saying the Pledge of Allegiance.  Chair Anderson said that she would be happy to institute the Pledge of Allegiance at each meeting.

### E. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 7:48 p.m. to the Government Relations Committee meeting.
