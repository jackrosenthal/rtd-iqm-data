Stakeholder Goals Review

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

1.B.1.a

• This is Denver’s gateway – a unique, family-friendly and iconic
destination that represents Denver in the minds of local and national
visitors to the plaza
• This is a gathering spot for the neighborhood as well as a place for
visitors to stop for a time or attend a planned activity
• It draws visitors to adjacent retail uses and serves to complement
them
• It is active in ways that respect the surrounding residential and
business uses
• Uses may change over time as those who use the plaza discover
how they want to use it

Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

Stakeholder Goals Review

1.B.1.a

• It is flexible, allowing for a balance between spontaneous use and
high-quality, planned activities that consistently draw visitors,
contribute to the iconic nature of the plaza, and are fiscally
sustainable
• It is clean, safe, attractive, and in good repair as is appropriate for
signature public spaces
• It is compatible with the DUS project’s basic function as a primary
access point to regional transit

• It is responsive to those who have a stake in the plaza’s success –
RTD, the Metro District and others with a direct governmental and
financial stake in the plazas: neighbors, community and not-for-profit
stakeholders, adjacent land owners, tenants, transit riders and users

Packet Pg. 11

Management Options
Basic assumptions:

• RTD doesn’t assume responsibility for special events programming,
but may retain licensing rights depending on the management
structure
• RTD provides basic maintenance and security, contracts out
programming
• Management structure to remain flexible over time, allowing for
consideration of different combinations of options
• Adjacent properties, North Wing, South Wing, and DUS Historic
Building will all contribute funding towards maintenance

Management Options

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

permitting process

4. Separate entity created within existing organization

10

Packet Pg. 13

Management Option 1

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

1.B.1.a

No Action: Demand-based programming using RTD’s existing
permitting process
PRO
- Least cost
- Most streamlined
- May produce the fewest events: quieter space, reduced maintenance

CON
- Lack of coordinated programming effort may result in fewer events and
opportunities, lesser quality, more reactive than planned
- Not part of RTD’s core mission, limited staff experience
- Fails to address Master Plan/Public Space Symposium, public interest goals
- No formal role for stakeholders

11

Packet Pg. 14

Management Option 2
New autonomous not-for-profit entity
Example: creating a “DUS Plaza Board”

PRO
- Altruistic, public purpose-interest singular focus, diverse range of interests
- Recommended by 2009 Public Space Symposium
- Ability to fund raise
CON
- Creating/maintaining new organization requires additional effort/costs
- May require considerable programming for viability
- Limited public space fundraising sources, competition from others
- Potential conflict between RTD/new entity maintenance requirements
- May increase RTD cost/contribution to maintenance

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

1.B.1.a

12

Packet Pg. 15

Management Option 3
Absorbed within existing entity (profit or non-profit)
Example: Downtown Denver Partnership, Lower Downtown Denver Inc. (LDDI)

PRO
- Built-in administrative structure with potential programming experience
- Easier start up, potentially less expensive
- RTD can contract to ensure transparency, accountability, and structure to
respond to stakeholders

Attachment: Wynkoop Plaza Update 01.31.13 (1481 : DUS Wynkoop Plaza Update)

1.B.1.a

CON
- May not have programming experience
- Still requires additional staff/resources
- Lacks identifiable point of contact and singular focus; potential for divided
interests
- For profit entity potentially doesn’t have governmental responsibility, possible
divergent transparency and accountability expectations
- May increase RTD cost/contribution to maintenance
