BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: March 14, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

March 13, 2013

Board Meeting Date: March 19, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to
the issuance of RTD Certificates of
Participation, Series 2013A

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD financing issues at lower than
current interest rates to reduce payments, and improve cash flow as a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item
and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the refundings as a step toward accelerating
construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the third of the three refunding opportunities that were included in the RAM
item proposed on January 22, 2013. Also included in this action item is a discussion of the financing of
buses and ticket vending machines the District is in the process of procuring.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $80.965 million Certificates of Participation (COP), Series 2005A (the “2005
Certificates”) in June 2005 for the purpose of financing 29 light rail vehicles. At present, $38.030
million par amount of the 2005 Certificates remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2005 Certificates on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of
approximately $1.5 million (4.00% of principal of refunded bonds). The Resolution requires a minimum
of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the
date the bonds are sold. The 2005 Certificates are callable June 1, 2015 at par.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding certificates at a return equal to
the interest expense of the refunding certificates, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the
refunding certificates and call date of the 2005 Certificates (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time
proceeds of the refunding certificates must be invested prior to redeeming the 2005 Certificates.
Despite the cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2005 Certificates exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has
assembled a financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the
opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
In addition to the refunding, the Resolution provides for financing of up to $280,000,000 worth of
equipment as anticipated to be financed in the Strategic Budget Plan(SBP). Buses included in this
financing include intercity buses, 40 foot transit buses, 60 foot articulated buses, Mall Shuttles and ADA
cutaway vehicles. These vehicles are expected to be delivered within the next 24 months. The District
has taken delivery of 18 of these vehicles to date. Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs) to be financed
include replacement machines for the southwest and central corridors which will make all of the
District’s light rail lines credit card capable. The District intends to reimburse itself for the purchase of
this equipment with the proceeds from these certificates as outlined in the reimbursement resolution
adopted by the Board on May 22, 2012.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding certificates, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a
preliminary official statement, continuing disclosure agreement, certificate purchase agreement and the
Resolution for issuance of the refunding certificates. The Board is being requested, through the
Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the parameters and to approve agreements required in
connection with the issuance of the certificates.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Certificate Resolution including the Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Certificate Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Certificates will be underwritten by a
team including RBC (40%), J.P. Morgan (20%), Loop Capital Markets (10%) and Stifel Nicolaus (30%).
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2013A.
This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series
2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the District.

the appropriate officers of the District herein authorized shall be conclusive evidence of the
approval by the District of such instrument in accordance with the terms hereof.
Section 7.
No General Obligation Debt. No provision of this Resolution, the
Lease, the Indenture or the 2013 Certificates shall be construed as creating or constituting a
general obligation or other indebtedness or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District
within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory provision, nor a mandatory charge or
requirement against the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond the then current fiscal year.
The District shall have no obligation to make any payment with respect to the 2013 Certificates
except in connection with the payment of the Base Rentals (as defined in the Lease) and certain
other payments under the Lease, which payments may be terminated by the District in
accordance with the provisions of the Lease. Neither the Lease nor the 2013 Certificates shall
constitute a mandatory charge or requirement of the District in any ensuing fiscal year beyond
the then current fiscal year or constitute or give rise to a general obligation or other indebtedness
or multiple fiscal year financial obligation of the District within the meaning of any
constitutional or statutory debt limitation and shall not constitute a multiple fiscal year direct or
indirect District debt or other financial obligation whatsoever. No provision of the Lease or the
2013 Certificates shall be construed or interpreted as creating an unlawful delegation of
governmental powers nor as a donation by or a lending of the credit of the District within the
meaning of Sections 1 or 2 of Article XI of the Colorado Constitution. Neither the Lease nor the
2013 Certificates shall directly or indirectly obligate the District to make any payments beyond
those budgeted and appropriated for the District’s then current fiscal year.
Section 8.
Reasonableness of Rentals. The Board hereby determines and
declares that the Base Rentals due under the Lease, in the maximum amounts authorized
pursuant to Section 3 hereof, constitute the fair rental value of the 2013 Leased Property and do
not exceed a reasonable amount so as to place the District under an economic compulsion to
renew the Lease or to exercise its option to purchase the 2013 Leased Property pursuant to the
Lease. The Board hereby determines and declares that the period during which the District has
an option to purchase the 2013 Leased Property (i.e., the entire maximum term of the Lease)
does not exceed the useful life of the 2013 Leased Property.
Section 9.
Exercise of Option; Direction to Trustee. In the event that the
General Manager or the Chief Financial Officer determines to proceed with the Refunding

Project and executes a Sale Certificate in accordance with the provisions set forth herein, the
Board hereby elects and hereby declares its intent to exercise on the behalf and in the name of
the District its option to purchase all or a portion of the 2005A Leased Property and to redeem all
or a portion of the 2005A Certificates (the “Refunded Certificates”), as applicable, on the
redemption date and at the redemption prices set forth in the Sale Certificate related to the
Refunding Project. Upon the execution of the Sale Certificate related to the Refunding Project,
the District hereby irrevocably instructs the Trustee to give notice of refunding and defeasance to
the Owners of the Refunded Certificates in accordance with the provisions of the Sale
Certificate, the Mortgage and Indenture of Trust, as amended, related to the Refunded
Certificates and the Escrow Agreement between the Corporation and the Trustee, as escrow
agent.
Section 10.
No Recourse against Officers and Agents. Pursuant to Section 1157-209 of the Supplemental Act, if a member of the Board, or any officer or agent of the District
acts in good faith, no civil recourse shall be available against such member, officer, or agent for
payment of the principal, interest or prior redemption premiums on the 2013 Certificates. Such
recourse shall not be available either directly or indirectly through the Board or the District, or
otherwise, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute, rule of law, enforcement of penalty, or
otherwise. By the acceptance of the 2013 Certificates and as a part of the consideration of their
sale or purchase, any person purchasing or selling such certificate specifically waives any such
recourse.
Section 11.
Repealer. All bylaws, orders and resolutions of the District, or
parts thereof, inconsistent with this Resolution or with any of the documents hereby approved are
hereby repealed to the extent only of such inconsistency. This repealer shall not be construed as
reviving any bylaw, order or resolution of the District, or part thereof, heretofore repealed.
Section 12.
Severability. If any section, subsection, paragraph, clause or
provision of this Resolution or the documents hereby authorized and approved (other than
provisions as to the payment of Base Rentals by the District during the Lease Term, provisions
for the quiet enjoyment of the 2013 Leased Property by the District during the Lease Term and
provisions for the conveyance of the 2013 Leased Property to the District under the conditions
provided in the Lease) shall for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity
or unenforceability of such section, subsection, paragraph, clause or provision shall not affect
any of the remaining provisions of this Resolution or such documents, the intent being that the
same are severable.

Sustainability
Recommendations Update

Task

Force

BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Sustainability Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy
recommendations to the Board of Directors which were approved for further consideration and/or
implementation. Certain recommendations have been implemented including removing the volatility from
sales and use tax projections, implementing a service optimization expense reduction strategy as well as
implementing a revised fund balance policy. The other recommendations required additional research by
staff and prioritization by the Board. These recommendations were prioritized at the 2012 Board retreat
in the following categories:
Top Tier (Highest Priority)
 Sales and use tax compliance reviews1
 Technology/energy innovation

This recommendation previously included self-collection of sales and use taxes. Further research and discussions resulted in
removing self-collection of taxes by RTD from near-term consideration.

In addition, the Board of Directors made additional revenue enhancement suggestions which were
included in the General Manager’s Tactical Plan for consideration in developing the 2013 Budget. The
purpose of this memo is to provide an update to the Board of Directors on the status of those
recommendations that have not yet been implemented.

DISCUSSION
The attached matrix lists the recommendations remaining to be implemented and includes information
regarding the pros and cons of each recommendation as well as a status update. This matrix is
presented for discussion purposes and will continue to be updated and presented to the Board of
Directors as new information is received.

January 2013 Financial Summary

BACKGROUND
Staff presents the monthly financial status report to the Board each month as an information item during the
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting. Due to the year-end financial audit each year, financial
information for January is incomplete for timely presentation. For this reason, staff only presents Dashboard
information, including ridership, fare revenue and sales and use tax results for the month.
DISCUSSION
Ridership, fare revenue and sales and use taxes for January 2013 were as follows:

Ridership: Due to the complexity of conversion of ridership data from driver counts to a combination of driver
counts and SmartCard validations, we have included an estimate of ridership for January.
Fare Revenue: January 2013 is 0.6% below January 2012. With the exception of additional fare revenue from
the West Rail Line beginning in late April, 2013 fare revenue was budgeted to stay flat from the 2012 budgeted
revenue by assuming no fare increase and no change in ridership.
Sales and Use Taxes: January 2013 sales and use taxes exceeded January 2012 by 2.8%. The 2013 budget
assumed a 5.7% increase over 2012. The 2013 Budget was approved prior to the most recent forecast from
Leeds School of Business which forecasted a 1.25% increase for 2012. Staff will continue to monitor 2013 actual
results and will receive an updated forecast for 2013 in March.

2014 Budget – Calendar

2014-2019

SBP,

BACKGROUND
The 2013 Summary Budget Calendar is structured to provide the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input into the development of the RTD 2014 Annual Budget. The purpose of the attached
calendar is to assist the Board members in anticipating and planning their input into the development of
the 2013 Amended Budget, 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2014 Budget. The five
strategic goals approved by the Board on March 2 for the General Manager will be incorporated into the
2014 Budget plans.
DISCUSSION
In the course of the development of the three financial plans mentioned above, staff will look to the
Board to provide guidance and collaboration in:
(1) 2013 Amended Budget and proposed FasTracks multi-year project approval
(2) Determining the objectives of the 2014 Budget
(3) Understanding the key drivers of costs in the District’s annual budget
(4) Determining the required adjustments to RTD programs and fund balance levels
(5) Developing a understanding of departmental operating expenses and capital projects
(6) Establishing and adhering to a calendar of critical milestones that make it possible for the District
to satisfy State Statutes relative to budget formation and monitoring
CONCLUSION
The suggested topics and pacing in the accompanying calendar are proposed with the intent of keeping
the Board informed on critical budget information as it becomes available and allowing the Board to
develop an understanding of the key financial plans. Staff is seeking the support of the Board in moving
ahead with this plan.

2012 Performance Report – Fourth Quarter

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10

DISCUSSION
Attached is the 2012 Performance Report for the Fourth Quarter. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District. Of the 23 performance measures tracked, RTD met 18 of the goals in their entirety in the
fourth quarter. The following are the exceptions:
Goal 1.1 – First Transit-Commerce City and Veolia exceeded the goal for number of passenger accidents
per 100,000 miles. An unusual number of accidents were incurred in Q1 attributed to inclement
weather. In Q4, both contractors showed improvement in this measure. Both contractors continue to
use DriveCam and Smart Drive technologies to help operators improve/correct driving practices. Both
also provided Smith System retraining to all of their operators during the year.
Goal 2.1 – Average facility maintenance complaints per month exceeded the goal of 10.5, primarily due
to Q1 complaints about snow/ice and shelter clean-up from snow, and several instances where shelters
have a one-time per week maintenance schedule. Complaints began to decline in Q2 and the trend
continued downward through the rest of the year. The manager responsible for this area developed a
more accurate tracking system in 2012 which captured more customer complaints resulting in a higher
number of average complaints.
Goal 3.1 - The District did not meet its goal for on-time service in Q4. In local on-time service systemwide, we did experience improvement over Q3 for all carriers. Regional and Express Service on-time
performance declined slightly from Q3 as this service continued to generate large increases in ridership
with corresponding increases in dwell time. Staff continues to study individual route and driver
performance in order to target remedial actions and resources to the routes experiencing the greatest
challenges. As the focus on run boards continues, on-time performance is showing positive trends.
Although not on goal in Q4, light rail on-time service improved due to recovery from Q3 issues which
included a record number of new train operators brought on in a short period who needed time to adjust
to complex downtown operations and a traction power substation software upgrade that resulted in
multiple substations being off-line that in turn prevented trains from accelerating to full power and
permissible speeds.
Goal 3.3 – Mileage between lost service road calls was met by all carriers in Q4. On a year-to-date
basis, only Veolia did not meet goal. Veolia’s performance in this area continues to improve from prior
quarters due to progress made with the new management team.

Packet Pg. 29

1.C.4

Goal 4.2 – We have seen customer complaints increase across the entire system due to several factors
including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and heavy/longer load times. The level of
complaints has been consistent over the past two years and is not increasing. Top reasons continue to
be “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review
CAD/AVL playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address
valid complaints. Staff provides an analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services
report.

Top complaints are “bus did not show,” “bus early,” “bus late” and “operator discourtesy.” Staff continues to review CAD/AVL
playbacks to determine the validity of these complaints and to work with operators to address valid complaints. Staff provides an
analysis of complaints as part of the Operations/Customer Services report. Customer complaints increased across the entire
system due to several factors including the fare enforcement campaign, increasing ridership, and heavy/longer load times; this
higher level of complaints has been consistent for the last 2 years and is not increasing.
