BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Access-on-Demand Funding

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to provide
additional funding of $15,814,441 for the Access-on-Demand program, raising the not-to-exceed
amount from $21.9 to $37.8 million, and delegating authority to amend the contracts with existing
providers to increase the current amount of program funding for the remainder of the term of the
contracts, which expire December 31, 2025.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Paul Hamilton, Director, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD and its contractor partners deliver multimodal transit services across a 2,345 square-mile service
area, which services include bus, light rail, commuter rail, and micro transit services, as well as Accessa-Ride complementary paratransit services in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA).
In November 2020, RTD launched its Access-on-Demand service as part of an expanded premium to
Access-a-Ride paratransit service. Access-on-Demand began as a supplemental demand-response pilot
program in partnership with Uber, a private transportation network company (TNC). The program’s goal
was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit customers, which was similar to the
agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. The Access-a-Cab program provided
alternative on-demand service to paratransit customers through private taxicab providers.
The Access-on-Demand pilot program provided eligible customers a per-trip subsidy of up to $20, and
those customers were required to pay the first $2 in fare for each trip. Access-a-Ride customers within
four ZIP codes, selected for their density of existing paratransit customers, were eligible to participate in
this pilot. The program hours were between 6 and 9 a.m. and between 2 and 5 p.m. The program was
later expanded to an additional three ZIP codes and was expanded again to serve customers 24 hours a
day, seven days a week. During the pilot period, RTD continued to offer its Access-a-Cab demandresponse service, for which a $12 subsidy was offered, and customers were required to pay $2 in fare
for each trip.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Following the Board’s approval of funding in November 2022 in the amount of approximately $9.3
million, in January 2023, RTD merged the Access-on-Demand and Access-a-Cab programs. Since then,
RTD has partnered with four contracted private providers, Uber, Lyft, Metro Taxi, and zTrip, to provide
Access-on-Demand service. Customers travel using their choice of these providers, receive a subsidy of
up to $25 per trip, and pay no upfront fare. Additionally, customers schedule trips through the four
providers’ mobile apps or the RTD Access-a-Ride call center for Metro Taxi or zTrip. Customers are
limited to 60 one-way trips per month across all providers and are responsible for monitoring their trip
usage.
Due to the popularity of Access-on-Demand as an alternative to traditional paratransit services, demand
for service quickly exceeded expectations following the expansion beyond the pilot program in January
2023. Key factors driving the increase in demand likely include the same-day convenience when booking
an Access-on-Demand trip, expanded service times and service area when compared with Access-aRide, and no out-of-pocket cost to customers. As a result, RTD anticipates that Access-on-Demand trip
cost subsidies for calendar year 2024 will reach $11.1 million, a 77 percent increase over subsidy costs
in 2023 (at the time of this report development all third-party costs for 2024 have yet to be reconciled).
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery. This on-site review was
conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in a holistic
review of the paratransit program, including both the Access-on-Demand program and the Access-a-Ride
program. Peer review recommendations, coupled with paratransit customer feedback, will assist RTD in
adopting industry best practices, understanding the agency’s strengths and opportunities concerning
paratransit service delivery, and determining options for potential improvements, sustainability, and fiscal
responsibility.
DISCUSSION
In considering this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Priority of Customer
Excellence.
The Board approved an additional $8,600,000 in June 2024 to fund Access-on-Demand, and the
GM/CEO approved an additional $2,000,000 in December 2024, which sustains the program through
February 2025. Based on projected continual growth in demand for Access-on-Demand services, and
until sustainability recommendations of the peer review committee may be vetted and adopted, an
additional $15,814,441 is requested to continue to provide Access-on-Demand services through
December 2025 when the third-party contracts expire.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Additional funding for the Access-on-Demand program in the amount of $13,814,440 will be derived
from existing funds in the 2025 budget, and the remaining $2,000,000 will be made available through
the unrestricted reserve. Future funding for this program will be allocated through the annual budget
process.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Contracted Security Services

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work for a solicitation, and to subsequently
authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to enter into a contract for security
services.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Glyn Horn, Acting Co-Chief, Transit Police and Emergency Management
Michael Millage, Senior Manager, Commuter Rail Contract Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment police
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD employees,
customers, facilities, and property, as well as federally required commuter rail second crewmember
duties.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, Allied Universal Security Services
was awarded a three-year contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security
services. The initial contract term expired June 30, 2022, and following three separate Board approvals,
RTD executed each of three additional one-year contract options. The third and final option year term
expires June 30, 2025. No additional contract options remain.
To continue to augment the overall security model with contracted security services, RTD staff will
publish a competitive solicitation for services to begin July 1, 2025.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking contracted security services consistent with the
below summary scope of work.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through
recruitment and retention of contracted security personnel to support RTD Police throughout the

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.2

District yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall community security in areas
RTD serves
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability of Commuter Rail
Contracted Services to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby
improving system reliability and decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contracted services funding for this contract is included in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Light Rail Vehicle Cameras Retrofit

February 12, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
February 25, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Confluence Security for the purchase and installation of forward-facing, operator-facing incab, and customer compartment cameras on 157 light rail vehicles for a total cost not to exceed
$3,000,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with 49 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 674, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
has delegated its safety oversight responsibilities to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC),
which is the State Safety Oversight (SSO) agency responsible for the oversight of safety and security of
rail fixed guideway systems within the state of Colorado.
Effective June 30, 2022, pursuant to CPUC Rule 7349(b), as a Rail Transit Agency (RTA), RTD was
required to use cameras currently installed in its light rail vehicles (LRVs) to record activity at all times
when the light rail vehicle power is on. This footage must be used to assist in the management of safe
light rail operations, including in accident investigations, whether performed by CPUC staff or the RTA.
Rule 7349(b) also requires that no later than June 30, 2027, RTAs must install and use forward-facing
and operator-facing in-cab cameras on all LRVs for the above purposes.
DISCUSSION
On November 7, 2024, RTD issued a solicitation for LRV cameras and camera installation to replace
existing cameras. The solicitation was made available on the RTD website and advertised on RTD’s
online procurement portal. Proposals were due December 20, 2024. Two proposals were received during
the solicitation period. A panel of subject-matter experts assessed the proposals using pre-determined
objective evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluations of the proposals, the panel recommends
awarding the contract to Confluence Security.
This recommended action aligns with 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value,
Customer Excellence, and Financial Success by improving the agency’s ability to investigate events,
accidents, and criminal incidents and to increase public and employee safety and security on LRVs.

Packet Pg. 9

1.C.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding is included in the 2025 Budget for the provision of replacing existing cameras with forwardfacing and operator-facing in-cab cameras in LRVs.

COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of the 2025 Operations, Safety, and Security
Committee Work Plan

February 11, 2025

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee to approve the 2025 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
JoyAnn Ruscha, Chair, Operations, Safety, and Security Committee
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board. The work plan before the committee will cover meetings
through February 2026.
Per Article VI, Section 1, e.), the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee is “responsible for all
operational matters, including all contracted and non-contracted bus, rail, paratransit, and microtransit
services, as well as safety and security matters.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed this item three times over the last month: the first discussion was held during
the Committee’s January 15, 2025, meeting; the second discussion occurred during the Board retreat on
February 1, 2025; and the third discussion occurred at a Special Operations, Safety, and Security
Committee meeting on February 6, 2025. Additionally, Committee leadership further coordinated with
senior RTD staff on this work plan.
Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve the work plan.
Once approved by the Committee, the work plan, will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Chair of the committee in consultation with the committee’s
Vice Chair and responsible RTD staff. It is expected that the timing of some items may shift throughout
the course of the work plan.

Packet Pg. 11

1.C.4

This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Operations, Safety, and Security
Committee’s ability to effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An
organized committee work plan will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s
policy and governance objectives are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
May 2025 Service Change Recommendations

February 12, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Local Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001,
the May 2025 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for Service Development Division staff
to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit network and Operations Department personnel to select
new work assignments.
DISCUSSION
Considering the current staffing levels, operators in training, and anticipated attrition, the May 2025
service change recommendations were designed with careful consideration toward the availability of
staff. The recommendations are centered on continued System Optimization Plan (SOP)/Comprehensive
Operations Analysis (COA) implementation, the restoration of services and system capacity, seasonal
adjustments, and improving system performance and reliability by way of service enhancements,
reductions, and adjustments.
The May 2025 service change recommendation contains several SOP/COA-related increases and
optimizations. Among the more notable changes are:

•
•
•
•
•

Increases to service frequency on Route 16 – West Colfax
Increases to midday service frequency on Route 73 – Quebec Street
Increases to service frequency on Route 153 – Chambers Road
Reintroduction of the Free Metro Ride 18th/19th Street service
Extension of service to the Willoughby Corner development via Routes 225 and DASH (nonSOP/COA)

Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power availability, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with the ATU Local 1001, and adjusting
service levels to match ridership demand.

Packet Pg. 18

1.D.1

The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
SOP/COA-Related Changes
The following recommended changes are reflective of service provision as contemplated in the SOP/COA
of RTD’s transit network services adopted by the Board of Directors on July 26, 2022, as a component
of Reimagine RTD:
Route 16 – West Colfax: as described in the SOP, service frequency increased from 15 to 10 minutes
during midday and p.m. peak periods.
Route 73 – Quebec Street: as described in the SOP, midday service frequency increased from 30 to 15
minutes.
Route 153 – Chambers Road: as described in the SOP, midday service frequency increased from 30 to
15 minutes.
NB – Boulder/Nederland/Eldora: as described in the SOP, service spans modified to start earlier and end
later.
Services proposed for routine adjustments (schedule adjustment/schedule analysis)
Route 1 – West 1st Avenue: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance.
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance.
