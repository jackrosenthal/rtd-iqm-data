Recommended Actions
2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award
It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year
option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of
performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is
negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded
annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract
amendment is for an amount not to exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016.
Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels with the
elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions
for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget
for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original
fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016
Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
