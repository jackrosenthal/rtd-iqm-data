#### 1. 2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant Contract Award

It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions for 2016 and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016 extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.

Chair Sisk explained this item is on the agenda due to the changes with the Virtegic contract since Joni Goheen had submitted her resignation.  The Board report has changed and the Executive committee needs to review this change and approve this to take forward to the full Board

Motion:              Director Walker made the motion to approve the amended Virtegic Board report to take to the full Board.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Hoy explained that the changes in the Board report included reducing the Joni headcount and not moving the two part-time positions to full-time. IGM Genova added that the team has renegotiated the scope with Virtegic and this is the new agreement.

Director Bagley inquired of IGM Genova how does this reduction in headcount given the 2016 rollout impact the Agency and if we will be sufficiently staffed?  IGM Genova stated that staff was comfortable with the changes.  Marta Spieki will be moving into Joni’s role and she has a breadth and knowledge that will be helpful.

Director Walker expressed that he hopes there is no missteps during the rollouts but if one occurs, because of this decision to reduce headcount, the Board will recognize that we put our customers in risk in terms of providing information in a timely manner.  Director Bagley noted this was poignantly stated and requested Director Walker to make these statements in the Board meeting on December 15.

Director Hoy added that he has worked with Marta and she is a dynamo.  She will be good in this role.

Director Tobiassen agreed with the statements made by Director Walker.  He stated that Virtegic also has a new person with much depth who will be stepping up to the plate.

Chair Sisk indicated that he has been having conversations with Virtegic and communications.  It is unfortunate that this was personal and people took personal hits.  He does not like to see anyone get hurt.  He thinks this is a good solution and he will support this action.

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed with four committee members (Sisk, Hoy, Tobiassen and Walker) and 1 opposed (Menten)

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

## III. December Board Meeting Agenda Review

Motion:              Director Hoy made the motion to move the full agenda with corrections noted forward to the December 15 Board meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Menten inquired how the motion to take from the table on the Virtegic contract will work.  Paula Perdue explained that the motion that the Executive Committee approved becomes a substitute motion.  At the Board meeting, a motion will be made to take the contract from the table.  Someone will need to substitute the motion with the new motion.  Assuming the action to take from the table passes, they will resume their normal discussions on this action.  Amendments and other changes may be made as recommended and voted upon.

Director Francone offered to make the substitute motion since she was the one to request tabling the action in the last Board meeting.

Director Bagley requested IGM Genova to give him the votes on each of the recommended actions.

The committee noted two errors on the agenda: The proposed 2015 internal audit plan did not pass as unanimous as indicated and the Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride contract should have been on unanimous consent.  Paula Perdue acknowledged the errors and stated her staff would make proper corrections.

Chair Sisk noted that a number of people are abstaining without stating a reason.  He referenced the ByLaws where a reason should be given for abstention.  Director Walker commented there is a finite number of reasons for abstaining.  Director Menten noted that there appear to be more people abstaining for really no good reason.  We are elected officials to make some of the hard decisions.

Vote on the Motion:              The motion passed with the Committee in agreement.

Chair Sisk declared the motion PASSED.

#### B. 2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-a-Ride

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Via Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation in costs incurred as a result of the assignment of additional Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand in 2015.  The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $686,000.
