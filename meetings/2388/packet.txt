2016 FasTracks Public Information Consultant
Contract Award

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the Executive Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the Interim
General Manager and CEO to approve the fourth one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated
as the FasTracks Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the
period of performance through 2016, the final year of the contract. The scope of work is negotiated
annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant Staff, and awarded annually by the RTD Board of
Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment is for an amount not to exceed
$602,163.20 for the year 2016. Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels
with the elimination of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions for 2016
and there is no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget for the fourth -year 2016
extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original fourth-year 2016 proposal. Funds for the award
are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
BACKGROUND
Utilizing a Public Information Consultant team to extend the staffing needs of the FasTracks Public
Information Program contributes to the agency’s Board adopted goal to Advance/Complete
FasTracks.
In October 2011, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for a Public Information, Communications and
Public Outreach Consultant to serve as an extension of staff in the implementation of the FasTracks
Public Information Program. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, Virtegic Group,
Incorporated, a certified SBE firm, was selected for this contract award, at a rate that was
approximately half that of the previous Public Information Consultant.
The procurement was set up as a one-year contract award with four one-year options, negotiated
annually by RTD and Consultant Staff and awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors. This gives
RTD the opportunity to assess and address the public information and outreach needs of the
FasTracks program on an annual basis as the program evolves. The services needed through this
contract may be reduced or increased from year to year depending on the future financial situation
and changing needs of the FasTracks program.
Virtegic began its work in January 2012 and the RTD Board approved three previous option years
through 2015. In the three years of working as the FasTracks public information consultant so far,
the Virtegic team members have satisfactorily performed their work assignments and have remained
flexible in meeting the needs of the public information program during several key staff transitions.
They are also playing a key role in augmenting RTD Public Relations outreach, as FasTracks projects
begin transitioning into base system operational services.
DISCUSSION
The initial contract to Virtegic for 2012 was in the amount of $451,459.20. The first one -year

Packet Pg. 6

1.2.1

option for 2013 was $485,167.20. The second one-year option for 2014 was $487,308.80. The
third one-year option for 2015 was $686,009.60. The fourth one-year option for 2016 is not to
exceed $602,163.20 bringing the total on this contract to $2,712,108.00. It is crucial that proper
amounts of staff who have direct experience with RTD’s programs, procedures and policies be in
place to provide adequate resources for the unprecedented five rapid transit line openings in 2016,
something with which no other transit agency has ever been tasked.
The FasTracks Public Information Program is implemented through six functional areas: Internal
Relations, Government Relations, Media Relations, Public Involvement, Public Outreach, and Crisis
Communications. The 2016 PIC scope of work is divided into the PI Program’s functional areas.
The 2016 Scope of Work is as follows:

members and three part-time staff members.



A seven percent Small Business Enterprise (SBE) goal is assigned to this contract.
However, 100 percent of the work effort on this contract is SBE-performed given that
Virtegic is a certified SBE.



Please note that the headcount has been reduced below 2015 levels with the elimination
of the Senior Public Outreach Specialist and no additional positions for 2016 and there is
no increase in hourly rates, which has reduced the budget for the fourth-year 2016
extension by $143,248.32 compared to the original fourth-year 2016 proposal.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for this fourth and final one-year option are included in the 2016 Recommended Budget for
the FasTracks program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the fourth and final
one-year option to the Virtegic Group, Incorporated as the FasTracks Public Information,
Communications and Public Outreach Consultant, extending the period of performance through
2016. The scope of work is negotiated annually between RTD and the Virtegic Consultant staff, and
awarded annually by the RTD Board of Directors at the discretion of RTD. This contract amendment
is for an amount not to exceed $602,163.20 for the year 2016, the final year of the contract.

Packet Pg. 8

1.2.1

Funds for the award are contained in the 2016 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks program.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Reconsider the Public Information Consultant approach.
This is not recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have the staff to provide a sufficient level of
resources to meet the public information, communications and public outreach needs of the
FasTracks program and specific FasTracks design and construction projects, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016. This alternative would
delay and negatively impact the effective implementation of the FasTracks Public Information
Program.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager to approve the
fourth and final one-year option to Virtegic Group, Incorporated. Issue another Request for
Proposals for professional services for Public Information, Communications and Public Outreach
for the FasTracks Program and award a contract to another consulting team. This is not
recommended as the Virtegic team is satisfactorily performing its work and has been flexible in
meeting the changing communication needs of the FasTracks program. Also, this alternative will
delay and negatively impact the successful implementation of the various strategies and activities
associated with a comprehensive and multi-layered communications effort, especially given the
fact that RTD is opening an unprecedented five major transit lines in 2016.

2015 Year End Budget Transfer for Access-aRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the purchased transportation service and fuel line items of the Via
Mobility budgets to the service line item of the Transdev On Demand budget to cover the variation in
costs incurred as a result of the assignment of additional Access-a-Ride service to Transdev On Demand
in 2015. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $686,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) different service providers, All Aboard Transit, MV
Transportation, Via Mobility Services, and Transdev On Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride
paratransit services under four (4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard, MV,
and Via) operate RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. These vehicles are “dedicated” to the
provision of Access-a-Ride service. The fourth provider (Transdev On Demand) uses Transdev-owned
vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. These vehicles are not dedicated to the provision of
Access-a-Ride service, but are also used to provide traditional taxi cab service. The current Accessa-Ride contracts were implemented in April of 2014 following the re-bid of the service in 2013. The
current Access-a-Ride service model is a change from the previous service model. Previously, the
service had been provided by four (4) providers (MV Transportation, Global Transportation, Horizon
coach Lines, and Via Mobility Services) all using RTD-provided vehicles.
DISCUSSION:
At the time the current Access-a-Ride service contracts were implemented, the three dedicatedvehicle providers (All Aboard, MV and Via) were all planning to hire a portion of the operators that
were employed by Global Transportation. Due to ongoing Union negotiations at the time, the
providers were not able to specify the exact benefits that operators would receive once they
transitioned from Global to a new employer. As a result, a large number of former Global operators
decided to find employment elsewhere. From the onset of the contracts, the three dedicated vehicle
providers struggled to hire sufficient numbers of employees to meet the service demands. Despite
aggressive hiring campaigns, each or the dedicated vehicle service providers continues to request
limitations on the level of service that they are requested to provide. The combination of hiring
challenges due to the low unemployment rate, legalization of marijuana in the State of Colorado, and
the ever increasing pattern of traffic congestion, forced the Access-a-Ride Call Center to assign more
and more service to Transdev taxi cab service. It appears that the forces working against the
dedicated vehicle providers being able to hire drivers, has not had the same limiting effect on the cab
industry.
The reliance on Transdev taxi service to absorb the Access-a-Ride service that the dedicated vehicle
providers have been unable to provide has resulted in an increase in the 2015 costs for Transdev and
a decrease in 2015 costs for the dedicated vehicle providers. Consequently, it is necessary to

Packet Pg. 10

2.14.B

transfer budgeted funds from dedicated vehicle providers budgets to the Transdev budget in order to
pay for service provided through the end of 2015.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
There is no financial impact. There are currently budgeted dollars available in the Via service and fuel
budgets that can be transferred into the Transdev On Demand service budget.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.
Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay invoices for
Transdev On Demand service through the end of 2015.
2.

Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will require
staff to locate additional sources for budget funding to pay invoices for Transdev On Demand
service.

Award of Evergreen Call-n-Ride Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with the Seniors’
Resource Center for the provision of the “Evergreen Call-n-Ride” contracted demand response transit
services. This contract is for three years with two (2) one-year options. The contract amount
includes $1,597,481 for service for the first three years and $99,217 for fuel for the first three years
for a total amount not to exceed $1,696,698 for the first three years. The contract amount also
includes two (2) one-year options in the amounts of $564,187 for service and $35,075 for fuel for a
total of $599,262 for option year 1; and $580,848 for service and $36,127 for fuel for a total of
$616,975 for option year 2. The total contract amount for the five year period is not to exceed
$2,742,516 in service and $170,419 in fuel for a total of $2,912,935. These costs are based on an
hourly rate and include estimated fuel costs, which will be treated as a “pass-through” (RTD will
reimburse the Contractor’s actual direct fuel costs). This proposal represents the most responsive
and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 15DH099, to provide
“Evergreen Call-n-Ride” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to begin January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND:
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive, or “Call-n-Ride” service can
be described as shared-ride public transit service provided in a defined service area that requires that
the passenger contact the service provider to arrange for pick-up.
As a supplement to RTD fixed-route service, “Call-n-Ride” service has been operating in Evergreen
since March 2002. This service will continue to supplement and complement existing RTD fixedroute services operating in the area. The service area for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride can generally be
described as the same area as the Evergreen Metropolitan Water District.
Call-n-Ride service will continue to be provided on weekdays from 5:30 AM to 7:00 PM with two
vehicles serving the area. Saturday service will operate 9:00 AM TO 7:00 PM with one vehicle. No
service is offered on Sundays/holidays.

DISCUSSION:
One (1) proposal was received in response to Request For Proposals (RFP) 15DH099 for the provision of
the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response service. The proposal was received from the current Call-nRide Contractor, the Seniors’ Resource Center. The limited response to the RFP was primarily due to
two factors: 1) Because of the physical location of Evergreen, it may be impractical for other local
contractors to bid on a service that would require excessive deadhead; and 2) Potential contractors also
feel that it was impractical to try to supervise an Evergreen operation from Denver; locating on-site
operations in Evergreen would most likely be cost prohibitive given this size of the contract. The

Packet Pg. 12

2.14.C

Seniors’ Resource Center currently provides non-profit transportation services in Evergreen and has an
established operations center in the area.
It is the recommendation of the RTD staff that evaluated the proposal received in response to RFP
15DH099, that RTD award the contract for the Evergreen Call-n-Ride demand response services to the
Seniors’ Resource Center. This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposal according
to the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established
for this procurement were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b)
experience/qualifications (30%); and c) price (35%).
The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services, Pat Heye,
Alternative Service Planner and Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services. The Seniors’ Resource
Center (SRC) has been providing the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service since March 2002. SRC has provided
excellent service to the community as well as to the RTD. After reviewing both the technical and cost
proposals, it was the consensus of the evaluation team that the Seniors’ Resource Center presented an
acceptable proposal and offered a realistic price to provide the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of service under this contract are included in the adopted 2016 RTD budget.
Funds will be requested in future years’ budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES
1)
Award the contract to the Seniors’ Resource Center.
2)
Resolicit the provision of the Evergreen Call-n-Ride service.

Authorization to enter into fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics for a new RTD
Trip Planner (15DJ005)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to enter into a $763,757.00 fixed-price contract
with Cambridge Systematics, Inc. (CS) for design, development, testing, and release of RTD’s new Trip
Planner.
BACKGROUND:
Currently, trip planning is done by individual RTD riders through the RTD website by using a trip planner
powered by Google Transit and also internally by Customer Care agents using outdated TranStar
software. RTD (Customer Care and Marketing) has encountered a number of growing challenges:
 The two current solutions do not allow adequate flexibility to customize planning for a rider’s trip.
As an example, there are very limited means to set acceptable walk distances that meet RTD’s
standards or that properly define potentially hazardous physical boundaries.
 The current trip planners constrain RTD from making desired enhancements and customizations
that are now the standard of the transit industry.
 The two trip planners do not always provide the same itineraries for the same trip request,
resulting in conflicting schedules and routes that confuse would-be passengers.
 The current trip planner limitations result in a significant amount of unnecessary trip planningrelated calls directed to the RTD call center that impact wait times for customers who have other
information needs.
The purpose of this project is to implement a new trip planner that better meets the needs of RTD’s
Riders as well as internal Customer Care department:







To enhance the Trip Planning experience of riders:
o More options to plan trips (enter a stop, etc.)
o Permit users to explore, change, refresh, reverse, email, print, save trip plans etc.
o Accessible to all users with a wide-range of abilities.
To increase efficiencies and reduce the number of unnecessary trip planning-related calls that
come into the Customer Care call center.
To ensure that riders and Customer Care agents have quick access to the same trip planning
data.
To ensure that the trip planner product is flexible and can be customized and scaled to meet the
changing needs of our riders and RTD as an organization.
To reduce from two to one the number of trip planner tools utilized, funded and managed by
RTD.

Packet Pg. 14

2.14.D

DISSCUSSION:
In early 2015, RTD completed an extensive requirements gathering effort with product owners and IT
experts to identify the overall system requirements as well as what requirements could be met out-ofbox versus what requirements would have to be custom-developed.
After a lengthy analysis process, RTD has selected OpenTripPlanner (OTP) as the new trip planning
system for use by both Customer Care employees and our riding public. OpenTripPlanner (OTP) is an
Open Source, Multi-Modal Trip Planning System (OS MMTPS) collaboratively developed by a team of
developers from across the globe and coordinated by TriMet, Portland’s transit agency. TriMet’s trip
planner, using Open Trip Planner can be found on their website here: http://trimet.org/.
As an open source product, there are no recurring software licensing costs or the attendant licensing
limitations to RTD. RTD will have access to the source code of the system as well as access to an open
development community. RTD and Cambridge Systematics will contribute back to the developer
community with ideas and new code development (as part of the open-source licensing agreement).
While the Open Trip Planner tool will provide significant, comprehensive functionality out-of-the box, it
will also require customized modifications to meet RTD’s specific and local needs – this development
effort represents a major component of the project’s budget and scope.
RTD’s Information Technology department does not have human resource capacity to develop and
configure the customizations in the timeframe required. Thus, a 3rd party software development service
provider with experience in developing trip planners with open-source products is required. The proposed
contract’s completion is eight months
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of the OpenTripPlanner development, warrant and support is $763,757.00. Funding
for this project is included in the 2015 SBP.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Cambridge
Systematics, Inc. to design, develop, test, and release a single new trip planner system that
meets both the needs of RTD’s riders and RTD Customer Care agents. This is the
recommended action.
2. Continue the use of the existing trip planner tools. This solution does not address RTD rider
needs, will continue to increase demands on Customer Services personnel and requires
ongoing resources and funding to support two separate systems.
3. Advance the development and configuration of the Open Trip Planner utilizing IT resources.
This would significantly delay the delivery of the planner and would require diverting already
busy IT staff from current priority projects.

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Approval of 2016 Granite Paver Maintenance
Contract Amendment for 16th Street Mall
Transitway Lanes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the Interim General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end
date from the current end date of July 31, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract
value by $1,000,000 to a total of $3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016
Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
RTD has maintained the granite pavers on 16th St. Mall Transitway since the mall was constructed in
1982. In 2013 the City and County of Denver committed to participate in the cost of maintenance and
pay RTD 30% of the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an annual maximum of $300,000.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. Gallegos is the current contractor performing
maintenance on the Transitway. Historically, Gallegos has utilized eight employees and material vendors
that supported approximately 10 to 20 jobs for each Work Order (WO). As needed, granite pavers are
purchased from a separate vendor (Cold Spring Granite).
The current maintenance contract was a three year contract that was awarded midyear 2013. This
amendment to extend the end date brings the contract period into alignment with our annual expense
budget. During the initial two years of the contract, the Mall required a greater amount of maintenance
than anticipated, and RTD has expended the total amount anticipated over the full three years of the
contract award. This amendment increases the total contract value to allow for expected activity for the
remainder of the third year of the contract as well as the five month extension to the end of 2016.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The available budget for Mall paver repairs in the 2016 Adopted Budget is $1,000,000, which will cover
the cost of this contract in 2016.

2.15.E

DBE / SBE GOAL
All work has and will be completed by a single contractor which is self-classified as a Woman Minority
Business Enterprise (WMBE). There was no DBE / SBE Goal established for the original contract.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract for 16th Street Mall maintenance with the Gallegos
Corporation (Gallegos), to extend the contract end date from the current end date of July 31,
2016 to December 31, 2016 and increase the total Contract value by $1,000,000 to a total of
$3,764,183.96. Funding for this action is included in the 2016 Adopted Budget.
2. Do not accept the recommended action. Require a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) be issued for the
next 16th Street Mall Granite Maintenance contract, to be awarded on or before July 31, 2016,
and suspend all Work Orders when contract value funds are exhausted before the current end of
the contract term. This is not recommended as it will result in the deterioration of the mall pavers
with the resulting potential for pedestrian tripping hazards and damage to the mall shuttles,
possibly resulting in the suspension of shuttle service.

and

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution which adopts the Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has two policies, Resolution 10, Series of 1984 and Resolution 35, Series of 2002, which
govern the disposition of real property and the joint development of real property. The Board has also
granted authorization for real property transactions under the grants of authority given for the FasTracks
infrastructure projects. As those projects currently under construction come to completion, an updated
policy is needed that provides for a consistent and efficient method of managing RTD’s real property
assets.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. Minor changes and clarifications have been
made to the November draft and are attached, showing track changes, to this Board report, as
Attachment A.
The proposed resolution repeals the existing resolutions and adopts the attached Policy for Joint
Development and Disposition of Real Property.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The policy identifies process and guidelines for disposition of real property or joint development of real
property, and as such has no financial impact in and of itself. The financial impact of any disposition or
joint development will be considered on a case by case basis as it arises.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action: It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts the attached Resolution which adopts the
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action: Do not adopt the attached Resolution.

I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. During the course of
implementing the regional transit system, the District has acquired and will in the future
acquire various real property interests for transit related uses. As the District’s needs change
over time, real property once needed for transit purposes may no longer be needed and may
be disposed of, or may be utilized more efficiently and effectively if combined with transit
supportive uses in a joint development project. This policy replaces prior District policies on
disposition and joint development, including Resolution 10, Series of 1984, and Resolution 35,
Series of 2002, and identifies procedures for authorizing the disposition of excess real property,
or the joint development of District real property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has no current or future transit
interest.
3. Fair Market Value: The amountprice at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.
4. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
5. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopts
the attached Resolution
BACKGROUND
RTD currently has no formal policy that holistically addresses unsolicited proposals for joint development
or unsolicited offers to acquire excess real property. RTD’s unsolicited proposal policy for goods and
services explicitly excludes real property while RTD’s Strategic Plan for Transit Oriented Development
provides general guidance for reviewing unsolicited development proposals, but needs additional
clarifying regarding process for selection of a development partner.
DISCUSSION
Staff has presented an overview of the issues and proposed policy as updates in June and August, and
provided a draft of the policy for Board review in November. During the November update, and in
comments provided to staff, Board Directors have expressed concerns about the sole source criteria
identified in the joint development context, and have asked for some additional process clarifications. A
comparison version showing tracked changes for the proposed changes to the policy is attached as
Attachment A.
As a result of those comments, staff recommends the following modifications to the policy draft
provided in November.
1) For joint development proposals, the District will accept unsolicited proposals, but will
advertise all joint development opportunities competitively. A chart illustrating the unsolicited
joint development proposal review process is attached to the policy.
2) For excess real property, the District may enter into negotiations with a contiguous property
owner without a competitive solicitation when the District property is configured in a way that it
cannot be developed as a stand-alone parcel due to factors such as size, shape, or access.

The proposed resolution repeals Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TOD and adopts the attached
Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property.

DRAFT UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL POLICY FOR REAL PROPERTY
I. Background and Purpose:
The Regional Transportation District (the “District”) was created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. In 2010, the District
adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for TODTransit Oriented Development
(revised, 2010) and establishes policies and procedures for the review of unsolicited proposals
from third parties wishing to acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development
of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current
or future transit interest.
3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period of time which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior
to Board approval. During the Exclusive Negotiation Period, the District will not market
the property or consider alternate proposals for disposition or joint development.
4. Fair Market Value: The amountprice at which property would change hands between a
willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell,
and both having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.

5. Federal Interest: The dollar amount that is the product of (a) the federal share of total
project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project
costs, or as otherwise provided under current FTA guidance.1
6. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.

III. Policy:
A. Purchase Offers for Excess Property:
The following process will govern third party offers to acquire excess District Property.
1. Availability of District Property:
a. The District will maintain a list of excess property which is available for
disposition. Anyone interested in acquiring property from the District, which is
not identified on the excess property list must submit a written inquiry to
determine if the property is available for disposition:

UNSOLICITED PROPOSAL POLICY FOR REAL PROPERTY
I. Background and Purpose:

General Assembly to plan for, develop, maintain and operate a regional mass transportation
system; in establishing the District, the General Assembly found that the system was necessary
for economic development, commerce and the reduction of air pollution. In 2010, the District
adopted the Revised Strategic Plan for TOD (Resolution 17 Series of 2010), in order to enhance
the value and effectiveness of transit in the district by increasing ridership, and providing
opportunities for enhanced transit infrastructure. The goal of this policy is to encourage
innovation in leveraging RTD’s real property assets while establishing a consistent process and
transparent criteria for review and acceptance of any unsolicited proposals.
This policy replaces Section 3.4.2 of the Strategic Plan for Transit Oriented Development
(revised, 2010) and establishes policies and procedures for the review of unsolicited proposals
from third parties wishing to acquire excess District Property or proposing a joint development
of District Property.
II. Definitions:
1. Contiguous Real Property: Sharing a common boundary; touching. Property separated
by public right of way is not contiguous.
2. Excess Real Property: Property in which the District has determined there is no current
or future transit interest.
3. Exclusive Negotiation Period: period of time which is granted to an entity to exclusively
negotiate with RTD staff the terms of a property disposition or joint development prior
to Board approval. During the Exclusive Negotiation Period, the District will not market
the property or consider alternate proposals for disposition or joint development.
4. Fair Market Value: The price at which property would change hands between a willing
buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or to sell, and both
having reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.

project costs, and (b)current fair market value of the property, improvements or both,
to the extent the costs of acquiring or improving the property were included as project

6. Joint Development: A public transportation project that integrally relates to, and often
co-locates with commercial, residential, mixed-use, or other non-transit development.
7. Project Property: Any real property or improvements included in the costs of an FTAassisted project, or as otherwise provided under current Federal Transit Administration

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager
and CEO

Date: December 1, 2015

From:

Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager,
Rail Operations

GM

Date:

December 1, 2015

Board Meeting Date: December 15, 2015

Subject:

Approval of General Manager Authority
Regarding Eagle Project Operations and
Maintenance Annual Costs

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors pass
the attached resolution authorizing the Interim General Manager to execute all necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation
and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously
executed Concession Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. A copy of that 2010 resolution is attached as
Exhibit A. The Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project extends to December 31, 2044 and includes
the design, construction, finance, operation and maintenance of the Project during that time period. The
authority provided by the Board in June 2010 allowed the General Manager to negotiate and execute all
necessary agreements, work orders, change orders and amendments for the construction phase of the
project in accordance with Resolution #10 and within the amount of $2.386 billion.
The attached resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work
orders, change orders and amendments for the operations and maintenance phase of the Concession, all
within the Board approved annual budget, and pursuant to any service changes authorized by the Board
for each runboard. Because capital expenditures are generally included in the annual budget and
programmed in the Strategic Budget Plan for years prior to approval, and the budget and runboard
changes are approved by the Board, this grant of authority will avoid the need for a separate Board
action for contract amendments or change orders to implement those Board approved expenditures and
changes.
DISCUSSION
Operations and maintenance of the Eagle Project is included in the Board approved Concession
Agreement. Payments for operation and maintenance are included in annual availability payments to be
made to Denver Transit Partners (DTP) under the Concession Agreement. A portion of each year’s
availability payment for operation and maintenance will be a part of the RTD annual budget. A portion

Packet Pg. 51

2.15.H

of the availability payment will be made directly by a trustee out of RTD sales tax receipts. Availability
payments under the Concession Agreement will commence in 2016.
It is anticipated that over time there may be a need to request that items serving the Eagle Project be
built or modified, and to modify service just as RTD monitors and adjusts all of its services to adapt to
customer needs. These changes will, if necessary, be negotiated as contract amendments, separate
agreements, or change orders with DTP or its subsidiaries. Each year staff will include the annual
appropriation amount of availability payments in the RTD annual budget, whether solely for the originally
contracted costs, or for additional capital or increased or modified service. Without the attached
Resolution, contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General
Manager’s Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s
approval of the budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget and service changes
by the Board, staff will notify DTP and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the
required commuter rail operations and maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the
coming year. This process is clearly defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year through 2044.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service
Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to execute all necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with Denver
Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries for the operation and maintenance and any additional
capital requirements for the Eagle Project pursuant to the previously executed Concession
Agreement in accord with the Board approved annual budget and service changes.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change
as frequently as may be required.

Subject:

Proposed 2015 Internal Audit Plan

Discussion

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the proposed plan of internal audits to be performed in 2016.
BACKGROUND
The annual internal audit plan has historically been approved by the General Manager. As a result of the
State of Colorado examination, it was agreed that the Board of Directors would also approve the internal
audit plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached plan includes the calculated number of days available for auditing, as well as the audit plan
and an estimate of the days allocated for each audit. A total of twenty (20) audits are planned including
IT audits. Due to budget constraints, there are no outside audits scheduled for this year.
The plan is based on estimates of the time required to complete the audits. As in past years, it utilizes
every available business day. If other audits arise during the year, we will request the input of the Board
as to which audits are to be eliminated to accommodate the added audit/audits.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Do not approve the proposed plan. This is not recommended. The plan was developed including
input from numerous sources throughout the District and also includes the audits annually
required by the Board. Delaying the start of audit work will limit the days available for fieldwork
and could require a reduction in overall audit presence in the District.
