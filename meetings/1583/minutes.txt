Motion:

Second:

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion: The motion passed unanimously.

b. 2009 Amended Budget – Robert Merriman presented this action item. The
amended budget occurs on an annual basis for the purpose of adjusting
revenues to our best estimates for the current year; incorporate all previously
approved transfers into the current year budget, to request other expenditure
adjustments, to adjust the capital carryover to align with the audited figures for
2008.
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2009 to amend and appropriate
funds for the proposed 2009 Amended Budget, to decrease the appropriation by
$(111,402,450) to $1,234,119,681 as detailed below in the Overview of the
2009 Budget Amendment, and to decrease the appropriation of Capital
Carryforward (Previously Approved Capital Funds) by $(129,262,471) to
$296,757,845.
Director Christopher noticed a few places where budgets had increased due to
increase in headcount and wondered how they relate to the hiring freeze. Phil
Washington said that every one of the positions had been looked at and were all
deemed mission critical.
Director Martinez asked about the draw down to the Transit Development
Reserve. Terry Howerter explained that we are drawing down on reserves but
are holding on to our commercial paper reserve and TABOR reserve. Most
governmental entities are drawing on reserves at this time to balance their
budgets.
Director Christopher asked for Mr. Howerter’s latest thinking on sales tax. Mr.
Howerter responded that 9.6% down on sales tax will be added to the amended
budget if that is the direction the Board goes after the discussion on the TDP.
Mr. Howerter also shared that due to State legislation, a piece of the vendor
allowances has been eliminated (the amount they get to keep for processing
sales tax), and the allowance was left on RTD collections. Also the State is
now collecting sales tax on cigarette sales but RTD does not get sales tax
money off of that. Staff has taken these conditions into account with
calculating the new sales tax projections.
Motion:

Director Martinez made a motion to
forward the item to the August 18,
2009 Board Meeting Agenda subject

to the board’s direction on sales tax.
Second:

Director Chacon seconded the motion.

Vote on
Motion: The motion passed unanimously.

II.

Second Quarter 2009 Investment Report– There were no questions on this report.

III. Second Quarter 2009 Internal Audit Report - Bill Holmes, Senior Internal Auditor reported
that before next November he will be ramping up the hiring process to fill the Senior
Auditor position and increase the number of internal audits.
IV. June Financial Status Report - Robert Merriman shared that the recession is really
affecting our numbers; ridership is down and sales tax did not get the traditional June
bump.
V. Update on TCRP Revenue Sources – This item was tabled until the September
committee meeting.
VI. Update on American Recovery and Reinvestment Act – Mr. Howerter gave a brief
update. The District was required to obligate 50% of the funds by September 1, 2009.
At this time, 100% of the ARRA funds have been obligated; all projects are approved
and submitted to the FTA with the exception of the late grant for the West Corridor.
The RFP for the fareboxes went out and two proposals are under review. PRs have been
issued for the rail pandril clips, the District Shops roof, and the Platte hoist. The four car
platforms will be coming to the Board for approval on August 18, 2009.
Director McMullen spoke about seeing the CDOT signs identifying ARRA funds and can
RTD do the same so people can see what we are doing with the funds.
VII. 2010 Budget Update – Robert Merriman reported that on August 25, 2009 staff will be
presenting the requested budget for 2010.
VIII. 2010-2015 TDP – Terry Howerter reviewed different mitigation options for the TDP. At
this time staff does not feel that there is enough time to affect the 2010 budget with
new revenue ideas. He asked for the Committee’s input. There was a lengthy
discussion regarding mitigation ideas. In general the Committee was not in favor of a
fare increase. The Committee was in favor of drawing down the reserve. There was
support for looking at service changes totaling less than a million dollars. Some Board
members supported employee furloughs (as long as they were not mandatory) and some
did not.

Director McMullen suggested maybe doing away with transfers instead of a fare
increase.

Director Martinez would like to see all other options exhausted before cutting service.
Chair Tayer stressed his concern about service cuts. Our business is providing transit
service. If we cut too much, it impacts our ability to meet our core mission. Chair Tayer
asked staff to explore what novel things transit agencies across the nation are doing to
provide reduced fares low income patrons.
Director McMullen would really like to see fare enforcement stepped up on the light rail
and on bus routes outside of Denver.
Director Tobiassen asked for an update on arbitration since we do not know how that
will affect the budget. Phil Washington said that the arbitrator has finished his hearings
and the final ruling is expected in October 2009.
IX. RTD Pass Program Committee Update – Chair Tayer shared that the Board should be
receiving a recommendation in September or October. Five meetings have been held so
far. Key consensus elements of the proposed pricing formula the committee is
developing are 1- make sure program is economically sustainable and builds ridership for
RTD, 2 – all proposals will be revenue neutral for RTD.
X. Other Matters – There were no other matters discussed.
XI. Next Meeting – The next meeting of the Financial Administration Committee will be
September 8, 2009.
