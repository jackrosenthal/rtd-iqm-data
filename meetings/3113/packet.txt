• Ridership across the U.S. transit industry and RTD has been
declining the past 5 years.

• The largest drops have come from traditional transit riders including

CONTEXT.

lower-income, minority and disadvantaged groups where car
ownership has increased in a good economy.

• Due to RTD’s increased investment in rail and BRT service,

discretionary ridership has maintained or increased somewhat
among the more affluent suburban commuters.

• But with COVID, lower income and disadvantaged groups constitute
a large majority of workers that are still most dependent on transit

• Higher income office workers are more likely to be able to work
from home and have a car available for their commute.

compiles data from two runboards for comparison
between a “normal” time period and the current
Pandemic situation
• April 2019 (4/28 – 5/18, 2019)
• Pandemic 2020 (4/1 - 6/11, 2020)

• The pandemic service plan, basically a Saturday level of

service on weekdays and weekend service retained, was
implemented on April 19, 2020
• The Mall shuttle was restored at similar levels on
June 21
• Additional service on Routes 15L, 40, 105, and 121 to
accommodate loads was implemented on May 26
• Fares were restored on July 1

RIDERSHIP BY HOUR OF DAY.
Ridership by hour of the day has very significantly changed
• Gone are the familiar camel humps of the morning and evening peak periods
• Weekends, with mostly transit dependent riders, retain nearly half their ridership

Packet Pg. 16

RIDERSHIP RETENTION OVERALL & BY SERVICE TYPE.
• This table provides a comparison as the percent retention calculated by dividing the
Pandemic boardings by the April 2019 boardings.

• Local service has by far the highest weekday retention at 45% with commuter rail next
at 30%. A third tier combines light rail, SkyRide and FlexRide at about 23%, and then
the Flatiron Flyer and regional services at about 13% on weekdays.

• Weekends retain a considerably higher proportion of ridership across the board except
for commuter rail and SkyRide.

2.1.a

• Local and weekend service riders are predominantly

people dependent on transit for much of their travel.

WHY.

• Light rail (and FlexRide) is heavily dependent upon

downtown and large suburban office commuters who
may now be working from home.

• The Flatiron Flyer and other regional services are even
more heavily peak, commuter office workers.

• SkyRide is dependent upon airline employment and air
travel, which has been impacted as badly as public
transit.

Packet Pg. 18

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

RIDERSHIP & RETENTION
BY ROUTE.
• Retention is a key indicator of both the

resilience of the route and how intensely our
customers rely on it.

• Half of the currently operating 93 bus routes
and train lines have 40% or more ridership
retention.

• Strong routes with good service are best at
retaining ridership

• For rail, only the C Line has moderate

retention and indicates that the Southwest
Corridor may have a larger share of transit
dependent workers than other lines.

Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

MAXIMUM LOADS.
• Social distancing requirements have

imposed severe constraints on the use of
transit vehicle capacity.

• RTD is limiting the occupancy of our

vehicles to 15 for a 40’ bus, 20 for a 60’
bus, and 30 per rail car.

• Not many routes are failing this metric at
this time.

• Bus Operations dispatches additional buses
as needed to relieve overloads.

Packet Pg. 20

POTENTIAL RECOVERY SCENARIOS.
• The following charts show ridership retention by week as a percent of the stated baseline for
RTD and New York City.

• These charts are more confirming of the pandemic’s effects than helpful for predicting ridership
recovery near or long term.

Packet Pg. 21

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

SERVICE – VEHICLES REQUIREMENTS & VEHICLE HOURS.
• Pandemic weekday hours are 58% of April19 compared to 32% for ridership, thus we
observe relatively empty vehicles.

• Vehicle requirements are 46% of April19 which is significantly above ridership retention,
but significantly below service hours retention. That is a good thing and a result of the
flattening of the boardings by hour camel humps.

Packet Pg. 22

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR SERVICE RESTORATION.
• At this time our ridership is almost entirely those who rely on transit as their only means of
transportation.

• There will be a need to focus on consistent all-day service to help those that rely on transit—
the equity markets.

• How will RTD adhere to social distancing requirements as ridership increases, especially

difficult for routes on the cusp of attaining max loads and have good ridership retention?

• Service proposals need to follow RTD’s Service Policies & Standards, including Title VI. To

conserve resources RTD will need to reduce service on routes with low ridership and loads.

• We will need to work closely with employers, schools and colleges regarding their plans for
return to work and classes, as these are our main source of riders.

• RTD will need to continue to follow the requirements of the CBA in the formulation of service
changes.

PRINCIPLES AND
PROCESS MOVING
FORWARD.

2020.

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

Packet Pg. 24

#1
Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe: We
will strive to keep our communities connected and our riders,
employees and region healthy and safe.

#2

DRAFT COVID-19
BUDGET
REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES.

Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be
creative: We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions
and do so in such a way as to align with our mission. Accordingly,
service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded
approach by incorporating reductions in overhead, breaking down
silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative approaches to
service delivery.

#3
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit
during the pandemic: We will strive to maximize mobility during the
pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services
to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.

Packet Pg. 25

Attachment: Board Study Session - August 4th (4288 : The Path Moving Forward - Finances and Service)

2.1.a

#4
We will support and value all of our employees. We acknowledge
our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the
public and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We
also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage
categories, because a humane work environment is valued by
RTD.

#5

DRAFT COVID-19
BUDGET
REDUCTION
PRINCIPLES.

Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and
expertise: We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to
decision-making for the COVID period, while planning for the midterm financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through
the Re-Imagine project, the accountability committee, and
stakeholders.

#6
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input: We will take active
measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of
CARES Act money as well as in the decision-making process for
measures we adopt to respond to ongoing COVID financial
impacts.
