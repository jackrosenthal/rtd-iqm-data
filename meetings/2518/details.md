There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. Local Update - CRL Associates

Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, indicated that ten RTD candidates were deemed sufficient for November’s election.  He noted that four of the districts (D, F, G and H) are uncontested and the ballot placement for districts A, E, I and M occurred last week.  He stated that District A’s candidates are: Regan Byrd, Kate Williams, Aaron Goldhamer and Mike Cerbo.  District E’s candidates are Director Folska and JM Fay.  District I’s candidates are Véronique Marie Bellamy, Lee Kemp and Director Lubow.  Lee Kemp is a provisional candidate as he is protesting his signatures.  His appeal should be resolved this week and if he is still deemed insufficient, he will be removed from the ballot.  District M’s candidates are Dave Ruchman and Director Menten.  He added that there were several candidates across the district who were deemed insufficient, but they did not follow up with the proper paperwork to ensure their placement on the ballot.

Roger Sherman remarked that Mobility Choice is partnering with RTD, CDOT and DRCOG to complete a 2030 Blueprint.  He stated all of their funding is in place which totals $1.5 million.  He commented that it will be interesting to see what comes out of the study and what will be the next major idea.  Previously, RTD participated in the MPACT 64 analysis, which was a two-year study.

Director Lubow inquired if Jim Gunning, former Mayor of Lone Tree, was going to be the Chair for the study.  Roger Sherman indicated yes, he was.

Director Lubow asked if RTD had provided any funds towards the $1.5 million.  General Manager Genova stated staff will be bringing an action item to the Board in a few weeks to contribute a total of $500,000 to the study.  He added that CDOT and DRCOG have already funded their portions.

Director Lubow asked if the Mobility Choice Blueprint is for new technology.  Roger Sherman stated it is an issue that they are interested in, but transit is a critical piece as is general funding.

General Manager Genova remarked that staff will cover more details at the Financial Administration and Audit Committee.

Director Lubow commented that she thought this was previously completed without the $1.5 million price tag.  Roger Sherman stated that the MPACT 64 Study was done by the Metro Mayor’s Caucus and they used their staff to complete the analysis.

Director James asked if initiatives such as this were being developed in other metro areas across the county, and if so, what could be learned from them.  Roger Sherman said he was not sure if there were other studies similar to this one, but the goal is to see what new ideas may develop locally.

Director Menten stated there is a non-profit being formed which is funded by three government agencies, and RTD is reducing its oversight by funding a portion of the study.  She asked if RTD pushed for an initiative or referendum to the voters, how could RTD show transparency.

General Manager Genova remarked that the funds RTD, CDOT and DRCOG are contributing will go towards the Mobility Choice Blueprint.  He indicated that there will be an agreement which will determine how the money is to be used, and establish the scope.  He added that there will be a Board of Directors, and RTD will have a seat on that Board.  He stated that nothing is binding for future action, and it will be up to each entity to determine how they wish to move forward.

Director Anderson commented that she is not enthusiastic about this study, especially since RTD is strapped financially, and added that she does not see this study going anywhere.

Chair Tobiassen stated that he was at the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) meeting when this came up.  He remarked that Don Hunt presented the study to DRCOG and commented that it will include all aspects of transit, including transit for the transit dependent along the Colfax corridor.  He commented that it is unknown what transit will look like in 20 to 30 years, and if we do not participate in this new study, RTD will be putting its constituents in jeopardy.

#### 2. State Update - Brandeberry McKenna

Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry ~ McKenna (BBMK), stated that they along with General Manager Genova, Chair Tobiassen and Director Folska met with the Legislative Audit Committee while they were in session.  She added that the Audit Committee appreciates all that the Board has done.  She remarked that in the past, it was rare for a Board member to attend and for the current Directors to make time to attend shows the Board’s dedication.  She noted that BBMK anticipates a competitive election this year, and there are feverishly targeted races.  The conventional wisdom is that the House will remain Democratic control, but the Senate is a tossup.  She commented that there are three races in the metro area whose outcomes will determine the Colorado Senate.

Megan Wagner, BBMK, added that they attended a tour of the B line with Sherry Ellebracht and the Legislative Legal Services Committee.  She noted that the tour went well and everyone was impressed with the B line.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, stated that Congress went back into session today and will be out by the end of the month.  He commented that they have 17 days to pass a continuing resolution that will allow the Federal Government to continue working past October 1st.  He noted that there will be a lot of debate for the next three weeks as the Freedom Caucus would like the resolution to extend the date six months from October 1st, but the Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, indicated that would not happen.

Mike Dino added that Jeff Denham, the Chairman of the Federal Railroad Sub Committee, visited last Wednesday.  He commented that Chairman Denham was on a railroad tour of the west and he wanted to see Union Station while he was in Denver.  Chairman Denham was impressed with Union Station and the surrounding area, and was very interested in the P3 concept.  He added that Chair Tobiassen and Director Folska were able to meet with Chairman Denham and it was nice to have him here since he has such an important role.

Director Anderson commented that she has received several phone calls from constituents who are treated poorly by RTD’s Access-a-Ride.  She added that there needs to be some sort of triage to resolve this issue.
