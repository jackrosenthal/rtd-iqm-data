Subject:

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for September 6, 2016
1. RTD Candidate Update – Ten candidates have had their petitions deemed sufficient by

the Secretary of State. One candidate, Billy Robinson, failed to resubmit by the 8/15
deadline and two candidates, Lee Kemp and David Casiano, seeking to address their
earlier insufficiency had their resubmitted petitions again deemed insufficient. Districts
D, F, G, and H are uncontested. The Metro Mayors Caucus, Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce, Transit Alliance and area transportation management organizations will be
taping interviews of the candidates on September 15 to be made available to municipal
Channel 8 stations and shared via YouTube for cities that don’t have a Channel The
Secretary of State’s Office will hold a lot drawing to determine ballot order on September
1st. I will share results of the drawing at the LGR meeting.
2. Mobility Choice – Mobility Choice, a partnership among the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce, Colorado Department of Transportation, Regional Transportation District,
and Denver Regional Council of Governments, is the non-profit overseeing the
preparation of the 2030 Blueprint. Funding for the effort has been secured and we
anticipate that a Request for Qualifications will be issued soon.
3. Metro Mayors Caucus - The MMC also has reconvened its transportation task force to
begin discussing options for a metro-area solution to transportation funding. The process
to legally create and fund a metro-area regional transportation authority or other special
district is complicated and there are many unknowns as to how any such entity would
work with RTD.

Re:

Update

BBMK attended the Legislative Audit Committee meeting on August 22nd. General Manager
Dave Genova provided an update to the committee on the audit recommendations from the Bus
and Light Rail Train Operatory Safety Audit performed in 2015. The consensus from the Audit
Committee members is that the Audit was successful and provided significant safety
improvement measures and that RTD’s commitment to incorporating the suggestions was very
well received. Several RTD executive staff joined Director Genova which further demonstrated
the District’s commitment to working with the Audit Committee.
In order to prepare for the 2017 legislative session BBMK has been meeting with current
legislators and candidates. As is our practice BBMK will meet with all newly elected legislators
prior to the January session begins to update them on the District’s activities and interests.
BBMK assisted Legislative Legal Services in coordinating TLRC staff tour of the B line and
RTD’s presentation to TLRC on October 5th 9:00 am for our regularly scheduled briefing to the
committee. BBMK will report back on any bills drafts taken up during the TLRC meeting.
BBMK attended Chamber briefings regarding Mobility study and transportation infrastructure
investments.
BBMK continues to monitor ballot initiatives for any potential implications to the district.
In September the Joint Budget Committee will hear the revenue forecast. This forecast will be
helpful to determining the impact of the BP case on future budget work for FY 2017.

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: SEPTEMBER 6, 2016



With the end of the fiscal year (September 30) approaching, none of the twelve FY 2017
appropriations bills have been passed by both the House and Senate. It is widely anticipated
that both chambers will pass a short-term continuation of current-year funding levels for all
government programs and agencies by September 30, so there will not be a government
shut-down. The length of this short-term spending bill is still unclear, but the current
thinking is that House and Senate GOP leaders will have sufficient support to pass a 3month bill to carry programs until the Lame Duck session after the November election, over
any objections of Freedom Caucus conservatives who seek a 6-month CR into the Spring.
In November, Congress would then likely pass a full-year omnibus appropriations bill for
the remainder of the fiscal year.



Transportation Spending: FAST Act-funded surface transportation programs, including all
transit formula and New Starts grants, would likely be continued at current-year funding
levels under a short-term appropriations bill.

Presidential Candidates’ Transportation and Infrastructure Proposals:


Both major Presidential candidates have ambitious plans to dramatically increase
transportation funding to begin to close our infrastructure investment gap and improve
highways, transit systems, ports, waterways, and airports.
o Hillary Clinton has proposed a 5-year, $275 billion package that she pledges to advance
in the first 100 days of her term in office. Her package includes:


$250 billion in “direct public investment,” which likely means formula grants.
Clinton’s proposal seeks to, among other goals, “prioritize and increase investments
in public transit.”



$25 billion for a national infrastructure bank, which is a low-cost loan program much
like TIFIA but including all modes of transportation.



A renewed and expanded Build America Bonds (BABs) program. BABs were tax
credit bonds available in FYs 2009 and 2010 under ARRA. In the previous BABs
program, States and municipal agencies issued taxable debt and receive from the U.S.
Treasury each year a payment equal to 35 percent of their interest payment to
bondholders. For most public issuers, BABs offered a meaningful cost savings over
traditional tax-exempt debt and gave issuers access to the much larger market of
investors in taxable debt.

o Donald Trump has pledged to provide “at least double” the funding of Clinton’s
proposal, which would be $550 billion, backed by contributions from citizens and
investors to a fund to pay for transportation projects. He has said he would provide the
funding through “infrastructure bonds.”


Both infrastructure bills must be paid for in some way: tax increases, spending cuts, or
borrowing (issuing debt). Both proposals provide few details on this subject; Clinton says
she will pay for her proposal with “business tax reforms” and Trump’s proposal would rely
on borrowing: issuing bonds, the proceeds of which would be earmarked for infrastructure
projects.
