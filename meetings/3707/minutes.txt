XVI. Chair's Report
Presented by Chair Davidson.

XVII. Unanimous Consent
Chair Davidson noted that Director Lewis had requested that Item B, 2025 Fiscal Policy be
removed from Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held on Wednesday,
October 9th, several Directors correctly noted that the Public Transportation Agency Safety
Plan, or PTASP and related attachments included in the packet contained apparent
typographical errors, such as names of individuals no longer employed with RTD as well as
incomplete phone numbers for certain individuals.
Please note that the documents included in tonight’s agenda packet are the same as those
approved in committee on October 9th, and further explanation is warranted.

Page 5 of 11

Several of these apparent errors were in fact intentional redactions, that is, certain phone
numbers included in the exhibits are for personal devices and have been redacted prior to
the publication of the agenda packet. Similarly, the names of certain individuals who are
no longer employed with RTD are referenced in policies and procedures approved and
compiled over the course of the past year since the previous iteration of the PTASP was
submitted to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. Additionally, the PTASP’s
exhibits, such as the organizational chart and the listing of emergency contacts, are
evergreen and subject to revision over time as necessary; this means that contacts, phone
numbers, org charts and other materials on file with the CPUC are periodically revised as
necessary to reflect current information.
In closing, the PTASP document and the corresponding exhibits that will be submitted to
the CPUC prior to November 1st will be the full, unredacted versions and will include the
most current versions of policies, procedures, reference materials and contacts available at
that time.
Director Lewis requested Item A, 2025 Investment Policy be removed from Unanimous
Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
Director Tisdale requested item C, 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan
(PTASP) be removed from the Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.
Chair Davidson noted after these changes were made there were no items listed under
Unanimous Consent.
