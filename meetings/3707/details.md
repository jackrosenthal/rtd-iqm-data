## XVI. Chair's Report

Presented by Chair Davidson.

## XVII. Unanimous Consent

Chair Davidson noted that Item B, 2025 Fiscal Policy be removed from Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action by the request of Director Lewis.

During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held on Wednesday, October 9, several Directors correctly noted that the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan, or PTASP and related attachments included in the packet contained apparent typographical errors, such as names of individuals no longer employed with RTD as well as incomplete phone numbers for certain individuals.

Please note that the documents included in tonight’s agenda packet are the same as those approved in committee on October 9. Further explanation is warranted.

Several of these apparent errors were in fact intentional redactions, that is, certain phone numbers included in the exhibits are for personal devices and have been redacted prior to the publication of the agenda packet. Similarly, the names of certain individuals who are no longer employed with RTD are referenced in policies and procedures approved and compiled over the course of the past year since the previous iteration of the PTASP was submitted to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, or CPUC. Additionally, the PTASP’s exhibits, such as the organizational chart and the listing of emergency contacts, are evergreen and subject to revision over time as necessary; this means that contacts, phone numbers, org charts and other materials on file with the CPUC are periodically revised as necessary to reflect current information.

In closing, the PTASP document and the corresponding exhibits that will be submitted to the CPUC prior to November 1 will be the full, unredacted versions and will include the most current versions of policies, procedures, reference materials and contacts available at that time.

Director Lewis requested Item A, 2025 Investment Policy be removed from Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.

Director Tisdale requested item C, 2025 Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) be removed from the Unanimous Consent and be placed in Recommended Action.

Chair Davidson noted after these changes were made there were no items listed on Unanimous Consent.
