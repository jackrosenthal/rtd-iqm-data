Thank you for participating in this evaluation of RTD's General Manager/CEO. High
functioning public agencies are positioned for success when the Board clearly establishes

year, and evaluates the GM/CEO's delivery of those expectations at the end of the year.
For this year's assessment, we invite you to retrospectively assess the General
Manager/CEO's performance related to these 3 areas:
SECTION 1: Assessment of 2020-2021 Criteria
Section 1 of this evaluation will allow you to review the GM/CEO's performance across the 5
categories outlined by the Board in the GM/CEO job description in 2020.
SECTION 2: Organizational Values
This section will give you the opportunity to rate the GM/CEO's adherence to RTD's
Organizational Values. You will give the GM/CEO a rating on each value and also comment
on their performance in each area.
SECTION 3: General Feedback
This section will give you the chance to offer broader recommendations to the General
Manager/CEO for the coming year: questions to reflect on, processes to adjust, and more.
Your responses to this evaluation will be compiled alongside those of your colleagues on the
Board into a report to be shared with the Board Chair. The Chair will then present this
report to the General Manager/CEO during a formal performance evaluation session.

GM OVERSIGHT & PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
GM and CEO Performance Appraisal Framework

Committee Meeting Date:
June 24, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 29, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt an appraisal framework for evaluating the performance of General
Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson beginning January 1, 2022 based upon the RTD Strategic Plan to
include a combined appraisal score of 50% Objective Outcomes-Based Results and 50% Subjective
Values-Based Results, with an opportunity for Ms. Johnson to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (“GMOC”) Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board and GM and CEO Debra A. Johnson are currently engaged in a strategic planning process to
develop RTD’s mission, vision, values, and success outcomes, including key performance indicators. The
Strategic Plan will establish the goals and metrics the Board will use to evaluate Ms. Johnson on an
annual basis beginning in 2022.
DISCUSSION
The GMOC recommends that the Board adopt a performance appraisal framework based upon the
Strategic Plan whereby 50% of the appraisal score is for Objective Outcomes-Based Results (tied to
Success Outcomes and Key Performance Indicators) and 50% of the score is for Subjective ValuesBased Results. Ms. Johnson would have the opportunity to submit a Self-Evaluation to the Board.
The GMOC anticipates bringing another proposed recommended action to the full Board to address the
specifics of the performance appraisal process and compensation performance incentives for adoption no
later than July 30, 2021.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact for this recommended action.
