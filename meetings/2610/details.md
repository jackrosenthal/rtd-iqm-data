Chair Hoy stated that his favorite part of Board Meetings was the recognition of retirees.  He noted that there were seven retirees for the month of June, and four were in attendance: John Davis, Brian Harpole, Jerome Hernandez, and Oscar Lee.

Bruce Abel, Chief Operating Officer/Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations said that this is indeed the best part of every meeting when staff and the Board can recognize the people that have contributed so much to the organization.

Mr. Abel noted that John Davis was retiring after 39 years of service.  He said that Mr. Davis started at RTD on the shop floor as a mechanic, and for a number of years, he was the budget analyst for the Bus Ops group.  He noted that Mr. Davis’ hobbies were classic cars and motorcycles, and he shared that passion with many people.  Mr. Abel added that Mr. Davis has two children, six grandchildren, and he will definitely be missed.

John Davis commented that he had been at RTD a long time, and he started out at the Platte garage.  He remarked that the Boulder garage was being operated out of an old Ford dealership, and the heartbeat of RTD was the old Alameda facility.  He said that that place really made everyone felt like a team, and having everyone in that little two story building made a huge difference.  He noted that there was a manager who came from Chicago transit whose management style was managing by walking around, which lets a manager know what is really going on and he incorporated that philosophy into his own work.  He thanked everyone at RTD that he had worked with and stated that he never felt like he worked for anyone, but he worked with everyone.  He said thank you, and it had been a fun ride.

Mr. Abel said that Brian Harpole was retiring after 19 years of service.  He remarked that Mr. Harpole began as a repair mechanic and his plans are to visit Delaware and New Jersey to finish seeing all 50 states.  He added that in retirement Mr. Harpole will do housework and help his friends and neighbors with their projects.

Mr. Harpole thanked RTD for the ability to work with such a great organization and fantastic talent.

Mr. Abel commented that Jerome Hernandez was retiring after 23 years of service.  He stated that currently, Mr. Hernandez was a driver out of the Platte division, and he had been an operator for his entire career at RTD.

Jerome Hernandez stated that being a bus driver was very interesting.  He said that the first five years was on-the-job training, and it took him a few years to get to know the people riding the bus.  He added that it took time to get familiar with driving and handling people, but when he looks back it was fun and he was happy that he became a bus driver.  He thanked everyone again for the opportunity.

Mr. Abel stated that the last retiree present was Oscar Lee, who was retiring after 34 years of service.  He noted that Mr. Lee was an operator and instructor out of the Platte garage.  He said that Mr. Lee’s plans for retirement will include travelling and thanked him for his years of service.

Oscar Lee said that working for RTD was challenging, but the rewards were fantastic.  He stated that he had built a relationship with his passengers, and as things progressed he changed his personality to be happy.  He added that he was going to miss driving and the realization that he will never dive a bus again hit him harder than he had expected.  He asked if management could make is possible for him to drive a bus now and again, but he noted that he and his wife were leaving for Vietnam the next day so he and his wife could not rest just yet.

Chair Hoy thanked the other retirees, M. Charles Armstrong, Robert Medina, and Alice Osner for their years of service since they were unable to attend the Board Meeting.

Special Recognition – APTA 2017 International Bus & Paratransit Roadeo

Bus International Participant

John Deschner (RTD – 8th Place)

Chair Hoy noted that John Deschner was unable to attend the May Board meeting where the other APTA Bus & Paratransit Roadeo winners were recognized, so he would be recognized at this meeting.

Mr. Abel commented that Mr. Deschner was working during May’s Board meeting, so he was unable to accept his plaque.  He stated that Mr. Deschner took 8th place out of 60 nationally and he has won the RTD competition a number of times over the past couple of years as well.

John Deschner stated that his father, who also worked for RTD, always told him to treat passengers like they were family and friends.  He said that he would be at RTD for a few more years, and he thanked the Board for acknowledging him.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the Board.  He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

John Torres, Boulder, stated that he was the Executive Director for the Golden West retirement home that houses 400 seniors.  He noted that he was in attendance to speak about the Route 209/209G, which comes before the Board every few years for elimination.  He remarked that, while the usage is low, the severity of the cut would be high.  He noted that the community currently uses VIA Mobility and Access-a-Ride, but the down side of those services is that they must be scheduled in advance.  He added that the community chose to support VIA Mobility because it cannot afford to purchase its own bus for transportation and asked the Board to reconsider cutting off that line.

Dan Burke, Centennial, commented that he was the President of the National Federation of the Blind in Denver.  He noted that there were a lot of people in the audience because of the new electric 16th Street Mallride buses.  He remarked that since the buses were quiet, they were a safety concern for the blind.  He added that a pedestrian safety bill requires electric vehicles to make sounds so that blind people can distinguish them.  He noted that while the regulation does not take effect for two years, it is important that the new 16th Street Mallride busses are safe for the blind community.  He further added that one person in the audience was hit by one of the new buses and reported the incident but they have yet to hear back from RTD staff.

Joe Triplett, Aurora, remarked that he was a Board member for the National Federation of the Blind.  He noted that he was downtown earlier in the day and was unable to hear the new shuttle bus.  He asked staff for a timeline of when the audible devices would be installed on the bus motors and added that shuttle drivers are not ringing the bells like they should.  He further added that the older buses were not ringing their bells either.

Steve Patton, Centennial, also expressed his concerns with the new electric shuttle buses.  He stated that he is a travel instructor with the Colorado Center for the Blind and his students use alternative techniques for everyday life.  He explained that having a very large vehicle such as a shuttle bus with no sounds is very frightening and disturbing and stated that it makes him feel unsafe and that he cannot do his job.  He added that he too would like a timeline for the installation of the noise devices and added that it would be a great marketing tool for the School of the Blind.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that given the commentary he wanted to address the Board by saying that the mall shuttles will be updated with the noisemakers by the end of July.  He added that staff has issued several bulletins to the driving corps regarding ringing bells and also the need to ring bells at street corners so that individuals with vision impairments can know that buses are at corners.  He added that the concerns articulated will also be addressed with the driving corps.

Monique Melton, Englewood, stated that she was the President of the Mile High Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind.  She commented that not only are the mall shuttles a hazard, but the light rail trains are becoming a hazard, too.  She remarked that recently there have been two incidents at the Englewood Station where the northbound train did not ring its bell.  She asked that light rail operators ring their bells as they pull into and leave a station.

Peter Chan, Woodland, CA, indicated that he was a student of the Colorado Center for the Blind.  He commented that out of the six training centers in the United States, he chose the Colorado Center for the Blind because it has the best facilities.  He said that in Sacramento the transit agency has audio and visual signs for pedestrians, as well as a loud PA system for everyone to hear.  He encouraged the Board to implement these tools.

Gary Van Dorn, Denver, also spoke about the quiet shuttles.  He said that he used the Mallride to get to the Board meeting and the driver did not ring the bells.  He added that he had a video that he would like to share with staff and the General Manager and that he would take videos throughout the week to document the improvement.  He added that he recognized RTD’s need for a new mall shuttle fleet, but he thought that staff would have delayed putting them into service until the noisemakers had been installed.

Jamie Perkins, Denver, stated that she was the Program Manager with Transit Alliance.  She explained that Transit Alliance was a nonprofit organization with a 20-year history of partnering with RTD and advancing public transportation in the metro region.  On behalf of Transit Alliance, she was addressing the Board to provide comments of support for improvements coming to the Broadway and Lincoln Corridor.  She added that Transit Alliance firmly believes that the future of transportation in this region will be major investments and improvements to RTD’s bus network. While you might think that Broadway and Lincoln are a Denver-specific project, we see huge benefits for the entire RTD district. Like much of the metro region, Broadway is changing.  RTD and the City & County of Denver are wise to get ahead of the curve by ensuring that more people will be able to travel to and through this corridor. Providing even better bus service on Broadway and Lincoln will leverage the transit-oriented development happening at Broadway and Alameda Stations, while helping to connect existing neighborhoods and businesses.  The cooperation and collaboration between RTD and the City sets an example region wide.  Transit Alliance strongly believes that the future of transit in this region is providing exemplary bus service that is frequent, reliable, and serves all district residents. This is possible only with the cooperation of municipalities to develop smart land use policies that prioritize transit riders.  Most importantly, these are improvements that elevate the importance of transit service for all people, not just those people commuting in and out of Denver during peak hours. Transit Alliance envisions a future where transit is a first choice for affordable living and not just for commuting.  We are leading a coalition of organizations that support a “Better Broadway” and will activate our citizen leaders throughout the district to support these efforts to better serve people who ride the bus.  Thank you for your leadership and dedication to all of the region, but especially for those of us in the region that make the bus a top choice.

Helen Bushnell, Denver, said she wanted to comment on the proposed service changes.  She said that historically one of the stops closest to Civic Center has been the most used.  She added that the stop at Denver Health is a good option to eliminate, but when removing a popular stop with others, it becomes difficult to evaluate what RTD is doing or trying to accomplish.  She stated that RTD needs to do a better job with outreach for both the community and its drivers.  In regards to the Route 209, she stated that there is a lack of service for working-class people and the Route 206 used to provide that service.  She urged the Board to keep the Route 209 and to look at the populations not being served.

Charlie Busch, Denver, said she bought her house as close to a bus stop and light rail as she could, while still living on a quiet street.  She commented that her drivers are excellent but noted that they need more outreach efforts.  She remarked that the changes to the Route 0 are needed but explained that ridership would not increase by moving the stop to Exposition.  She added that people will use transit if they have a way to get to their destinations safely, and she asked the Board to consider people when making service changes.

Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management committee had met earlier in the day along with the General Manager to review the new process for his evaluation.  She noted that the review used the same criteria as before, but in a different format.  She stated that the Board is trying something new, and if anyone had any questions, Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, could answer them.  She remarked that the next meeting date would be July 18th to solidify the 2018 General Manager’s goals.  She added that the General Manager performance surveys would be emailed in the next couple of weeks and asked that everyone participate because it was an important process and imperative to the General Manager’s performance review.

### H. Call-n-Ride Amendment for New Contract

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend the recently awarded ADA paratransit services contracts with MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services (per solicitation #16-DH-047) to include the provision of Call-n-Ride services. The amendment to the MV Transportation contract is for three years for $13,110,752, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $4,587,223 and option year 2 is for $4,797,357.  Fuel is considered a pass through.  Fuel is estimated at $1,206,599 for the first three years and with option year 1 at $426,569 and option year 2 at $439,367.  The total not to exceed cost for the 5-year period for MV Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $24,567,867.  The amendment to the Via Mobility Services contract is also for three years for $12,700,984, with two one-year options, option year 1 is for $2,642,063 and option year 2 is for $2,753,714.  Fuel is considered a pass through.  Fuel is estimated at $671,325 for the first three years with option year 1 at $237,334 and option year 2 at $244,454.  The total not to exceed amount for the 5-year period for Via Call-n-Ride services and fuel is $13,854,096.

BACKGROUNDOn November 9, 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to provide Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.  Call-n-Ride services were included in the Access-a-Ride services RFP because these services had been assigned to and were operated by ADA paratransit service providers under the existing contracts.  Past experience has shown that the cost to provide Call-n-Ride service is lower when combined with Access-a-Ride service because of reduced overhead costs.

All of the existing Call-n-Ride services (with the exception of the Evergreen CNR) were divided into two (2) service packages and proposers were allowed to bid on one or two packages.  Proposers were required to bid on Access-a-Ride service in order to also bid on Call-n-Ride service (Call-n-Ride service was not a “stand alone” service option).  Proposers were not required to submit a separate proposal for Call-n-Ride service, but they were required to detail how they would address the unique operational requirements of the service.

The Call-n-Rides included in each package are as follows:

Package A                                                                                    Package B

Arapahoe                                                                                    Brighton

Belleview                                                                                    Broomfield

Dry Creek                                                                                    Federal Heights

Golden                                                                                                  Interlocken

Green Mountain                                                                      Longmont

Lone Tree                                                                                    Louisville

Meridian                                                                                    Superior

North Inverness                                                                      Thornton

Orchard

Parker

South Inverness

South Jeffco

The new contracts for ADA paratransit service include the option for the assignment of Call-n-Ride service so that Call-n-Ride service can be assigned to those contracts.

DISCUSSION

Subsequent to the evaluation of the Access-a-Ride RFP responses and recommendation for contract award, the Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated.  Only proposers that were recommended to provide Access-a-Ride service were considered to provide Call-n-Ride services.  These proposers were MV Transportation, Transdev, and Via Mobility Services.  The Call-n-Ride proposals were evaluated on the following criteria:  a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (25%); c) Small Business Enterprise (SBE) Submittal / Compliance (5%) and d) price (30%).  The proposal evaluations highlighted the following:

MV Transportation has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately eleven years.  MV Transportation proposed a team comprised of experienced Call-n-Ride managers and drivers, and it has provided quality Call-n-Ride service throughout its tenure.  The MV Transportation facility is located in the south metro area, which provides good access for the Call-n-Rides. MV Transportation bid on package A.

Via Mobility Services has operated Call-n-Ride service for approximately seventeen years.  The management team is well experienced in the provision of Call-n-Ride service.  Via Mobility currently provides Call-n-Ride service from a facility in the Boulder area and a facility in the Denver area.  This allows a quicker response time in case of vehicle maintenance problems and cuts down on excessive deadhead mileage and fuel expenses.  Via Mobility Services bid on package B.

Transdev does not have any experience operating Call-n-Ride service for RTD.  Additionally, the Transdev cost proposal was higher than the other proposer.  Transdev bid on package B.

The evaluation of the Call-n-Ride service proposals and pricing resulted in a recommendation to assign Call-n-Ride Package A to MV Transportation under the ADA paratransit contract and Call-n-Ride Package B to Via Mobility Services under the ADA paratransit contract.  The contracts to provide these services are scheduled to be effective October 1, 2017.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the 2017 budget.  There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the 2017 budget.  Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:

1)              Assign Call-n-Ride service to MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services as recommended. This is recommended as both contractors’ personnel have Call-n-Ride experience and can provide the direct supervision for a smooth contract transition.

2)              Do not assign to either contractor.  Separate Call-n-Ride service from the ADA contract and put the Call-n-Ride services out to bid under a separate contractor.  This alternative is not recommended, as the cost will most likely be more expensive as Call-n-Ride would be a standalone service and the RTD would lose the economies of scale associated with the ADA contract.

## I. Authorization to enter into a contract with M.A.I.O.R. Sri, for a Fixed Route Scheduling and Run-Cutting Software Application (16DO018)

It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for the new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application to M.A.I.O.R. Sri (M.A.I.O.R), in an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.00. The price includes the period of performance base of four years and six one-year options (total ten years).

BACKGROUND

RTD’s Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is a core component in the development of bus and rail operation plans. The software is used to handle the complex task of organizing and manipulating time and spatial data for the development of route services, public information and operator schedules/runcutting. Runcutting is the process of developing operator assignments (runs) from a pool of vehicle “blocks” which are vehicle assignments derived from the public timetables. This is an iterative process conducted in accordance with RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). Runcutting directly impacts operator resources and work assignments. Optimizing operators’ work with vehicle blocks creates a more efficient operator and vehicle utilization and reduces operational costs.

The scheduling and runcutting application is the central source of truth and a primary interface for several major systems including but not limited to; Driver pay calculations, Public Information Display System (PIDS), RTD website, Customer Care, TIES, CAD/AVL, etc… RTD requires a modern technical platform to assure ongoing quality scheduling, runcutting and data integration with all the major systems.

RTD’s current Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is over seventeen-years old and needs to be replaced with modern technology. Because of operational changes and growth, the legacy system, no longer meets RTD’s current needs, future needs and quality standards. Issues with the legacy system that impacts the District on a daily basis include but are not limited to:

- Ongoing Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) concerns requiring RTD to regularly create manual work-around processes that are labor intensive and error prone which redirects RTD staff away from other business priorities.

- RTD’s growth outpaced the current legacy system’s capabilities (i.e. Annually, from 50 days of special services to 200 days; rail operations and fleet growth)

- RTD’s bus and rail operations have changed since the original implementation requiring new technology and expanded functionality to generate the most cost effective runcutting and resource utilization strategies.

The Service Development department determined the replacement of the existing Fixed Route Scheduling & Runcutting system is absolutely necessary to assure the District’s ability to continue; “to meet our constituents’ present and future public transit needs by providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the District.” Given the complexity of the Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application and processes, the business owner and stakeholders completed a thorough due diligence assessment and identified requirements to replace the legacy system.

DISCUSSION

To assure RTD’s ongoing ability to meet their mission and commitment to their constituents, RTD must replace the legacy Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system. The new system will be modern, configurable and fully supported that meets RTD’s requirements, quality standards and future demands.

RTD advertised an RFP publically to provide a proposal for design, testing, training, implementation and support for a Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system for the next ten years. RTD received six proposals.

The evaluation team consisted of personnel from the following departments; Service Development, Service Development Support, Service Planning and Scheduling and IT. The proposals were reviewed in accordance with the evaluative criteria as set forth in the RFP for this procurement including: fulfilling RTD specified design and functionality requirements, cost, functional strength, experience, qualifications, project plan and schedule. After reviewing the submitted proposals, interviews with vendors and obtaining clarifications, the evaluation team unanimously selected M.A.I.O.R., as the preferred Fixed Route Scheduling & Runcutting vendor to move forward in the procurement process. The reasons for selecting M.A.I.O.R. Sri. include but are not limited to:

- M.A.I.O.R. meets RTD’s requirements and quality standards. All of RTD’s 532 compliance matrix requirements were accepted by the vendor.

- M.A.I.O.R. has international presence with some of the largest public transit agencies. References checked and verified.

- M.A.I.O.R. included in their cost proposal, all required reporting including custom development.

- M.A.I.O.R.’s product leverages automation and eliminates certain manual work-around processes leading to more efficient internal processes

- Of the six proposals received, M.A.I.O.R. offered the best architecture to meet RTD’s current and future demands, is all inclusive of RTD’s operations (Rail and Bus), was the most flexible and most responsive to RTD inquiries.

- M.A.I.O.R has a strong and proven project implementation strategy and has successfully deployed their Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting system internationally.

This new system will assure RTD’s ability to schedule services, most effectively provide for cost saving runcutting and meet RTD’s commitment to the constituents with quality and accuracy. The vendor’s data center is located Woodbury, New York and a fail-over site in the central United States.

The selection committee was made aware of the pending sale of M.A.I.O.R. to the American company, Clever Devices. On June 2, 2017, RTD received confirmation the acquisition was closed on June 1, 2017. M.A.I.O.R. is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Clever Devices.

Clever Devices is a nationally recognized company headquartered in Woodbury, New York, providing technology solutions to public transit agencies. They provide solutions for Fixed-route, bus rapid transit, paratransit, rail and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). RTD has used their Ridecheck Plus ridership evaluation software since September 2004.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The M.A.I.O.R.  proposal provides for System Design, Testing, Training, Integration and Implementation for $1,847,428; First four years of Operational Services (Warranty and Hosting) for $575,699.00 ($143,924.754 per year). Years five through ten Operational Service will be $200,688.00, per year and will be budgeted for annually. Total cost of the M.A.I.O.R. proposal is $3,607,814.00. The implementation of the Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting application is fully funded with existing approved capital and operating funds and includes the first four years of warranty and hosting. The total not to exceed contract amount is $3,607,814. Implementing a fixed route scheduling and runcutting system to ensure RTD’s ongoing ability to conduct accurate scheduling and runcutting operations may result in changes unforeseen at the time the Scope of Work was produced.  To allow for a timely implementation, it’s in RTD’s interest to have contract authority beyond the proposal amount by $392,168, to allow for such events. Authority is requested from the Board for a total amount not to exceed of $4,000,000 which includes implementation costs, annual warranty and hosting for ten years and contingency to cover any unforeseen expenses.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       RTD could choose not to implement a new Fixed Route Scheduling and Runcutting Software Application and assume the risks and inefficiencies associated with maintaining the legacy system.

### J. Construction Award for RFP 16 DD - 002 -  Platte Bus Wash Replacement

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project.

BACKGROUND

The Platte Maintenance and Storage Facility was constructed in 1975 and opened for operations in December of 1976. The design capacity of the garage was based on 40-foot buses for a total of 250 buses. Currently, the facility supports 298 buses, which are made up of 28, 30, 40, 45, and 60-foot-long buses.

DISCUSSION

The system is a three lane bus wash. In 2004 the system was partially rebuilt. This new project is considered to be a full rebuild. This system has been increasingly difficult to repair as parts are becoming more difficult to obtain. The project was advertised as an RFP. The RFP was advertised on March 6, 2017. Proposals were due on May 8, 2017. Qualifications, experience, personnel, and cost were all a part of the award criteria. Four teams were on the proposers list but only two teams submitted.

1.       Gilmore Construction Corporation

Kubat – Wash Equipment Installer

NS Corporation – Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier

ADK – Electrical Design Build Subcontractor

MSI – Mechanical / Plumbing Design-Build Subcontractor

ABO Group – Architect

2.       T-Bone Construction / Interclean Equipment, Inc.

MP Contracting – Demolition

InterClean Equipment - Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier

Hodges Plumbing – Plumbing

Arrcon Electrical - Electrical

Proposals were rated in the following manner:

1.       Cost – 40%

2.       Key Staff and Technical Experience – 25%

3.       Technical Approach – 25%

4.       Technical Innovation / Creativity – 10%

Gilmore Construction Corporation cost proposal came in at $1,402,113 and T-Bone Construction / Interclean Equipment, Inc was at $1,371,179.

The selection committee was made up three evaluators. The evaluators were Mark Golnar of the Facilities Engineering Division, Mel Munsterman who is the Platte Maintenance Manager for Bus Operations, and Mike Young the Platte Facilities Maintenance Supervisor. The evaluation meeting was held on June 1, 2017. The committee’s combined evaluations clearly identified Gilmore Construction Corporation to be the most qualified proposer. While their proposal was $30,934 more than T-Bone Construction, their proposal strengths were their organizational structure, choice of team members, and previous project experience with vehicle wash systems.

SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT

There was no SBE goal set for this project.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.

ALTERNATIVES

1.              Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project.  Funding for this contract is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.

2.              Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project. Re-advertise the project later in the year. Re-advertising could gain additional competition, but could also lose competition or have no proposers.

3.              Do not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to Gilmore Construction Corporation in the amount not-to-exceed of $1,402,113 for the Platte Bus Wash Replacement project. Cancel the project and utilize the funds to repair the system as it breaks down. The primary reason for this project is that parts are becoming more difficult to obtain.

### K. August 2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the August 2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $19,700 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. Bus stop consolidation efforts aimed at optimizing bus stop spacing, thereby improving operational speed and reliability are proposed for Routes 40, 105 and services along the Broadway/Lincoln Corridor. Based upon current and past ridership performance a number of services will have minor service reductions.  The Route 46 - South Dahlia will see the largest reduction in early morning and late evening periods.  We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Five public hearings were conducted in Boulder, Curtis Park, Downtown Denver, Littleton and Southeast Denver, between June 7th and June 13th. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes an annualized net increase of $80,300 of which $100,000 would be offset by funding from the City of Golden; for the Golden Call-n-Ride proposal, resulting in a RTD base system cost savings of approximately $19,700 annualized.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to approve the August 2017 Service Changes.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Lubow stated that the Route 209 that goes to the senior residence at Golden West still bothers her.  She said that, if there is a vulnerable population, it is concerning to drop services to them.

Director Folska asked whether Golden West would still benefit from the services provided by Via Mobility if the 209 was eliminated.

Mr. Abel commented that the Route 209 is not being eliminated as a route, but the service to Golden West is instead a deviation.  He added that Via Mobility’s services are separate from RTD’s.

Director Folska asked if Golden West would still be in the ¾ mile fixed route shadow in order to use Access-a-Ride.

Mr. Abel indicated it was.

Director Sisk stated that he had worked with John Torres to increase ridership for the Route 209 and ridership has subsequently decreased.  He added that there are alternatives for people living at Golden West to access services at Kaiser Permanente and, based on the historical data presented, he was satisfied with the service change.

Vote on

The Motion:              The motion passed with 12 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Broom, Deadwyler, Folska, Francone, Hoy, Mihalik, Sisk, Tisdale, Walker, Williams) and 1 opposed (Lubow).  Director Solano was absent, and Director Menten was away.

Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

## XIV. Old Business

There was no old business.

## XV. New Business

Director Francone said that she wanted to comment on the Accelerate Colorado Conference that she and Director Folska attended.  She noted that this year, there were 110 representatives from the State of Colorado that impressed the federal delegation in a way that the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) does not.  She noted that she discussed in length the return of the $29 million Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) bond and added that the General Manager should be hearing from the federal government soon.

Director Francone added that she attended the Colorado Municipal League (CML) conference for the first time in June.  She said that it was very good, and the conference attendees were delighted to see representatives from RTD.

Director Folska noted that Accelerate Colorado was very busy, but she thinks that RTD will be refunded the $29 million.  She also thanked Michelle Madrid, Board Office Administrative Specialist, for her service in the Board Office.

Director Deadwyler thanked staff for the help in planning and participating in the Juneteenth celebration.  She said that she appreciated all of the help she received last weekend and noted that she will be hosting another event, Brick City, at Curtis Park in two weeks.  She added that the Mayor of Denver attends, and there will be recruitment efforts for Access-a-Ride and the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program.
