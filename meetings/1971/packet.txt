BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Request for Increase to ACS Smart Contract
(Howerter/McMurphy)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to increase the Xerox Transport Solutions contract notto-exceed amount by $2,349,912 to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.
BACKGROUND and DISCUSSION
Smart Media System changes will be required in order to configure the system to utilize RTD’s new fare
structure that will be a result of the Fare Study currently under way. In addition, changes to the public
facing web portal are required so as to create a web portal that is easy to use and navigate by RTD’s
customers. Once the web portal changes are made, RTD needs to ensure that all pages and functionality
of the portal are ADA compliant so that persons with disabilities can easily navigate the web portal.
In Q3-2015, RTD will begin issuing Stored Value Cards, which in essence are debit cards for use on the
RTD system. Because some cards will be purchased via the Smart Card Web Portal, RTD needs to be
very confident that the highest levels of cyber security have been implemented on our system to protect
credit card and personal information. This is the first time that RTD has undertaken this type of payment
vehicle that is open to the public. Xerox will be working closely with RTD to ensure that the web portal
and back-end systems meet the high standards of RTD’s Cyber Security requirements.
With the 2016 opening of the new rail lines, approximately 140 new platform validators will be installed,
along with the 138 platform validators already in operation. An increased inventory of spare parts will
need to be on hand and managed in order to expedite and correct any hardware issues that may be
encountered on our light rail platforms. The spare parts must come from Xerox the company from which
RTD purchases the platform validators currently in use.
Based on these considerations, additional funds are needed to facilitate enhanced security, web portal
enhancements, additional cards, nine SMV installations on SE, additional APOS units, file compression
and recharge selection software, and ADA Compliance enhancements, as well as the creation of a
validator spare parts inventory.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for these additional SMT Program Activities will be provided via the Unrestricted Funds Balance.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance, Administration and Audit
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager or his designee to
issue a change order to Xerox, Inc. to a new contract amount not to exceed $19,731,382.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

2) Do not accept the Recommended Action. The SMT Web Portal may be at a higher risk due to the
lack of enhanced security. The web portal may also be unusable by some constituents due to its
lack of accessibility to those with disabilities. Spare parts to fix the platform validators would
eventually become unusable and/or unavailable. Without the Services of Xerox, the Smart Media
system changes required as a result of the Fare Study may not be timely implemented.

2015
Salaried
(Howerter/Sprague)

Benefit

Plans

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the 2015 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2015 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 16 through
December 1, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2015 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2015 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the modest changes for the 2015 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2015. The
administrative cost will increase by 10% in 2015. The Cigna Plans are expected to have
approximately 460 employees enrolled. 2014 claims are running 10% above expected claims YTD
and 2015 claims are currently projected to be slightly higher than 2014 levels.
-

Kaiser provides 3 Plan Options: a fully insured HMO; a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and an
HDHP. The Kaiser plans are expected to have approximately 200 employees enrolled. This plan has
proposed a 5% blended increase over 2014 and Kaiser has requested removing the HMO (High Plan)
due to low enrollment (10 people).

-

Cost-sharing, the employee contributions for the plan, will be increased for employees by 10%.

Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a 1% renewal rate increase, with a two-year Administrative rate
guarantee through 2016. Delta is a self-funded plan and has projected a 5% increase in expected
claims exposure.
Life & Disability
- The rate guarantee with Lincoln National expired and an RFP was conducted. It is recommended that

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

the Short Term Disability, Long Term Disability, Accidental Death & Dismemberment, and Voluntary
Insurance be moved from Lincoln to Cigna. This move results in a reduction in annual premiums of
12% or approximately $55,000.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross – Blue Shield. Based on
utilization, Anthem has proposed an 8% renewal increase. There are no carrier/plan changes and no
costs increase with the Business Travel Accident Plan.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2015 planned Salaried Employee Insured Benefit budget is projected to be an 8% increase over
2014 projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are slightly below the medical
trend of 10%. With the additional costs associated with the Affordable Care Act, the overall benefit
budget increase is projected to be 8.4% over 2014.
The major cost impacts in 2015 are due to Cigna Plan increases of 10%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2014 are essentially flat. This is the fifth year we have achieved strong cost
containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2014 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $9,699,223. The projected increase of
8.4% results in an increase of $812,341 or a total projected cost of $10,511,564 in 2015. The increase
meets the projected costs in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). RTD’s benefit costs are at or below the
average for Metro area companies, which are experiencing 8-15% cost increases according to the
Denver Chamber of Commerce.

2.

Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2015. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay the
employee enrollment period.

3.

Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit plans
to the salaried employees.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Subject:

Certification of the 2015 contribution for the
RTD Salaried Employees' Retirement Plans
(Howerter)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB
Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the RTD
Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan
Trust (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment, at
a percent of each participant’s eligible compensation.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9 percent of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012 the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan would
be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a result of
the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The recommended fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million
to the DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to
maintain a “fully funded” status for the plan in the future. The actuaries have updated the DB Plan
projections to reflect the final 1/1/2014 valuation assumptions for the DB Plan. The 2014 Actuary
Recommended Contribution is expected to exceed the $3.1 million fixed annual contribution amount
through the 2019 Fiscal Year and fall below the fixed annual contribution amount thereafter. The DB
Plan is projected to reach 100% funding in 2028 assuming that the $3.1 million contribution were to
continue after the actuary’s recommendation drops below the $3.1 million fixed contribution if all other
actuarial assumptions are met each year. The Plan remains on target to achieve this goal.
As stated above an actuarial evaluation of the DB Plan is completed annually to monitor the funding
status of the plan. The actual 2015 Actuary Recommend Contribution is $5.7 million based on current
projections. Should the Board approve contributing a higher amount to the DB Plan and continue to fund
at the amount calculated to be the Actuary Recommended Contribution the DB Plan would be fully
funded in 2024.
In summary, the Board could continue to approve a fixed contribution amount of $3.1 million and be
fully funded in 2028 or fund the DB Plan at the Actuary Recommended Contribution amount of $5.7
million and be fully funded in 2024.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2014.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

The assumed contributions indicate the different amounts that would be required to fund the plan at
9%, 8% and 7% of eligible salaries in 2015.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the RTD Board of Directors certifies a 2015 contribution to RTD’s Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust at the recommended amount of $3.1 million and
Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan Trust rate at 9% of each participant’s eligible
compensation as planned in the SBP.
2.

The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan Trust at amounts other than $3.1 million and 9% respectively.

3.

Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Proposed 2015 Fiscal
(Howerter/Scarpino)

Policy

Statement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in October 2013
for the 2014 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to clarifying that the Strategic Budget Plan
includes the current practice of including fare adjustments every three years to account for inflation
and that the Board at its discretion may consider potential fare adjustments annually at the time of
the development of the SBP. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most recent rating
agency credit ratings at the time.
DISCUSSION
For 2015, the following changes are proposed.
Fund Balance Policies #1 is amended to read as follows: “RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance
in the Base System and in the FasTracks operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures
of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as
a result of economic downturns affecting revenue.”
Under Budget Policies #1 it is stated that the budget is prepared using Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles with certain exceptions, to which is added the “exclusion of the non-cash
portion of long-term unfunded pension accruals.” This is to reflect the appropriation of only the cash
outlay of the pension obligation.
The Policy Statement is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this
date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachment for the full proposed document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2015
Recommended Budget.

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.4

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2015
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

2015 FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3 years in the mid and long-term budgets to
adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare adjustments
annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As
part of this process, staff will review potential fare increases adjustments to
establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general
public; and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will
make an ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 28, 2014

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure
consistency with the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
 attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two
objectives
2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier
to use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and
minimizes future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against
loss and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and
thereby reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls
using the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been
approved by the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
including projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and
2

operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital
projects to be included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited
to the effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and
ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); consequences of not
funding; and
 RTD mission statement elements.
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).
3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for
the capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If
the cost estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be
brought to the Board for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future
technological changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the
public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance
with the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital
improvement costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the
FasTracks capital and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring
nature, or to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions
as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. This unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund
and an undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base

1.B.4.a

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective October 28, 2014

Attachment: 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement Red-Line (2105 : Proposed 2015 Fiscal Policy Statement)

System, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding
depreciation. For FasTracks, the total of these three funds should be maintained at
an amount approximately equal to two months of FasTracks operating expenses
excluding depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be
directed to fund balance replenishment. For example, RTD may define the revenue
sources that would typically be looked to for replenishment of fund balance to
include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses. Year-end surpluses are an
especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With
Board approval, these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce
the need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade
bond rating. The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will
take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at
each year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to
unanticipated events.
5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado
Constitution.
6. The Board shall establish three reserves for future construction under the
FasTracks plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30
million each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings
opportunities that might arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not
be used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding
for future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project



goals identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be
provided from the sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other
sources approved by the Board.
All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a
reserve for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be
used to fund the (non-FasTracks) Base System expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds, Certificates of Participation
(COPs) or other financial obligations shall be financed for a period not to exceed
the expected useful life of the asset.
2. Effective communication with credit rating agencies will be maintained, and a

3. Before long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual

It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's credit ratings at the highest reasonably attainable
level in light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to
receive lower interest rates and lower debt insurance premiums than would be
possible with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: October 15, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

October 15, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

2015 Budget Update (Howerter/Scarpino)

BACKGROUND
The State of Colorado requires that a requested budget be presented to the Board and be made
available for public inspection after giving public notice in newspapers of major distribution by
October 15th of each year. RTD’s 2015 Requested Budget was presented at the Board Study
Session on September 30, 2014. Public notice will be given in the October 11-12, 2014 weekend
editions of The Denver Post and The Boulder Daily Camera. Copies of the 2015 Requested Budget
will be made available at that time in the Board office for public inspection.
The purpose of this Board report is to update the Board with proposed changes and new information
that has become available since the presentation of the 2015 Requested Budget at the Board Study
Session. The 2015 Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November Financial
Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request to forward the budget to the Board for
adoption.
DISCUSSION
The attached power point presentation summarizes the revised assumptions incorporated into the
2015 Requested Budget and the resulting changes from the first draft of the 2015 Requested Budget
previously presented at the Board Study Session. Major revisions and areas of focus follow:


Sales/use taxes are not revised from the first draft Requested Budget previously presented.
Both versions incorporate the CU-Leeds School September forecast. The Recommended
Budget will not be revised further for sales/use tax because the CU-Leeds School
December forecast will not be received before final budget adoption. For 2015, sales/use
tax is budgeted to increase 5.9% over the 2014 projection. The 2014 projection is
projected to increase 7.8% over 2013 actuals.



Total District-wide operating expenses (excluding depreciation) of $483.6 million are
$0.850 million lower compared to the first draft Requested Budget. The District-wide
Appropriation of $1.394 million is $0.129 million higher than the first draft Requested
Budget.



Diesel fuel is now locked at $2.95/gallon for 2015, down from the budgeted per gallon
price of $3.12. The favorable impact to the budget is approximately $1.7 million. The
lock provides budget certainty for planning purposes.



Gasoline remains budgeted at $3.54/gallon, which is the same price that was budgeted in
2014 for no incremental change.



The capital carryforward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at this time but will
be included in the Recommended Budget.



Due to the favorable effect of the fuel lock and other budget adjustments, the combined
unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected at $7.9 million, consisting of $4.8 million

Packet Pg. 26

1.C.1

for the Base System and $3.1 million for FasTracks. The Base System unrestricted fund
balance is line with the SBP.
The 2015 Requested Budget and Fund Balance Report showing the operating and capital sources and
expenditures of the District for the Base System and FasTracks is included as Exhibit I. The
following tables are a summary of the attached Exhibit I. The 2015 Requested Budget column below
includes the revisions noted above (in thousands).

Colorado unemployment rate to continue to decline (below 5% by 2017),
personal income to grow strongly (peaking at 7% in 2016), retail sales to
outpace inflation in 2014/2015
Retail sales will slow beginning in 2016 implying more cautious spending
and saving behavior

Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate
Burden Policy

GM
Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Civil Rights Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
implementation of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy.
BACKGROUND
Per Section 12 of the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Master Agreement, RTD must comply with
49 CFR part 21 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, which effectuates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
(Title VI) and Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority and
Low-Income Populations.” Title VI and Environmental Justice essentially prohibit recipients of federal
financial assistance (grants, loans, land, etc...) from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national
origin and low—income status. Accordingly, RTD is committed to the administration of an equitable
mass transit system, with a specific interest in the impacts absorbed by minority and low-income
populations.
In pursuit of equitable transit, FTA Circular 4702.1B requires the completion of an equity analysis for all
fare changes. Through the equity analysis, RTD will evaluate fare changes for adverse effects that may
disproportionately impact minority or low-income populations. The FTA further requires that RTD develop
a Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy that will guide RTD in analyzing fare changes
for equity.
DISCUSSION
This policy establishes a statistical threshold to determine whether minority and low-income riders are
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of a proposed fare change. RTD has established
threshold of 5%. Thus the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income
persons as a result of any fare change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than
or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership (see full policy for details).
As RTD proceeds with the Fare Study, this policy is needed to ensure recommended alternative fare
policies are equitable in accordance with FTA requirements.
PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The FTA also requires that this policy be established through the public decision-making process.
Accordingly, RTD solicited feedback on the threshold during the Fare Study Problem Identification phase.
During this phase RTD sought feedback on the proposed threshold from Local Governments,
Transportation Management Associations/ Organizations (TMAs/TMOs), non-profit organizations and
community based organizations through a series of focus group style discussions. We also provided the
general public with opportunities to comment via the RTD website, phone and six public meetings held
throughout the district.

Packet Pg. 66

2.B.1

Generally, participants asked questions about the manner in which the threshold would be applied in an
equity analysis rather than commenting on the 5% threshold. Participants seemed more interested in
fare affordability and access to discounted fare media in the context of equity. Overall, reactions to the
proposed threshold and RTD’s philosophy on equity were positive.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The approval of this policy doesn’t result in a financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Approve the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy, achieving compliance with
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and secure current and future federal funding.
2) Delay the approval of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy and jeopardize
current and future federal funding.
3) Reject the approval of the Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy and jeopardize
current and future federal funding.

Fare Disparate Impact and
Disproportionate Burden Policy
As a recipient of federal financial assistance, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
required to comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898
“Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations” (Environmental Justice). Title VI and Environmental Justice require that federal
recipients administer all of their programs and initiatives without regard to race, color, national
origin and low-income status.
The purpose of this policy is to establish specific measures to avoid and mitigate
disproportionate impacts absorbed by minority and low-income populations with respect to
fare changes.

Definitions
The definition of each key term used in this policy is as follows:
Disparate Impact: a percentage of adverse effects absorbed by minority persons that is
considered to be significantly disproportionate.
Disproportionate Burden: a percentage of adverse effects absorbed by low-income persons
that is considered to be significantly disproportionate.
Fare Media: a form of payment for transit service (i.e. cash fare, monthly pass, etc...).
Fare Change: an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media,
creation of new fare media or the discontinuance of existing fare media.
Low-income Person: a person whose median household income is at or below 150% of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines. The HHS Poverty
Guidelines can be viewed at http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.cfm.

Attachment: Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy (Final) (2110 : Fare Disparate Impact Disproportionate Burden Policy)

2.B.1.a

Minority Persons include the following:
(1) American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of the
original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who
maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
(2) Asian, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far
East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia,
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
(3) Black or African American, which refers to people having origins in any of the Black
racial groups of Africa.
(4) Hispanic or Latino, which includes persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or
Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
(5) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which refers to people having origins in any of
the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
Substantial Legitimate Justification: evidence that a policy/policy change is necessary to meet
a goal that is legitimate, important, and integral to RTD’s institutional mission and business
requirements (e.g. farebox recovery ratio policy).

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Circular 4702.1B outlines Title VI and Environmental
Justice requirements pertaining to fare changes. Specifically, the circular requires recipients of
federal funds to establish a disparate impact and disproportionate burden policy. This policy
must establish a statistical threshold to determine whether minority and low-income riders
are disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of a change between an existing
fare and a proposed fare.
Pursuant to this requirement, the RTD threshold indicating a disparate impact or
disproportionate burden shall be set to +/-5%. Thus the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by minority and low-income persons as a result of any fare change or the average of
multiple fare changes, shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the
overall ridership.

Attachment: Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy (Final) (2110 : Fare Disparate Impact Disproportionate Burden Policy)

2.B.1.a

Prior to establishing this threshold, RTD reviewed the thresholds established by peer transit
agencies, as well as FTA partiality to trending thresholds. Based on this review, other transit
agencies and the FTA tend to prefer the more conservative threshold of 5%. See Appendix A to
view thresholds established by other transit agencies.
Every proposed fare change shall undergo an Equity Analysis using this threshold to identify
disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens during the planning stage. An Equity Analysis is
a comparative analysis used to ensure that each proposed fare change has the least
discriminatory effect while still fulfilling RTD’s business requirements. This analysis is primarily
dependent upon customer satisfaction survey results that detail the use of fare media on a
demographic basis (e.g. race, income, etc…). See Appendix B for an example of how an equity
analysis uses the policy to evaluate a fare change for a Disparate Impact and Disproportionate
Burden.
In the event a fare change proposal results in a disparate impact or disproportionate burden,
RTD will examine alternatives in an attempt to avoid, minimize and mitigate the discriminatory
results of the initial proposal. If after the revision of the proposal a disparate impact or
disproportionate burden still exists, the equity analysis must demonstrate that the proposed
fare change is the least discriminatory option and there is a substantial legitimate justification
for the proposal (see the decision tree in Appendix C). Each proposed fare change will be
accompanied by a summary of an equity analysis for the RTD Board of Directors’ awareness,
consideration and approval.

In the examination of the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy requirement,
peer transit agencies were examined as well to identify trends in establishment of the statistical
threshold. Thresholds ranging from 0% to 20% were observed in nationwide inquires. Though a
large range of threshold percentages were identified, the most commonly observed thresholds
were established at 10% or less. Depicted in the table below are the percentage thresholds
established by other transit agencies nationwide.

The above thresholds suggest a pattern of transit agencies moving toward a common threshold.
Further, some agencies were interviewed to obtain a more detailed understanding of the FTA’s
response to their established threshold(s). Although the FTA has yet to provide a formal and
acceptable statistical differential for transit agencies, the evidence suggests that the FTA has
shown a general preference for a threshold of 5% or less. This percentage more closely
resembles the use of the statistical significance principle. Statistical significance refers to
whether any differences observed between groups being studied are "real" or simply due to
chance. While this principle doesn’t fit squarely into the context of measuring equity in transit,
it serves as a basic framework for determining disparate impacts and disproportionate burdens.

As an example, assume a fare increase on 10-Ride Ticket Books was proposed. RTD would have
to examine the percentage of minorities and low-income populations using 10-Ride Ticket
Books, compared to the percentage of the overall population that utilizes the 10-Ride Ticket
Books.

The example chart above clearly reveals the existence of a disparate impact resulting from the
proposed fare change, as minority populations will absorb greater than 5% of the effects
absorbed by the overall population. Yet there is not a disproportionate burden since the effects
absorbed by low-income populations is less than 5% of the effects absorbed by the overall
population.

January 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the January 2015 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A
resulting in an annualized cost of approximately $647,200 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose
service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, system maintenance actions and several service reductions. The proposals regarding the
cancellation of certain Call-n-Ride services are ridership/performance based and in accord with RTD
Service Standards. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes
and propose adjustments as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended between October 2nd
and October 16th. Public meetings were held in Denver, Federal Heights, Highlands Ranch and Parker
with nearly 200 hundred public participants. Comments from these meetings and the service change
website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

Arapahoe at Village Center Station
Due to the development of the hotel at this station, several routes will need to have gate
assignments changed to allow for construction and future operations. This change will
impact Routes: 65, 66, AT and T.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride currently
serves the Garrison Station. The boundaries can best be described as 13th on the north
and one stop on Colfax at Garrison, Wadsworth on the east, Kipling on the west and
Morrison Road to the south. The Call-n-Ride also runs a Flex Route on Garrison during the
peak hours. The ridership has been averaging 1.6 passenger boarding’s per hour. This
proposal calls for discontinuing the Garrison Flex route and for the changing of the north
boundary to be moved south to 10th Avenue. The boundary will be adjusted west of
Kipling and north of 13th to the Oak Station.
Additionally, the south boundary at
Morrison Road will be moved up to Jewell. This change to the Oak Station will now allow
customers to transfer to the Route 16 and 100 at a station and alleviate neighborhood
concerns regarding the safety and the vehicle traffic in the neighborhood in and around the
Garrison Station.
After further consideration from public input, the boundary will continue at 13th and
Garrison Station will continue to be served by reservation only.
No additional costs are anticipated.
Route DD – Colorado Blvd
Schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance are proposed. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Dry Creek Call-n-Ride
The Dry Creek Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride
The Federal Heights Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012 under a Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) grant. The Cities of Federal Heights,
Thornton, Northglenn and Adams County applied for and contribute financially to operate
the Call-n-Ride. The municipalities requested the RTD to operate the service with all
parties agreeing that as part of the Call-n-Ride branding and operating within the RTD
family of services, the opportunity to succeed would be greatly increased. The costs to
operate the service is approximately $191,950 annually (includes fuel). The Call-n-Ride
operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 7:00pm. Currently, Weekday ridership is at 2.9
passenger boarding’s per hour. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-nRide due to low ridership. Alternative service is available using the Routes 6, 8, 31, 80,
92 and 104.
It should be noted that an offer to extend the Call-n-Ride service via a cost share
agreement has been made to the municipalities that the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride serves.
If this offer or a counter offer is received and agreed upon by the RTD, this proposal for
the January Service Changes will be rescinded. At this time a formal response from the
municipalities has not been received.
Cost: increase dependent on a Cost Share Agreement.
Free MetroRide
To improve reliability in the afternoon peak, it is proposed to add one-bus and make minor
schedule adjustments. Service will still be offered every 6 minutes.
Projected cost: 893 hours and an estimated $36,150 annualized.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of
the Southeast Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm.
Currently, weekday ridership is at 2.1 passenger boarding’s per hour. RTD requires a
minimum of 3 boardings per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour
since operations began in November 2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of
the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service is available using the Routes
401, 402Ltd and 403.
It should be noted that an offer to extend the Call-n-Ride service via a cost share
agreement has been made to the municipalities that the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride
serves. If this offer or a counter offer is received and agreed upon by the RTD, this

on the west. During off peak hours the Call-n-Ride serves the entire area. During peak
hours the Call-n-Ride serves only to Quebec. This proposal calls for changing the
boundaries by not serving west of Quebec and north of Dry Creek. This area has been

however, it will also reduce some early-morning “C-Line” pullout trains from Evans to
Union Station, which are currently lightly patronized.

It is also proposed to discontinue ten additional Monday-Friday trips on the fringes of the
AM and PM peak periods: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:31 AM, 8:31
AM, 3:46 PM, 4:16 PM, and 6:16 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 6:11
AM, 8:11 AM, 3:26 PM, 3:56 PM, and 5:56 PM. This proposed change effects
approximately 529 passengers that will need to take a W-Line 7.5 minutes earlier or later.
Total hours saved: (Mondays-Thursdays) 1,275 annualized.
Route 102 Loop Extras – it is proposed to make minor adjustments to the Loop Extras,
trains 10, 50, and 70, to adjust times and service based on early information gathered
from the August 2014 runboard. Changes to hours are not anticipated.
Savings 1,700 annual hours, $314,500
W-Line: It is proposed to extend the existing Denver Union Station (DUS) Weekday hostler
hours so that there is coverage all day for one hostler (currently there are two hostlers in
each AM and PM peak). This would change the existing four splits to two splits and two
straights. This change helps provide layover and relief for W-Line operators at DUS.
Costs 2,040 annual hours, $377,400
Total net proposal cost is estimated to be 340 hours, $62,900 annualized.

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC MEETINGS – JANUARY 2015

Doug Monroe conducted the meeting. Staff in attendance included Nataly Erving, Nate
Diaz, Jessie Carter, Jeff Becker, Jeff Dunning, Nick Shoup, Dave Menter, Daniel Menter,
Diane Marquis, Brian Matthews, Pate Heye and Chris Marko. There were no elected
officials in attendance. In addition there was a count of 43 members of the public who
signed in.
Route 11:
On Sundays, Leticia Mangeson said that she needs the route 11 to run later than its
current end time of 7:00 pm.
Denver Union Station/18th Street Detour:
Many in attendance were in favor of the city’s proposal to establish two-way traffic along
18th St between Wynkoop and Blake and therefore have bus service along this segment
thus removing it from Wynkoop St. Among those in favor were Elizabeth Orr who wanted
to know the time frame for its implementation. [Jessie Carter answered that it would be
on October 31st, 2014]. Andy Youtz, who lives at 1720 Wynkoop noted an increase in
activity along Wynkoop since Union Station opened last May not only with RTD buses, but
with convention buses, tour buses, more taxis and cars standing in the middle of the
street blocking traffic and for this reason feels that 18th would be better for routing buses
than Wynkoop is and therefor he wants to make sure that the decision not to route them
on Wynkoop is upheld. Andy’s sentiment was echoed by Vickie Godbey of the Union
Station Advocates. Ryan King is also in support of this upcoming change.
However, Tom Rickert, who lives at Franklin Lofts likes the current routing arguing that if
the plan is implemented, 100% of the buses would be on 18th and he did not find that to
be “equitable” and asked that some buses use other streets.
John Parkinson pointed out that there are priorities on all sides and that the final decision
should not be swayed by individual interests.
Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride:
Terry Whitmore asked us to save the Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride stating that the trip that
her daughter uses to get to school is full. She pointed to many factors that suggest our
keeping this service including the projected doubling of the region’s population by 2040
with 1 in four residents being over 60 at that time, many of which are likely to want to
remain independent, yet also remain in this region but needing to not depend on Single
Occupancy Vehicles (SOV). She said that when customers are forced to become a SOV
due to elimination of transit service, they are likely lost to transit and not likely to return.
She also mentioned that the Douglas County residents that would be negatively affected
by this cut contribute to the system with the highest farebox rate and that equity in the
system would keep service to their area running.

Morrison Rd / Westwood neighborhood:
There was considerable support for the possibility of restoring transit service in the
Westwood neighborhood including along Morrison Rd which was discontinued in January,
2012 due to budget constraints. Among the comments supporting restored service:
 Lillian Castaway who is disabled, who would like this service restored not to just
during peak hours but during the entire day. Andrea Chiriborga-Flor and Lorena
Limon agreed that full day service is needed as there are many elderly in this area
and she wants to avoid transit “pockets” of non-service. Andrea also thanked RTD
for the opportunity to address this issue at this meeting.
 Patricia Grado who works in Westwood said that many families that live in the area
do not have cars and without convenient transit service have to walk more than a
mile to where there is service, even if they have cancer and are going to medical
appointments. Marisol Valencia also said that she could use this service to get to
medical treatments and therefore it would be helpful for it to run during the entire
day.
 Mayra Olivas who works with the families in the Westwood area said that families
have to walk more than a ½ mile to buy groceries and in the winter that gets even
more difficult.
 It’s difficult with good transit service for kids to get to school according to Lydia
Cameron.
 Tracy Kaye, who works for Healthy Places a Colorado Health Fund, referred to
Westwood as an “island” of non-service. She said that there are many community
members who have multiple part-time jobs that they have trouble getting to. She
said that not only do they “deserve” service, but providing such transit service
would get them to walk to/from the bus and therefore contribute to their overall
health. Laura Martinez who works as a housekeeper also finds it very difficult to
get to / from work without better service in this neighborhood.
 Barnum resident Eric Kornabi, the Executive Director and Co-Founder of Re:Vision,
an organization that works with people in marginalized neighborhoods suggested
that with Westwood not having convenient transit options, our service is not
“Equitable” as it is in areas such as LoDo. He mentioned that although between
16,000 – 17,000 vehicles a day travel on Morrison Rd, there is not one transit
stop. He said that his organization is helping to establish a new grocery store on
Morrison Rd and that having transit service along that street will benefit this new
business.
 Olga Seguin mentioned that it is not safe for children to walk along Morrison Rd
and that bus service that they could take would make things safer for them. Bertha
Perez also said that walking along Morrison Rd is dangerous and that she has
missed medical appointments at Denver Health Medical Center because of the poor
transit service in the area. Marisol Valencia also mentioned this would be helpful for
children getting to and from school.
 Ivan Escalante is also in favor of restoring this service since students now have
very far to walk, but he pointed out that the fares are too high as many can not
afford them.
 Rachel Cleaves of Westwood Unidos, who was surprised that no proposals for new
service on Morrison Rd was proposed, did a survey in which 52% of those she

survey said that one’s employment is affected by access to public transit and such
transit is currently not accessible in this neighborhood which she said is one of the
youngest and densest in the city. She also asked RTD to be “creative” in how we
establish this new service saying that the old service was not adequate and that
she would prefer a “shuttle”.
Monica Acosta of Parents and Youth United, an education and justice organization
is dedicated to removing the boundaries that hinder education and employment
opportunities and that one of these barriers is poor public transportation. She said
that her families rely on public transportation for such things as getting to school,
child care, work, shopping and health care. Without public transit, many have to
walk ten blocks or so to Sheridan Blvd and that their quality of life gets impacted
when they have to make difficult choices as a result of the poor transit.
Others that affirmed agreement with creating service in this area included Mary
Cruz Herrera.

RTD Administrative Offices
Thursday, October 2, 6:00 PM, 2014
Jessie Carter conducted the meeting with Director Angie Rivera-Malpiede present. RTD
Staff in attendance included Jonathan Wade. There were 23 members of the public who
signed in.
There were no comments or questions concerning items listed in the service change
proposal. The following topics and question were discussed during the public input
session:




The Westwood neighborhood would benefit from service along Morrison Road
connecting them to other RTD services, grocery stores, and medical facilities.
The Westwood community would like RTD to consider operating a “circulator”
service in the Westwood area.
The Urban land Conservancy (ULC) has invested in housing developments in the
Westwood community and would like to see service along Morrison Road.
Why are there delays on the D-Line Light Rail service in the Five Points area?
As RTD expands the light rail system to the suburbs it seems that RTD has
forgotten about the people in the inner city.

The meeting was concluded at approximately 7:15pm.
Highlands Ranch

The route 0 is much too slow to ride all the way to downtown Denver. An express

Since no school bus service is provided, we need to keep the Call-n-Ride.
The CnR arrival phone notification system is very inaccurate.
The CnR is too busy during the peak hours for anyone to get rides except for
students.
One neighborhood of 200 homes is all seniors who will be left without
transportation if the CnR is cancelled.
The CnR is perfect for students and teaches independence with more safety than
401 or 402 Ltd.
There has not been sufficient marketing, especially to charter schools.
The drivers are great and we feel safe allowing our children to use CnR.
We appreciate the CnR and it will be needed even more with the continued growth
of Highlands Ranch.
CnR would operate better with a central dispatch instead of drivers doing it
themselves.
Ridership would double with a second bus during peak hours.
Students need a bus just for them from 7:00am-9:00am and 2:30-4:30pm.
Parents would be happy to pay a higher fare to keep the CnR service for students.
The community was not given enough advance notice of CnR cancellation to help
do something about keeping it.
One person gave us a written letter. Attached.

The meeting was concluded at approximately 7:45pm.
Federal Heights
Wednesday, October 8, 6:00PM, 2014
Staff in attendance included: Brian Matthews, Pat Heye, and Nate Diaz. There were 28
members of the public in attendance, primarily in favor of the continuation of the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. RTD Board Member in attendance included: Larry Hoy.
Officials included Federal Heights City Council members John Hamlin and Daniel Dick, as
well as Kent Moorman, Traffic Engineer for the City of Thornton.
Director Hoy and Brian Matthews gave an update on the status of the offer to continue the
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride service as a cost share proposal between RTD, Adams County,
Northglenn, Federal Heights, and Thornton until May 8, 2015.

Federal Heights Call-n-Ride - The rest of the public was in support of keeping the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride. The majority of attendees were residents of the Villa Maria senior
living community and were encouraged to attend by community advocate Bonnie Good
and arrived via the Federal Heights Call-n-Ride. Community members stressed the benefits
the service provided, stating that it gave them freedom, the ability to get to the store,
pharmacy, and doctor, an opportunity to make friends with other riders, and access to
restaurants and community and cultural events. One member of the public, who teaches
disabled youth, said that she had just recently learned of the Call-n-Ride and now all 20 of
her students are able to use it to get to and from their jobs at the local ARC. Bonnie Good
spoke last, highlighting the need for the service for students, seniors, emergency
preparedness, first and final mile connections and community building. She also submitted
a letter of support for the Call-n-Ride to the public record (please see attached).
All of the public commended RTD on the dependable, safe and courteous drivers operating
the Call-n-Ride Service. Several community members brought up frustrations with the Calln-Ride scheduling software. One cited complaint was the software’s inability to handle
recurring, once-a-month trips. Frequently mentioned was the software’s inability to handle
multiple passengers wishing to go to the same or nearby destinations and the desire for it
to suggest more logical and efficient routings. One member of the public suggested, as
call-n-Ride buses are replaced, they are re-wrapped with a design that more clearly shows
the “RTD” logo, so as to cut down on confusion as to what it is.
6:47p - The hearing was closed, so that attendees could return home via the Federal
Heights Call-n-Ride.
Parker
Thursday, October 9, 6:00PM, 2014
Brian Matthews conducted the meeting. RTD Staff in attendance included Patrick Heye,
Cesar Ochoa, and Dan Menter. Director Gary Lasater and three Parker city council
members were present. There were 47 members of the public who signed in.

The route 410 only runs between 5:00am-8:30am and 2:00pm-5:00pm. We need

This customer runs a website “rtdpriders.com” and wants everyone to visit it.
The route P always gets assigned the old buses.
We need to extend the RTD boundary to the south because those people ride the
bus and should pay taxes for it.
The route P needs to serve the Pinery area.

Route 31x - One member of the public spoke asking if the last PM trip of Route 31x could
be moved back from a 5:21p departure at Union Station to 5:30p to accommodate the
additional distance to reach Union Station as compared to the former Market Street
Station.

Parker pays 7.9 million annually to RTD and gets almost nothing in return.
The charter school students need CnR service.
The CnR is a necessity to us, not just a convenience.
The senior population is growing fast and depends on CnR service.
The CnR area should be expanded to include the Jorden and Pine area.
Running Saturday service during the holiday season would help ridership.
Remove the 5 minute window and it will speed things up.
The current morning driver has a bad attitude and is hurting ridership.
A second bus would help ridership.
If Lincoln Station were served ridership would increase greatly.
The CnR system needs to have a central dispatch. Drivers have problems with the
phone calls. They often do not answer or return call.
Need to organize shopping trips for seniors.
More marketing needs to be done before cancelling the service.
Should expand the CnR boarders to the west.
Organize some senior shopping trips in the midday to increase ridership.

Equity Analysis

In the pursuit of the provision of mass transit service in the Denver Metro Area, equity is a core principle
of the Regional Transportation District (RTD). An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Environmental Justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national
origin in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically Title VI states, “No person in the
United States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, shall be excluded from participation
in, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898 “Federal Actions to Address Environmental
Justice in Minority and Low-Income Populations,” which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high
and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority
populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular,
the FTA requires RTD to evaluate any and all major service changes to determine whether those changes
will have a disproportionate negative impact on minority or low-income populations.

SERVICE CHANGE PHILOSOPHY
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We continually adjust services in response
to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our
responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or
cancellation of service as warranted. We utilize our official Service Standards to establish performance
metrics by which we identify underperforming services on a class of service basis.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities. The general assembly further finds that the
farebox recovery ratio of the district must be improved so that resources once allocated for
mass transportation can be made available for other surface transportation needs.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

3.B.1.c

Equity Analysis

The FTA also requires that RTD establish policies that will guide the analysis of major service changes for
equity. Accordingly, RTD has established equity analysis policies to meet this requirement and establish a
service evaluation process.

Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change policy, a Disparate
Impact policy and a Disproportionate Burden policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational
requirements for evaluating major service change proposals for equity. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change Policy: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction
in the service hours of any route that would remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All
major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis which includes an analysis of adverse
effects.
a. Adverse Effect: is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service which
includes but is not limited to: elimination of a route, shortlining a route, rerouting an
existing route and an increase in headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse
effects, and analyze those effects, when planning major service changes.
2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority
population 10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a
disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will
consider modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it
removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot
be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service
change, the FTA will allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Major Service Changes
Pursuant to the intent to provide cost effective demand responsive services, RTD has proposed many
service changes to take effect in January of 2015. Per the Major Service Change Policy, the proposed
major service changes subject to this analysis are listed below.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast
Light Rail line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekday hours 6:00am – 6:00pm. Currently, weekday ridership
is at 2.1 passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings
per hour. Ridership has never attained a 3.0 boarding per hour since operations began in November
2008. This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative
service is available using the Routes 401, 402Ltd and 403.

Parker Call-n-Ride – Cancellation
The Parker Call-n-Ride began operating in November 2006 with the opening of the Southeast Light Rail
line. The Call-n-Ride operates weekdays 5:30am – 6:00pm. Currently weekday ridership is at 1.8
passenger boardings per hour. Applicable service standards require a minimum of 3 boardings per hour.
This proposal calls for the discontinuance of the Call-n-Ride due to low ridership. Some alternative service
is available using the Route 153.
Savings: Annual hours saved: 3,200, saving $183,312 (includes fuel).

Equity Analysis Methodology
As previously mentioned, the basic framework for analyzing service changes for equity involves the
comparison of affected populations. The manner in which these populations are identified and compared
is described below:
1. Assess the proposed service change for adverse effects (e.g. frequency decrease, shortlining,
etc…)
2. Obtain applicable population or ridership data (e.g. customer satisfaction survey, census data,

3. Examine the proportions of adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income populations.
The two proposed major service changes are cancellations of Call-n-Rides. Call-n-Ride is a demandresponse bus service. Patrons make a reservation for pick-up at any location within a predefined service
area and can then travel to any destination within that predefined service area. Typically, Call-n-Rides
have operated within multiple low-density, suburban neighborhoods that don’t have a ridership demand
high enough to justify fixed-route bus service.
Considering all customers traveling within the predefined service area can be impacted by these
changes, we’ve elected to utilize U.S. Census population data to assess the impacts absorbed by minority
and low-income populations. Table 2.1 depicts demographic data from the 2010 Census.

As stated in the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, minority and low-income
populations should not be subjected to adverse effects that are at a rate greater than or equal to 10%
more than non-minority and non-low-income populations. Based on this demographic profile, we find that
a service change affecting minority populations at a rate greater than or equal to 32% (22% + 10%)
would be considered a disparate impact. We also find that service changes affecting low-income
populations at a rate greater than or equal to 38% (28% + 10%) would be considered a
disproportionate burden. Accordingly, through Tables 2.2 and 2.3, we will examine the two services in
question, the nature of the service changes and rate at which minority and low-income populations are
impacted. We also utilized Geographic Information Systems (GIS) maps to examine the demographic
data as well (see Appendix A).

CONCLUSION
As mentioned previously, our primary objective within this analysis is to examine proposed major service
changes to ensure minority and low-income populations would not disproportionately absorb adverse
effects. The Census demographic data shows the Highlands Ranch and Parker Call-n-Ride service areas
have percentages of minority and low-income populations well under the applicable policy thresholds of
the disparate impact (32% minority) and disproportionate burden (38% low-income) policies. Therefore
neither disparate impact nor a disproportionate burden was identified and the proposed service changes
do not require revision.

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

October 10, 2014

Board Meeting Date: October 28, 2014

Subject:

Free Rides for Members of the Military

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations & Customer Services Committee that free rides on RTD for active duty
members of the United States Military should be extended from the presently approved date of December 31,
2014 to December 31, 2015. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have minimal impact
on RTD.
BACKGROUND
At the October 30, 2006 Special Board Meeting, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution allowing
active duty U.S. Military personnel to ride free on all RTD services through the end of 2006. This offer has
been extended annually by the Board since that time and is now valid through December 31, 2014. As a result
of these actions, all active duty members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, National Guard,
and Reserves are entitled to ride free on any RTD service including special services such as SkyRide and
BroncosRide. To be eligible to ride for free, active duty military personnel must either be in uniform or present
an active duty military ID card.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the RTD Board of Directors extend this offer beyond the current expiration date of
December 31, 2014 and that the expiration date be extended by one year at this time and revisited again next
year.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The exact financial impact of this action is not known, but is expected to be minimal.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Extend free rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should from the
presently approved date of December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015. This is the staff
recommendation.
2. Do not extend RTD’s program offering free rides for active duty members of the United States Military.

Subject:

Award of Contract for On-Vehicle Advertising

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into a contract with Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year
period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 with a two year option for 2018 and 2019. Under
the terms of the recommended action, Lamar would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales,
whichever is greater.
BACKGROUND
On August 20, 2014, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued soliciting proposals for the sale and
installation of exterior and interior advertising on RTD vehicles. Responses to the RFP were due on
September 25, 2014. This RFP offered proposers the option to submit for one or any of three sections:
1) bus, light rail and commuter rail; 2) ADA paratransit vehicles and 3) other in-vehicle advertising
opportunities. Three responses were received for section 1, and one response was received for each of
section 2 and section 3. Additional research is required prior to staff making a recommendation on the
proposals submitted for sections 2 and 3, so this action item covers section 1 only (bus, light rail and
commuter rail). The two remaining sections will come forward to the Board at a later time.
DISCUSSION
A total of three responses were received for the bus, light rail and commuter rail section of the RFP;
from CBS Outdoor, Direct Media and the incumbent Lamar Advertising of Denver. CBS Outdoor indicated
that they were declining the opportunity to submit a proposal, as they felt the minimum annual
guarantee contained in the RFP ($3.5 million per year) was beyond what they could offer. Staff reviewed
the remaining two proposals for compliance with a set of four minimum qualifications: 1) experience of
firm; 2) onsite key personnel experience; 3) sales history; and 4) financial responsibility. Both Direct
Media and Lamar were deemed to have met the minimum qualifications as outlined in the RFP.
Qualifying proposals were then ranked by a pre-established formula based on their revenue proposal,
which factored both minimum annual guarantee and percentage of net sales.
Upon review of the revenue proposals, Direct Media’s proposal did not meet the minimum annual
guarantee specified in the RFP. Lamar’s revenue proposal exceeded the minimum annual guarantee for
each year. For the first three years of the contract period, Lamar’s minimum guarantee was a total of
$3.9 million more than that of Direct Media.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Lamar’s financial proposal was the most advantageous to RTD, offering a minimum guarantee of $4.0
million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2 million in 2017 or 70 percent of net sales, whichever is
greater. For this reason, staff is recommending that the contract be awarded to Lamar.

Packet Pg. 115

3.B.3

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver for the three year period January 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017 for the exclusive sale of exterior advertising on RTD buses, light rail
and commuter rail vehicles and for the non-exclusive sale of interior advertising on RTD buses,
light rail and commuter rail vehicles. Under the terms of this alternative, Lamar would remit to
RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of $4.0 million in 2015, $4.1 million in 2016 and $4.2
million in 2017 or 2) seventy percent of net sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff
recommendation.
2.

Do not award a contract to Lamar Advertising of Denver and reissue the RFP. This alternative is
not recommended because the contract amount proposed by Lamar exceeded the minimum
guarantee required in the RFP and there is no indication that a higher revenue figure could be
obtained.

Strengths & Weaknesses
• Light Rail Zone Structure
Strengths: Higher fare for longer distance trips.
Weaknesses: Difficult to understand; complex to administer/enforce; inequity
with bus system; applying current zones to future I-225
corridor results in long trips in one zone.

• Bus Class of Service Structure
Strengths: Ability to charge higher fare for longer and faster trips.
Weaknesses: Complication added from combining class of service with
distance traveled on Express, Regional and SkyRide
trips; need to evaluate how to add BRT service and modify
SkyRide rates with the introduction of rail service to the airport.

Existing Fare Structure
Strengths & Weaknesses
• Transfers
Strengths: No additional fares upon boarding subsequent vehicles within a
defined time window and the same service class; only pay for the
up charge when transferring to more expensive class of service.
Weaknesses: Complex transfer rules are difficult to understand and enforce;
disliked by bus operators and fare inspectors; abused by riders;
primary source of conflict between passengers and operators.

• Fare Enforcement
Strengths: Barrier free light rail system has lower capital and maintenance
cost and provides easy access for passengers; bus operators
responsible for fare enforcement on the bus.
Weaknesses: Bus operators responsible for enforcement and verification of
discounts and transfers; complicated zone structure difficult to
enforce; varied validation requirements for different media.

generate ridership.
Weaknesses: Limited sales locations; complicated validation requirements on
rail; complicated administration requirements for the non-profit
agency program; EcoPass program not yet priced on actual
utilization.
Opportunities: Smart Card implementation (MyRide) will allow for many
existing fare media issues to be addressed; potential for
discounts without requirement of up front purchase.

Peer Review: Fare Policies
• Transfers
– Most other agencies also offer free transfers.
– RTD’s 3 hour bus transfer period is notably longer.
– Some agencies limit the number of transfers.
– Portland and Dallas have gone to a 2-hour pass essentially
turning transfers into short duration passes.

• Day Passes
– Day passes introduced 20 years ago as a means of responding to
transfer fraud. Passes available on bus and from TVMs.
– RTD break even point at 3 trips which is in line with other
agencies.
– Many agencies sold day passes on buses or from TVMs.

• Discount Eligibility
– Some agencies have gone to integrating proof of discount
eligibility onto smart cards to minimize disputes with operators.

Opportunities for Fare Simplification
• RTD is only one of three agencies with a distance-based light rail
fare structure. Some agencies (e.g., San Diego and Portland) have
recently eliminated zones to simplify fares.
• RTD’s light rail fare is higher than the bus fare for a trip with the
same origin and destination. Offering comparable and affordable
fares on light rail and bus may enable RTD to provide service more
cost effectively.
• Surcharges for light rail and bus trips connecting to airports are
common. To offset the impact on airport employees, discounted
fares and passes are available for these employees.

Opportunities for Fare Simplification
• Smart card fare systems enable the introduction of accumulators
and fare capping. The implementation of smart card can eliminate
transfer abuse and improve enforcement.
• Some agencies are transitioning away from the concept of paying
for a trip (and offering transfers) towards the concept of buying time.
This can simplify fare enforcement by eliminating the need to
enforce complicated transfer policies, such as no round tripping.
• Day passes are another strategy some agencies have adopted to
minimize transfer abuse. Day passes are also popular among
customers who cannot afford the up front cost of longer period
passes and are convenient for social service agencies to distribute.
