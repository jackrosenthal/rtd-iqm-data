#### 1. Board Report August 2018 Service Changes Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION

No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the public for review and comment.

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, said that staff had developed a network of improved delivery options and that staff would continue to adjust services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance as a whole. He explained that the entire service change process takes three to four months to finalize and staff would host seven public meetings before the next service changes are proposed. He added that this discussion would cover the human resource elements as they pertain to the service change process.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, explained that staff was attempting to align services to match RTD’s available manpower. He noted that currently, RTD was short 144 full-time and 30 part-time bus operators. He stated that it was staff’s collective desire to reach the right level of service that paralleled RTD’s manpower to reach equilibrium. He added that RTD would also hold off on allowing municipalities, such as Boulder, to buy-up service until RTD reached its service service/manpower balance.

Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager, stated that staff was looking to affect the overall service hours. He said that this proposal had a number of service adjustments which included Conifer/Evergreen as well as a restructuring of the 27.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that with respect to the 27, it made sense to cut the route in two. She asked how the area that would not be served would be connected to the system.

Mr. Cater explained that staff wanted to take this proposal out to the public to determine if there were other ways to provide service and access. He said that routes 26 and 27 lend themselves to further adjustment and could potentially be restructured in the future. He added that, if ridership continued to grow, staff would provide additional service to right-size.

Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired as to what would happen when equilibrium was finally achieved. She asked whether staff would keep the status quo or continue to aggressively recruit operators.

Mr. Abel explained that staff’s intent to align service was only an interim strategy. He said that the best way to describe the process was that, as service comes down, the headcount increases, which would eventually meet in the middle, then both would then grow together concurrently.

Director Folska, Ph.D., remarked that the worst case scenario would be that service, when ridership increases, is not adjusted appropriately. She asked for more information on the Colorado School for the Blind.

Mr. Carter explained that in 2012, when the route 401 revision was proposed which is what the route 85 is now, the Colorado Center for the Blind protested that change. He said that, since that time, the school’s housing had moved and was now served by a different route.

Director Catlin asked if there would be any modifications to the proposal after public input.

Mr. Abel said yes and remarked that RTD wanted to engage the public to provide their feedback.

Director Caitlin stated that during her Telephone Town Hall, there were a few comments that pertained to the Evergreen/Conifer service and she wanted to make sure staff received those comments.

Mr. Abel commented that the restructuring is attempting to improve service from the Federal Center Station to the city core.

Director Sisk said that, in respect to the City of Boulder’s offer to buy-up service, if RTD did not accept that money, other districts would suffer. He noted that this was going to be something that RTD needed to get in front of and would be a difficult task. He added that it was not a forever plan and it would be re-evaluated and noted that he was satisfied that this was the correct approach.

Director Menten noted that she was going to host her own Town Hall meeting the following Sunday and asked if the service change brochure would be ready.

Mr. Carter said no, that it would not be ready for two weeks, but offered to get her other materials from marketing.

Director Lubow commented that RTD’s service change process was a backwards way of doing things.

Mr. Carter explained that the first service change meeting would be held on May 29th and the last was scheduled for June 7th. He indicated that the next service change proposal would be presented to the Board in June for implementation in August.

Director Archuleta asked staff how many operators the agency still needed.

Mr. Abel stated that, for both bus and rail, RTD was short 202 positions.

Director Archuleta inquired as to how many people were in the training classes at the moment.

Mr. Abel said that RTD held classes every other Monday. He said that for the previous week 12 people were expected to attend but only 9 showed up. He added that staff was also not in the position to advertise recruitment efforts until the Board approved the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. He noted, as the Leeds School of Business had previously highlighted, that there were only 0.5 unemployed people for every position available.

Director Walker commented that anyone who had been here long enough would know that nothing was set in stone and all routes were fluid. He asked what this meant for mandating.

Mr. Abel explained that it would be an improvement on RTD’s need to mandate. He said that, if RTD could improve its headcount, it would lessen that burden as well.

Director Walker remarked that he had been asked for Saturday service for the 27. He asked if the reduction would help facilitate that addition.

Mr. Carter said that it could. He noted that the route 27 would become a shorter route and staff could shape the service to where it was needed.

Director Williams said that the gentlemen at the table have stepped up to the plate time and time again and she commented staff for the marvelous job they do with the minimum number of employees RTD has.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that the biggest problem in terms of recruitment was that operators face a rude public. She noted the drivers who spoke in front of the Board who said they had been spit on by bus riders, and added that recently, another driver was called racial epithets a couple of times. She said that RTD needed to assure its operators that any kind of assault was met with a zero tolerance policy and a strong stance needed to be taken.

Mr. Abel said that staff will discuss with General Counsel what RTD could or could not do.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that it was criminal under the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) guidelines but suggested that RTD’s buses do not operate under them. She added that RTD needed to stand behind its employees and that any type of assault was unacceptable.

#### 2. Transit Priority Update

Mr. Abel said that staff wanted to provide the Board with a quick update regarding identifying opportunities to improve service through implementation of transit priority strategies. He noted that RTD needed to focus its efforts on utilizing its existing resources for items such as traffic signal priorities and queue jumps.

Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, stated that the Transit Priority Study Goals:

§         Identified and prioritized corridors for transit priorities

§         Transit priorities would:

•          Increase bus service speeds and reduce bus delay

•          Improve bus service reliability

•          Improve customer satisfaction

•          Lead to increased ridership and cost-effectiveness

§         Support community investment in sustainable mobility through interagency coordination: Complete Streets, transit, bicycle, and pedestrian

Mr. Becker noted that in terms of RTD’s bus network:

§         All RTD bus routes were broken down into 40,000 segments for detailed study

§         Multi-step screening was used to identify and prioritize corridors that would best benefit from transit enhancements based on:

•          Speed - measure of delay and reliability

•          Passenger load – benefit the most customers

Mr. Becker stated that in terms of speed:

§         Actual running times were used to estimate speed at segment level

§         Median speed was 17 MPH

§         Slower speeds in places were as expected

Mr. Becker said that for load:

§         Visualized areas with highest levels of passenger throughput

§         Median load of 300 passengers per day

§         High of 18,000 passengers

§         Corridor loads were also as expected

Mr. Becker commented that in terms of the index score:

§         Captures areas with slowest speeds and highest loads (based on median values)

§         Clusters of high scoring areas

§         Corridors such Colfax and Broadway

§         Use index score to identify short list of corridors

Mr. Becker noted that the top 15% of segments:

§         Were the first level of screening

§         Were where the corridors started to take shape

§         Were the building blocks for the network

Mr. Becker stated that for corridor continuity, it was important to:

§         Identify continuous corridors

§         Synergy with current service performance

§         Bottom-up analysis

§         Downtown focus

Mr. Becker remarked that priority corridors would:

§         Adjust alignments to complement radial and grid network

§         Some already being addressed, e.g., E Colfax, US 36, Speer/Leetsdale

§         Narrow priorities with city input

o        Downing St.

o        E 17th and 18th Avenues

o        E 12th Ave.

o        Federal Blvd

o        W Colfax Ave.

o        Havana Blvd.

o        Broadway St (Boulder)

Mr. Becker said that cooperative transit priority treatments would include:

§         Bus lanes

§         Traffic signal priority

§         Queue jumps & bypass lanes

§         Bus bulbs & bays

§         Bus stop accessibility & amenities

§         Next step: Scope of work

Mr. Becker noted that the 17 Federal Boulevard priority intersections were:

- Federal Blvd. & 8th

- Federal Blvd. & W. Jewell Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & Alameda Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & 29th Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & US-6 westbound off ramp

- Federal Blvd. & US-6 eastbound off ramp

- Federal Blvd. & W. 5th Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & 2nd Ave.

- Federal Blvd. &1st Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & Speer Blvd.

- Federal Blvd. & 32nd Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & 38th Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & 10th Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & Exposition Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & W. Virginia Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & Evans Ave.

- Federal Blvd. & Mississippi Ave.

Mr. Becker explained that the Federal Blvd. priority bus stops included:

- 15 priority stops

o        10 meet both ridership and delay thresholds

o        4 meet delay threshold only

o        1 meets ridership threshold only

Mr. Becker said that Federal Blvd analysis assumptions had:

- 120 second cycle length

- 20 seconds of additional green time due to TSP

o        10 seconds early green

o        10 seconds extended green

- G/C improves by 0.17

- Delay reduction expected: 10 – 15 seconds*

o        12 seconds assumed per intersection

- 17 TSP intersections = 204 second delay reduction

Mr. Becker noted that Federal Blvd. proposed northbound improvement benefits and tradeoffs included:

- TSP

o        Bus service reliability improves

§         Minor increases to vehicular travel times on side streets

- Louisiana Ave. Bus Bulb

o        Shortened pedestrian crossing distances; bus service reliability improves

§         Minor increases to general traffic travel times

- Mississippi Ave. Bypass Lane & queue jump

o        Bus service reliability improves

§         Minor increases to general traffic travel times

- Alameda Ave. Bypass Lane

o        Bus service reliability improves

§         Increase to vehicular travel times due to reduction to two thru lanes northbound at Alameda

- Howard Pl. Bus Bulb

o        Shortened pedestrian crossing distances; bus service reliability improves; complements Vision Zero plans at this location

§         Minor increases to general traffic travel times

- 26th Ave. Bus Bulb

o        Shortened pedestrian crossing distances; bus service reliability improves

§         Minor increases to general traffic travel times

- 38th Ave. Bypass Lane

o        Bus service reliability improves

§         Removal of one accessible parking space

- Consolidated Stops

o        Bus service reliability improves

§         Minor increases to walk distances

Mr. Abel stated that it was important to determine how RTD could get as many big bangs as it could for its limited dollars while making strategic investments with low impacts.

Director Anderson commented that she had just attended a presentation from a one person department at the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) who was working on this exact same issue. She said that it is not lost on her that Federal Blvd., Sheridan Blvd., and Wadsworth Blvd. were all state highways. She noted that if RTD could work with other municipalities to get this done she would be very appreciative. She added that this had been a topic of conversation in her city for the past couple of weeks, and in fact, some people in her district have wanted to have bus stops removed because they make them nervous. She also added that a lot of people do not know how to recognize, or understand the yield sign on the back of the buses.

Director Williams said that Denver Street Partners had posted an interesting statistic that outlined Federal Blvd. as the number one corridor for pedestrian fatalities.

Mr. Abel confirmed that RTD was engaged in that process and added that Federal Blvd. was a high priority for RTD and the City and County of Denver.

Director Lubow stated that while this prioritization process was smart and made a lot of sense, she said that staff had forgotten the equitable issue. She noted that the report did not mention anything in her district and her constituents felt like they subsidize Denver.

Mr. Abel explained that staff always has that consideration in their work and added that the age old question in transit planning is how do we find the balance and tradeoff between maximizing ridership and providing service to everyone within the district, and how does that balance create good business and mobility sense.

Mr. Becker noted that while the discussion is centered on one segment, it affects every route from the outside in, and it is a systemic plan.

Director Solano inquired if staff had considered using roundabouts.

Mr. Becker explained that roundabouts were more of a traffic technique and not a transit technique.

Director Walker said that this was similar to a process that Houston METRO went through before they reconfigured their bus system a few years ago.

Mr. Becker explained that Houston METRO was looking at using this process for their entire system and not for rightsizing service like RTD was doing.

Director Walker commented that, now that RTD had completed a large part of its build out, the agency could focus on other areas of its service.

Director Catlin asked if staff was looking for ways to partner with local municipalities to leverage funds.

Mr. Becker commented that RTD had not identified any funds, but various cities already had.

##### a. Transit Priority Update - Board April 2018 Revised

#### 3. Potential Adjustment to Fixed-Route Contractor Agreements

Mr. Abel commented that RTD contracts out 45% of its fixed route services. He said that RTD had contracts with First Transit and Transdev and they operated under four separate contracts. He noted that historically private contractor operators had been paid $1.00 less per hour than the starting wage for RTD operators. He added that, since RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) 1001 re-negotiated its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in February, it was recommended that RTD adjust and amend the existing agreements with First Transit and Transdev so that private contractor operator wages could be increased to a more competitive amount relative to the new starting wage for RTD operators. Mr. Abel added that the amendments would include language, which stated that any funding adjustments would be applied to operator wages and other ancillary benefits and not to overhead, administrative costs, or profit. Mr. Abel commented that the estimated costs would be $4.5 to $5.5 million in 2018 and $6 to $6.5 million in future years. He noted that the purpose of the discussion was to socialize the concept to the Board, and staff anticipated bringing forth an action for Board consideration in May.

Committee Chair Deadwyler asked what staff was proposing in terms of the new contracted operator wage.

Mr. Abel explained that staff wanted to amend the current contracts to be in line with the historical difference in wages, which was $1.50 to $2.00 less than RTD operators.

Director Solano remarked that, while this was a good move forward, the contractor operator pay wage should be comparable to RTD operator wage pay and there should not be a difference between the two.

Director Folska inquired as to when the contractor agreements would be renewed.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD had four contracts that expire on a rolling basis. He noted that RTD was in the process of preparing the documents for the re-procurement of Group 24, First Transit Commerce City. He added that staff may be able to shorten the rebidding cycle, but it would have to be done one contract at a time.

Committee Chair Deadwyler asked if all of the contractor operators were represented by a union.

Mr. Abel stated that First Transit was represented by ATU 1001, which was the same union that represents RTD’s employees, and Transdev was represented by a different ATU group.

Committee Chair Deadwyler noted the recent CBA negotiations with ATU 1001 and inquired as to how RTD could come up with wages for the contracted operators without participating in negotiations.

Mr. Abel explained that RTD would not get involved in the collective bargaining process between contractors and their collective bargaining units, but RTD believes it was appropriate to enter into the conversations with its contractors to allow them to then go and have talks with their collective bargaining units.

##### a. Potential Adjustments to Fixed-Route Contractor Agreements

#### 4. Service Availability Update

Mr. Abel commented that the report was included in the packet and he would be happy to answer any questions.

Committee Chair Deadwyler noted there were no questions and moved on to other matters.

##### a. Service Availability Memo 4 10 18

##### b. Lost Service Hours 4 10 18

### D. Other Matters

Mr. Abel thanked the Board members who attended the employee appreciation barbeques and said that it meant a lot to staff and represented employees to see the Board members at the events.

Director Lubow said that she had received an email from a disgruntled constituent about the Bolt service from Longmont to Boulder. She commented that it was distressing to receive letters like that and, while she understood it was because of operator shortage, RTD’s constituents were being oppressed by lack of service. She added that she was working with staff to provide better notifications for RTD’s ridership.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, stated that Next Ride clearly shows which trips are missed but conceded that it was a passive process and noted that the current system would not accommodate a manual override. He commented that a new system would come online at the end of the year and it should take care of the current issues and be more flexible.

Director Menten stated that she receives the internal rider alerts first thing in the morning and asked if the advanced notice to riders was provided two hours in advance.

Mr. Abel explained that staff was always attempting to fill any route that needed to be filled. He said that the dispatchers were always attempting to pull loop extras, an extra bus in waiting for a particular route to fill voids, which meant a delay in communicating information to the public.

Director Menten commented that, if the new alert system would not be rolled out until the end of the year, she would look for a suitable alternative even it that meant sending out a mass email or text herself. She noted that the 20 and 28 have had problems and she would like to see routes with the biggest issues included on the drop run hours report. She also inquired as to the ridership on the R Line.

Mr. Carter stated that ridership was averaging about 6,400 boardings per day, about half of the 12,000 that was estimated.

Director Sisk stated that he would like the Executive Committee to consider having the April 24th Study Session video recorded. He said that the meeting would have information from the working groups and video from that meeting could be shared with the public as the information would affect every district. He added that the Board needed to provide it to local news stations to show that the Directors are working for the district.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Deadwyler adjourned the meeting at 8:42 p.m.
