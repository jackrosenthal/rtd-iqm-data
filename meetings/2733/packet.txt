Board Report August 2018 Service Changes
Committee

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
Changes to RTD transit service, have historically been measured by and related to ridership and financial
impacts. However, current labor market conditions continue to be a serious challenge to the recruitment
and retention of bus and rail operators. More to the point, the amount of service being provided by
operators working on their scheduled day(s) off is at a level that impedes employee retention efforts and
makes it difficult to meet our service commitments to our customers. To better match the RTD’s
scheduled service offerings to RTD’s available workforce, this proposal starts a process to optimize the
level of service on various routes throughout the District. The proposed service adjustments were
conceived in accordance to the Service Policies and Standards adopted by the RTD Board of Directors.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Notable proposals include a
restructure of service to/from Conifer and Evergreen (CV/CS/CX and EV/ES/EX). Additionally, a proposal
to split the Route 27 into two separate services (Routes 26 and 27) is also included. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Route 3L - East Alameda
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
This proposal consolidates the 5:04pm and 5:24pm trips leaving Civic Center Station.
Ridership on these trips average 39 and 34 boardings respectively, which can be
accommodated on the consolidated trip proposed to depart Civic Center Station at
5:14pm. It is expected that some customers will migrate to earlier and later trips around
the 5:00pm and 5:30pm work stop times.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 510 annual hours
Route 10 – 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local - (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue Saturday service east of Clermont Street, as it is on Sunday/Holidays. Current
ridership along this segment is 168 boardings, corresponding to 10.7 boardings per hour,
which is below both the 10th and 25th percentile standard for CBD Local service of 15.2 22.3 boardings per hour respectively. Alternative service can be found in Routes 6 – East
6th Avenue and 15 East Colfax.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,144 annual hours
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local - (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership it is proposed to reduce Route 20 service frequency from 30 to 60
minutes before 10:00am and after 6:00pm on Saturdays and Sundays. Current
productivity during these time periods is 11.7 passengers per hour, which falls below the
service standard for a CBD Local service of 15.2 boardings per hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,100 annual hours
Route 24 – University Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This proposal discontinues underperforming trips weekday northbound 5:03am (7
boardings), 9:34pm (17 boardings) and southbound 4:43am (10 boardings), 9:13pm (8
boardings). Saturday northbound: 5:39a (9 boardings), 6:39a (12 boardings), 7:34pm (12
boardings) and southbound: 6:13am (12 boardings), 8:13p (9 boardings).
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,665 annual hours
Route 26/27 - Yale Avenue
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Ridership on Route 27 between Englewood Station and Colorado Boulevard has been low
historically and current ridership data shows the segment operating at 12.8 passengers per
hour, which is below the 25 percentile standard for an Urban Local service of 19.1
boardings per hour and only slightly above the 10% standard of 12.2 boardings per hour.
This proposal splits the Route 27 in to two separate route services. The new Route 26 West Yale Avenue service would operate between Southwest Plaza and Englewood
Station. The new Route 27 – East Yale service would operate between University Hills and
Ulster - Tufts.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 4,335 annual hours

1.C.1.a

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Route 46 – South Dahlia
Service Standard type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reduce midday frequency from 30 to 60 minutes south of Colorado Station. Current
productivity for the segment sits at 10.6 boardings per hour. Additionally, reduce Sunday
service frequency from 30 to 60 minutes, where current productivity is 13.8 boardings per
hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,530 annual hours
Route 73 – Quebec Street
Service Standard type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reduce Sunday service frequency from 30 to 60 minutes, before 9:00am and after
8:00pm. Productivity during these time periods is 13 boardings per hour.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 893 annual hours
Route 85 – Chatfield Avenue
Service Standard type - Suburban Local - (10%-4.7 pass. per hr. / 25%-11.4 pass. per hr.)
Introduced in August 2015, the Route 85 was implemented as a measure to clarify bus
service access to the Littleton-Mineral Station, as it covered a portion of what was
formerly included in the Route 401-Ranches service. Due to low ridership performance
(9.8 boardings per hour) this proposal discontinues service on the Route 85. The Suburban
Local standard at the 25 percentile level is 11.4 boardings per hour. This change would
affect 100 passengers per day of which 90% board or alight at a location not served by
another fixed route. However, the entire route is in the South Jeffco Call-n-Ride.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 4,845 annual hours
Routes 100L – South Kipling Limited
CV/CS/CX – Conifer/Denver
EV/ES/EX – Evergreen/Denver
Service Standard type- Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour/ 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
To better match service to customer demand it is proposed to restructure Routes
CV/CS/CX and EV/ES/EX and eliminate service between Federal Center Station and
Conifer/Evergreen. Service would be maintained between Civic Center and
Conifer/Evergreen. Trips between Federal Center Station and Civic Center would be
replaced by trips on Route 100L. This proposal is outlined below:
Discontinue Route CS. Route CS currently carries 17 passengers solely between
Conifer and Federal Center on 8 eastbound trips and 6 westbound trips.
8 reverse commuters on the CV/CS/CX would be impacted.

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Reduce current 30 minute service frequency to hourly service south of Colorado Station
weeknights (14.8 boardings per hour), Saturday (10.1 boardings per hour) and Sunday
(12.5 boardings per hour).
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,645 annual hours

1.C.1.a

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Discontinue Route ES. Impacts 10 passengers between Evergreen and Federal
Center Station. Route ES currently carries 10 passengers solely between Evergreen
and Federal Center on 5 eastbound and 5 westbound trips.
Route EV/ES/EX also has 8 passengers boarding between Aspen Park and
Evergreen PnR that will no longer have service. 7 reverse commuters on the
EV/ES/EX will be impacted.
Remaining service would provide 2 trips on Route EX each direction, each peak and
would provide 3 trips on Route EV each direction, each peak.
Discontinue service between Evergreen PnR and Aspen Park PnR. Impacts 1
passenger. Lutheran Church PnR passengers would instead need to board at
Evergreen PnR.
Discontinue reverse peak in-service on all routes. Impacts 2 passengers.
Provide 5 additional Route 100L trips between Federal Center Station and Civic
Center Station to replace discontinued Route CS and ES trips. Alternative service
can also be found the W Line light rail service and the formation of Van Pools.
This proposal would save approximately 27 weekday hours and an estimated 3 weekday
FTE’s.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 6,885 annual hours
Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Service type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue 6:11am and 8:11am northbound trips. Average daily ridership on these trips is
14.9 and 10.7 respectively.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 408 annual hours
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Service type - Urban Local -(10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Due to low ridership it is proposed to discontinue 4:34am northbound trip from Aurora
Metro Center on weekends, which have 3 boardings on Saturdays and 5 boardings on
Sundays. Alternate trips are available approximately 30 minutes earlier and later from the
same location.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 55 annual hours
Route 157 – CCA/Buckley
Service type - Urban Local - (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
This route was implemented in April of 2016 to provide a replacement for service formerly
provided by the Route 10 along Centretech Parkway to the Community College of Aurora
and Buckley Air Force Base. Current ridership performance is relatively low on this service

Version 3
Packet Pg. 8

Attachment: Atch A - August 2018 (3454 : Board Report August 2018 Service Changs Committee)

Discontinue Route CX. All trips would instead stop at Twin Forks PnR,
providing 5 trips on Route CV in each direction, each peak.

1.C.1.a

Atch A – August 2018 Service Changes

Route 169 – Buckley Road
Service type - Suburban Local – (10%-4.7 pass. per hour / 25%-11.4 pass. per hour)
Discontinue 3:13am northbound trip due to low ridership. The latest data shows an
average of 4 passenger boardings are affected by this proposal.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 383 annual hours
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/19th
Service type - Urban Local -(10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
It is proposed to discontinue the route portion south of Downtown Boulder Station,
between Downtown Boulder Station and Table Mesa, due to low ridership, on Saturdays
and Sundays/Holidays. Alternate routes are available along the Broadway corridor and
within the ¼ mile walking distance of current routing along Moorhead drive. Ridership on
Saturdays and Sundays, currently is less than 1 passenger per trip on the Moorhead
section. The other portion of Route 204 south of Downtown Boulder Station is duplicative
to Routes DASH, SKIP and/or 225.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 1,540 annual hours
Route 209 – CU/Mohawk/Talbot
STAMPEDE – CU/East Campus
Service type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
It is proposed to reduce the AM and PM peak frequency to 30 minutes versus the current
15 minute frequency, as well as the current midday 30 minute frequency to 60 minute
frequency, due to low ridership. Maximum passenger loads per trip range from 1 – 18
passengers. The majority of the route’s boardings and alightings occur between Colorado
& 30th Street and Euclid & 18th Street (Eastbound 165/185 boardings, Westbound
193/210 alightings). This section of the route is duplicative to Route STAMPEDE, which
operates at 10 minute frequency or better, all day.
In cooperation with CU Boulder and City of Boulder, it is proposed to discontinue Route
STAMPEDE between Colorado/Discovery Drive and Marine Street and 30th Street. CU
Boulder will take over this portion of the route via its Buff Route. Route frequency for
Route STAMPEDE would be every 10 minutes, 7am – 5:30pm and every 15 minutes
5:30pm – 7pm. Additional frequency of 5 minutes would be maintained for major class
start and end times, at 9:00am, 10:00am, noon, 2:00pm and 3:00pm.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 3,825 annual hours
Route AT – DTC/DEN
Service type – Regional – (10%-11.3 pass. per hour / 25%-21.9 pass. per hour)
This proposal starts the first two trips northbound and ends the last two trips southbound
at Nine Mile Station rather than Arapahoe Station. The current start times at Arapahoe
Station for these trips are 3:03am (6 pax) and 3:33am (2 pax) northbound, instead these
trips would begin at Nine Mile Station would be at 3:17am and 3:47am. The current

Version 3
Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Atch A - August 2018 (3454 : Board Report August 2018 Service Changs Committee)

(17.7 passengers per hour) and so it is proposed to reduce frequency from 30 to 60
minutes.
Anticipated resource impacts include a reduction of 3,188 annual hours

Re:

Possible Amendments to Fixed-Route Contracts to Address Wage
Changes

Attachment: Potential Adjustments to Fixed-Route Contractor Agreements (3455 : Potential Adjustment to Fixed-Route Contractor Agreements)

1.C.3.a

RTD currently contracts with two companies to provide fixed-route bus service. These
two companies are First Transit and Transdev and they operate under the terms of four
(4) separate contracts, each of which is for a three (3) year term with two (2) one-year
options. Collectively, these contractors provide approximately 45% of RTD’s fixed-route
service.
First Transit provides service under three contracts:






“Group 24” (“First Transit-Commerce City”) which is operated out of the First
Transit Commerce City location. This contract includes local service in metro
Denver and was implemented on 8/17/14. This contract provides approximately
334,700 revenue hours of service per year;
“Group 26” (“First Transit-Longmont”) which is operated out of the First Transit
Longmont location. This contract includes local service in Boulder and Longmont
and was implemented on 1/3/16. This contract provides approximately 189,400
hours of service per year;
“Group 27” (“First Transit-Denver”) which is operated out of the First Transit
Denver location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was
implemented on 5/13/17. This contract provides approximately 344,600 hours of
service per year.

Transdev provides service under one contract:


“Group 25” which is operated out of the Transdev Englewood location. This
contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on
1/4/15. This contract provides approximately 339,700 hours of service per
year.

Packet Pg. 34

Historically, the starting wages paid for operators by the private contractors have been
approximately $1.00 per hour less than the starting wage for bus operators for RTD. In
February of 2018, RTD re-negotiated its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the
Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and increased the starting wage for bus and rail operators
to $19.40 per hour. The current starting wages for bus operators for the private contractors
are currently as follows:
First Transit Commerce City (Group 24)
Transdev (Group 25)
First Transit Longmont (Group 26)
First Transit Denver (Group 27)

$15.38 per hour
$15.71 per hour
$15.43 per hour
$15.26 per hour

Due to the low unemployment rate in Colorado and the highly competitive labor market, there
is concern that the disparity in operator starting wages between the private contractors and
RTD will entice a high number of bus operators at the private contractor operations to “jump
ship” – to quit their jobs and apply for jobs with RTD. As a result, our contract partners will
lose employees and be unable to meet their service commitments to RTD and our customers.
This will result in dropped service for our customers and a decrease in reliability, one of the
primary determinants of transit ridership. In order to mitigate a large-scale migration, it is
recommended that RTD renegotiate the existing Agreements with First Transit and Transdev
so that private contractor operator wages can be adjusted to a more competitive amount
relative to the new starting wage for RTD operators and the local Denver labor market for
drivers.
In addition to the adjustment to starting wages it will also be necessary to adjust the wage
scales for existing operators as well. Wages for operator trainers, dispatchers and street
supervisors will also be increased as wages for these positions are typically determined based
on an operator wage plus a stated per-hour increase (e.g. the operator wage plus $1.00 per
hour).
The purpose of this memo is to expand on previous conversations with the Board that staff
would be back to discuss additional issues related to the approval of the CBA as this is one of
the areas previously anticipated for additional conversations with the Board.

Re:

Service Availability- March 2018

Attachment: Service Availability Memo 4 10 18 (3451 : Service Availability Update)

1.C.4.a

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 98.4% of all scheduled hours of
bus service in March 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons
did increase from 283.44 hours in March of 2017 to 1556.16 hours for the month of
March 2018 and from 851.85 hours YTD in March 2017 to 3216.29 for the YTD in
2018.
While RTD did provide in excess of 98.4% of all scheduled hours of service in the
month, it was necessary to cover 2647 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of
their schedule days off). This represents approximately 21,176 hours of service being
provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours
provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Contributing to our service challenges in March were several bus bridges and several
snow days as well as a number of maintenance related challenges at TransDev which
we are in the process of addressing with TransDev staff. Staff continues to work with
Human Resources and other departments to address ways to improve recruitment and
retention among bus operators.
