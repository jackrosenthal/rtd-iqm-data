CAC Update
Debra Wilcox explained that after the meeting and work session for October, the
CAC may restructure the December 14th meeting and hopes that the Board will
participate. There will be a 5:30 p.m. reception followed by a roundtable discussion
from 6:00 – 8:00 p.m.
Ken Burns added that he wanted to applaud the Board for waiting to approach the
voters for a potential tax increase given the fact that recent tax initiatives were
voted down in the recent election.

Recommended Action


Assumptions for FasTracks 2012 Annual Program Evaluation

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the scope of the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) to
include the following assumptions:
Sales and Use Tax
 Successful .04% sales and use tax election in November, 2012, with new
revenues effective January 1, 2013.
 The new sales and use tax will fully sunset
 Debt proceeds secured by the new sales and use tax will be used ONLY for
the remaining, partially-funded projects (as identified in Table 1)
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be available to pay for O&M for
the remaining, partially funded projects.
o Existing .04% sales and use tax would not be able to fund O&M on
the new corridors until after 2035. Absent this flexibility, this could
result in a scenario where there is not enough funding to operate and
maintain the corridors once they are built.
o RTD needs to maintain the ability to manage O&M as a system, not on
a corridor-by-corridor basis.
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be combined for debt service
coverage purposes
o If revenues cannot be blended for debt service coverage purposes,
RTD cannot issue new bonds in time to complete the program by 2020
at a 2.00x Additional Bonds Test (ABT)
o Issuing Debt at less than 2.00x ABT could result in:
•
Lower Credit Rating
•
Higher Interest Rates
•
Reduced pool of potential investors
•
More risk for completing the program if revenues do not meet
expectations.
Scope
 Construction and operation of all the FasTracks corridors and projects,
including Denver Union Station, West Corridor, Central Corridor Extension,
Eagle Project, I-225 Corridor, Light Rail Maintenance Facilities, North Metro,
Northwest Rail, Southeast Corridor Extension, Southwest Corridor Extension
and RTD’s remaining proportionate share of US 36.

Summary of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee held on Tuesday, November 8, 2011





Scope of these corridors and projects consistent with the final environmental
clearance documents, currently approved designs, signed contract documents
and any minor modifications resulting from future value engineering efforts
o Current design assumptions will be used to update capital cost
estimates for the remaining corridors
Establishment of a program-wide contingency is being considered to ensure
funding is available to complete the FasTracks system on time.
o If there is contingency left over after all the corridors are complete,
RTD staff and the RTD Board of Directors will work with stakeholders
to develop a recommendation concerning the use of any remaining
contingency. Options could include:
 Fulfilling outstanding commitments allowed by the original
FasTracks plan
 Paying down the existing bonds so that they sales and use tax
can sunset earlier than targeted

Schedule
 Corridor construction phasing consistent with the current Board adopted
2011 APE, as approved in the most recent (201 0) Annual Report to DRCOG
on FasTracks (See Attachment 1)
o Note: specific completion dates may shift to match updated cash flow
assumptions
Bill Van Meter explained that staff is seeking solid guidance from the Board of
Directors moving forward. There will not be an additional financial impact related to
this action item.
Julie Skeen noted that there are four alternatives to this recommended action: The
Board could choose to not move forward; RTD will not build anything until there is
enough funding to build everything; Projects will be built in segments; and capital
improvements on the Northwest Rail will be done by the railroads. Staff does not
recommend those alternatives, but they would also work.
Director O’Boyle added that he did not see any advantages in trying to tweak the
current plan. The action that was approved last year is unchanged and as a matter
of consistency we should move forward as is. We are on the right track.
Director Tayer indicated he will not be voting for this item and needs more time to
discern all of the information. Director Tayer also suggested that staff reach out to
US 36 with these options.
Motion:

Director McMullen made the motion
to forward this item to the full
board at the November 22, 2011
Board meeting.
Chair Kemp seconded the motion.



Renaming of Northwest Rail Corridor South Westminster Station

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors adopt the name Westminster Station for the Northwest Rail Corridor
Phase I end of line station, previously referred to as the South Westminster
Station in the Northwest Rail Corridor Environmental Evaluation. This
recommendation is consistent with the current Board Policy on station naming.
Chris Quinn explained that the City of Westminster had requested this name
change since it fits in better with their redevelopment plans for the area.
Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to
forward this item to the full board
at the November 22, 2011 Board
meeting.
Chair Kemp seconded the motion.

Intergovernmental Agreement with CDOT and Funding Authorization for the
I-225 Nine Mile to Iliff Avenue Light Rail Transit and Parker Road to
Mississippi Avenue Highway Reconstruction Project.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) for the joint I-225 Parker Road to Mississippi Avenue Highway
Reconstruction & FasTracks-Nine Mile Station to Iliff Station Light Rail Transit
Construction Project (the project). This action authorizes funding in the amount
of $28 million for the light rail components of the joint RTD/CDOT project

Summary of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee held on Tuesday, November 8, 2011

including the light rail median bridge structures, Yale Avenue Bridge
Reconstruction, retaining walls, and basic civil components. Funding for this IGA
in 2012 is included in the 2012 Recommended Budget for the I-225 Segment 1
project, and funding for future years is included in the FasTracks Financial Plan.
Director O’Boyle inquired if the 14% for oversight was CDOT’s figure, or ours.
Del Walker indicated that the 14% is not just for the oversight commitment, but
for the procurement as well.
Motion:
Director Tobiassen made the motion
to forward this item to the full
board at the November 22, 2011
Board meeting.
Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Authorization of Fiscal Authority to the General Manager for the Segment 1 of
the I-225 Rail Line

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors ("Board") authorize the General Manager or designee with fiscal
authority for Segment 1 (Nine Mile to Iliff) of the 1225 Rail Line in the amount
not to exceed $90 million. This authority shall include the ability to negotiate and
execute all contracts; work orders; change orders and contract modifications;
agreements for the acquisition and conveyance of property interests; and
intergovernmental agreements that are necessary or advisable to complete
Segment 1 of the 1-225 Rail Line within the scope of the 1-225 Project budget.
Rick Clarke explained that the intense nature of construction projects requires
quick decision making capability at the project level. Construction is very volatile
and failure to provide direction to contractors in a timely manner can result in
delays or expensive work. This authority only extends to the project budget
amount.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion
to forward this item to the full
board at the November 22, 2011
Board meeting.
Director McMullen seconded the
motion.

Approval of Eighth Year (2012) Contract Amendment to Jacobs Engineering
for FasTracks Program Support Consulting Services.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to approve the eighth year contract
amendment to Jacobs Engineering, in the amount of $19,794,332 for Program
Support Services Consulting for FasTracks for the year 2012. Funds for the
award are contained in the 2012 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program.
Rick Clarke noted that Jacobs Engineering provides management support and
specialized technical staff to augment RTD FasTracks Team staff. Key staff
members are co-located with RTD Staff at the RTD FasTracks offices, and they
function as an extension of RTD Staff. This approach adds value, costeffectively, by allowing RTD to specialized resources in planning, environmental,
design, engineering, program control, and related disciplines on an as-needed,
often part-time basis.
Del Walker added that Jacobs continues to provide DBE participation well beyond
the established 7% goal.
Chair Kemp added that he would be in support of this action item. Jacobs has
not only been a support structure for staff and the Board, but for our
constituents as well.
Motion:
Director Bagley made the motion to
forward this item to the full board
at the November 22, 2011 Board
meeting.
Chair Kemp seconded the motion.

Quality Management Consultant Services.

Consulting Services for FasTracks for the year 2012. Funds for the amendment
are contained in the 2012 RTD FasTracks Budget.

Summary of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee held on Tuesday, November 8, 2011
Page 7
Kevin Diviness explained that some of the key deliverables and assistance
received from the Delcan/QMC team in 2011 included establishment of a Quality

Program for Project Management Process and Establishment of a Quality of Life
Measurement Program. For 2012, related RTD work includes construction on

Approval of Contract Amendment to Front Range Systems Consultant (FRSC)
for FasTracks Systems Engineering Consultant Services.

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise a six-year option to
extend the term of the contract with Front Range Systems Consultant (FRSC) for
Systems Engineering Support Service Consulting through December 31, 2017.
It is further recommended that the Board of Directors approve a Contract
Amendment with FRSC in the amount of $9,775,710 for the year 2012, bringing
the total contract authorization to $43,303,631. Funds for the contract award
are included in the 2012 Recommended Budget for the FasTracks capital
program.
Pranaya Shrestha noted that RTD selected a single Systems Engineering Consultant
for the entire FasTracks Program for consistency and standardization of design. This
approach will provide consistency in Systems design, save the RTD cost and will
facilitate the operation and maintenance of the system. FRSC will support RTD’s
Systems Engineering staff on managing West Corridor, NorthWest Rail, SE/SW/CC
Extensions, DUS, I-225, North Metro, and Eagle Projects.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to
forward this item to the full board

Updates
 Review of Public Opinion Survey Results
Bob Drake of Talmey-Drake explained that the objectives of the Public Opinion
Survey were to track how attitudes have shifted over time towards RTD and the
services it provides, to test messages developed through the focus group process
and to test reaction to recent service changes. Key findings showed that RTD,
Light Rail, and FasTracks comprised three of the top four very favorable ratings
among nine key organizations and public officials. Familiarity with FasTracks is at
58%, up eight points from 2010. 76% of voters have a positive impression of
FasTracks and 78% of voters think that approving FasTracks in 2004 was the
right decision. Also, 68% of voters believe that by altering current routes and
services, RTD is showing sound fiscal responsibility by living within its means.
Relative to messaging of FasTracks, the three most important messaging are
relieving congestion, providing greater choice when getting around and providing
greater convenience when getting around. The message related to creating jobs
resonate less with the voters.
A copy of this presentation is available on the FasTracks website.
 Rocky Mountain Performance Excellence Award
Rick Clarke shared that the staff has attended this event where this award was
presented to RTD.

IV.

Other Matters
Director Tayer noted that the Citizens Advisory Committee will have committee
appointments soon and wanted this to be as transparent as possible.
Scott Reed explained that staff had sent around a sign-up sheet for the Telephone
Town Hall schedule. Mr. Reed urged the Directors to choose the most appropriate
time for their individual schedules and once a time is designated/chosen it cannot be
changed.
