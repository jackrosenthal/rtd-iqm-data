BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: September 26, 2018

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

September 26, 2018

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a cost of $276,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2019).
This action represents the fifth and final year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included
in the annual budget.
Goals:
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Core Goal #5: Effective Communications & Community Outreach
Task Goal #3: Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by an evaluation committee that
recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and to date has
assisted in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant
monitoring of Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special
reports are prepared when required by the Board of Directors or the General Manager.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process.
The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST) was passed on December 4, 2015, and the
federal lobbyists played a key role in representing RTD’s needs in this reauthorization bill. With the build
out of FasTracks, the lobbyists need to be especially attentive to the federal financing needs for the new
corridors, and they will monitor discussions and advocate for RTD’s best interests regarding new plans
for the Executive Office’s infrastructure bill to be introduced sometime in the near future. When the bill
is revealed, Squire Patton Boggs will play a key role in advising RTD as to the contents of the bill and
monitoring the amendments and progress of the proposed language.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the US Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation, as well as
advising staff on proper protocols for these agencies.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves in an important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire
Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at cost of $276,000 (January 1 through December 31,
2019). This action represents the fifth and final year of a five-year contract. Funding for this
contract is included in the annual budget.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor (Squire
Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability in liaison
services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for Federal
Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was properly
utilized for this procurement, and all the proposals were reviewed and subjected to the evaluation
criteria, resulting in a recommendation from the evaluation committee—pursuant to RTD’s longstanding procurement procedures.

Re:

October Board Update

The Joint Budget Committee received the September Revenue Forecasts from Legislative Council and
the Office of State Planning and Budgeting (OSPB).
Both forecasts show the US and Colorado economies are still performing very well. The nation is on
track to post the longest economic expansion in US history due to healthy levels of job creation, robust
consumer spending, rising incomes, and solid business activity.
For the fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2018, both forecasts show general fund revenue excess of
$103 million higher. This surplus is a result of stronger than expected sales, individual income, and
corporate income tax collections.
According to Legislative Council, this surplus means that the JBC will enter into the discussions about the
upcoming 19/20 budget with $1.16 billion or 9.2 percent more to spend or save in the General Fund
than what is budgeted for FY18-19. The OSBP forecast has a slightly higher growth rate.
The recent US Supreme Court ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, Inc. provided an unanticipated source of
revenue. The Legislative Council forecast included an estimated maximum of $110 million in additional
sales tax collections per year as a result of this ruling. Both forecasts anticipate Tabor refunds for
FY2018-19 and FY2019-20.
Although this forecast is positive there are still a number of uncertainties that could impact Colorado’s
revenue outlook. The November ballot includes several measures that would have significant fiscal
constraints on the state budget as well as others that make substantive changes to Colorado’s tax
collections. These factors in combination with changes at the federal level could change the long-term
forecast for the state. The Governor’s budget will be submitted to the Joint Budget Committee by
November 1st.
BBMK has confirmed that General Manager Genova and RTD Board Chair Tisdale will present on October
1st at 9 am for the statutorily required update to the Committee. BBMK would encourage board
members to attend this meeting.
BBMK is monitoring two transportation ballot initiatives filed by the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce and the Independence Institute. Both initiatives received the required number of signatures
to proceed and will appear on the November ballot. BBMK has attached a separate memo that includes
more detailed information about all the initiatives that will be on the November ballot.

Re:

2018 Ballot Initiatives

On Monday September 10th the Secretary of State officially certified the November ballot. The ballot
includes for consideration: three constitutional amendments, four statutory changes, and six measures
referred from the Colorado General Assembly.
Citizen Initiated Ballot Measures
Proposition 109 Fix Our Damn Roads: this measure would authorize $3.5 billion in bonds to fund
statewide transportation projects including bridge expansion, construction, maintenance and repairs.
The measure would require that the state repay the debt from the general fund without raising taxes.
This measure is being proposed by the Independence Institute.
Proposition 111 Limits on Pay Day Loan Charges: this measure would restrict the charges on payday
loans to a yearly rate of 36 percent and would eliminate all other finance charges and fees associated
with payday lending. This measure is being proposed by an organization called Coloradans to Stop
Predatory Payday Loans.
Proposition 112, Minimum Distance Requirements for New Oil, Gas, and Fracking Projects Initiative:
this measure would mandate that new oil and gas development, including fracking, be a minimum
distance of 2,500 feet from occupied buildings and other areas designated as “vulnerable.” Vulnerable
areas are defined by the initiative as “playgrounds, permanent sports fields, amphitheaters, public
parks, open space, public and community drinking water sources, irrigation canals, reservoirs, lakes,
rivers, perennial or intermittent streams, and creeks and any additional vulnerable areas designated by
the state or a local government. The current regulations specify that wells must be 1,000 feet from
high-occupancy buildings such as schools and hospitals, 500 feet from occupied buildings such as homes
and 350 feet from outdoor areas like playgrounds. This measure is being proposed by Colorado Rising.
Proposition 110, Let’s Go Colorado: this measure would authorize $6 billion in bonds to fund
transportation projects, establish the Transportation Revenue Anticipation Notes Citizen Oversight
Committee, and would increase the state’s sales tax and use rate by .062 percent (from 2.9 percent to
3.52) percent for twenty years starting on January 1, 2019 through January 1, 2039. This measure is
being proposed by the DMCC. The revenue from the increased sales tax would be placed into the
following accounts and spent as follows:
• 45% to the State Highway Fund for bond repayment and state transportation funding including
highway construction and maintenance.
• 40% to the Local Transportation Priorities Fund for municipal and county transportation projects
and
Packet Pg. 10

Attachment: State Update 10-2-18 (3579 : State Update - Brandeberry McKenna)

From: Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK)

1.C.2.a

15% to the Multimodal Transportation Options Fund for municipal and county transportation
such as mass transit and paths for walking and biking. To receive these funds counties and
municipalities would need to match 50 percent of the funds.

Amendment 73, Funding for Public Schools: this measure boosts income taxes to raise money for
education by establishing a tax bracket system rather than a flat tax rate and raises taxes for individuals
earning more than $150,000 per year, raises the corporate income tax rate and creates the Quality
Public Education Fund. There would be no change in income taxes for those earning between $0 and
$150,000 which would continue to be taxed at the current rate of 4.63 percent. The initiative would
also increase the corporate tax rate from 4.63 percent to 6 percent. The measure would decrease
property taxes levied by school districts but does not affect property taxes levied by other local
governments. The property tax rate for residential property would be decreased to 7 percent and nonresidential property rate would be decreased to 24 percent. Lastly the measure would establish a fund
called the Quality Public Education Fund. This measure is proposed by Great Schools Thriving
Communities.
Amendment 74, Compensation to Owners for Decreased Property Value Due to State Regulation
Initiative: this measure would require that property owners be compensated for any reduction in
property value caused by state laws or regulations. This measure is being proposed by the Colorado
Farm Bureau.
Amendment 75, Campaign Finance: this measure changes campaign finance limitations so that if a
candidate contributes or loans more than $1 million to his or her candidate committee, then all
candidates in the same election who did not benefit from the contributions are entitled to accept
aggregate individual contributions for a primary or general election at five times the current rate. This
measure is being proposed by two former Colorado legislators Rep. BJ Nikkel and Senator Greg Brophy.
Constitutional amendments referred by the Colorado General Assembly
•
•
•
•
•

•

Amendment A: amends the state constitution to prohibit slavery and involuntary servitude as a
punishment for a crime and thereby prohibiting slavery and involuntary servitude in all
circumstances.
Amendment V: amends the state constitution to reduce the age qualification for a member of
the Colorado General Assembly from 25 years to 21.
Amendment W: changes the format of the election ballot for judicial retention elections by
consolidating retention questions.
Amendment X: changes the definition of industrial hemp.
Amendment Y: changes the way that congressional districts are drawn by taking the duty to
draw congressional districts away from the state legislature and giving it to an independent
commission composed of 12 citizens with restrictions designed to prevent control and influence
by one political party.
Amendment Z: changes the manner in which state Senate and House districts are drawn and
reforms the existing legislative reapportionment commission by expanding the commission to
twelve members, authorizing the appointment of members who possess specified qualifications
and prohibits any one political party’s control of the commission.

Congressional Negotiations Continue on FY 2019 Spending Bills.
FY 2019 Transportation-HUD Bill:
While the Senate has passed its FY 2019 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development
(THUD) appropriations bill, the full House has not considered its THUD bill. Congressional
staff for both the House and Senate appropriations committees have, however, been preconferencing the two THUD bills this month, and intend to include the THUD bill as part of a
four-bill appropriations package that is nearing completion. That package has not yet been
released, however, and at this time it appears unlikely that Congress will vote on a final FY 2019
THUD bill before current-year transportation appropriations expire on September 30.
Short-Term Continuing Resolution:
This week we expect Congress to pass and send to the President another appropriations package
that includes a short-term Continuing Resolution (CR) that would fund through December 7
those departments and programs of the Federal government – likely including US DOT – for
which Congress has not yet reached final agreement on spending legislation. Thus, it appears
likely that US DOT programs would continue at FY 2018’s historically high funding levels
under the CR until the FY 2019 spending bill is enacted.
RRIF Program Language in the CR and FY 2019 THUD Bills:
US DOT and the Office of Management and Budget have secured language in the short-term CR
that appears to be a step backwards in our efforts to direct US DOT to begin returning credit risk
premiums due and owing to borrowers who have repaid their loans under the RRIF program.
While bill text for the FY 2019 THUD spending bill has not yet been released, we understand the
THUD bill may make further changes to the law governing RRIF credit risk premiums. Such
changes could affect our continued efforts to secure the return of the credit risk premium on the
DUSPA loan, so SPB remains directly engaged with US DOT, House and Senate Committee
staff, and our Congressional delegation. We have made clear that RTD has followed all the rules
of the RRIF program and simply expects US DOT to do the same.

1.C.3.a

Upcoming Midterm Elections Could Affect Infrastructure Legislation and RTD’s
Congressional Delegation.

Democrats have already stated that a large infrastructure package will be a top priority, should
they take control of the House. Infrastructure investment has long had significant bipartisan
support and could be an area in which House Democrats and the White House work together in
the new Congress. If Congress considers a large infrastructure package next year, it is also likely
to consider reauthorizing surface transportation programs in the same bill, as the Fixing
America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act expires in September 2020. Additionally,
Democrats would likely be willing to consider a Federal gas tax increase to address the Highway
Trust Fund’s (HTF) chronic revenue shortfall and may also consider reestablishing
Congressional earmarks to direct infrastructure investment to particular projects.
The elections could also affect RTD’s Congressional delegation. While all other Colorado
incumbents appear to have safe seats, Representative Mike Coffman (R-CO-06) is in a close race
with Democratic challenger Jason Crow. Recent polling shows that currently 40 percent of
voters support Coffman while 51 percent support Jason Crow. Hillary Clinton carried the district
by 9 points in the 2016 Presidential election.
FTA Acting Administrator Addresses Critics at APTA Annual Meeting.
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Acting Administrator, Jane Williams, spoke at
APTA’s meeting in Nashville on September 24. She touted FTA’s deployment of historic levels
of discretionary grant and formula funding and the Agency’s approach to reducing regulatory
burdens on transit agencies. She also emphatically defended FTA’s implementation of the
Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program, and decried what she described as outsized and unfair
“myths” about the Agency’s actions to implement the program. She noted that the current
Administration has deployed significant CIG funding on pace with prior Democratic and
Republican Administrations, and that her focus on geographic diversity in grant awards is
consistent with prior Administrations as well.

The upcoming midterm elections on November 6 could produce changes relevant to RTD’s
mission and interests, both here in Colorado and at the Federal level. At this time, the most
likely outcome of the Congressional elections will be that the House switches to Democratic
control while the Senate remains in Republican control.

Recommendation for Contract Award to
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. for RFP
18FH013, On-Call Construction Materials
Testing and Inspection Services

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a Work Order contract to RockSol Consulting
Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for On-Call Construction Materials Testing and
Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four years, with four one-year options to extend the
period of performance. Funding for the initial tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding
for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
On May 18, 2018, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for On-Call Construction Materials Testing
and Inspection Services. The selected firm would conduct testing of construction materials that is
required within RTD specifications, and specialized inspections of construction that lies outside the
expertise of RTD staff. This work is currently performed under a previous contract that was awarded in
2008, but that contract is approaching the end of its period of performance, so it was necessary to
bring in a new firm that could perform the necessary services for upcoming projects.
The RFP included the following evaluation criteria:
1. Project Team – Weight 30%
 Qualifications and ability of professional personnel
 Experience on similar projects as a team
 Commitment of key staff members
2. Firm Capability – Weight 30%
 Firm’s ability to do project concurrent with existing and project work load
 Firm’s to provide entire spectrum of testing services identified in the Scope of Work
3. Past Performance on Similar Projects – Weight 20%
 Demonstrated ability to control costs
 Demonstrated ability to perform quality work
 Demonstrated ability to meet project schedules
4. Work Location – Weight 10%
 Ability to support projects throughout RTD’s entire District boundaries
5. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises – Weight 10%
 DBE Program Plan demonstrating DBE commitment
 Identify past performance with DBE programs

2.B.1




Demonstrate how DBE firms will be integrated into team structure
Demonstrate creative initiatives, technical support and outreach efforts for DBE
participation

Since this is an Architectural/Engineering procurement, selection was based solely on the Technical
Proposal without reference or consideration to cost.
On June 29, 2018, seven written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:
 Geocal
 Ground Engineering Consultants, Inc. and TRIAX Engineering
 Kleinfelder, Inc.
 Kumar and Associates, Inc.
 RockSol Consulting Group, Inc.
 Vine Laboratories, Inc.
 Yeh and Associates, Inc.
On July 26, 2018, the five-member selection committee met to review and score the proposals. As a
result of this meeting and by unanimous consensus, RockSol Consulting, Inc. was selected as the best
technically qualified firm.
DISCUSSION
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. is recommended for contract award as the most technically qualified
consultant team for the following reasons:
 Project Manager is licensed Professional Engineer with 33 years experience
 Highly experienced technicians
 RockSol along with subs Vivid and ITC provide qualifications necessary to provide full spectrum
of expected services
 Capacity matrix provided available resources and commitments
 Utilization of Cost Projection Reports to track budget
 Certification to international quality management standard ISO 9001
 Team members familiar with RTD management systems such as Aconex and Quality Records
Database
 RockSol and Vivid provide two labs within the District for good coverage
 Although RockSol is a DBE, they provided a very detailed DBE Program Plan in their role as a
prime contractor for this work
Although cost was not a consideration for selection, RockSol provided a cost proposal that was
consistent with RTD’s Independent Cost Estimate. RockSol’s workscope will initially include two
upcoming projects:
 Commuter Rail Maintenance of Way Building and Related Infrastructure
 20th and Chestnut Turn Lane
DBE INVOLVEMENT
RTD specified a DBE goal of 16% for the Work to be performed under the resulting contract. Since
RockSol is a certified DBE, they have committed to exceeding the RTD goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 17

2.B.1

RTD began negotiations on August 6, 2018. We have concluded negotiations with an initial pricing of
$30,000 for the two tasks identified in Discussion. Funding for these tasks is included in the 2018
Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these
services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a
contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for OnCall Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four
years, with four one-year options to extend the period of performance. Funding for the initial
tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the
budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. Rather, continue utilizing the existing
consultant contract for all testing and inspection needs. This is not recommended. Although the
Board has previously authorized an extension of this consultant’s contract through 2019 to
complete their current work on the SERE and NMRL projects, the Period of Performance including
option years is approaching its end and the recommended firm provided the best proposal going
forward.

Authorization
for
Additional
Acquisition for Eagle P3 Project

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018
Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties as
necessary for constructed infrastructure on the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Goal – Task Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD issued an RFP for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the Eagle P3 Commuter
Rail Project and contractually, RTD has been required to obtain possession and make available to the
contractor right of way necessary for the construction of the project. By Resolution 001 Series of
2010, Resolution 017 Series of 2011, Resolution 006, Series of 2012 and Resolution 012 Series of
2012, the Board found and determined certain property to be necessary to be acquired within the
corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose. As construction on the project was completed, it
was determined that survey work to verify location of certain constructed infrastructure should be done
and as a result of the survey work, additional property needs have been identified as required for the
project. Specific legal descriptions will be prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This
process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of the additional property
identified.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by survey and authorize the
General Manager and/or Project Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the Eagle P3 Project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the Eagle P3 Project Team that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties

as necessary for construction of the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorizing staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This is not recommended as failure to acquire required
properties would be contrary to federal guidelines.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2018

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Eagle P3 Commuter
Rail Project and associated Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (the Project); and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation
sheets, which list the additional properties to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the acquisition of the Properties, it may
be necessary to initiate condemnation proceedings and to obtain immediate
possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Eagle P3 Project, although financially compensated according to the law,
makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.

The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate
with property owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to
address concerns of owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively
impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the Properties as soon as permitted by law.

Subject:

Construction Award for RFP 18 DB-001 –
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash LLC in the amount
not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract
is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals – Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The Boulder maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1978 and opened for operations in
February 1979. Original design capacity of the garage was based on 96 buses. Currently, 123 buses are
being stored and maintained including washing the busses at this facility.
DISCUSSION
The system is a two lane bus wash. The original wash was installed in 1979 and then replaced in 1995.
This new project is considered to be a full rebuild. This system has been increasingly difficult to repair as
parts are becoming obsolete. The project was advertised as an RFP. The RFP was advertised on June
14, 2018. Proposals were due on August 8, 2018. Qualifications, experience, personnel, and cost were
all a part of the award criteria. Twelve firms were originally notified of the project. Four teams ended up
on the proposers list, but only two teams submitted.
1. AutoAuto Wash LLC
AutoAuto Wash LLC – Demolition
InterClean Equipment - Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
Galloway Engineering, Inc – Engineer of Record
Security Plumbing – Plumbing
Zapplin Electrical, Inc. – Electrical
DeAndrea Concrete – Concrete
2. Gilmore Construction Corporation
Kubat – Wash Equipment Installer
NS Corporation – Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
ADK – Electrical Design Build Subcontractor
MSI – Mechanical / Plumbing Design-Build Subcontractor
ABO Group – Architect
Proposals were rated in the following manner:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Cost – 40%
Key Staff and Technical Experience – 25%
Technical Approach – 25%
Technical Innovation / Creativity – 10%

Gilmore Construction Corporation cost proposal came in at $1,174,240 and AutoAuto Wash was at
$841,111.48.
The selection committee was made up of three evaluators. The evaluators were Shayne Ford of the
Facilities Engineering Division, Anthony Romero, Boulder Maintenance Manager for Bus Operations, and
Edward Callies, Boulder Facilities Maintenance Supervisor. The evaluation meeting was held on August
22, 2018. The committee’s combined evaluations clearly identified AutoAuto Wash to be the most
qualified proposer. Their proposal was $333,129 less than Gilmore Construction Corporation and their
proposal strengths were technical approach with their proposed equipment, technical innovation,
creativity, and previous project experience with vehicle wash systems.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
There was no SBE goal set for this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Local funding for this contract is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2018
Amended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Re-advertise the project later in the year. Re-advertising
could gain additional competition, but could also lose competition or have no proposers.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Cancel the project and utilize the funds to repair the
system as it breaks down. This is not recommended because the existing system is difficult to
repair as parts are becoming more obsolete.
