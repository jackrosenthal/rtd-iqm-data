BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Date:

Subject:

Termination of Lease between the Fiddler’s
Business Improvement District and the
Regional Transportation District

General

Board Meeting Date: February 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to terminate the
Lease between the Fiddler’s Business Improvement District (FBID) and the Regional Transportation
District (RTD) for additional public parking spaces for RTD transit customers in the vicinity of the RTD
Arapahoe Light Rail Station on the west side of I-25. Proceeds of this transaction will total $1,100,000,
which will be deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system.
BACKGROUND
The Lease, dated October 10, 2002, recorded October 11, 2002 at Reception No. B2193529 of the real
property records of Arapahoe County provided an additional 1,000 parking spaces for use by RTD transit
customers to be available on or after September 1, 2006; RTD paid a total of $1,680,000 through
divided monthly installments beginning September 30, 2002 through August 30, 2006. The Lease term
was established for 75 years starting September 1, 2006 through September 1, 2081 and established
minimal parking fees for RTD transit customers.
A First Amendment to the Lease, dated February 22, 2007, reduced the number of parking spaces to be
available for use by RTD transit patrons and approved repayment of money by FBID to RTD for that
purpose. The number of parking spaces available for RTD patron use was reduced to 470 and the
reimbursement by FBID to RTD amounted to 1,888,484.94 (which included consideration for the 530
spaces released by the First Amendment plus 5% interest per annum, compounded annually from the
date of each RTD payment.)
In 2011 the FBID requested termination of the Lease. RTD and FBID negotiated and agreed to terminate
the Lease including releasing, waiving and relinquishing all rights, duties and obligations against any
actions, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses arising under the Lease. The termination agreement
provided for FBID to pay RTD $1,000,000.00 by December 31, 2013 or the date on which the City of
Greenwood Village, Colorado would issue a building permit for construction of any building on Lot 1,
Greenwood Plaza South Filing No. 12, County of Arapahoe, whichever occurred first. The RTD Board
approved this transaction at the December 2011 Board Meeting, however, the FBID was unable at the
time to finalize the negotiated termination.
DISCUSSION
RTD and FBID have negotiated and currently agree to terminate the Lease. The Lease Termination
Agreement will provide that as consideration for the early termination of the Lease and First
Amendment, FBID shall pay RTD $800,000 in good funds on or before July 31, 2017 at which time
RTD will release 340 of the 470 remaining parking spaces under the Lease. Finally, FBID shall pay RTD
$300,000 on or before July 31, 2018 at which time the Lease will terminate as to all of the parking

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

spaces including releasing, waiving and relinquishing all rights, duties and obligations against any
actions, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses arising under the Lease and the final 130 parking spaces
will be released.
A Personal Guaranty with John W. Madden, Jr., as Guarantor, will be executed providing that Guarantor
personally guarantees the payments which FBID is obligated to make.
Parking at the Arapahoe Village Center Station parking structure averages at approximately 42%; with
approximately 466 of the 1,115 spaces utilized. No RTD transit patron parking can be verified in the
structure operated by FBID.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD will receive $800,000 in 2017 and $300,000 in 2018, for a total of $1,100,000. These funds will
be deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system upon receipt. This is consistent with the
original Board approval of this transaction in December 2011.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to execute all documents necessary to terminate the Lease between the Fiddler’s Business
Improvement District (FBID) and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) for additional public
parking spaces for RTD transit customers in the vicinity of the RTD Arapahoe Light Rail Station
on the west side of I-25. Proceeds of this transaction will total $1,100,000, which will be
deposited in the Operating Reserve for the base system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This will have no physical impact on parking spaces
necessary for RTD transit customers and RTD will not receive consideration at this time.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 1, 2017

From:

Henry
Stopplecamp,

GM

Date:

February 1, 2017

Subject:

Approval of 2017 - 2019 Granite Paver
Maintenance Contract for 16th Street Mall
Transitway Lanes

General

Board Meeting Date: February 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to execute the
three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance with Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation, in the dollar amount of $2,865,102.16. Funding for the first year of this action is
$915,680 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
BACKGROUND
The Free Mall Ride bus service connects Denver Union Station and Civic Center Plaza, and carries
approximately 40,000 passengers per day on 16th Street in Downtown Denver (“Mall”). A portion of
the Mall, from Civic Center Plaza to Market Street was built in 1982 with granite pavers as the surfacing
materials. The right-of-way is owned by the City and County of Denver, but RTD took on the
maintenance of the Transitway pavers in 1984.
For the past three years, RTD has been spending approximately $1.1 million a year, on average, on
repairing the Transitway pavers. In 2013, the City and County of Denver committed to participate in the
cost of granite paver maintenance and pay RTD 30% of the annual paver maintenance cost, up to an
annual maximum of $300,000, for a period of ten years.
Over the past 18 months, RTD staff led an environmental clearance effort to evaluate different paving
material alternatives for the Transitway. Recently, a broader vision for the Mall has come under
consideration. This includes evaluation of the Transitway surface materials, as well as the location and
width of the transit lanes within the Mall footprint. This approach will address not only the need to
implement more sustainable materials, but also the long-term livability factors and uses of the Mall.
DISCUSSION
This contract provides granite paver repair, replacement and/or maintenance within the 16th Street Mall
Transitway between Broadway and Market Street. Colorado Custom Rock Corporation tendered the
lowest competitive bid. They have been deemed responsive and responsible. Historically, previous
contractors have utilized eight employees and material vendors that supported approximately 10 parttime jobs for each Work Order. As needed, granite pavers are purchased from a separate vendor (Cold
Spring Granite).
The lowest responsive and responsible bidder as shown on the list below is Colorado Custom Rock
Corporation for the three-year contract amount of $2,865,102.16.

Bidder List:

Bid Amount:

1) Colorado Custom Rock Corporation

$2,865,102.16

2) Gallegos Masonry, Inc.

$2,946,353.00

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The RTD 2017 Adopted Budget includes $915,680 to fund the first year of this contract. Funding for
the remaining two years of the contract was included in the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan.
DBE / SBE GOAL
All work will be completed by a single contractor. There was no DBE / SBE Goal established for the
original contract.
ALTERNATIVES
Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all
documents necessary to execute the three-year contract for 16th Street Mall Granite Paver Maintenance
with Colorado Custom Rock Corporation, in the dollar amount of $2,865,102.16. Funding for the first
year of this action is $915,680 and is included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.
Do not accept the recommended action. Allow the Transitway pavers to fall into disrepair, which will
lead us to reroute or discontinue the Free Mall Ride bus service.
Resolicit the work. This is not recommended as historically we have only had a couple of firms bid on
this work.
