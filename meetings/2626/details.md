#### 1. 2017-006 : Budget Transfer for Router Upgrades

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.

BACKGROUND

Network equipment that supports commerce and security activities on the Southwest, Southeast and Central Plate Valley rail lines are no longer in a state of good repair. The network equipment and switches need to be replaced as the technology is at end-of-life and may become unreliable.

The new network equipment includes multiple network switches and routers which connect to RTD’s core network infrastructure. Total estimated costs are not to exceed $900,000.

In 2015, a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) funding request was made to replace equipment on one of the three rail lines. This project has $320,000 available. An unrelated project, the Garage Concentrator Upgrade project, was completed under budget and has $325,000 remaining that can be used for the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project. The Garage Concentrator Upgrade project originally included contract services to install the equipment. The Information Technology team opted to install the equipment using in-house resources resulting in overall project savings of $325,000. The remaining $255,000 needed for the Network Equipment project is available in the Information Technology expense budget.

DISCUSSION

As the district continues to lean more heavily on technology, our reliance upon the network infrastructure increases in need and criticality. For example, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) accept credit cards. The network equipment that connects the TVMs to RTD infrastructure must adhere to Payment Card Industry standards. Moreover, this network equipment is used to transport information to the Public Information Displays (PIDs) on the platforms, and is used by security in support of the security cameras and emergency telephones.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The project budget will not exceed $900,000. $325,000 was previously approved in the SBP. This request is asking for permission to transfer $320,000 from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade Project and $255,000 from the Information Technology expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       RTD replaces the equipment and switches on one rail line at a cost $325,000. This leaves two other rail lines at risk of equipment failure potentially leaving RTD unable to collect revenue, use emergency telephones, and collect security camera footage.

3.       RTD does not replace the legacy switch equipment on these lines and continues to use the existing equipment, some of which is not Payment Card Industry compliant. This puts the agency at risk of violating PCI endorsement.

#### 2. 2017-007 : ITS Work Order Contract

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.

BACKGROUND

RTD has need of an on-call contractor to perform work in support of initiatives including Information Technology Governance; Service Provision, Acquisition and Contracting; Intelligent Transportation Systems, Emerging Technologies and Transit Business Operations.  The contractor will provide technical support of the agency’s broad range of technologies and applications. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods.

DISSCUSSION

RTD conducted an open procurement for an ITS Work Order contractor.  Six firms submitted proposals.  The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected three firms for interviews.  Apex was selected as the successful proposer.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The contract authority shall not exceed $10,000,000.  Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.  The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project.  Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.  The amount is not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one year.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       Provide the needed services with RTD personnel.  RTD personnel does not have the expertise or capacity for the work provided by a work order contractor.  This does not meet the needs of RTD.

3.       Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement.  This would take well over six months and not likely result in a different outcome.

#### 3. 2017-008 : Approval of Contract Extension for Special Event Ticket Sellers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.

BACKGROUND

RTD is currently contracted with Central Parking Systems, Inc. for a term of three years plus two option years.  The initial three-year period had a contract value of $448,336.09.  The first option year has been exercised increasing the contract amount to $598,336.09.  Exercising the final option year will add $172,000.00 to the contract authority for a revised contract amount not-to-exceed $770,336.09.

DISCUSSION

Ticket sellers are deployed to supplement ticket vending machines (TVMs) and Park-n-Rides during periods of high passenger volume for special events.  Providing these supplemental ticket sales avoids long lines at the TVMs, allows for more streamlined boardings and provides good customer service.  These ticket selling services are used during Rockies and Broncos games as well as other special events such as The Race for the Cure, large concerts, etc.

Central Parking provides the staffing necessary for these supplemental ticket sales.  RTD retains all fares sold by the ticket sellers and pays Central Parking for the staffing they supply.  The following shows the last three years of ticket sales performed by Central Parking.

The ticket sellers on the rail corridors are housed in secure booths at certain rail stations where high passenger volumes occur.  The booths have internet and power connections which allow the sellers to accept credit cards as well as cash.

RTD has contracted with Central Parking to provide the staffing for these supplemental ticket sales because RTD does not have enough staffing resources in-house.  During these events, RTD schedules additional coverage with RTD revenue technicians to service TVMs and also may provide some RTD ticket sellers that use handheld ticket selling devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Exercising the final option year will authorize $172,000 in contract funding.  Funding for 2017 is included in the 2017 Amended Budget approved by the Board of Directors in June 2016 and will be included in the 2018 Budget request.

ALTERNATIVES

1)      Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is the recommended action.

2)      Do not approve the recommendation by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is not the recommended action because it would result in long lines to purchase tickets, uneven boardings and customer dissatisfaction.
