## I. Call to Order

Committee Members Present:              Chair Anderson, 1st vice-chair Bagley, Secretary Daly and Treasurer Walker.

Director Hoy arrived late.

Staff Present:              General Manager Washington, Paula Perdue

## II. September Board Meeting Agenda Review

Chair Anderson reviewed the agenda. She asked if there would be any updates by the Chair of the General Manager Oversight & Performance Management Committee. Director Bagley indicated that he plans to report out that the next GM Survey Monkey will start on October 14th.  Board members will have 2 weeks to complete. He asked Paula Perdue to provide possible meeting dates for the Committee to begin looking at the General Manager’s annual performance evaluation which will need to be approved by the full Board in December.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the September Board Meeting Agenda.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              General Manager Washington shared that some of the concerns expressed by Board members on the Park Creek District and Forest City Stapleton IGA had to do with the $5.6M cost.  The issue is what happens if we go over that amount.  General Manager Washington stated that staff feels confident we have sufficient contingency to cover the unexpected.  There is some environmental mitigation work that has been done.  His team will call the Board members to explain.

General Manager Washington also shared that there are three items that the US 36 stakeholders would like to see included in the action item for the final scope elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit:  bike  cages, parking structure at Church Ranch and inclusion of maintenance facility.  The reason staff is pushing back on the bike cage is because this is considered an enhancement or betterment compared to what we consider standard across the region.  He met with the stakeholders and agreed to include some language in the report.  The revised language in the Board report now reads “The US 36 stakeholders have requested RTD’s support to upgrade bike parking at the stations in the form of bike shelters.  Per the final report from the First and Final Mile Study conducted by the stakeholder group, 36 Commuting Solutions will take the lead with the stakeholders on a grant writing and fundraising campaign for the Bus then Bike facilities.  It is RTD’s intent to cooperate with the stakeholders as they pursue such funding for both capital and operations and maintenance of these upgraded facilities.”

Vote on Motion:              The motion passed five in favor and zero against to move the September Board agenda to the September 17 Board meeting.

Chair Anderson declared the motion passed.

#### A. Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.

##### a. Investment Policy 083013

#### B. Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. Inter-governmental Agreement Amendment

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of an existing Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the Central Park PnR along the East Rail Line.  It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary documents to convey a certain amount of RTD property for dedication as City and County of Denver ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the infrastructure improvements has been determined to be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the FasTracks Eagle project budgets.

##### a. CPS PNR BoardReport Exhibit_082813_22x34

#### C. Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is RTD Staff’s desire and intent to implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36 Corridor.  RTD Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor.  Approval of this action will allow RTD to commit to the completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation of defined scope items, as RTD does on every other project in the FasTracks program.
