Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the
design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the

Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors approve the final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to
establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is RTD Staff’s desire and intent to
implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36 Corridor. RTD

Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively
complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor. Approval of this action will allow
RTD to commit to the completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation
of defined scope items, as RTD does on every other project in the FasTracks
program.

Date: September 5, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

September 5, 2013

Board Meeting Date: September 12, 2013

Subject:

Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2012. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
The Policy, among other things, outlines the investment objectives, standards of care, eligible
investment securities, credit and maturity parameters and diversification parameters. It is conservative in
nature and identifies its principal objectives as: safety, liquidity and yield, in priority order. The Policy
specifies reporting requirements and requires a system of internal controls designed to protect RTD
against loss of funds due to fraud, employee error or imprudent actions by employees.
Staff is not recommending any changes to the policy at this point in time but will continue to look for
ways to refine and improve the policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Packet Pg. 9

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

1. PURPOSE

2.11.A.a

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.

The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.

2.11.A.a

4.2 Delegation of Authority

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.

Packet Pg. 11

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to
the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

2.11.A.a

5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS

Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security is purchased.
Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (“NRSRO”)
include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category will
include bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3
for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below the
minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity date. Portfolio
percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date of purchase of
the investment.
The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the following investment
types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time Deposits/Time Certificates
of Deposit and Banker's Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds or certificates
of indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America.
100% of the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum
maturity for investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. U.S. Agency Obligations. Obligations issued by or fully guaranteed as to principal and
interest by those Federal Agencies or United States government-sponsored enterprises
described in 24-75-601.1(1)(b) (an ‘Agency” or “Agencies”). Eligible Agencies shall be
rated no lower than the highest category by any NRSRO. No more than 75% of the
Portfolio may be invested in Agency obligations with no more than 25% being invested
in a single U.S. Agency. Subordinate debt of any U.S. Agency is not authorized. The
maximum maturity for investments in Agencies shall be limited to five years.
In the event that one or more NRSRO rates such Agency obligations below the highest
rating category but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD's funds
may continue to be invested in Agencies if the maturity from the date of settlement to
maturity does not exceed three years. The diversification limit set forth in the prior
paragraph (no more than 75% of the Portfolio may be invested in Agency Obligations
with no more than 25% being invested in any one Agency) shall apply.
3. Municipal Bonds. Obligations of a political subdivision of any state, including bonds
payable solely out of revenues from a revenue producing property owned, controlled or
operated by the state or any local agency or by a department, board, agency or authority

2.11.A.a

6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of

7
Packet Pg. 15

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

2.11.A.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

Packet Pg. 17

Attachment: Investment Policy 083013 (1688 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

Date: August 29, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

August 28, 2013

Board Meeting Date: September 12, 2013

Subject:

Park Creek Metro District & Forest City
Stapleton, Inc. Inter-governmental Agreement
Amendment

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of an existing Inter-Governmental
Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the
funding for the design, construction, and management of the infrastructure that will support the Central
Park PnR along the East Rail Line. It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary documents to convey a certain amount of RTD
property for dedication as City and County of Denver ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the
infrastructure improvements has been determined to be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in
the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the FasTracks Eagle project budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 1996, with the opening of DIA and the closure of the Stapleton Airport, RTD began operating a Bus
Transfer Facility and PnR at the previous parking site with surface and covered parking of over 1,000
spaces being provided through a license agreement between RTD and the City & County of Denver. In
August of 2010, RTD relocated its commuter parking to an interim gravel PnR at the northwest corner of
36th Avenue & Central Park Boulevard with approximately 1,500 surface parking spaces and an on-street
bus transfer operation on 36th Ave between Ulster and Central Park Boulevard.
During 2001, RTD received a CMAQ grant for the proposed relocation of the Stapleton PnR/Bus Transfer
Facility. Environmental clearances were initiated for the new permanent site between Smith Road /37th
Place and west of Central Park Boulevard. Several concept designs were proposed and coordinated with
the City and the developer over the years.
In July 2010, RTD entered into an IGA with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. for
acquisition, design and construction of public infrastructure improvements. Approximately 50% of the
identified Park-n-Ride site was acquired in late 2011. In the spring of 2012, a finding of “no further
action” was received for the environmental cleanup. This allowed RTD to acquire the remaining property
in July 2012, which gave RTD a total property ownership of approximately 20 acres on three individual
parcels that are separated by public ROW.
RTD amended this IGA twice with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City Stapleton, Inc. The first was
for early traffic signal and intersection design of Smith Road & Ulster Street ($39,279.00) to initiate
PUC applications by RTD’s Eagle team for the East Rail Line. The second was for implementation of
final design of the public infrastructure improvements ($150,000.00). These two amendments were
within the signature authority of the General Manager.

2.12.B

DISCUSSION
This will serve as a park-n-Ride for the new Eagle project Central Park Station. RTD committed to
provide 1,500 spaces as part of the Environmental Impact Statement.
The design of the infrastructure improvements was closely coordinated by the Park Creek Metro District
(PCMD) and its design consultant (URS). RTD staff and the project design consultant (FHU) reviewed,
commented, and ultimately approved the infrastructure design, and agreed with the proposed funding
share as described in the initial IGA and finalized in this 3rd amendment.
The infrastructure
improvements project was publicly bid and a negotiated best value was initiated by PCMD, and was
found to be within the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulations and RTD’s procurement policies.
The construction of the infrastructure improvements is scheduled, and stated within the IGA, to be
complete four months prior to the opening day of the East Rail Line. The infrastructure construction will
be managed by PCMD. RTD will fund, oversee and approve the infrastructure improvements that are
adjacent to the RTD development site, including approval of any change orders over $50,000. PCMD is
completing a best value process and a construction contract is anticipated during the 3rd Qtr. 2013,
which will include a cost maximum value for RTD’s portion of the work that is part of this third
amendment to the IGA $5,564,325. If the submitted proposals exceed RTD’s allowable funding
($5,564,325), RTD will have no further payment obligation, but PCMD may suspend work unless
resolution is reached.
The infrastructure improvements for which RTD is responsible include: all or split portions of Smith
Road (54%) from approximately Syracuse to Xanthia Street; Ulster Street from 37th Place to Smith Road
(100%); Uinta Street from 37th Place to Smith Road (100%); and 37th Place from Ulster to its’ easterly
limits (located just west of Central Park Boulevard) (50%).
The infrastructure improvements for which PCMD is responsible include: all or portions of Smith Road
(46%) from approximately Syracuse to Xanthia Street; Ulster Street from 36th Avenue to 37th Place
(100%); Uinta Street from 35th Avenue to 37th Place . (100%); and 37th Place from Ulster to its’ easterly
limits, located just west of Central Park Boulevard (50%). The layout and overall cost sharing
responsibility is shown on the attached exhibit.
This infrastructure project will provide the roadway network and utilities to support the proposed Central
Park PnR having 1,500 surface parking spaces with 12 bus bays, which will connect to the Central Park
Commuter Rail Station along the East Rail Line. The Central Park PnR is currently in final design and
scheduled to be under construction in the spring of 2014 with an anticipated 3rd Qtr opening. A
separate construction contract for the PnR will be recommended for Board approval during the spring of
2014
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This total work of $5,564,325 is budgeted by the Eagle Project ($5,058,477) and the strategic budget
plan ($505,848).
The project includes a DBE component of 20%, which is being directed by PCMD.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute a third amendment of
an existing Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) with Park Creek Metro District & Forest City

Stapleton, Inc. for participating in the funding for the design, construction, and management of the
infrastructure that will support the Central Park PnR along the East Rail Line. It is also recommended
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute the necessary
documents to convey a certain amount of RTD property for dedication as City and County of Denver
ROW. The cost maximum for RTD’s share of the infrastructure improvements has been determined to
be $5,564,325. Funding for this IGA is included in the 2013 Amended Capital Programs and the
FasTracks Eagle project budgets.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as RTD has agreed in the initial
IGA to participate and to provide funding, of which we have already expended $189,279 toward the
project design.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because both design and
construction costs are anticipated to increase as the overall economy improves. Also, delaying this
action will jeopardize the opening of the Central Park PnR with the opening of the East Rail Line.

Approval of Final Scope Elements for US 36
Bus Rapid Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve the
final scope elements (as illustrated in the table below) to establish BRT in the US 36 Corridor, as it is
RTD Staff’s desire and intent to implement a “World Class” Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) in the US 36
Corridor. RTD Staff believe that the implementation of these final scope elements will effectively
complete a model BRT in the US 36 Corridor. Approval of this action will allow RTD to commit to the
completion of the US 36 BRT project through implementation of defined scope items, as RTD does on
every other project in the FasTracks program.

to the station for residents north and
east of US 36 in Broomfield.
*Note: RTD’s ability to provide the full fleet required for opening day service will be dependent
on the cost of the vehicle that can best satisfy the corridor’s service requirements.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan provided $204.1 million for BRT in the US 36 Corridor. The
original budget assumed $66 million for the RTD contribution for the HOV/Bus lanes (this was prio r
to the decision to pursue Managed Lanes) along with various upgrades to the corridor’s stations. The
remainder of the scope was left undefined. This budget has been adjusted with each Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) to reflect rises in the composite construction labor and materials costs.
However, unlike all of the other FasTracks corridors, RTD did not define a specific scope for the
corridor for the following reasons:




The joint CDOT/RTD Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) was not completed when the
FasTracks plan was under development;
It was unknown at the time of the FasTracks plan development how BRT would integrate with
CDOT expansion of the highway; and
It was assumed that construction would likely be led by CDOT since many of the anticipated BRT
elements would share the CDOT facility.

For these reasons, the FasTracks plan opted to create a budget which was deemed reasonable for
completing BRT in the Corridor. To date, RTD has completed the following improvements in the
corridor:










Construction of the McCaslin station platforms;
Construction of the McCaslin pedestrian bridge over US 36;
Relocation of the Church Ranch park-n-Ride;
Construction of the Church Ranch station platforms and slip ramps;
Relocation of the Broomfield park-n-Ride;
Construction of the Broomfield station platforms and slip ramps;
Construction of the Broomfield pedestrian bridge;
Construction of the Table Mesa pedestrian bridge; and
Construction of the Table Mesa eastbound station platform and slip ramp.

Additionally, RTD has also committed funding to CDOT and the High Performance Transportation
Enterprise (HPTE) for ongoing US 36 Managed Lanes construction. The US 36 Managed Lanes
project will construct the shared guideway (managed lanes) for travel time savings and reli ability,
install new station canopies, a fiber-optic communications network, and programmable information
displays for customer information. The managed lanes project also includes construction of the US
36 bikeway from the US 36 EIS. With the completion of all these projects, approximately $75
million (2015 dollars) remains in the FasTracks US 36 BRT budget commitment.
DISCUSSION
Many of the corridor’s stakeholders have expressed concern that, unlike every other FasTracks
corridor, the US 36 Corridor has not included a defined scope and, they have advocated that RTD
instead work with the stakeholders to define a BRT scope for the corridor and establish the
corresponding cost for the necessary capital items required to complete that scope in future
budgeting efforts. Through the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) process, the study’s project

Packet Pg. 26

2.12.C

team has worked with the stakeholders to determine the remaining capital elements that should be
included in the scope. At the July 30, 2013 NAMS Joint Policy/Tech nical Advisory Committee
(PAC/TAC) meeting, the PAC/TAC members agreed that, with the completion of the Phase I BRT
improvements and the completion of the Managed Lanes project, the following remaining scope
items should be implemented as part of US 36 BRT:

Station Amenities

Staff has determined that the first five elements on the list – station amenities, security upgrades,
Transit Signal Priority, Passenger Communications improvements, and vehicles (depending on vehicle
cost) – can be funded and in place by opening day. The US 36 stakeholders have requested RTD’s
support to upgrade bike parking at the stations in the form of Bus then Bike Shelters. Per the final
report from the First and Final Mile Study conducted by the stakeholder group, “36 Commuting
Solutions will take the lead with the stakeholders on a grant writing and fundraising campaign for
the Bus then Bike facilities.” It is RTD’s intent to cooperate with the stakeholders as they pursue
such funding for both capital and operations and maintenance of these upgraded facilities.

Packet Pg. 27

2.12.C

As shown in the table below, depending on the final cost of the remaining capital it ems, and
depending on the chosen BRT vehicle, the remaining cost for establishing BRT could vary between
$58 million and $79 million. Funding for these items could potentially come from the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) and potentially from outside grants. In any case, staff is in
agreement with the stakeholders that, in order to establish BRT in the corridor, RTD should focus on
completing the required scope listed above rather than defining the project through the FasTracks
remaining commitment.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Depending on the final cost of the remaining capital items and the chosen BRT vehicle, RTD could be
required to allocate up to $4 million more than originally anticipated for the corridor. As noted above,
potential funding sources for these items could come from the FISA or other potential outside grant
sources.
