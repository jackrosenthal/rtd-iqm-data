2.1.a

Think about the certainty you have about the answer to this question. It’s called
axiomatic or geometric certainty. You recognize this as a example of the statement
that objects don’t fit in containers that are smaller than themselves, and you are so
sure that you don’t need data. If someone told you they’d put an elephant in a
wineglass you wouldn’t believe them. Most of this presentation presents facts about
which we have this kind of certainty.

2.1.a

The problem of fitting vehicles into streets is just like the problem of fitting elephants
into wineglasses. You can fit some vehicles into a street, but the number is finite.
This has nothing to do with psychology or consumer preferences or culture.
Geometry has a veto over all of those things.

2.1.a

When someone asks this questions, they’re really asking “What are my options in
life? Where could I work? Where could I study? What organizations could I belong
to? Who will I meet?” These questions all boil down to one: “How free am I?”
Physical freedom is your ability to go places so that you can do things.

2.1.a

This is an example of a freedom analysis from our current study in Dublin, Ireland.
The blob shows where a person living near Dublin City University could get to in 45
minutes on transit plus walking. This is the “wall around her life.” In a sense, we are
all in prison, where the walls of our prison are the limits of where we could get to in a
reasonable amount of time. Beyond that wall are jobs you can’t hold, schools you
can’t study at, and a whole world of things you can’t do. We expand freedom in two
ways: by moving the walls outward, which is what good transportation planning does,
and by building more stuff inside the existing wall, which is what good land use
planning does.

If Jane can get to 43% more jobs, and if we assume that other kinds of opportunities
grows at the same rate, Jane is 43% more free, because she has 43% more
meaningful options in her life.

2.1.a

Freedom is not just a good thing in itself. Every other key goal that people bring to
transit presumes that it’s delivering freedom. Ridership arises from freedom. So
does real estate value – at least when it comes to freedom achieved by car.

2.1.a

The picture, of course, illustrates Lincoln’s idea. When stuck in traffic, you are also
part of the cause of the traffic. In the act of denying freedom to others you
experience the denial of your own freedom.

17
Packet Pg. 19

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

The path from a network to a freedom calculation is pure math, so it is far more
certain than any prediction about human behavior, such as what goes into a ridership
prediction. That’s why it is good to talk about freedom separately. Still, growing
freedom is the core of how you grow ridership, which is why ridership models
proceed in the two steps illustrated. First, they calculate the freedom outcome from
a plan, and then (more dubiously) they try to predict human behavior. Social science
is important, but predictions about human behavior are always less certain than
predictions of math.

2.1.a

When our firm does a transit plan, we put all their route by route data into a master
database. Note that over many routes in many cities, higher frequency corresponds
to higher productivity. Notice how remarkable this is. Increasing frequency increases
operating cost, which should pull the productivity ratio DOWN. Instead, frequency
pays off so well that the ratio goes up. Note: this doesn’t mean that you’d increase
productivity by increasing frequency just anywhere. This correlation also reflects the
fact that frequency tends to be deployed in places where the land use is favorable –
an issue we’ll come back to below.

21
Packet Pg. 23

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Frequent buses are great because unlike rail, you make make them abundant enough
that they can’t possibly increase real estate costs everywhere. So they are a great
basis for organizing affordable housing.

22
Packet Pg. 24

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

This street in Portland has a frequent bus line. There’s no rail anywhere nearby, but
good, useful service that’s part of a grid of frequent lines. As a result, the site has a
good “freedom blob”. This is also about 2 miles out from downtown. All this
redevelopment has occurred in the last 10 years. A key was the low level of offstreet
parking required because the planners assume that the people who choose to live
here are choosing not to rely on cars much. Low parking requirements are critical to
making housing affordable.

23
Packet Pg. 25

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

We cannot offer freedom equally everywhere. It is much more expensive to provide
freedom in some places than in others, but the places where transit has trouble
providing freedom tend to be the places where the private car is a good option.
These slides are a purely geometric explanation of why.

24
Packet Pg. 26

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

There are four geometric features of a community that matter. Notice that I am not
talking about identity or culture. I’m talking about pure, unavoidable geometric facts
that arise from how a community and its streets are designed.

25
Packet Pg. 27

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

These two bus lines have the same operating cost, because each has two buses
running along it. But in the upper image, there are twice as many people around
every stop. So if everyone is equally likely to use transit, the ridership/cost would be
twice as high in the upper image. In fact, density pays off even more than that,
because it often implies other features, such as higher costs and hassle of driving and
parking, that mean each person is likely to find transit more useful. So that’s two
positive relationships between density and transit: Density means a larger market,
but also each person is more likely to value transit. That’s why the payoffs of density
are often exponential, at least until you get to the extreme density of a highrise city
where many trips become walk trips.

26
Packet Pg. 28

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

The two images on the left show a bus stop at the center and the abstract 1/4 mile
radius that we often think of as the market of a stop. The black lines show places in
that circle that could actually walk to the stop in 1/4 mile. A connected grid street
network provides much better access to the stop. In the disconnected street network
in the lower image, over half of the circle is walled off from the stop. This effectively
makes the market smaller, which makes service to the stop a less effective
investment for the transit agency. In addition, it must be safe to cross the street at
every stop.

27
Packet Pg. 29

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Our architecture and development friends understand density and walkability, but
they may not all understand linearity, which is a specific need of transit. These two
images show two ways that the same four developments could be arranged. In the
upper image, they are all in a reasonable straight line, which means that transit can
operate on a path.

28
Packet Pg. 30

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Finally, all other things being equal, going longer distances costs more than going
shorter distances. So sheer horizontal growth, which generates longer average trip
lengths, makes transit more expensive and less attractive.

Here’s a map of a simple fictional city. The dots are residents or jobs, so dots close
together indicate high density. You have 18 buses to deploy. What’s the right
network design. It depends on the community’s goals.

2.1.a

Ridership and coverage goals are universally popular, but because they lead,
mathematically, to opposite kinds of network, policy boards and elected officials
need to choose what balance they want between them. If you claim to be doing
both, you are telling your staff to do something that’s mathematically impossible.
Impossible demands guarantee failure, and this is one of the reasons that it’s easy to
mis-describe transit as failing: Coverage services are counted as services that are
failing at a goal of ridership, when in fact ridership isn’t their goal and is therefore not
a valid basis for assessing them.

34
Packet Pg. 36

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Of course, the ridership-coverage tradeoff is not “either-or”. It’s a spectrum. You can
choose any balance between these two goals, but if you move toward one you are
moving away from the other. Another way to visualize this is as a pie chart dividing
the budget between ridership services and coverage services. You can move the wall
separating the two slices, but this doesn’t create more pie.

2.1.a

Note the legend. Red lines here mean service every 15 minutes or better all day,
which is the minimum that counts as high-frequency service. The old Houston
network had lots of routes, but the frequent network (red) was entirely radial to the
historic downtown. This was the perfect network for 50 years ago, when Houston
had only one downtown. Now, of course, it has many, so this network wasn’t very
useful. Look at how often blue or green lines (30-60 minute frequency) cross in the
network. Those look like intersection, but in fact they are more like one highway
flying over another without an interchange. You will wait so long to change buses at
these points that the connections aren’t really useful. That’s why ridership really
takes off when you create a network where red lines cross, so that you can make
connections in any direction without waiting long.

39
Packet Pg. 41

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

The new network vastly expanded freedom by creating a grid of high frequency
service connecting 1m people to 1m jobs. (That, in fact, was the winning soundbite.)

40
Packet Pg. 42

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Lousy weekend service is one of the main reasons US transit tends to fail its audience.
Most lower-wage jobs are not weekday only! They are in retail and services where
the demand often peaks on weekends, so it’s rare for a lower-income person to travel
on weekdays.

41
Packet Pg. 43

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

That’s why the plan set weekend service to be identical to weekday, except for the
peak The same network is there all week so that people can have transit-oriented
lives all the time. That’s crucial to creating the opportunity for low-car lifestyles.

At the end of the horrible public hearings, the only two board members who wanted
to discard the plan were the two that had not been on the board when they made
the 80/20

43
Packet Pg. 45

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Here is a diagram that organizes a number of key choices around the core question of
whether we are trying to expand freedom for as many people as possible.

44
Packet Pg. 46

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

If the goal were maximum ridership, you’d offer maximum freedom to the most
people, because this maximizes the number of trips for which the service is useful.
Each of the seven two-way arrows describes a particular debate that we tend to have
in isolation, but they are all connected. In each case, you get the most freedom for
the most people if you make the inward choice. That doesn’t mean you should, only
that this is a consequence. The inward choice generates a positive feedback loop: all
of these choices support each other, in a way that the outward choices do not. Let’s
look at each choice in turn.

45
Packet Pg. 47

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

The ridership-coverage goal was explained earlier. Again, you must find your own
balance, but the mathematical fact is that achieving the greatest freedom overall, and
the greatest ridership overall, happens when you focus service on places where the
geography is favorable, rather the running a little bit of service everywhere.

46
Packet Pg. 48

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

If you don’t think people should have to transfer, you have to run a direct bus from
everywhere to everywhere else. This means lots of overlapping lines, which makes a
massively complex network. It also means low frequency, because you are dividing
your resources over so many route miles/km. So it’s a less useful network because of
all the waiting required.

47
Packet Pg. 49

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Again, the fewer route miles you run, the more frequently you can run them. A
freedom maximizing network is careful not to run parallel routes too close together,
so as to minimize the number of routes needed to serve an area. It also avoids
putting stops too close together, as this slows down the service, making it less
attractive and more expensive to operate. (Remember, transit cost is mostly labor, so
it varies by the hour, not the mile/km. So slower service is more expensive to
operate.)

48
Packet Pg. 50

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Service that runs only during rush hour is especially expensive to run for three
reasons:
1. You have to own, store, and maintain a vehicle that you don’t use very much.
2. You usually have to pay drivers extra to work short shifts, because these shifts are
so inconvenient for the driver.
3. You are usually carrying passengers in only one direction, and running empty in
the other direction. (Remember, driver shifts must end where they began, so you
must pay the driver to travel in the reverse direction for every trip they make.)

49
Packet Pg. 51

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Obviously, transit that can run reliably, and at a reasonable speed, is both cheaper to
operate and more useful to the customer.

50
Packet Pg. 52

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

Technologies can be used to enhance transit in many ways, but when technology
becomes a goal in itself, it can defeat the goal of freedom. To maximize freedom,
focus on efficient (and therefore abundant) service, and choose technologies that
make service more efficient.

51
Packet Pg. 53

Attachment: 559 RTD Board Presentation 16x9 (3884 : Transportation Transformation (T2) with Jarrett Walker)

2.1.a

High ridership is diverse ridership. Resist all demands to run separate services down
the same street at the same time, for “different markets.” Doing that means less
service – less freedom – for everyone. However, one market is less important than
the others if the goal is ridership: the wealthy. Improving a network always expands
the range of incomes that find it useful, but special services features designed to
attract an affluent rider are expensive and are valuable to too few people, because
affluent riders are a minority of the population. Most people respond to service that
is liberating and civilized, but not luxurious. If you want this as a slogan, try: “Transit
is Target, not Tiffany’s..” The key to Target’s success is its efficiency at meeting the
needs of lower-income and middle-income customers who are the vast majority of
the population. As a result, some wealthier people like to shop there too. That’s how
efficient transit succeeds.

The Auckland, Houston, Richmond, and Columbus networks are fully implemented and achieving ridership
growth. Jarrett’s pre-2010 work included successful projects in Sydney, Canberra, San Antonio, and many parts
of Southern California.
Small-City and Rural Service Design
In the 1990s-2000s Jarrett designed transit networks for more than 35 small cities and rural areas across the
western U.S. In the 1990s he worked on such plans in 50 of California’s 58 counties.
Transit for Campus and College-Town Environments
Jarrett has done extensive planning for the special environments of college and university towns. His work
directly for universities includes campus shuttle studies for Stanford University and Washington State University,
and for numerous small cities where large universities drive public transport demand, including Fort Collins,
Colorado; Davis, California; San Luis Obispo, California; Corvallis, Oregon; Bellingham, Washington;
Toowoomba, Australia and Canberra, Australia.

These projects have synthesized short-term political and financial challenges with the long-term challenges of
growth. All have included recommendations regarding new ways for transit agencies to work together with
municipalities to achieve common goals.

Transit Policy Development and Transit Conversations
Jarrett Walker is a recognized innovator in the area of public transit
policy. Much of this work is intended to increase the transparency of
public transit agencies, by helping stakeholders and citizens
understand the real choices involved in transit planning. This highlevel policy development work has been an important part of his
contribution on recent projects in Toronto, Vancouver, Houston,
Canberra, and Los Angeles, among other cities.
He has developed tools for helping elected officials and policymakers
provide clear, quantitative direction about their public transport goals,
including the inevitable trade-off between productivity and coverage.
Jarrett facilitates stakeholder workshops on these issues using a variety
of innovative tools, including a range of “planning games” that allow
participants to experience the challenges of designing a transit system,
using a simplified model of geography and costs. He has used these
tools to facilitate transit conversations in many cities where he has
recently led short- and long-range planning, and transit network redesigns.

As Mayor, I really valued the clear
thinking about transit decisionmaking that Jarrett brought to
Edmonton City Council. His way of
coaxing us out of our own received
wisdom and challenging us to think
more critically about the trade-offs
was very helpful in raising the level of
debate about our transit service.
Jarrett has made many of the choices
ahead a lot easier to comprehend.
Mayor Don Iveson,
City of Edmonton, Canada

Service Branding
Jarrett has done original work on the definition and branding of Frequent Transit Networks – the subset of a
transit agency’s services that run every 15 minutes or better all day.
Jarrett's work on service branding integrates diverse efforts – marketing, transit planning, land use planning, and
street infrastructure – around a common vision for a region’s permanent transit network that includes not just
rapid transit services (like BRT or light rail) but also productive, frequent local bus routes. He has developed
policies relating to this concept with many agencies, including those in Brisbane, Canberra, Vancouver, Portland,
Seattle, Minneapolis and San Francisco. He has also helped refine and implement Frequent Service brands for
networks in San Francisco, San Antonio and Vancouver (BC)

Bus-Rail Integration

Teaching and Training
Jarrett taught a range of humanities courses in the course of his PhD, and also taught the graduate-level course
in Public Transportation Systems at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2002.
He now provides a wide range of training services, mostly in the form of his Interactive Short Course in Transit
Network Design: This two-day course is an interactive workshop in which students design networks for a range of
situations, and discover for themselves the trade-offs that transit requires them to think about. Jarrett has
offered this course more than 20 times, including sessions in New York City, Washington DC, Toronto,
Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland and Canberra. The course and student responses
are described at jarrettwalker.com/courses/.

Public Speaking
Jarrett has done major keynotes or plenary speeches at countless conferences, including:
•

Congress for the New Urbanism

•

American Public Transportation Association

•

RailVolution

•

Shared Use Mobility Summit

•

UITP Australia/New Zealand

•

State/province public transit conferences in California, Oregon, Washington, Minnesota, and British
Columbia.

He is a frequent speaker for local economic development organizations and transit initiatives.
