Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2016 through
June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-00, at a cost of $122,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective July 1, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 3 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has an excellent record of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2016 through June 29, 2017) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$122,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action.
Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for May 10, 2016:
1. CCA Transportation Funding Proposals – As you may recall, the Colorado Contractors
Association, Associated General Contractors of Colorado, the Colorado Construction
Industry Coalition and Move Colorado submitted 10 ballot initiatives on March 25. Each
measure include language to exempt the money from TABOR; nine measures seek to
raise the Transportation Safety Sales Tax at the rate .0062% and one measure has a
$0.003 sales tax increase. The money would be deposited into the Highway Users Trust
Fund (HUTF) and would be directed for state and local road, bridge and transportation
projects that address safety and congestion. All measures include language to exempt the
money from TABOR.
The Metro Mayors Caucus held a special work session on May 2 to discuss the measures.
The MMC has not taken a formal position, but the mayors in attendance were unanimous
in their opposition to moving forward with any of the proposed ballot measures as
currently written, citing three primary concerns:
 Lack of funds dedicated to transit
 Concern the statewide tax increase could preclude cities from raising local sales
taxes for needed infrastructure
 The inequitable distribution of funds raised; metro region cities would account for
nearly 55% of overall revenue but receive only 11% back.
The CCA is conducting additional polling this week and is expected to make a final on
which, if any, of the 10 measures to move forward in the next week or so. Attached are
handouts from meeting.
2. CML and CCI Summer Conferences – The Colorado Municipal League (CML) will hold

its summer conference June 21-24. The Colorado Counties Inc. (CCI) conference is June
6-8.

Re:

Update

SB16-194 Regional Transportation Development Projects sponsored by Senator Scott and Reps.
Moreno and DelGrosso passed the Senate Transportation Committee. The bill creates the
“Regional Transportation Development Act,” which allows a city, county, town or local
government to apply to the state transportation commission for approval of a regional
transportation development project. The bill has been introduced in previous years and is an
issue that the City of Broomfield is behind. SB194 as written would not take any funds from the
District. It allows creation of new “authorities” to build highway or transit projects. These
authorities could be within the district but the funding is state sales tax increment finance, plus
what other public bodies would want to contribute.
BBMK is expecting the re-introduction of last year’s SB15-272 Authorize New Transportation
Revenue Anticipation Notes (TRANs) Bonds. The bill titled the “Fix Colorado Roads Act” is
sponsored by Senator Baumgardner and Minority Leader DelGrosso. The bill would replace the
228 funding mechanism with General Funds for transportation by directing $160M+ annual
transfer (equal to 5% of state sales tax revenue) to the State Highway Fund and $32M+ (equal to
1% of state sales tax revenue) to the Capital Construction Fund. The bill also authorizes $3.5
Million in bonding capacity for state transportation projects and directs the Transportation
Commission to allocate funds as necessary to meet the obligation of the annual payment. $150M
of the $160M in General Funds would be combined with $100M in CDOT funds to support the
$250M annual bond payment with the remaining funds available for Asset Management,
Operations and Maintenance. The bill will also allow the Transportation Commission to decide
when to put the referred question before the voters (2016, 2017, or 2018). Lastly the bill will
define 50+ highway and transit projects throughout the state of Colorado and aligns precisely
with the projects on CDOT’s most recently revised list of priority projects, referred to as the 228
list.
HB16-1186 MAP-21 Rail fixed Guideway Safety Fund Grant Match sponsored by Rep. Tyler
and Senator Baumgardner passed the Senate on Second Reading. Current law requires 3% of the
fixed utilities fund (FUF) to be sent to the general fund. HB16-1186 proposes diverting up to
$150,000 from the transfer in order to fulfill the 20% match required by MAP21. RTD is
monitoring this bill.
HB16-1304 Transportation Priorities Community Conversations sponsored by Rep. Tyler is
scheduled for a hearing in the Senate State Veterans and Military Affairs Committee on
Wednesday at 1:30pm. The bill requires CDOT to hold at least one community conversation in
each transportation planning region of the state no later than Oct 1, 2016 in order to allow

1.C.2.a

HB16-1273 Authorize Parking Fees at CDOT Parking Facilities sponsored by Rep. Arndt was
postponed indefinitely in the Senate State Affairs Committee. The bill would authorize CDOT
to charge fees for parking at a park-n-ride lot or any other CDOT parking facility for more than
24 hours or in a reserved parking space. BBMK is monitoring this legislation. The bill was
amended on Second Reading in the House to limit the bill to a park and ride lot in Fort
Collins and to adjust the fees CDOT could charge.
BBMK has been monitoring the transportation funding related ballot proposals for 2016. A total
of 10 ballot titles have been submitted. All measures except for Initiative #155 seek to raise at
least $640 million in the first full year through a Transportation Safety Sales tax at the rate of 6.2
cents on a $10 dollar purchase subject to the state’s sales and use tax. In all versions that include
a HUTF distribution to counties and cities, each local agency is permitted under current state law
to use the funds for roadway or transit projects.

and their preferred means of raising the revenue needed to fund those priorities. BBMK will

FEDERAL UPDATE FOR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT: MAY 10, 2016
Senate Makes Progress on FY 2017 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Legislation:


On April 21, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported out its fiscal year 2017
spending bill for the Department of Transportation and the Department of Housing and
Urban Development. Committee members agreed to abstain from offering controversial
amendments until the bill is considered on the Senate floor, so the measure was adopted
by a 30 to 0 vote.



This figure includes the $199 million authorized for FY 2017 for positive
train control grants to commuter and intercity passenger railroads.

o Capital Investment Grants (New Starts): The bill slightly exceeds the FAST Act
authorization level for New Starts, providing $2.338 billion (increase over FY
2016 enacted level of $2.117 billion and higher than FAST Act level of $2.302
billion).


The bill provides $150 million for the Eagle P3 FFGA, the same amount
provided in FY 2016, but less than the $167 million RTD requested.

o TIGER: The bill also increases funding for the extremely popular TIGER grant
program, providing $525 million (increase over FY 2016 enacted level of $500
million), but would decrease the maximum grant size from $100 million down to
$25 million.


Next Steps in the Senate: the Transportation/HUD bill, likely combined with the
Military Construction bill, will be the next appropriations legislation considered on the
Senate floor during the week of May 9.

Appropriations Action in the House Lags Behind the Senate:


The House has not yet introduced its Transportation/HUD spending bill for fiscal year
2017.



No House Budget Resolution: House leadership has been unable to reach agreement
with conservative House Republicans that are pushing for a top-line budget number
below the $1.07 trillion level agreed to by Senator McConnell, then-Speaker Boehner, and
President Obama in their two-year budget deal reached last year. In the absence of a
formal budget resolution, the House Appropriations Committee has advanced 3 of the 12
annual spending bills through committee, but no appropriations bills have come to the
House floor.

US DOT’s Innovative Finance Office Showcases Eagle P3 Project:


On May 11, US DOT will host a webinar on the finance plan and project development
approaches RTD and its partners have used to advance the Eagle P3 project, focusing on
RTD’s use of an availability payment P3 structure. Dave Genova will participate in the
webinar.

o Transit Formula Programs: The Committee’s bill honors the FAST Act
authorization levels for transit formula programs funded from the Highway Trust
Fund: $9.7 billion ($386 million over FY 2016 enacted level).

Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee and the Nominating Committee for the RTD
Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) that the RTD Board of
Directors reappoint one member of the Committee to an additional three-year term and appoint five new
members to the Committee to a three-year term.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation. Six current members’ terms expired on December 31, 2015.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide. Therefore, on February
16, 2016, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the RTD Board of Directors RTD Board of
Directors change the name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens
Advisory Committee and revise the structure accordingly.
On February 18, 2016, recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the
RTD and FasTracks Web sites, media releases, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions.
Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC along with
specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if available. A total of
45 applications were received by the March 31, 2016 deadline. Two current members were eligible for
reappointment and one expressed an interest in continuing to serve on the Committee.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and Committee
consistency to recommend reappointment of the current member who requested reappointment. The
Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application using criteria outlined in the adopted
Committee Structure, including:

Contract Amendment for the Westminster Park
and Ride Pedestrian Bridge Painting &
Rehabilitation

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a construction contract amendment with TMI Coatings,
Inc. in the amount of $390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster Park-N-Ride (PnR)
Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No. 16DP001) is for the restoration of the
adjoining access ramps to the pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT) Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be $839,283.74
BACKGROUND
The Westminster Center (US36 & Sheridan Bus Rapid Transit Station) Pedestrian Bridge over US36 was
constructed in 1995. It is a steel truss bridge structure with a concrete deck and enclosed pedestrian
walkway. Circular steel and concrete pedestrian access ramps on both ends of the bridge were
constructed at the same time. The bridge and ramps were originally painted federal green. In 2001, the
Westminster Center Park n Ride parking garage structure was constructed on the Boulder-bound side of
US36. A steel and concrete deck ramp extension was placed between the garage and the north access
ramp. Some maintenance has been performed on the bridge and ramps. A 2014 inspection revealed
areas of rust and concrete damage that require rehabilitation. The federal green paint has, over time,
flaked and salts including magnesium chloride have eaten away various areas of the coating; the
exposed steel is rusting. See Figures 1 and 2 (below) for project location.
DISCUSSION
A Request For Proposals (RFP) and construction plans and specifications were issued in February 2016
in order to solicit quality proposals from reputable contractors who were qualified and properly certified
in the rehabilitation of pedestrian bridges and ramps. Because of funding concerns, the pedestrian
bridge was designated as a base bid and the ramps were designated as an “add alternate.”
The responding contractors provided experience and qualification evidence for: (a) Site investigations
and materials testing; (b) Restoration and construction options; (c) Preparing structural steel member
surfaces (i.e., clean and remove rust); (d) Paint complex steel structural members above a highway; (e)
Prepare and repair reinforced concrete deck; (f) Prepare and repair reinforced concrete structural
supports; (g) Remove and replace broken downspouts and gutters; (h) Apply concrete deck coating; (i)
Recent experience on similar projects with government agencies (j) Provide safe and efficient highway
traffic control, vehicular and pedestrian detours; (k) Ensure public safety, structural integrity and
continued reliability of existing infrastructure; (l) Schedule and manage regular construction meetings;
(m) Administer contracts, construction management, invoices, inspection reports and other construction
related services; (n) Assist RTD staff with site inspections; (o) Coordinate proposed work with local,
state and federal agencies including obtaining work permits.

Packet Pg. 17

2.B.2

The evaluation criteria included technical merits, experience, personnel and cost, weighted as follows:
 40%: knowledge, certification and technical experience, Quality Assurance/Quality Control,
structural concrete repair, highway and pedestrian traffic control, and safety.
 20%: experience and project understanding, recent similar work, coordination with government,
coordination with subcontractors and strength of organizational chart.
 40%: cost.
Proposals were accepted March 25, 2016 from three prime contractors:
(1) Gonzales Custom Painting, Inc.;
(2) TMI Coatings, Inc.;
(3) RMA Group, Inc.
A technical evaluation committee of five RTD staff members independently reviewed and rated each
proposal. A final evaluation and recommendation meeting occurred April 6, 2016. TMI Coatings, Inc.
was recommended as the most technically qualified, and had a mid-range cost that is within the project
budget.
Because of the best value determination, an award of $448,687.93 was made for the base bid. The
contract duration is 180 calendar days.
The base bid contract award will restore the bridge as follows: (1) prepare and paint steel members dark
grey, as accepted by RTD and the City of Westminster; (2) replace clear Lexan side panels; (3) remove
chain link fence; (4) patch and coat concrete decks with a skid resistant material.
This contract amendment will restore the adjoining ramps as follows; (1) repair the concrete support
columns under the Denver-bound side of US36; (2) replace the rain gutters and downspouts; (3) replace
the green vinyl clad chain link fence with grey galvanized chain link fence; (4) treat and coat the stay-inplace metal formwork of the ramp decks located over walkways; (5) patch and coat the concrete decks
with a skid resistant material.
The add alternate for this contract amendment was included in the contractor’s base bid, and will not
increase the contract duration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This contract amendment will utilize currently budgeted US36 BRT Local Expense funds.

A 6% SBE goal was established by RTD. The contractor exceeded this goal for the overall project base
bid and add alternate. The base bid and add alternate amount of $839,283.74, which includes
$57,533.00 SBE work for traffic control, glazing and fencing, provides a 6.86% SBE participation.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a construction contract amendment with TMI
Coatings, Inc. in the amount of $390,595.81. This Contract Amendment to the Westminster PnR
Pedestrian Bridge Painting & Rehabilitation Project (Contract No. 16DP001) is for the restoration
of the adjoining access ramps to the pedestrian bridge over US36 at the RTD US36 Sheridan BRT
Station. With this amendment, the total contract value would be $839,283.74.

Delay implementing the Recommended Action: Instead, reissue a new set of plans and
specifications and issue a separate Invitation for Bid for the access ramps. This is not
recommended because:
a. It delays the access ramp restoration that is needed for repair and aesthetic appearance.
b. The current accepted contractor, TMI Coatings, Inc., will perform a complete “turn-key”
project, which is determined to be the most qualified with a fair and reasonable price.
c. The Engineering Division and the Procurement Office do not believe that a separate bidding
process will give better results. A better quality of the work is anticipated with this approach.
d. The funds are currently available.
Do not award: This is not recommended because the deteriorated condition of the pedestrian
ramps, downspouts, gutters and concrete are approaching a safety concern.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors approves
and adopts the Pass Program Working Group objective, commitments and guiding principles.
BACKGROUND
In September of 2015, the Board of Directors approved a fare level increase to the Business and
Neighborhood Eco Pass programs and directed to staff to establish a Pass Program Working Group. The
Board Action approved in September of 2015 specifically stated: “This working group will include RTD
staff as well as stakeholders from across the District. The working group will define goals for pass
programs as well as reevaluate the 2009 Board policy for utilization based pricing to incorporate the new
fare structure and average fare analysis once smart card tap data is available.”
Staff prepared a draft of an objective, commitments and guiding principles to set the course of the Pass
Program Working Group. At the February 2016 Planning and Development Board Committee meeting,
staff presented and received input from the Board on that draft. Input received from individual Board
Directors confirmed that the draft objective, commitments and guiding principles did reflect their
priorities and concerns regarding Pass Programs.
DISCUSSION
It is important that Staff receive Board approval of the objective, commitments and guiding principles of
the Pass Program Working Group prior to the establishment of the group. These directional elements will
lead the efforts of Staff and the working group. The recommended objective, commitments and guiding
principles are detailed below.
Objective: Improve RTD pass programs to better serve customers of the district.
To achieve this objective, the Pass Program Working Group will fulfill the following commitments:
1. Revisit and refine goals for each individual pass program.
2. Refine pricing and administration of each pass program.
3. Recommend pass program policy revisions to the Board of Directors.
Below is a list of the Guiding Principles for the Pass Program Study:
1. Cost Effective Administration
2. Equitable Access
3. Improve Customer Convenience
4. Increase Ridership
5. Meet Strategic Budget Plan Revenue Targets
6. Promote Greater Brand Loyalty
7. Provide RTD revenue certainty
8. Simplify Passenger-Operator Interaction
