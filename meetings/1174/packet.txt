GM 2014 Tactical Plans from Strategic Planning Session
General Manager (GM) Washington stated that he was going to review the tactical plans
that staff has put together to address the strategic goals established at the Advance on
March 2nd. Prior to reviewing the plans, he went through a presentation to lay the
groundwork for the Board to understand the plans. There is a Board Policy that was
adopted and approved in 2009 that outlines the goal setting process for the GM. This
was put together along with the GM Oversight & Performance Management Committee.
The GM Goal Setting process includes convening the Advance/Retreat which was held on
March 2nd and establishing 5 Strategic Goals. These goals drive the 2014 Budget process.
Board Policy states that the GM should come back a month after the Advance and present
the tactical plan to achieve the strategic goals. The strategic plan shows what the big
picture is and the tactical plan shows how we will get there.
During the advance, staff reviewed a timeline for the budget process with the Board. The
advance was the beginning of the budget process leading up to the approval of the budget
in November. If and when they have a consensus from the Board on the tactical plans,
then those plans become the GM’s task goals for the next year. These goals then trickle
down to GM Washington’s direct reports and staff.
The GM Oversight & Performance Management committee meets with the GM to review
the tactical plans and formalize the document used for his evaluation. The entire process
is to be completed by July of each year.
GM Washington reviewed the 2013 strategic priorities from the presentation that is
available for review in the April 23, 2013 Study Session packet.
GM Washington provided an example of how staff goes from a strategic goal to a tactical
goal and then incorporates the goal into the budget process. If they cannot address a
particular issue or additional funding is needed, there is a mid-year process to amend the
budget. As they put together the tactical plan they identify the budget needs to achieve
those goals. GM Washington explained that is why staff gets bent out of shape when
people suggest taking on a new project; each project has a budget impact.
GM Washington covered the proposed tactical plan for the 5 goals identified on March 2nd.
Director Lubow asked when the Board’s input would be allowed in the process. GM
Washington responded that the memo that was provided in the Board packet requested
feedback no later than May 17th. He said staff can also be available for meeting with
Directors.

Strategic Goal # 1: Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery
GM Washington stated that they provided all the background about Service Delivery to
make sure that the Board understands how they do service changes. It is done three (3)
times a year in January, May and August. They typically follow the guiding principles
listed in the package. They look at ridership and potential changes to the overall transit
system. When they bring the changes they are looking at impact to the whole system not
just one route; they look at Title VI impact as well as reasonable alternative transit
services. The process to implement the service changes begins with staff bringing an
initial set of recommendations. At that time they ask for the Board’s approval to take the
proposed changes out for public comment. They will typically bring the initial
recommendations with plenty of time for Board members to review the plan with
constituents. Once they have the feedback from the public they come back to the Board
for final approval. The entire service change process usually takes 3-4 months. Director
Menten asked when the Board would be seeing the initial proposal for August. Bruce
stated that they would bring the initial set of recommendations to the Board in May.
Director Folska asked for some examples of when we have taken things for public
comment and have made changes to the original recommendations. GM Washington
stated that there are numerous examples. Bruce Abel stated that he cannot think of a
service change that has not had modifications made due to public comment. When they
brought the original service change for the January 2012 service optimization, due to the
impact on the School for the Blind and per their request, one of the routes that was
originally schedule to be discontinued was reinstated; the school suggested keeping one
route and canceling a different route which is what RTD did. Director Folska asked if we
made this requested change why they are now complaining. GM Washington stated that
they can review the January 2012 service change process with Director Folska but they
would like to focus on the tactical plans. Director Folska asked what we can do to
improve the public comment. GM Washington stated that the staff is always open to
receive feedback from the Board Members if they see a way to improve the process. In
terms of communications, right sizing the services is just something that is hard to do and
there will be bad news. She stated that she was under the impression that the Colorado
School for the Blind was without services except for Call-n-Ride. Chair Anderson
requested that Director Folska to take the discussion of service changes offline so the
Board and staff could continue to focus on the process at this meeting. Chair Anderson
suggested having a Study Session on just service planning to better understand the
process. Director Folska stated that her job is to bring those questions up so the public
can have the information. Chair Anderson asked for the issue to be discussed offline.

Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 23, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

GM Washington stated that the full package is available at the Board Office and was also
sent to Board members in their Board packet.

Director Lubow noticed that the guiding principles stress eliminating bad routes but there
is nothing talking about creating innovative routes. She would like to see that as an
additional priority, especially when dealing with people considered “transit deprived”. GM
Washington stated that they can look into that and they can add that to the guiding
principles; however, most of the recommendations include some type of adjustment to
them looking at alternatives that will impact/improve ridership. Director Lubow stated that
another issue is that people complain that they have not been part of the process even
though we have the public hearings. She asked if it is possible to have a citizen’s advisory
board not just for FasTracks but for bus service as well. GM Washington stated there is
one for the base system. Director Lubow believes it would be good to brainstorm about
how people can feel like they are part of the process.
Director Menten would appreciate a session about service changes. GM Washington
stated that they will do that; they typically review the entire service delivery process once
a year.
GM Washington asked the Board members to look at the package and provide their
feedback. He highlighted that they need to have a discussion about the Light Rail Service
which usually runs until 2:00AM and restarts at 4:00AM. Many systems in the East stop
at midnight so RTD needs to look at this issue. The maintenance requirement is becoming
harder and harder as the system expands and staff only has a two (2) hour window to
complete the necessary work. They need to discuss how they will approach this as the
systems expand and the maintenance requirements increase.
He also mentioned that under the area of Service Delivery Initiatives they are in the
process of implementing technology that will extend into 2014 having to do with
automated booking of Access-a-Ride, automated vehicle arrival notices, etc. They will
also be looking at the number of providers for Access-a-Ride that will have a budget
impact.
Director Deadwyler stated that she thought we already had all the automated processes in
place. GM Washington stated that some are in place and we have some in the
implementation process. Director Deadwyler stated that she hears a lot of complaints
about the signs in the light rail not working properly. GM Washington stated that they will
look at it. He rides the light rail and the destination signs are always working but
sometimes they might not be in sync.
Strategic Goals #2: Grow riders and engage customers across the Region
GM Washington stated that in the packet they listed most of the things that we do to
communicate with the general public. Going forward they want to upgrade and expand
these tools. They want to do targeted outreach to schools, agencies, and neighborhoods

Director Folska asked if it would be the cost of producing the card or the cost of riding.
GM Washington stated that it would be the cost of the rides but they have not worked
that in the final arrangement yet. They would have to find out what the average usage
would be and try to have DPS pay for the ride. They will come back to the Board once
they have the details worked out.
Director Folska stated that we need to list a goal of what ridership increase we are hoping
to attain. GM Washington stated that this would go in the performance measures. He
stated that they can revisit the performance measures.
Director Walker would like to see something where we work with local governments to
improve ridership through infrastructure improvements. He would also like to see our
planners having input on construction projects that might impact our service. GM
Washington stated that they do a little bit of that, but they will work to see if they can
structure it so they can identify those opportunities.
Director Lubow stated that she is concerned about targeting the under-served markets.
She is from an area that feels under-served and would like to see a goal to engage with
interested stakeholders to serve those markets by experimenting with successful
strategies used elsewhere such as in Boulder. She has received suggestions of creating a
pilot community program for those areas. GM Washington stated that they can revisit
that as Director Deadwyler had brought that up before. He cautioned the Board about
starting a pilot service in an area to see if it works. Even if the entity agrees to pay for the
service for a year, if the ridership does not materialize, you will find that the three or four
riders that use that bus will come to say that we cannot take the service away if it doesn’t
meet the minimum goals. When we look at the boarding criteria, etc., there is a reason
why it is under-served because the ridership is not there. Director Lubow asked if there is
a possibility to create an MOU with the different parties involved in the process. GM
Washington stated that they can revisit it, but cautions the Board members that it is not
easy to eliminate those routes if they don’t work out.
Director Menten asked who is our local government liaison listed in page 13 of the packet.
GM Washington stated that Roger Sherman from CRL is the local government liaison. This
was not in place before 2011. Director Menten asked when the next meeting of the local

Packet Pg. 8

and focus on young people. They want to simplify the fare media; there are several fare
media and it is confusing for people. They want to move forward with a program called
“My Denver Card” for young people which was introduced by Mayor Hancock. The card
would include RTD rides and access to recreation centers and libraries. They are trying to
qualify the cost and Denver Public School (DPS) would pick up that cost. Staff thinks this
program could be expanded to other communities.

6.A

government service planning is. Bill Van Meter stated it has not been scheduled yet, but
they will let the Board members know.
Director Solano stated that the pilot programs are nothing new as they have a pilot
program in Commerce City. He asked what the update on that pilot is. GM Washington
stated that will look for the information and let him know.

Chair Anderson stated that any of city’s transportation department would love to have the
Directors stop by and talk transit with them; they might even provide information about
bus routes. It is possible that you can work within your cities.
Director Hoy has had meetings with various city planners and the cities need to do a better
effort in communicating to RTD what they are doing. They build curbs, cutouts, etc. and
then they want RTD to service it. We need to strengthen the process between the cities
and RTD to get them to talk to us before they start building. He mentioned that it looks
like the planners are sending their plans but there is some confusion on our end as to who
receives them and reviews them. GM Washington stated that it has gotten better; RTD
planners are now talking to the city planners to determine what the plans are.
Director James mentioned a conversation with Scott Reed about reaching out to the
Elected Officials and senior leadership of the different jurisdictions in the metro area to
make sure we keep the communications lines open to facilitate those plans.
Strategic Goal #3: Innovative, Priority-Based FasTracks/SBP Funding
GM Washington stated that it is a Board policy to keep reserves to specifically address
various issues. Staff will continue to satisfy those resources to fund the working capital
pieces. They are pursuing sales tax parity and audit capabilities. They are also monitoring
the news about internet sales tax. The audit and parity pieces will start in 2014. If the
internet sales tax is approved, the Colorado Municipal League and the State are ready to
go with various bills to lay it out. They have estimated the impact to RTD on the low side
will be$10 million and on the high side $25-$30 million. They will keep the Board
members informed. They continue to look at other alternatives for funding for FasTracks
and base system as well.
Strategic Goal #4: Enhance constituent collaboration and communication
Again they have listed most of the things that they are doing. For the kickoff of the
Northwest Area Mobility Study, they are considering having a telephone town hall to
layout the scope of the study.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 23, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly stated that the under-served markets are listed under the 2014 Tactical
Goals; there is a paragraph devoted to it.

6.A

Director Lubow stated that she would like to have more effective early involvement for
major service changes. She would like more information about the citizen advisory
groups. She is also concerned about developing funding strategies for FasTracks as MAP21 is more concerned about current ridership. She asked if we could convene a funding
symposium to find alternative funding.
Director Menten asked what method is used for the annual FasTracks survey. Scott Reed
stated that it is a statistically valid that is telephone based and done throughout the
District. It will be brought to the Board this summer but don’t have the date yet. GM
Washington stated that they will inform the Board.
Director Folska asked if they call everybody in the District, a sample of people that live in
the District, or just users of RTD. Scott stated that it is a sample of residents, not just
users.
Director Sisk stated that he would like to understand why RTD did an RFP for an outside
consultant for our local government liaison. He believes this role should be handled
internally. He feels having someone in-house that understands RTD and would be
accountable for how RTD reacts would be good. Director Sisk believes that an
independent consultant doesn’t work for RTD and have the same accountability.
Director Walker stated that there is also a degree of responsibility on the local
governments to understand how RTD works. It doesn’t make sense for RTD to always be
out there trying to babysit them; the cities need to take responsibility if they want better
services from RTD and meet us in the middle.
Director Tobiassen stated that the plan looks good; there has been great progress made in
the social media and other outreach systems. He was looking at the Facebook page and it
is impressive. He commended Scott for picking up on the social media feedback.
GM Washington commented that with regard to the local government piece, they make a
very thorough analysis as to whether they should bring that in house or go with outside
consulting. Staff made a determination based on that analysis looking at length of the
assignment and economic impact. On the social media we are dealing with a new

Packet Pg. 10

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Apr 23, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

With regard to the tactical goals going forward, they will do the annual RTD FasTracks
Survey. They do this through a third party consulting firm and they will come back to the
Board with the results of the survey. They will continue all the formal meetings with local
government and town halls. They look forward to the Board members input before May
17th.

6.A

Strategic Goal #5: Continue Advancement of FasTracks
They listed the current projects being developed and talked about continuing the strategic
relationships, the programming of the project and developing funding strategies. The
tactical plan for this goal is to continue what we have been doing pursuing new revenue.
We need new revenue because we have a debt limit issue under TABOR. We are trying to
create more room under TABOR with the refinancing of bonds so if we need to borrow
more we can. A key issue is creating more revenue opportunities such as parity and
encouraging the internet sales bill to allow the opportunity for additional funding. It is
important for RTD to be flexible. For example, if we are moving forward with the North
Metro we will move forward with or without federal funding, but we need to stay flexible
so that if we see an opportunity for federal funding we can jump on it. They will not bring
something that the Board will need to act on overnight, but as an agency we have been
successful by being flexible.
He stated that he presented the five (5) strategic goals and the proposed tactical way
forward to attain those goals. He provided the outline of how they fit into the budget
process. He explained the calendar for the budget and how it matches the GM and staff
goals for next year. They look forward to the Board’s input between now and May 17th.
Once they have looked at that input they will come back to the Board to hopefully get a
consensus to move forward with the tactical plan for 2014.
Director James stated that the City/County of Denver de-Bruced themselves and it resulted
on an 18% of the property tax portion of their revenue. He asked what the potential is for
this at this time. Marla Lien stated currently we don’t need a de-Brucing. The 1999 ballot
issue allows RTD to retain all revenues until the T-Rex debt is repaid which is about 2024.
The FasTracks ballot issue allows RTD to collect, retain and spend all the .4% revenue
until the FasTracks system is fully built and all the debt is repaid. After that the tax is
reduced to the rate required to operate the system. By 2020 on the .6% we will need a
de-Brucing if we want to retain revenue.
Director James asked how TABOR is constraining us. Marla Lien stated that TABOR
includes several components; it affects our debt limit. The debt capacity is constrain by
TABOR and our financial capacity in the market. We are almost at capacity in the base
system. GM Washington stated that it is also about what we can borrow.

demographic that might be different from what we are expecting. This new demographic
is not picking up a newspaper. We have been trying to reach that new demographic and
identify if they really care about the things we think they do. They are trying to see what
information they really want and what the impact will be in the 2014 budget.

6.A

Other Matters
Director Deadwyler asked General Manager Washington and the staff to provide some
update about Rocky Mountain Reinforcement (RMR). GM Washington stated that Rocky
Mountain Reinforcement (RMR) did some iron work on some RTD projects. There is a
dispute between some former employees of RMR and the company. It has to do with
Davis-Bacon Wages, which determines prevailing wages for a federal contract. The
Department of Labor is investigating the case. At this point is not a good idea for RTD
Board members to take a position or get involved. Former employees want RTD to get
involved, but the issue is between them and RMR. His advice is to let the Department of
Labor clear the issue with the firm.
Director Solano stated that he understands that Rocky Mountain Reinforcement is a subcontractor for Kiewit. GM Washington stated that they are sub-contractors for several
prime contractors. Director Solano stated that he also understands that these employees
are\ alleging that they were doing a higher capacity job and receiving labor wages. He has
also been informed that some of those employees were illegal aliens and that should be
screened out by the contractors. It is not RTD’s job, but the contractors should do it.
Many of these employees were hurt and fired and were not given the due rights as far as
workers compensations. Again he doesn’t know if this is true, but those contractors are
working for RTD.
Chair Anderson reminded the Board members to provide input to staff about the tactical
plans by May 17th so we can be ready for the budget in November.

B. Update

• Citizens Advisory Committee Update
David Lewis, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, stated that the CAC has
completed the two-on-one meetings with 14 of the Board members. These meetings have
been important for the Board members to convey their interests; the feedback received
was very valuable. CAC members are making themselves available to go to individual
community meetings for each Board member if requested.
There is a work session tomorrow (May 15, 2013) and staff will be briefing the CAC
about the West Line opening. Presentations will also include lessons learned from the
West Rail Line; the CAC will work with staff to help transfer those lessons learned onto
other projects.
On June 26, 2013 the CAC Quarterly Meeting will be held at the Westminster City Hall –
Council Chambers.

Director Bagley thanked David for his time; he also stated that he thought the two-on-one
meetings were productive. He believes the efforts of the CAC are very important and
asked them to keep up the good work.
Committee Chair Hoy asked if there is going to be a field trip to the Westminster Mall
demolition site. David stated that it will take place after the quarterly meeting at 2:00

C. Recommended Actions

• Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator Fare-Free Service Plan
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations
beginning in 2014.
Motion:

Director James made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
May 28th, 2013 Board meeting.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, introduced Lacy Bell,
Project Manager for the Downtown Denver Circulator and Bryan Welch,
Planning Technical Service Manager. Lacy stated that the circulator has
always been included in the FasTracks plan as there is a need to
complement and enhance the existing 16th Street MallRide. It will
accommodate the increased amount of passengers due to the completion
of the West Rail lines and other projects. Lacy explained that the service
was originally planned as a continuous service but a reevaluation showed
that the circulator service is only needed during peak hours. They expect
that 80% of the circulator’s ridership will be transfers from other RTD
services. Since RTD has a free transfer policy, the majority of riders
would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a fare free service.
Staff anticipates that based on peak period service, the circulator will
operate from 6:00 – 9:00 a.m. in the morning and 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. in the
afternoon. The cost for operations and maintenance will be $830,000 per
year.
Director Lasater stated that he met with staff member earlier to discuss
this item; when he was on the E-470 Public Highway Board payment
was on a per-mile basis. As an outsider to RTD, he thought the MallRide
was originally paid for by the downtown merchants or a business
improvement district that contributed to it. He knew that it was free for
the riders but thought it was paid by someone other than RTD tax payers.
He would like the Board to consider creating both the circulator and
MallRide on a per use basis. There are still 20% of riders that do not
come from other areas and therefore would be paying to ride the
services. He explained that when the Public Highway Board raised tolls,
the number of users went down but revenue went up. He believes this
would be the same situation on the circulator. If we are subsidizing this
service for approximately three quarters of a million dollars or more,
coupled with the free mall shuttle, even 50 cents could make a
difference. Riders can choose to walk or pay for the privilege of the ride.
Director Lasater does not feel this is a good recommendation; he thinks

Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 14, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly seconded the motion.

6.B

we could provide better service in our bus system if these services were
not subsidized.

Director Menten applauded Director Lasater for bringing up the issue of
riders paying their share for what they are using. Director Menten noted
that the original ballot text does mention increasing bus service but does
not expressly say anything about the circulator. She wanted to know if
the transit expansion plan is one single document or several created over
the years. Marla Lien said she will send the document to Director
Menten.
Director James thanked Director Lasater for the comment about E-470.
He thinks that the mall shuttle and the circulator are different from E470. The frequency and efficiency of the service is what makes it very
difficult to charge a fare. The subsidy per passenger for the mall shuttle,
even with the free fare, is a fraction of the lowest subsidy capacity
experienced in other routes. The circulator is anticipated to have a
subsidy similar to the mall shuttle. It is more cost effective to not charge
a fare for the service. Bill Van Meter stated that some of the
considerations for this recommendation are that attempting to collect a
fare would slow down the service due to the number of stops and the
large volume of passengers. 80% plus of the riders on the circulator are
passengers that would have already paid or will be paying a fare to RTD
and our current fare policy accommodates free transfers so they would
have the service for free anyway. They have done an analysis based on
the projected ridership; because of the peak period only services keeping
the costs down, they anticipate the subsidy per passenger is in the same
range as the mall shuttle which is the most effective service in terms of
low subsidy per rider.
Committee Chair Hoy stated “I came into this process on this particular
issue thinking that we should probably charge a fare too, but the
practicality of this is just that it is impractical. Too many people are
getting on and off the bus, 80% of them would not pay a fare anyway; as
a result we would be collecting fares from part of 20% because we don’t
require people to go past the driver on those buses. The riders just hop
on and hop off and go a block or two. There is no way for any
supervision; as a result I decided that perhaps the free fare is certainly
something that we can at least start out with and maybe down the road
we can explore different opportunities.”

Director Daly asked for explanation of what the Bus Bulbs are. Lacy
stated that the bus bulbs purpose is to bring the passengers to the bus
instead of making the bus move to the sidewalk to get the passengers.
They are curved extensions that allow the bus to stay in the travel lane
for the bus stop and the bus doesn’t have to wait to get back into traffic.

• FasTracks Public Information Update
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager, stated that they will be giving a presentation
about the FasTracks Public Information (PI) Team.
Pauletta Tonilas, PI Manager, stated that they have two new PI specialists. She
introduced Deborah Mendez-Wilson and Tara Miller. They will be focusing on the four
strategic priorities described in the presentation was included in the May 14, 2013
FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Pauletta shared that the PBS TV Channel 12 Special called “FasTracks Moving Forward”
will air on May 14 at 9:30 p.m., May 16 at 12:30 a.m., June 21 at 11:59 p.m., and June 23
at 9:30 p.m. This is a half an hour program which includes both of the videos RTD
developed on how FasTracks came to life, the challenges faced and the impact on the
region.
PI will be conducting a Public Opinion Survey from May 29 to June 7. The findings will
be presented to the Board in late June or early July. FasTracks PI staff will also work
with HNTB on the Northwest Area Mobility Study which will kick off in June with a
telephone town hall. The first update for the Board should be in July.
With regard to Social Media, RTD-FasTracks.com registered a large increase in visits.
This includes visits from 140 countries with the top (excluding the US) being Canada
(928), Mexico (649), UK (557), India (296) and Colombia (294). Visits from the top
states (excluding Colorado) include California (5,885), New York (3,839), Texas (3,234),
Washington State (2,036) and Illinois (1,774).
RTD Facebook’s page received 9,060 like in April and 3,500 through May. Staff
believes this jump is due to the promotion inviting people to “Like” RTD’s page in
exchange for two free ride coupons. They have also seen an increase on Flickr.
Going forward for 2013, staff will continue to provide the Board of Directors’ Guest
Columns and provide the quarterly FasTracks Progress Fact Sheet; on May 15 they will
host the Media Working Group; the Public Opinion Survey will be conducted between
May and June; they will have Board Communications Trainings in June or July; on June
6 they will conduct the Regional PIO Briefing; the Northwest Area Mobility Study’s

telephone town hall will be in June; and In the fall the telephone town halls for all
districts will take place.
Director Hoy thanked them for the presentation.
Director Menten asked for the questions for the public opinion survey to be provided to
the Board before they go out to the public. Pauletta stated that they will send it to the
Board members.

Director Hoy asked who owns the PBS spot. Pauletta stated that RTD owns it. She
explained that we utilized some of their expertise and studio time. Pauletta said that her
team would make sure to distribute copies to the Board.
Director James noted that the PBS spot makes him think about some conversations he has
had with Scott Reed regarding the Colorado Public Radio (CPR). He thinks this is
perhaps an untapped resource and asked for other Board members feedback. Scott Reed
stated that they have approached CPR several times but we do not have funding for paid
advertising. Tony McCaulay has met with them several times but so far they have not
wanted to work within our funding capacity. They are scheduled to meet with CPR again
this summer.
Director Solano mentioned that he is part of the Advisory Council for the 760AM
Weekend Wisdom radio program. He has been working with them to promote RTD.
Pauletta stated that they can help with that.
Pauletta stated that Brenda Tierney, who was the public information manager on the West
Line, is now moving with Jim Starling to the North Metro Line. Director Hoy stated that
he is pleased with this as they are a great team.

E. Other Matters
General Manager Washington announced that as part of our Employee Development efforts, Lacy Bell
was nominated for a Middle Managers Course through the Eno Foundation. She was accepted to attend
the week long course in October.
Committee Chair Hoy stated that this is great. He likes when we recognize our employees and give them
the opportunity to advance.
Director James congratulated Lacy as he has worked with her in several instances and she has
always been very responsive.

C. Updates

• Real Property and TOD White Paper Overview
Bill Sirois, TOD Planning Coordinator stated that they put this together as an
outline of the process. Susan Altes, Real Property Manager, reviewed the
presentation that is included in the May 14, 2013 Planning and Development
Committee Meeting Agenda Packet. This presentation covers the Real
Property and TOD responsibilities as well as the regulations governing real
property. They also reviewed the policy and operational considerations for
RTD real property management such as financial, current and future needs,
transit oriented development opportunities and goals.
As part of the process of putting the paper together they reached out to
other agencies around the country as well as multiple municipalities within
the district. All agencies emphasized obtaining fair market value for each
property. The fair market value is based on appraisal. General Manager
Washington stated that when RTD announced the RAM, they had a lot of
people asking for the properties at a deep discount; staff will not bring a
recommendation like that to the Board.
The public versus private approach survey shows that the public entities
have many more regulations than the private sector. Staff has been
addressing those regulations in a planned modification to RTD’s real property
management.

Committee Chair James thanked staff for the attention they have given to
this issue. He is happy to see the staff working on this and answering a lot
of questions. As a public agency we have a number of constraints that
prevent us from doing many things. He also thanked them for the list of
properties. He thinks that what needs to improve is the interface with the
public. Many times the public does not understand what is required of RTD.
We need to find a way to better inform the public about the process.
Director Daly welcomed Susan Altes back.
Director Deadwyler asked if the list is complete or if there might be other
properties added at a later time. Susan stated that there could be other
properties added as corridors are completed. Director Deadwyler is
concerned about disposing of land that might be needed for future use and
then having to buy it back later at a higher cost. Bill Sirois stated staff looks
at all those possibilities before they make a decision about disposing of a
property. GM Washington also commented that when you hold on to
property thinking there might be a future use, there are maintenance
expenses that RTD has to incur. It cost us to hold on to land that we might
or might not use.
Committee Chair James stated that the return on investment can be
incidental to the main mission. We try to minimize the loss or maximize the
gain.
Director Sisk is wondering why we are using a resolution created in 1984;
he also noted that the resolution states that the “General Manager shall
formulate appropriate administrative procedures to be followed by the RTD
staff in connection with the disposition or development of Property Rights by
sale, lease, or other methods”. Director Sisk asked if these procedures
were available. Marla Lien stated that she is not aware of a uniform
administrative procedure. Typically when a property is ready for disposal
the staff will bring the proposal to the Board including each of the details for
the different disposal possibilities. There have been procedures for different
disposals, but not a single disposal procedure. Director Sisk commented
that some of the excess property sizes are very small. He asked how we
dispose of the properties when they are so small. Susan Altes stated that
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 14, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Bill Sirois and Susan Altes also presented the RTD Real Property White Paper
that describes the real property management and disposition process at RTD
and how it interfaces with RTD’s TOD functions. Included in the May 14,
2013 Planning and Development Agenda Packet were Resolution No. 10
Series of 1984 Regarding Joint Development and Disposition of Property
Rights and B-C Vacant and Under Utilized RTD owned properties that were
originally acquired with and without federal funding assistance.

6.C

on some of the properties the marketing approach is very limited; they will
only be of interest to the adjacent property owner(s) or RTD might have to
take care of the little piece or property for a long time. Each property will
have to be evaluated to identify the proper marketing for disposition.

Director Hoy stated that he has not appraised RTD land and will not in the
future. He also commented that he does not think anyone on the Board
would recommend selling below market value or selling properties that we
might need in the future. We are the leader in the industry because we do a
lot of things that other agencies do not. Director Hoy suggested
implementing a pilot program to see how we can deal with our excess real
properties in a creative and innovated way. GM Washington stated that
staff agrees with Director Hoy which is why they have planned a
modification for RTD’s real property management.
Director Bagley noted that looking at the report on Park-n-Ride utilization it
seems we have several underutilized Park-n-Ride locations. He would like to
have a better understanding of the sizes of the underutilized Park-n-Rides
and how the sites were acquired. He believes they need to be evaluated to
see if we should dispose of them. Susan commented that they have a Parkn-Ride task force that reviews these issues. They have done evaluation on
some Park-n-Rides but she will take the list to the group for evaluation.
Director Menten asked if any of the peer agencies we surveyed have an
elected board. Bill Sirois stated that the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) has
an elected Board; there are three transit agencies that have elected Boards.
Director Walker asked if some of the Park-n-Ride purchases are based on
long term ridership projections. Susan stated that a lot of them were
purchased in association with the rail lines. Director Walker also asked if the
agencies listed on page 5 of the Power Point presentation were the only
agencies they contacted. Susan stated that they contacted other agencies
but these were the only ones that provided their disposition procedures.
Others just stated that they do or do not dispose of excess properties.
Director Walker asked if the agencies explain why they do not include
marketing as part of their real property management. Susan sated that most
agencies use their websites or have auctions of their properties. Sirois
stated that because the actual acquisition process is so arduous many
agencies want to keep their properties unless they really need to dispose of
them.

Committee Chair James stated that the resolution from 1984 is an
interesting document; he suggested that the staff look at it to see if it needs
to be revised. GM Washington stated that the staff will review the
resolution and bring any recommendations to the Board.

Director Menten asked if the Board has a decision that needs to be made on
disposition of a property, would there be a way that the Board can find out
what the property may sell for in an Executive Session. Marla Lien stated
that property disposition been discussed in an Executive Session. Susan
commented that for the disposition there is a minimum bid amount
established based on the fair market value. Director Menten asked if the
decision will be made property by property or if it will be a group of
properties. Marla Lien explained that this is why we do not have a single
policy as each property has different and unique characteristics. We have
done many different things such as Executive Session, auction, etc. Bill
Sirois stated that they have used different tools, such as RFPs, and that
there are some tools that have not been used yet.
Committee Chair James stated that just as Director Hoy, he has not done an
RTD appraisal since he was elected. He thanked staff for the presentation.

D. Other Matters
GM Washington stated that he wanted to provide the Board with an update on the
model rail groups at Denver Union Station DUS). Marla Lien stated that from a
contractual perspective, RTD is out of the picture. RTD is not under contract with
the model rail groups or USA regarding placement in DUS. It was USA’s goal to
keep the Model Rail groups at DUS; however, 40% of the usable space was lost
due to the ducts required and a new stairwell. They have not been able to
accommodate the model rail groups and are not required to do so contractually.
Director James asked if we have any information about where the groups might go.
Marla Lien stated that she knows they had some offers but these are very small
groups; even if they were offered space at cost they are not willing or able to pay
that. Director James asked if we have a process to collaborate with USA to find a
way to help with this situation. GM Washington stated that they are working to
define the best message going forward.

C. Updates
Director Daly, Chair of the Government Relations Committee, introduced Sherry Ellebracht, Government
Relations Officer. She indicated that our local liaison, Roger Sherman, was present along with Jenifer
Brandeberry for our state update. Sherry Ellebracht said that she would be presenting an update from
Patton Boggs as Mike Dino was out of town.
Local Government Update – CRL Associates
Roger Sherman thanked the Directors for participating on the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) member meetings that were discussed by David Lewis during the FasTracks Committee Meeting.
He recognized the time commitment this takes from the Board members. Roger Sherman stated that these
meetings were very appreciated and positive. He reiterated that the next CAC quarterly meeting will be
on May 26th from 12:00 – 2:00 p.m.
Roger Sherman shared that his team is continuing to work with the region on long range funding options.
He joined Mayor Appelbaum from Boulder at the US 36 Commuting Solutions Meeting on May 14th to
present on Impact 64. Roger Sherman stated that Impact 64 continues to progress. He feels that if we had
suggested two years ago that the local elected officials across the State would consider a sales tax for
transportation we would have been laughed at. He thinks the progress continues to be very positive.
Roger Sherman said that Colorado Counties, Inc (CCI) and Colorado Municipal League’s (CML) annual
conferences are in June which they will be attending. This is a good opportunity for CRL to interact with
local elected officials. Roger Sherman also shared that Kim Kuccera from CRL is also attending
Accelerate Colorado. He noted that Directors Folska, Lubow and Tobiassen are attending as well and this
is a way for CRL and RTD to continue to connect with our elected officials.
Roger Sherman stated that CRL has been speaking with Liz Rao, Chris Quinn and Nadine Lee about the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). He explained that CRL wants to stay up-to-date on the
timeline and process as they are out in the community.
Roger Sherman stated that he is beginning the process of putting together a snapshot for this year’s
municipal elections. He said that there are a lot of announced candidates already. There is typically an
August deadline for candidates for formally file with their municipality. He explained that CRL will
work with Board members as to how we interface with the candidates, monitor the election, and then
work with the winners after the election.
Director Menten asked for additional information on the status of the sales tax increase. It was her
understanding that some of the mountain communities had some issues with this increase. She also said

Packet Pg. 27

6.D

6.D

that she was interested in attending the CCI and CML conferences and asked if that was possible. Roger
Sherman stated that the initiative was titled Impact 64. He explained that the group is meeting on a
monthly basis but this initiative is just being circulated and discussed. It is a long way off from going to
election. Roger Sherman said he would work with Director Menten on the conferences.
Committee Chair Daly asked Roger Sherman to explain further about Impact 64. Roger Sherman
explained that it is a group that was organized to bring all the counties in Colorado together to discuss
transportation funding.

Jenifer Brandeberry reiterated that there were 32 new members out of 100. In addition there was new
leadership in the House and Senate on the majority and minority sides. She said that she cannot
remember a session in which there were so many meetings up-to, and going past, midnight.
Jenifer Brandeberry shared that we were successful in getting two pieces of legislation passed. The bill
regarding RTD and third party parking was signed by Governor Hickenlooper at the West Line Opening;
the sales tax parity bill is on its way to be signed by the Governor.
Jenifer Brandeberry thanked the Board and staff for working with her team. She feels there is a strong
relationship between RTD and Brandeberry~McKenna.
Jenifer Brandeberry explained that while it is not legislation, they are also working with RTD and the
Department of Revenue to look at ways RTD can help support the Department of Revenue in collecting
sales tax more efficiently.
Director Hoy asked for an accounting of the votes of the representatives from his District. Jenifer
Brandeberry said that her team would provide the Board members with that information.
Director Bagley thanked Jenifer and Brandeberry~McKenna for all their efforts. He believes it has been
an outstanding year for RTD at the legislature. He thinks without Brandeberry~McKenna’s shepherding
we would not have been as successful. Director Bagley asked that he be kept updated on Senate Bill 13052 regarding Transit Oriented Development Claims.
General Manager Washington commented that as we look at what we did late last year through present it
was very textbook. Staff put together the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA) for Board approval in the fall; we then had our State lobbyists take the ball and run with
those approved items was very textbook. He shared that he has asked RTD’s District Historian to capture
what occurred because what we did in identifying how much money we could realize and then to have
that come to fruition is incredible. General Manager said that the RAM and FISA have trickled their way
to Washington with our federal delegation. He thinks it is very incredible when you have Congressmen
and Senators talking to him about the RAM. General Manager believes the RAM is something we should
all be proud of.
Committee Chair Daly noted that the Board had wanted to conduct a tour of Denver Union Station with
our legislators. He asked why that did not happen. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that since the
legislators were so overwhelmed during the session they did not want to take time away from the
building. She said that many did participate in the West Line Opening. Jenifer Brandeberry believes the
legislators really appreciated the attention that RTD gave them.
Federal Update
Sherry Ellebracht stated that Mike Dino from Patton Boggs was unable to attend the meeting so she
would cover the update.

State Government Update – Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that the 2013 legislative session concluded Wednesday May 8th. She said that
in 15 years of state lobbying this session had very substantial and prolific legislation.

6.D

Sherry Ellebracht shared that as many of the Board members are aware, the President nominated Anthony
Foxx as the new Transportation Secretary. The confirmation hearings will be held very soon but the date
has not been set.
Sherry Ellebracht said that the Internet Sales Tax legislation was passed on May 6th in the Senate. She
explained that the House has a parallel bill. She believes that while this legislation passed easily in the
Senate the House will be another issue as many of the members look at it as a sales tax increase.

Sherry Ellebracht informed the Board that the MAP-21 reauthorization expires a year from September
2013. The House Transportation Committee is starting to work on the next authorization. She said that
we hope to have the reauthorization be for at least 5 to 6 years.
Sherry Ellebracht shared that both the House and Senate are working on Fiscal Year 2014 appropriations.
She said that the debt ceiling will most likely become an issue by summer. Sherry Ellebracht explained
that the House would like to see tax reform rolled in with the ceiling issue.
Director Hoy commented that he believes RTD lost a friend with Ray LaHood resigning as the
Transportation Secretary. It is his understanding the Anthony Foxx may already be acquainted with RTD.
General Manager Washington said that we do know Anthony Foxx as the Mayor of Charlotte. He shared
that RTD has already gone through our channels to invite him to Denver. General Manager Washington
explained that Mr. Foxx is very pro-transit. Staff feels Mr. Foxx is a good choice; he is very familiar with
our projects and expansion. Sherry Ellebracht stated that Charlotte has many of the modes of transit that
we are interested in. She feels Mr. Foxx has a broad concept of multi-modal transportation which bodes
well for RTD.
Jenifer Brandeberry highlighted that Colorado passed the Marketplace Fairness Act. She explained that
this bill is a bill that proactively anticipates the Federal Government passing their Internet Sales Tax
legislation.

• Legislative Update--Local, State, and Federal
D. Other Matters
Director James wanted to make sure the other Board members are aware that Roger Sherman is running
for Denver City Council to replace Councilwoman Jeanne Robb.

Sherry Ellebracht stated that the Department of Transportation (DOT) announced $474 million in funding
for the TIGER V grant. She explained that this grant is different because there is a very shot application
and obligation period. To be approved your project has to be ready to be built. She believes this is
because the DOT is seeing funds that are allocated to projects but then the funds are not being used.

B. Recommended Actions

• Presentation of 2012 RTD Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and
Report to Governance
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited
financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2012 as prepared
by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor, RubinBrown,
LLP.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion
to move this to the full Board at
the May 28th, 2013 Board
meeting.
Director Lasater seconded the
motion

Discussion:

Terry Howerter stated that compiling the financial statements
took many man hours. He explained that the audit process
began back in September of 2012. Terry introduced Kathy
Maher from Rubin Brown, Susan Sandoval from the
Accounting Office at District Shops, Doug MacLeod, Manager
of Financial Review and Cheryl Wallace from Rubin Brown.
Cheryl Wallace reviewed the required communications with
the Board. Rubin Brown issued an unqualified opinion on the

Packet Pg. 32

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.E

financial statements for the District, as well as on the
compliance and controls for RTD’s federal funds. The
comprehensive annual financial report has different sections;
they did provide an opinion on the federal awards, budget
information and fund statements. They did not provide an
opinion on the management discussion analysis and pension
information which is done by the District or the introductory
and statistical information. The scope and timing of the audit
was planned through communications on August 30, 2012.
The District implemented two new required accounting
practices successfully; one was codification and the other one
had to do with deferred inflows and outflows.
When Rubin Brown looked at the estimates on the financials,
RTD basically has three estimates by classification.
Depreciation is considered an estimate because we have
capital assets and we are estimating the useful lives.
Allowance is also an estimate because of the receivables for
the revenue. There is also an estimate related to the net
pension obligation related to the pension plan. With regard to
sensitive disclosures, RTD has a few. That means that there
are some transactions that warrant attention.
She stated that there were no difficulties encountered during
the audit. The District was very well prepared and responded
in a timely manner to all of Rubin Brown’s requests. There
were no corrected or uncorrected misstatements which means
that the information the Board receives on an interim basis is
accurate and reliable. They did not have any disagreements
with management. They did ask management to sign a
representations letter. There were no outside consultations
and no other significant audit findings.
Kathy Maher reviewed their observations and suggestions for
the Board. They noted two key areas that RTD excelled
during the year. RTD did a great job looking at the account
receivables balances; staff analyzed what was collectable and
wrote off old and long-outstanding balance. The second piece
is that RTD was named one of the most significant
construction projects.
The audit of the financial statements was unqualified which is
a clean opinion. They have some comments and suggestions.
With regard to Davis-Bacon, RTD’s policy states that all
certified payroll should be reviewed but because there is so
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.E

many sub-contractors, some areas are only doing a sample
review as opposed to a full review. Therefore they
recommend RTD solidifies the policy on what they should be
reviewing and consider using the in-house certified statistician
to ensure that the proper sampling is being performed. With
regard to the construction in progress process, RTD records
construction in progress and in the accounting system there is
a project completion date which is the budget date. They
recommend improved communication between the project
managers and the finance department for when that project is
placed in service so that they can be properly categorized in
terms of asset class and the depreciation of those assets. On
the federal grants, they noticed that some grant requirements
were not clearly communicated to all departments. Again they
recommend improved communications and record maintenance
for federal grants.
With regard to Information Technology (IT) governance, they
brought in a specialist to review RTD’s processes. The first
category was documenting the information security policy and
nailing down the policy for all different areas of RTD. The
second was performing an IT risk assessment to help the
leadership understand the IT risks. With regard to IT access,
they suggested a review the super user’s access to
understand who has that access and reviewing periodically.
They recommend reducing the unrestricted physical access to
the server room. Finally, they also recommend expanding
management’s user access of the different modules that each
employee has access to.
Cheryl stated that RTD had a clean audit; it had unqualified
opinions and good practices. They only had some
observations to improve some of the positive control
environments that are already in place. Terry Howerter stated
that the staff has reviewed the recommendations and support
their implementation.
Director Menten asked for a spreadsheet of the account
receivables that were written off. Terry stated that they will
provide it. He reminded the Board to keep in mind that they
place an allowance on the account receivables which means
that they have concerns that they might not be collectible.
That is kept in the accounting records. Director Menten also
asked for the grand total. Cheryl stated that the balance sheet
is on page 40 of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report
Packet Pg. 34

6.E

6.E

Director Menten asked if they do an audit on the DBE/SBE
programs. GM Washington stated that staff provides that
update at the Civil Rights Committee meeting. They review it
by agency goals and existing contracts. The compliance office
evaluates each contract constantly to see if they are meeting
the goal. Director Menten stated that she has concerns with
regard to the companies being certified DBE/SBE when they
really are not. GM Washington clarified that RTD is not a
certifying agency for DBE. The Colorado Department of
Transportation or the City/County of Denver certifies DBEs.
They are the ones that verify that the companies are DBE/SBE.
RTD has very good connection with the certifying agencies but
we are not going out and checking firms because we are not
the certifying agency.
Director Hoy congratulated the staff on a clean audit. He
feels that with regard to the items for improvement, some of
them are not clear. With regard to the Davis-Bacon there
seems to be a disparity on what we say we do and what we
actually do. He wonders as we go forward if we are working
with Rubin-Brown on those issues or working on them on our
own. Terry stated that RTD will implement the suggestions
and next year the audit company will review what we have
done. Cheryl stated that they are here during interim to work
on this. They come several times during the year. They will
probably be here in September. GM Washington explained
that we have not had a repeat finding which means we are
fixing those issues.
Director Lasater stated that he finds it disconcerting that we
have the weaknesses indicated in the report with regard to IT.
Physical access to a server room should not be allowed as we
are a highly fiscally responsible entity. With regard to the
super users’ access, he likes the recommendation of having an
independent third party agency keep track of it. He is
surprised that we do not have a policy in place that addresses
this discrepancy. He would like this fixed as soon as possible.
Terry stated that the access to the server room has already
been modified. Trent Ratcliff is reviewing our IT policies and
making recommendations on changes.

and it includes the allowance. Terry stated that it was
$4,131,000 for the current year and the allowance for that is
$851,000.

Director Sisk asked if they can provide the advisory comments
from last year and what was done to address those issues.
Cheryl stated that they will provide it. Director Sisk also
asked about the management estimate of net pension
obligations. He asked what they did to estimate it and if they
mean that we are in compliance with our pension
requirements. Cheryl stated that it is a management estimate
and that they rely on actuarial information. RTD employs
actuaries to look at the pension fund. They do the statistical
analysis and based on the benefit RTD provides they identify
what the paying contribution should be and where the plan is.
Rubin Brown looks at that information and makes sure that it
is consistent and that it follows GAAP (Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles). Director Sisk summarized that Rubin
Brown bases their opinion on actuarials that are hired by RTD
but they do not go back and validate the actuarials with other
organizations. Cheryl stated that as auditors they are required
to look at the assumptions and if RTD had an assumption of
investment return of 20% that would get their attention
because RTD would not be earning 20%. They do a litmus
test of the assumptions projected.
Director Bagley asked which way we are trending for the debt
to net position ratio for 2013. Terry stated that in 2013 we
will increase the debt level due to some of the plans for
financing the buses which was just approved by the Board.
He looks on a regular basis at the net revenue calculation
which requires RTD to have net revenue 1.2 of debt which
indicates that we have adequate funds to pay all of our bills,
take care of our expenses, service our debt and have a
reminder after that. Director Bagley stated that he
understands that staff is satisfied with where we are today.
Director Walker stated that we will work with our contractors
to help them overcome any problems they had before the final
audit is issued. He assumes that is what Rubin Brown does.
Cheryl affirmed that is what they do.

C. Updates

• First Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, and Kevin
Parker, Auditor, stated that the Statements of the Audit completed in the
first quarter of 2013 and the current status report are included in the May
21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

Terry Howerter stated that the District’s investment report for the first
quarter is included in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Agenda Packet. He highlighted that they met the benchmark and
that the first quarter of 2013 was .7% annualized earnings on our
investments.
Director Lubow noticed that the 2013 yield seems lower than 2012. She
asked if there is a reason for that. Brenden Morgan stated that interest rates
have move down in the first quarter and we had a large construction
payment of over a $100 million this year. We were allowing those securities
to mature and reinvesting in money market funds that paid very little in this
current market environment.

• 2013 Financing Update
Terry Howerter stated that they included a summary in the May 21, 2013
Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. Brenden
Morgan stated that RTD has initiated the three debt refunding transactions
for interest expense savings. They have achieved the 3% value savings
required. The 2004-2005A Series Bond has a present value savings of
4.19%, the 2005A Certificates of Participation have a 6.935% and the
2006A FasTracks Bonds have a 5.5%. If we add the savings all together,
RTD will save $83.8 Million over the remaining life of the bonds. That
savings is net of the expenses associated with completing these
transactions.
Director Hoy asked if the $84 million is a savings over what we would have
spent if we had not done this refinancing. He also asked if the terms of the
bonds remained the same. Brenden stated that he is correct with regards to
the savings. He said that we did not change the terms of the bonds to
extend our obligation out further into the future. Director Hoy asked where
those savings will be allocated. GM Washington stated that typically any
savings would go into the general fund; however, he is not sure this is “real

Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• First Quarter 2013 Investment Report

money”. The savings come over the life of the bonds. On the base system
it would go in the general fund. On the FasTracks side we would try to do
more as listed in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). The RAM identify the
projects where the funds would go. Terry stated that when we did these
three refinancings it is a complicated process. They lined things up in
certain years so that our payment stream would improve our net revenue
calculation. Secondly we did not go further out from what we had originally
issued for the bonds. On the 2006 FasTracks Bonds of $53 million, the
interest savings will be recognized between now and 2036 when those
bonds are retired. The great thing is that this reduces our Tabor obligations
by $53 million giving RTD the benefit today to issue additional Tabor sales
tax debt. This is the best debt we can issue for RTD. The savings are
coming back into the program.
Director James asked if the present value saving is the interest that would
have been paid over the entire term of the debt. Terry stated that the
interest saving is the new debt compared to the original debt. Director
James asked if the 3% threshold used for the present value is comparable to
a home mortgage refinancing where you want the interest rate to be low
enough to make it worthwhile. Terry stated that that is correct.
Director Sisk asked what Brenden Morgan meant by the comment of the
financing agencies stating that declines or underperformance in sales tax
revenues or the issuance in the near term of a significant amount of debt
beyond current plans could result on a downgrade of RTD’s ratings.
Brenden stated that when the agencies prepare the report on any given
credit issuance, they list any factors that theoretically could cause our rating
to increase or decrease. On the decrease side of that they had the
underperformance of the sales tax revenue or significant amount of debt
beyond of what we currently have in our plans. We already briefed them on
the FasTracks revenue bonds that we will be potentially issuing later this
year to fund the North Metro Rail line, so they are already considering this;
however, if were to come back with another $500 million debt deal they
would have to take a close look at that and see if that would have a
negative impact. Director Sisk asked if we are suggesting that our sales tax
revenues are not within our budget. Terry said that we are suggesting that.
We budgeted a 4.2% increase over the prior year and we are currently at
1.9%. The other thing is that on our sales tax bond issues, they are very
secure. The rating agencies have not had too much of a concern over the
sales tax backed bond issues. Their concern is on our Certificates of
Participations (COPs). Their concerns is that if our sales tax revenue
decreases, we will continue to service our bonds but the Board might not
approve the annual appropriations for the COPs. That is where we have
some risk, if any at all, but they are aware of everything we have planned.

• 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan Update

Jannette Scarpino reviewed the presentation that is included in the May 21,
2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. The
SBP is RTD’s six year plan. It includes the years 2014-2019. It only
includes the base system and operating activities from the West Line which
is funded by the FasTracks 0.4% tax. FasTracks projects are covered
separately. At this point they are not recommending service reduction for
2014 to balance the SBP. There is a fare increase projected by the Board
for review in 2015.
On the SBP Summary Cash Flow – Base revenue comes in various forms; it
includes fare revenue, sales and use tax, grant revenue, other income and a
DUS land sale scheduled for 2014. The Adjustment Balance is $16.5 in
2015, $14.4 in 2016 and $2.2 in 2018 for a total of $33 million over the
SBP period. The operating expenses do not including depreciation because it
is a non-cash expense. Included in the summary is the Collective Bargaining
agreement with the Union and our diesel lock for 2013; it also includes the
one-time project expenses for operating or expense project. We also have
the expense projects carry forward. We reduced the FasTracks subsidy for
the rubber tire services. We show the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA) contribution because we changed the methodology for the current
SBP. We show a FISA contribution from the sale of the Civic Center air
rights in 2013. The interest income derives from investable balances and
the interest expenses derive from the amortization schedules that we run.
The change in net assets or income shows the capital expenditures which
are in our current SBP’s project requests. Our assumption for the change to
fund balance is that we continue to support the Board appropriated fund to
the tune of $3 million every year as well as the capital replacement fund to
the tune of $3 million every year. The beginning unrestricted net assets or
fund balance is the ending fund balance from last year that is rolled over at
the beginning of the year and then that amount is rolled forward to the
unrestricted fund balance. That bottom line is either positive or break even
on both years. The total adjustment to balance the SBP is $33 million over
the time period; staff is working on resolution of this shortfall by focusing on
the projects in the SBP and their impact to the cash flow. They will
eliminate or reduce the capital project requests and will bring those requests
back into the SBP if sales tax improve or we have an excess fund balance at
year end to draw on. This is challenging because it affects our state of good

Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Terry Howerter explained that they come to the Board with updates on the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) to keep the Board informed as to what we are
doing, how things are progressing with our amended budget and the SBP
itself and what the next steps are. They want the Board to be well informed
as to what staff is looking at and have a good understanding of the process.

6.E

They have included the West Line in the SBP analysis because it is an
operating entity. The revenue sources include a sales tax contribution from
FasTracks because it is needed to support the West Line operating expenses
and a reserve of 3 months of operating expenses in 2013 and a reserve of 2
months of operating expenses beginning on 2014. The bottom line is
positive and the contribution to the Board appropriated funds and capital
replacement funds as well as the unrestricted year end fund balance
represents 3 months of operating expenses in 2013 and 2 months of
operating expenses in 2014.
For the next presentation in June they will show both operations combined
for base systems and the West Line as well as show the West Line
separately per they cost allocation methodology. Jannette reviewed the
opportunities and challenges listed in the presentation.
Next steps include:
 June 18 – Present 2013 Recommended Amended Budget; SBP Update
to FAAC
 June 25 – Adopt 2013 Amended Budget
 July 9 – Presentation of SBP to FAAC for Board adoption
 July 16 – Adopt 2014-2019 SBP
 August 27 – 2014 Budget Study Session
Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation. He asked why the West
Line contribution from FasTracks was not prorated. Janette stated that the
contribution is only required to cover operating expenses and any
contribution to the fund balance. The operating expenses for $11.8 million
represents 8 months of operating expenses for 2013. Director Sisk stated
that he would expect that the tax contribution from FasTracks would be
incremental. Terry explained that what is in the operating expense is the
training cost through April 26. They had FasTracks employees for the West
Corridor being trained and charged directly to FasTracks plus the 8 months
of allocated expenses after that. The revenue contribution for the sales tax
is higher because they see it as three companies. Company one is the base
operation, company two is the FasTracks capital with all the projects on it
and company three is the operation for the West Corridor. They needed to
grow a fund balance on FasTracks as well as company three so when you
add companies two and three together we have an adequate fund balance
per Board policy. Director Sisk asked if when we open the other lines we
will do the same. Terry stated if that it is still a Board policy to have 2

repair as well as maintenance costs. They will bring a final list of projects
eliminated or deferred for Board review. Until then the review process
continues at the Senior Management level and their goal is to arrive at a

months in the fund balance we will do the same thing for I-225. Terry
stated that he is starting to view this as a base system operation funded by
FasTracks because Rail Operations runs the trains and they provide the
maintenance. All the cost are being taken through company three and
supported by FasTracks.

Director Rivera-Malpiede noted staff mentioned a fare increase for 2015.
Jannette stated that they will bring to the Board for consideration. Director
Rivera-Malpiede stated that she would oppose a fare increase. She thinks
that we need to do whatever we need to do to avoid increasing the fare.
She wants to be a part of the analysis. GM Washington stated that the
policy states that we are should consider a fare increase every three years; it
doesn’t mean we have to change it but the Board policy states we need to
consider it every three years. Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she is
concerned about the constituents that would be living further away from the
city because of the building of FasTracks. She wants to make sure that
they do not carry the burden of a fare increase.

• March 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
Terry Howerter stated that the March 2013 Financial Status Report can be
found in the May 21st, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Agenda Packet.
On the dashboard for the month over month comparison, ridership for the
month went down by 4.5% (391,000), Fare Revenue increased by 2.1%
($202,000) and the Sales & Use Tax increased by 1.5% ($550,000). On
the year-to-date comparison, ridership decreased by 3.5% (871,000), fare
revenue increased by 0.7% (192,000) and the Sales & Use Tax increased by
1.9% ($2,005,000). The ridership was affected by the extra day last year
due to leap year.
Doug MacLeod stated that they do not know anything in particular that is
driving ridership down. He mentioned that EcoPass, CollegePass and
annual passes make up about 60% of the fare revenue which is not
necessarily affected by ridership on the short term. They see a decrease on
the fare revenue on the short term for the cash paying customers. The fare
revenue is actually up because we have seen an increase on the passes.

Director Hoy wanted to clarify if we moved enough money to make the
bottom line work. Janette stated if you are asking if it is a “cash
contribution” to base in 2013, the answer is no; it is just an accounting
entry.

6.E

On the statement of position, in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA) in the base system column they show $5.563 million from the sale of
air rights for Civic Center which the base system owned. They were sold
for $8,063,000. They subtracted $2.5 million that went towards the
Northwest Area Mobility Study and the remainder went to the FISA.

Director Hoy asked for clarification with regards to the year-to-date fare
revenue increase while ridership decreased. Doug explained that a rider that
purchases a monthly pass pays the same amount whether he rides once or
15 times during the month. So no matter how the ridership fluctuates we
still get the same amount of revenue in the passes. The revenue went up
because we had increases in our CollegePasses.
Director Lubow asked what we do when the Sales & Use Tax revenue is less
than projected. Terry stated that we monitor it closely and budget to that
amount. In June they will have a new forecast and we look at changes for
the mid-term and long term. These changes are included in the amended
budget. We will manage the budget and SBP to those factors. Janette
mentioned that in September the forecast was different to what they had in
December.
Director Bagley stated that it would appear that the things not taken into
consideration were the sequestration and change in social security
deductions. It makes people feel less wealthy and those are two factors
that can contribute to the lower Sales & Use Tax collection. Doug stated
that those two factors definitely have an impact; however the CU Leeds
School of Business had included those issues even though they were not
sure on the impact they would have.
Director Walker asked what the biggest source is for Sales & Use Tax.
Doug stated that restaurants, automobile sales, warehouse stores, and fuel
delivery are the biggest. Terry stated that the bigger ones at this time of the
year are the home repair/lumber shops (Lowes, Home Depot, etc.). Director
Walker asked if Denver collects Sales & Use Tax on building materials.
Terry stated that they do.
Director Bagley asked about the internet sales tax. Terry stated that as far
as when it might be approved staff is getting a mixed read. It could be a
year to four years out depending on who you talk to. The nice thing is the
tax is that RTD and the State of Colorado are well position with software in
Packet Pg. 43

On the Sales & Use Tax trend report, the monthly percentage increase by
month shows January 2013 being up 2.8% vs 2012. February is up 1.6%
and March 1.5%. The commutative year-to-date is 1.9%. The trend so far
is below what CU Leeds forecasted.

place to start collecting that money. They expect that it would be around
$15-20 million a year. Bill 1272 for parity with the State will be signed next
week. Staff expects a small increase in our sales tax revenue when this
occurs. The audit at the state level is proceeding well and those numbers
are not included in this report.

B. Recommended Actions

• August 2013 Service Plan
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve moving the proposed August 2013 Service
Change as summarized below and described in Attachment A on to public
review and comment.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the
motion to move this to the full
Board at the May 28th, 2013
Board meeting.
Director Daly seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, explained that staff is
asking to move the proposed changes into public comment.
This is not approval of the service changes. As in the past,
the changes are focus on addressing issues related to on-time
performance and to address the issues they have seen arise
since the opening of the West Line. He thanked Terry
Howerter because despite the financial report, Terry Howerter
has given Bus Operations some funding for issues that needed
to be addressed due to some bus service changes that were
implemented as part of the West Line opening.

Staff will conduct six (6) public hearings in early June in
Aurora, Boulder, Golden, Downtown Denver (2) and
Lakewood. Once they compile the feedback from the public,
they will summarized it and present it to the Board at the June
Operations and Customer Service Meeting.
Chair Anderson asked if the 116X will run as it did before the
West Line opening. Jessie stated that the route will be
reinstated sooner than the actual August service changes on
May 28th. They will have three trips during each peak period.
The 116L will still run and they will also have additional
service on the CS operating between Federal Center Station
and Civic Center Station. The KC is being discontinued. Chair
Anderson asked how early first bus leaves. Jesse stated that
the bus leaves at 5:36 a.m. to arrive Downtown at 6:34 a.m.
Bruce stated that the schedule is arranged around 7, 8 and 9
a.m. work starts. Chair Anderson stated she understands that
staff will have a meeting in Lakewood to explain the
reinstatement of the route. Jessie affirmed that will be the
process.
Director Lubow stated that she has spoken to transportation
staff in her community; they shared with her that they have
had very good communication with RTD staff about the
August changes. She thanked staff for the interface and
communication. She will continue to work with riders to get
them to the public meetings.
Director Hoy asked about the terminology used, especially on
the 120X. It states that the route will have a $12,700
weekday cost impact. Jessie stated that it is going to cost
$12,700 more annually to operate the additional weekday
trips. He explained that certain routes have weekend service
so there needs to be clarification as to what the costs cover.
Packet Pg. 47

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jessie Carter, Service Planning and Scheduling Manager,
reviewed the proposed changes. He mentioned that it
represents $1.1 million worth of service improvements. The
largest cost of the improvements is the Route 16 proposal,
which represents $840,000 by itself and will require 8
additional vehicles per day to operate. Other changes include
the reinstatement of the Route 116X (South Kipling Express)
and the 87X (South Wadsworth express). These two
represent $140,000. Other areas in the district are also
included.

6.F

Director Daly asked if the 116X stopped at Federal Center.
Jessie stated this route by-passes the Federal Center Station;
however, Federal Center is still serviced by the CS with three
trips during each peak period that start/end at Civic Center
Station. Bruce stated that this serves the Federal Center in
order to make the necessary connections. Jessie stated that
they did not want to reduce capacity with the discontinuation
of the KC. Director Daly stated that he admires the staff’s
flexibility and making this decision within a month to address
riders’ concerns.
Director Sisk understands that over $840,000 will be going to
the West Line. Jessie explained over $840,000 is going to
route 16 as they have seen a 25% increase in ridership;
instead of having 6,000 boardings per day the route now has
close to 9,000 boardings. They are increasing service by 67% but the ridership has increased by 25%. Jessie stated
that they are addressing a need for increased service to
accommodate the demand. Bruce stated that since the
opening of the West Rail Line, Route 16 is overloaded; drivers
have to leave people at stops. Director Sisk stated that he
understand that having to make adjustments is part of opening
a new line; however, he thinks that when we open new areas
we should anticipate some of these reactions. He would also
like to see a review of the Superior Park-n-Ride and a
Longmont to DIA express bus. Director Sisk said that he
heard there are some Longmont routes that will be adjusted
with the proposed changes. Jessie stated they are changing
the layover point for one route as they had some neighborhood
complaints. There are also additional trips added to certain
routes to accommodate for the increased ridership from school
starting.
Director Lubow stated that she understands that the staff is
looking at the Longmont-DIA proposal. Bruce stated that staff
has no shortage of requests that they review. Jessie stated

Packet Pg. 48

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Hoy said he has had some comments from people
who work at Flatirons regarding service on Saturday evenings.
He believes this service concern has been addressed with the
proposed August changes by eliminating a Sunday morning
trip and adding a Saturday evening trip. Jessie confirmed this
was correct; the trip being taken away did not have any
ridership.

6.F

that they will get back to the Board with the different
scenarios being reviewed.

Director Menten stated that she handed out a few letters
before the meeting to each Director with regard to the West
corridor. She had a public meeting and the people have
various concerns. There are routes adding an additional 40
minutes of commuting time per day. She expects several
people to attend the Board Meeting to participate in Public
Participation. She thanked the staff for their support. Route
17 has been eliminated partially and she hopes that it will
come up in the future. With regard to the line to DIA, she has
heard a lot about the AF route. Also with regard to the stroller
policy, she would like the Board to also look at a luggage and
bike policy. The letters that Director Menten handed out to
the other Directors are available for review in the Board office.
Chair Anderson thanked staff for the quickest turnaround she
has seen. She knows they have been listening to people and
working with them to come up with the changes that are
being proposed. Bruce stated that they expect the changes on
Route 16 in terms of additional services to start on June 9th in
anticipation to the Board’s approval of the August changes.
Also on June 9th as schools let out the ridership load
decreases and they will be looking at changing the West Rail
from 3 to 2 cars.
Director Menten asked how often this type of proposal moves
to the next step in such a short period of time as next week.
Bruce stated that this request is not coming back for approval
to the Board next week. After the Board approves it would go
to public comment. Next Tuesday it will come up to the Full
Board for approval to go out to the public.
Director Hoy stated that the public meetings are specifically to
allow the opportunity for the public to have more dialogue
with staff. He does not discourage anybody from coming to
the Board Meeting but they will be able to have more dialog
and input at the public hearings.
Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of May 21, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley stated that since he has been on the Board,
the AT was terminated. Service to DIA is a component every
community wants. He asked that before we look at direct
routes from anywhere to DIA, those lines that were removed
three or four years ago need to be reviewed as well.

6.F

Director Tobiassen asked for a timeline for this process. Bruce
stated that the normal process is done three times a year. It is
typically in May when school gets out, August when school
goes back in session and in January. Normally they would not
be able to makes changes like the 116X, but because of the
way KC and 116X were constructed in the run board they
were able to make the change somewhat out of cycle. The
116X will be returning next Tuesday (May 28th, 2013).
Similarly because of the overload on the 16, they can start
earlier. Everything else is intertwined and part of the system
as the whole; therefore any additional changes have to wait
until the August recommendation is approved.
Director Bagley reminded the Board members that as a
procedure, if this issue is moved tonight by all of the board
members it would go to the Unanimous Consent. If is not
unanimous tonight then it would go into the Recommended
Action allowing for further discussion next week. He wants to
make sure all Board members understand this when they vote
tonight.
Director Tobiassen thanked the staff for their great work.
General Manager (GM) Washington stated that many staff
members have experienced this with the T-Rex project so this
is not new to them. They try to anticipate everything but
there is always something new and they try to make those
adjustments as soon as possible.

C. Updates

Alice Osner, General Superintendent of Transportation, presented the Stroller
Policy Update that can be found in the May 21st, 2013 Operations and
Customer Service Agenda Packet. They will be enforcing the stroller policy
and will be coordinating internally with marketing, security and street
supervisors to work with operators to ensure that passengers in wheel chairs
have access to the priority securement area; people with stroller are
expected to collapse the stroller and move to another area in the bus. They
will put new exterior signage so that passengers are prepared to collapse
their strollers when boarding. Bruce Abel stated that this approach has been
developed over time and this is an issue that all staff needs to pay attention
to.
Director Folska thanked staff for their efforts as this is not just a problem
here but at the national level.
Director Rivera-Malpiede asked if the marketing plan will outreach to the
Mommy groups to let them know that those massive, non-collapsible
strollers will not be allowed. She also asked if they have a big stroller that
will not collapse would they be denied service. Alice stated that they would
be put on notice that they will need to get a collapsible stroller. They do
plan to socialize it in schools and other places. Director Rivera-Malpiede
stated that since we are emphasizing the use of alternative transportation
methodologies, it would be advantageous to work with all the TMAs and
TMOs as part of the marketing plan to outline this policy about strollers. We
will need to do a lot of proactive support and education on this. She also
asked when the policy will go into effect. Alice stated that it will go into
effect by mid-summer. Bruce stated that though it is called a Stroller Policy
it addresses a broad range of issues such as passengers bringing packages
and luggage onto the bus.
Director Daly stated that this is good for the drivers to feel more comfortable
when facing these situations. He appreciates strengthening the rules. He
also suggested recommending for young mothers with strollers to ride light
rail when possible. Director Daly shared that he had been on the West Line
and was able to see how much easier it was for mothers to ride the train.
Director Menten asked what happens if the passenger does not comply.
Alice stated that they would have the operator supported by security; that is
why they are putting the marketing plan in place to educate the people
about the policy. Director Menten stated that she understands that the

operator would not have to ticket these people but rather the police
department would.
Director Folska mentioned that she attended the Disability Etiquette
Workshop. She thought it was very helpful for the riders. Director Folska
stated that Sarah Boettcher is an awesome bus driver. She believes this is a
great program for the user and the people that partner with RTD.

Bruce stated that the report can be found in the May 21, 2013 Operations
and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet. Judy McMurphy stated
that there was a correction to the report. It stated that there were 13M
taps during the month of April when really it should read 1.3M taps during
the month of April for the EcoPass and CollegePass riders. The Smart Card
Customer Service Center continues to distribute cards upon request, issue
replacement cards and answer riders’ questions when they arise.
All bus installations are completed and RTD and Xerox staff have updated
onboard software of the 5% of vehicles with performance issues identified.
All Light Rail validators have been installed. They have issued a Request for
Proposal (RFP) to retain a work order contractor to provide on-call
installation electrical services for additional validators as needed.
The Fare Inspector software is functioning sporadically and RTD staff is
encouraging Xerox to execute the suggested solution as soon as possible.
On May 10, RTD received 300 Retail Point of Sales (RPOS) Terminals. They
are working on the Retailer’s contract for legal review. RTD Marketing will
meet with Safeway and King Soopers once the contract is signed to develop
the appropriate marketing campaign. They expect to have 150 locations in
addition to the web portal already in place. Planning for Phase II is in
progress; staff continues to revise the schedule to ensure adequate time for
a successful launch of Phase II.
Director Lubow asked if they have reached out to other large retailers that
serve people of all incomes. Beverly stated that they have reached out to 711 and are considering Walgreens. They also have some mom and pop
businesses that currently sell or fare media that they are hoping will want to
continue with the Smart Cards. Director Lubow asked if they have thought
about Target and Wal-Mart. Beverly stated that they have not but that they
will look at the possibility.

Director Folska asked if it is possible to print the Smart Cards on the
computer. Beverly stated that the Smart Cards are encrypted; they would
have to have the encryption key in order to be valid when they tap it. They
can print a similar card but they would not be able to tap the card. Bruce
explained once a person has purchased an RTD issue Smart Card they can
go online and manage it. Director Folska asked it this also works for paying
for parking. Beverly stated not at this time. It is in the project list but they
have not assigned a date to it.

(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Bruce Abel stated that the report can be found in the Board Packet. Eric
Farrington, Project Manager, said that they are proceeding with the
implementation. INIT has been able to solve the CAD/AVL central system
issues that halted bus installations. They have resumed the installation and
are expecting an August completion for the installation.
Director Tobiassen asked if everything will be done by August. Eric stated
they will be done with the installation. Director Tobiassen asked if they are
still running with two radio systems. Eric stated that they are and that both
are independent.

• 2012 Bus Accidents Executive Summary
Bruce Abel stated that the report can be found in the May 21st, 2013
Operations and Customer Service Agenda Packet. The overall synopsis is
that staff is pleased with the improvements on safety.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley mentioned that he attended the Centennial Counsel of
Neighborhoods meeting. Tina Jaquez made a presentation on the I-225 Corridor
and she did a fantastic job.
Director Bagley also mentioned that he attended the accident free day last
Thursday. Chair Anderson, Director Daly and he attended. There will be two more
Accident Free days and he encourages the Board members to attend these events.
Director Bagley shared that Austin Jenkins gave them a tour of the facility. Austin
introduced them to extremely valuable employees; it is important to recognize those
people that have done some exemplary work. He wants those individuals to know
how much he appreciates what they do.
Director Daly mentioned that a couple of weeks ago they had the Pine Junction
Park-n-Ride Groundbreaking. He thanked Directors Lasater and Menten for
participating.

essay about the people that work the night shift keeping our buses running.
GM Washington stated that with regards to the email on graffiti that the Board
members received, staff is working on that and will provide the gentleman a correct
point of contact.

Director Menten asked who the correct contact is to handle issues related to
graffiti. GM Washington stated that it is Robert McIntosh, Senior Manager of
Facilities. He said staff will also notify the city staff for those areas that are not
RTD property as much of the graffiti is not in our property. David Genova stated
that he has been notified that Lakewood police has officers specifically working on
the West Line to try to identify the people doing the graffiti. Director Menten
stated that she would like to know what property is RTD versus the City of
Lakewood in reference to the email sent to the Directors. David will provide
additional detail for the whole board.
Director Rivera-Malpiede mentioned that there was an article on CNN about how
transit riders are happy people. She also mentioned she received an email from one

Other Matters
Other Matters:
 Director James expressed his appreciation to the Board members for their
review and responsiveness to the organizational membership update request.
 Director Daly shared that he had attended the Implementing PPP Workshop that
was held yesterday. General Manager Washington was one of the speakers and
did a great job. He found this workshop quite informative. Director James
asked General Manager Washington his opinion on if he is seeing a type of “CChange evolution” that is taking place. General Manager Washington responded
it depends. He noted there appears to be some fear/hesitation by the
international companies to deal with the government on PPP’s due to a lack of
knowledge pool within the government. RTD is sought after as speakers or for
knowledge due to our experience with PPP’s. Director James asked the General
Manager if he sees any strategic opportunity for RTD. General Manager
Washington responded that hopefully we can influence transportation on a
national level and the industry including APTA. He also shared that part of his
discussion has been creating a national priority project list where opportunities

could be leveraged. He believes the future financial opportunities will be a three
legged stool involving privates, government and others to have major impacts.
General Manager Washington briefed the Executive committee on some new
developments related to the I-225 project specific to the Anschutz campus
alignment. He shared there are numerous discussions that are in progress with
the city and the University. UC has expressed continued concerns on possible
impact of EMI and vibrations on its biomedical operation. They are reviewing
possible options for re-alignment but further information is needed to understand
the full impact of the re-alignment on ridership, costs, community, schedule and
other variables. RTD remains neutral on a number of these issues. He will come
back to brief the Board soon as more information around implications and
unintended consequences becomes available.
Chair Anderson shared with the Executive Committee a detailed request from
staff from Director Menten relative to the West Corridor and traffic counts.
General Manager Washington indicated that staff will prepare a response to
what information RTD has and will direct Director Menten to the appropriate
sources for where some of the other requested data may be obtained.
Director Hoy indicated the committee needs to be focusing on a succession plan
for the General Manager. General Manager commented this discussion has
already occurred and they have a succession plan in place.
Director Hoy would like to schedule a discussion around the Board travel policy.
He and Chair Anderson will meet to have an initial discussion.

Chair Anderson complimented the staff for the outstanding employee celebration
day on the West Line. This was one of the best days of her life and marked the
first corridor rollout from the FasTracks program. Brenda Tierney, FasTracks Public
Information had done a fantastic job.
Last month, Director Hoy hosted an extremely successful North Metro tour. One of
the highlights from this tour was the relationship building and people (i.e. elected
officials in the North and Board members), getting a chance to dialog and know
each other.
Chair Anderson and Director Sisk attended the Metro Mayors TaskForce meeting.
They are in support of RTD plans for FasTracks.

General Manager's Report


General Manager Washington stated the West Corridor Employee Event day was a
success with over 4200 employees who had RSVP’d. He thanked all the
volunteers including Director Rivera-Malpiede and stated he had received numerous
emails from employees who were proud of this organization and its
accomplishments.
 General Manager Washington announced that RTD is in queue for Federal funds in
the next phase of MAP-21 New Starts process for the Southeast Corridor
Extension. He stated we have been accepted into the project development phase
and that RTD is the only new start in the country for the new MAP 21. This new
MAP-21 looks at some different factors such as current ridership versus
projections.
 General Manager Washington announced that RTD did not get the full $150M from
the FFGA as hoped for 2013. RTD was part of the across-the- board cut (haircut)
of 5.489%.Nevertheless we will figure out how to stay the course and he believes
we will ultimately get the full amount.
 General Manager Washington indicated there have been some questions or
confusion about the operations and maintenance portion of FasTracks. O&M is a
part of the .4% of FasTracks and we will retain what is needed of the .4% for
operations and maintenance. He stated that RTD has taken an aggressive stance
on state of good repair with emphasis on asset management. This is a priority for
us and continuing to be proactive in this area will help us in the operations and
maintenance area.
 North Metro—we are moving in the direction with the assumption of no federal
funds; however, we will remain open so if an opportunity exists to apply for federal
funds.
Questions from Board Members:
 Director Lubow asked if this was the second cut RTD has experience for the FFGA.
General Manager Washington indicated that it is; the first cut was $10M which is

more than this second cut. We have done well with FFGA and he believes it hinges
on when we get the funds, not if.
Director Sisk asked for an update on the NAMS study and if we were on target
with the timelines. General Manager Washington replied we are still on schedule
with a target submittal date of May 14.
Director Solano asked assurance that we are still moving forward with North Metro,
with or without federal funds. General Manager Washington assured him we will
be moving forward.
Director Folska complimented General Manager Washington and staff for a
phenomenal employee event for the West Corridor.
Director Bagley commented on the Directors who attended this event, Folska,
Anderson, Tobiassen, Hoy, and Rivera-Malpiede and stated it was a great event.
He also declared how pleased he was to hear about Southeast Corridor extension
being accepted into the first phase of MAP-21. This is absolutely critical.

Recommended Action
B.
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit – Use of Contingency Funds from Phase I and II
Commitments
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors modify the formal actions taken on August 23, 2011 and July 24, 2012
concerning RTD funding provided to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT)
and the Colorado High Performance Toll Enterprise (HPTE) for Phase I and Phase II of the
US 36 Managed Lanes Project. Specifically, it is recommended that the RTD Board of
Directors allow the following actions:



Any RTD funding left over after completion of Phase I may be used for the Phase II
project; and
Any RTD funding left over after the completion of both Phase I and Phase II will be

Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve item B, US 36 Bus Rapid
Transit-Use of Contingency Funds from Phase I and II Commitments.
Director Tobiassen seconded this motion.

Discussion:

remaining funds will be divided equally between RTD and its partners,
CDOT and DRCOG.
Director Hoy stated he is also in support but stated we are dealing
with forecasted funds; until the work is complete, we do not know
what, if any funds may be available.
Director Solano asked about what happens if there is lack of funds.
General Manager Washington responded that our contractors will be
paid. This kicks in only if there is an underrun.

Donation of Vintage Rolling Stock

It is Recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate seven vintage
trolleys and buses for restoration purposes to the Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway
Foundation, (dba) Colorado Springs & Interurban Railway.
Primary motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve the donation of the
vintage rolling stock to Pikes Peak Historical Street Railway
Foundation in Colorado Springs.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Substitute Motion:

Director Lasater asked for a 6 month postponement of this decision
while he lead the effort to rally support and funds for the
preservations of these vintage rolling stock.
Director Solano seconded this motion.

Discussion:

Director Lasater stated his position that this is part of RTD history
and that we need to retain our history. He brings a passion to this
issue that perhaps others do not share. He wanted time to put
together a group to look at preservation options and to try to do this
without cost to RTD. He referred to a letter by Robert Brewster that
spoke also to this being Denver legacy and not Colorado Springs.
Director Lubow thanked Director Lasater for putting this option on the
table. She strongly supports this and stated that Brewster felt we
could turn this into an asset for RTD.
Director Daly shared that this is not a new discussion. He also
shares the passion for history but the last time this came up, staff

had been instructed to issue a RFP for possible interests. Staff sent
out letters of inquiries to every historical group. The only one
expressing any interest was Pikes Peak. AGM Genova stated he had
put a list of the people who the letter had gone to in the Board report.
Director Daly stated now is not the time for RTD to spend on
historical preservation. What is being offered is a compromise.
Director Menten inquired about acquisition costs. AGM Genova
stated he has no other information other than what he provided.
Director Menten asked if we could be creative in our approach.
Perhaps trade schools such as Emily Griffith could have their students
work on the preservation, donate materials, etc. General Manager
Washington responded that he is not sure who all was on the list of
18 names but he questions if trade schools such as Emily Griffith
would have capability.
Director Solano commented there is a lot of cultural history here and
the trolley is an instrumental part of Denver history that should be
retained.
Director Walker stated he is in favor of preserving the past as long as
it does not risk our future. Given all the issues with time, storage,
determining who might want them, etc., it is time to move on and
make a decision.
Director Lubow clarified her understanding that we had two
approaches. The first with the RFP was to give them away and have
someone take them off our hands. What Lasater was proposing was
preservation and a different approach.
Director Folska stated that she appreciated history but was more
concerned that the opportunity to do something with these vehicles
might go away.
Director Hoy stated his experience in restoration of vehicles and
stated the costs could easily go into millions of dollars. He could not
foresee spending any funds in this direction when we need buses and
services on the road. He would not support.
Director Bagley stated he supported Director Folska’s position that
this is an opportunity on the table that could be lost if we postpone.
He could not support postponement.
Director Lasater re-stated that he is not asking RTD to spend any
money. He is simply asking for time to look at the feasibility for
putting a group together for preservation. He also has extensive
experience in restoring and preservation and he understands fully
what is involved. Over the years, he has managed to restore lots of
things that others would have thrown out. He can also be a

the district. Chair Anderson directed staff to look at this and provide direction to
the Board on the appropriate action. General Manager Washington indicated they
will put a package together and get back to the Board as to action required.
Director Menten expressed interest in this discussion on annexation and wanted to
make sure that we knew and followed the requirements of annexation to the law.
We need to be very clear on process and notice that needs to be given to the
residents.
Director Sisk indicated that he had met the residents in the mountainous
community of Nederland north of Boulder. He stated this is a community that is
heavily dependent on transit and that RTD is the lifeblood of that community.

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

May 15, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 28, 2013

Subject:

Presentation of 2012 RTD Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report and Report to
Governance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and
audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2012 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy has been included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the
meeting on May 21. We have been advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the District as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its
cash flow for the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

Date:

May 6, 2013

Subject:

Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator
Fare-Free Service Plan

Assistant

Date: May 7, 2013
General

GM
Board Meeting Date: May 28, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations beginning in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan included funding for a Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator)
bus transit project to complement and enhance the existing 16th Street FREE MallRide. The Circulator is
a critical element to the implementation of the FasTracks Plan as the MallRide will not be able to
accommodate the increase in passengers from the addition of the US 36 BRT and the West, East, Gold,
North Metro, and Northwest Rail Lines.
Since the adoption of the original FasTracks Plan in 2004, RTD has worked with the City and County of
Denver to refine the plan for the Circulator. The long-range vision for the Circulator is all-day operations
along 18th and 19th Streets and Broadway and Lincoln Street between Denver Union Station (DUS) and
the Denver Art Museum area south of Colfax Avenue. The service is planned to operate in mixed-flow
traffic with transit priority measures such as bus bulbs, dedicated stops, a bus/bike/HOV lane, and
multiple-door, fare-free boarding.
In the short-term, RTD is recommending that the Circulator operate during the weekday peak periods
only with five minute headway based service between DUS and Civic Center. The peak period
operations are necessary to prevent overcrowding of the MallRide with the opening of DUS. The
MallRide will continue to have adequate capacity to accommodate the normal mid-day and weekend
transit ridership demand. The Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide and service levels can be
increased when the MallRide is expected to be overcrowded, including for special events. Therefore, it
is necessary for the Circulator to also offer free service in order to attract customers from the
overcrowded MallRide.
DISCUSSION
Fare-free service is recommended for the Circulator due to a number of characteristics unique to the
Circulator.
These characteristics are outlined below and were the basis for the fare-free
recommendation.
1. The Circulator is a regional service that provides a benefit for the entire District. A recent passenger
survey on the MallRide indicated that 40% of the passengers are from outside of the City of Denver.
The Circulator is anticipated to have a similar or greater percentage of non-Denver residents due to
the primary function being the last mile connection for commuters arriving downtown from other
RTD services that serve the entire District.
2. The Circulator will provide the last mile connection from the new FasTracks projects to the major
employment center in the region. The Circulator and MallRide are necessary for the design of a

Packet Pg. 172

12.B

major transit hub at the edge of downtown to work. The service needs to be fast and convenient for
passengers to transfer modes for the last mile of their trip.
3. There is a parallel free service with the MallRide two blocks away serving the same travel pattern.
Since the Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide, any passengers who would have to pay
the fare would likely opt to not pay a fare and instead take the MallRide.
4. The Circulator ridership is anticipated to be over 80% transfers to or from other RTD services. RTD
has a free transfer policy so the majority of riders would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a
free service. As such, the cost of charging a fare would far exceed the fare revenue collected.
In addition to the characteristics outlined above, the operations of the Circulator would make it difficult
to collect a fare. Multiple-door, fare-free boarding is considered the most important transit priority
measure for the Circulator as it has the greatest impact on reducing travel times and increasing the
reliability of the service. Charging a fare and allowing multiple-door boarding would require off-board
fare collection or a policy that all passengers needing to pay a fare would have to board at the front
door. These options would be very difficult and costly to enforce. If the Circulator cannot operate with
multiple-door boarding, it would not be any different than a standard RTD Local route and other
alternatives such as increasing service on existing downtown routes such as the 0 and 15L should be
considered.
A preliminary Title VI review of the service plan and fare policy reveals an equitable impact with respect
to race, color, national origin and income. The analysis will be completed and submitted to the FTA six
months in advance of the Circulator’s commencement of operation. Once the FTA provides feedback on
the completed equity analysis, the Planning Department will finalize the analysis and seek RTD Board
approval (as required per FTA Guidance).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The opening day Circulator service plan is anticipated to cost $830,000 per year for operations and
maintenance (O&M). This is based on peak period service, six hours per weekday, between DUS and
Civic Center and fare-free operations. The O&M for the Circulator will be paid for from FasTracks.
Charging a fare would result in an increase in the O&M required to operate the Circulator and an increase
in annual Circulator O&M would have a negative impact on the rest of the FasTracks Program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the Circulator service plan including fare-free operations beginning in
2014.
2. Approve the opening of the Circulator as a fare service in 2014. This is not recommended for the
reasons outlined in the Discussion section and would negatively impact the FasTracks financial plan.
In addition, this option could require additional capital investments for fare equipment that are not
included in the Circulator project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the Circulator service plan to begin in
2014. This is not recommended as the Circulator is a commitment in the FasTracks plan and a
necessary element to ensure the success of the other projects. Without the Circulator, the MallRide
will be overcrowded which would require RTD to increase service levels on existing downtown routes
such as the 0 and 15L. The Base System is not able to absorb the increased O&M costs associated
with this alternative. In addition, this alternative would require additional buses for these routes

Packet Pg. 173

12.B

which have not been programed. The Circulator project was awarded a $3.9 Million FASTER grant
for purchasing buses and this money would be lost if the Circulator is not implemented.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 28, 2013

Subject:

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy mandated by the Federal Transit Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the current policy on October 25, 2011. Recently there have been
changes in the federal regulation guidance on recreational and medical marijuana and Collective
Bargaining Agreement. RTD is therefore required to revise the policy, as negotiated with the ATU 1001,
and define provisions to comply with current US Department of Transportation and Federal Transit
Administration requirements. A revised copy is attached for your review with specific changes listed
below.
DISCUSSION
The policy changes are as follows:
Page 6
Updated Medical and Recreational Marijuana policy statement in accordance with
49CFR part 40.
Page 8
Removed 24-month provision for first and second violation for alcohol levels
between 0.02 but less than 0.04.
Pages 8 & 9 Removed 24-month provision for first and second verified positive test.
Page 11
Removed a list of initial and confirmatory cutoff levels replacing them with a single
sentence referring to 49CFR Part 40, as amended.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Removal of the 24-month provisions from the policy will decrease the number of repeat offenders. It will
decrease the financial strain on the District as multiple violations of Drug and Alcohol Policy create
intense and lengthy follow-up programs that require significant RTD resources. Savings to RTD are, at a
minimum, of $10,000 per occurrence.
By removing references to specific federal regulations and metabolite levels, fewer updates to all
covered employees will be required.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Financial/Administration Committee recommend to the full RTD Board
of Directors that the revisions to the RTD Substance Abuse Policy be approved.
2. Do not approve the revised policy. This is not recommended, as this will result in the Agency
being non-compliant with the DOT and FTA regulations.

Regional Transportation District

Drug and Alcohol Policy

The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work environment
for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree that employees of the
system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every
effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all employees. The employer has the
right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the public from the adverse effects of drug and
alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights and
privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy to (1)
detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing; (2) encourage employees to obtain
treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems; (3) deter drug or alcohol use in violation of
this policy through education, training, and discipline; and (4) enforce RTD's goal of a drug- and alcoholfree work environment through appropriate discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware
of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected. Appendix A to this policy contains additional discussion of these
matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 15, 1998, July 18,
2000, May 20, 2003 and July 2011. Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations
covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Appendix B to this policy explains which elements of this
policy are not federally required. Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol
use may contact RTD's Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended or

revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be familiar with,
and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new RTD
employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited
drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and the signs and symptoms which may
indicate prohibited drug use.

2.0 Applicability
2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and vendors are expected to
adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safetysensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended
and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in
this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to
perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of mass transit
services. The following are safety-sensitive functions:
1.

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in
revenue service.

2.

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

3.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.

4.

Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a
holder of a CDL.

5.

Carrying a firearm for security purposes.

6.

Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items 1-5
above.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD's drug and alcohol testing program, is
a required condition of employment.

RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job functions may
require the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job

2.2

Categories of Prohibited Substances

This policy applies to controlled substances (see section 2.2.1 of this policy); legal drugs or
medications which may impair mental functioning, motor skills or judgment (section 2.2.2); and alcohol
(section 2.2.3). For ease of reference, these substances are collectively referred to in this policy as
"prohibited substances" unless otherwise noted.

Controlled substances are any drug or other substance identified in Schedules I through V of the
federal Controlled Substance Act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), federal regulations at 21 CFR sections
1300.11 through 1300.15, and the Colorado Controlled Substance Act (CRS section 12-22-301), all as
amended. Controlled substances include, but are not necessarily limited to: marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and PCP (phencyclidine).
2.2.2 Legal Drugs or Medications
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs or over-the-counter medications are not
prohibited. However, the use of any legally prescribed drug or medication which carries a warning label
that indicates that mental functions, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be
discussed by employees with their appropriate health care professional before performing work-related
duties. Employees are urged to seek and obtain medical confirmation prior to using prescription or over
the counter drugs to assure that such consumption will not adversely affect their ability to safely
perform essential job functions. Appendix C contains guidelines for use of prescribed drugs and over-thecounter medications and a partial list of some over-the-counter medications that may affect your ability
to drive.
A legally prescribed drug is one for which the employee has a prescription or other written
authorization from a licensed health care provider permitted by law to prescribe or dispense drugs or
medications. The authorization must include the employee's name, the name of the substance, the
amount to be taken, and the period of authorization.
2.2.3 Medical and Recreational Marijuana
Colorado law on the use of medical and recreational marijuana does not amend, exempt, or
supersede RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Policy. The Department of Transportation’s Drug and Alcohol Testing
Regulation 49CFR Part 40, section 40.151(e) does not authorize verification of a test based on
information that a physician recommended that the employee use a drug listed in Schedule I of the
Controlled Substances act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such recommendations,
such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states have adopted). The MRO will not verify a drug
test as negative based upon learning that the employee used “medical or recreational marijuana” when
states have passed “medical or recreational marijuana” initiatives.

2.2.4 Alcohol
Alcohol is a colorless, volatile liquid that is the intoxicating agent in fermented and distilled
beverages. It also includes ethyl-alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or
isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol can be found in certain medications as well as in alcoholic beverages.

Hours of Compliance

Testing is conducted on all days and hours throughout the year. Employees are subject to this
policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD
vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends. Employees are subject to this policy on regularly scheduled days, and when volunteering for or
assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. Safety-sensitive employees are also subject to this
policy at additional times set forth in section 3.4 of this policy.

3.0 Prohibited Conduct; Discipline
Discipline under this policy is independent of discipline for violation of any other performance
code or work rules. For example, an employee who causes an accident and tests positive for alcohol use
may receive separate, consecutive penalties for both the accident and the positive test.
In addition to any disciplinary action taken under this policy, law enforcement authorities may be
notified where criminal activity is suspected in connection with any of the following prohibited conduct.

3.1

Possession/Use of Prohibited Substances at RTD

Any employee found to manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, possess, or use prohibited
substances while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD
vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.2

Intoxication/Under Influence

Any employee reasonably suspected of being intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence
of a prohibited substance, or of being not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD
duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or
other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be immediately
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of his or her condition. Any
employee found to be intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence of a prohibited substance, or
not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

Positive Drug or Alcohol Tests

Any time that an employee loses while removed from service pending report of a confirmatory
test (or for safety-sensitive employees, while removed from service under section 5.1 of this policy) will
be counted towards disciplinary suspension time.
3.3.1 Alcohol Test of 0.02 but Less than 0.04
Federal law requires RTD to remove a safety-sensitive employee from service as provided in
section 5.1 of this policy if a confirmatory breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02
or greater but less than 0.04. To deter such conduct, a safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory
breath alcohol test of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: Removal from service for no less than eight hours or until the start of
the employee's next shift, whichever comes first; warning letter; and
recommendation that the employee seek assistance from the Employee Assistance
Program (“EAP”).
For a first violation when the employee has already been subject to the return-toduty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, discipline may be a five-working-day
unpaid suspension (with time lost under section 5.1 counting toward the
suspension time) up to termination, depending on the circumstances.

2.

Second violation: Disciplined as a "verified positive" test as defined in section 4.1.2
of this policy (i.e., as a positive confirmatory test for alcohol concentration of 0.04
or greater).
For a second violation when the employee has already been subject to the returnto-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, the employee may be terminated.
3.3.2 Verified Positive Test

Any employee with a "verified positive" drug or alcohol test, as that term is defined in section 4.1 of
this policy (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater),
may receive the following discipline:
1.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Positive drug or alcohol tests may be subject to discipline up to and including termination as set
forth in this policy. In addition, sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy specify an employment assessment
and return-to-duty requirements following a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for
drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater).

First violation: 20-working-day unpaid suspension to termination, depending on
circumstances. If discipline is other than termination, the employee must also
undergo an employment assessment and fulfill return-to-duty requirements as set
forth in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy.

3.4

Additional Prohibitions for Safety-Sensitive Employees

Any safety-sensitive employee who uses alcohol within four hours prior to duty, or during
otherwise specified on-call hours, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.5

Noncompliance with Testing Requirements

Any employee who refuses to comply with an RTD request for drug or alcohol testing, provides
false information in connection with a drug or alcohol test, or attempts to falsify drug or alcohol test
results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a test sample, may be treated
as if the employee had received a "verified positive" drug test result (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for
drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater), may be removed from service immediately, and
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination. In addition, noncompliance with testing
requirements may constitute a verified positive drug test result for purposes of section 5.1 of this policy
(removal of safety-sensitive employees from service).
"Refusal to comply” includes:
1. Failure to appear for any test (except pre-employment test) within a reasonable time
as determined by RTD.
2. Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process is completed, except a
pre-employment test.
3. Failure to attempt provide a sufficient amount of urine, breath or saliva specimen as
required by FTA or DOT regulations.
4. In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, failure to
permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen.
5. Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when directed, and it has
been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no
adequate medical explanation for the failure.
6. Failure or decline to take an additional drug test RTD or the collector has directed
you to take.
7. Failure to undergo a medical evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the
verification process, or as directed by the Designated Employer Representative
(DER).
8. Failure to sign Step #2 of the ATF.
9. Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process.
10. For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer’s instructions to raise your
clothing above the waist, lower clothing and underpants, and turn around to permit

For pre-employment only, failure to appear, aborting the collection before the test commences, or
failure to remain at the site prior to commencement of test is NOT a test refusal.
A refusal to test constitutes violation of this policy and will be treated the same as a positive test
result. Refusal to test under RTD authority will not be considered as a refusal to take a DOT-required
test.

3.6

Criminal Convictions

Any employee who is convicted of a felony involving off-site purchase, sale or distribution of a
controlled substance, or who fails to immediately notify his or her supervisor of any such conviction,
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.7

Noncompliance with Treatment Requirements

Under certain circumstances, federal law requires RTD to impose and monitor treatment of RTD
employees for substance abuse, and to set aftercare and return-to-duty requirements (see sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy). Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with RTD requirements for
substance abuse treatment, aftercare, or return to duty may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

3.8

Improper Use of Policy

Supervisors, managers and employees are required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in
an unbiased and impartial manner. Any employee who knowingly disregards the requirements of this
policy, or who deliberately misuses or misapplies this policy against any other employee, may be subject
to discipline up to and including termination.

3.9

Alcoholic Beverages on RTD Property

Employees are prohibited from consuming alcoholic beverages on RTD property. Employees
violating this section may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

The Union and RTD will cooperate to allow the Union reasonable opportunity to review the Drug
and Alcohol program subject to limits of confidentiality. Such review may include, but is not limited to,
credentials of the medical review officer, Substance Abuse Professionals, breath alcohol technicians, and
testing laboratories.
In addition, RTD will permit the Union reasonable opportunity to review the results of blind testing
conducted on an unannounced basis to maintain the integrity of the testing facility. The Union shall
receive, when reasonably requested and subject to confidentiality, information including, but not limited
to, drug test results, chain of custody forms, the random selection process, and collection site
procedures. RTD and the Union may jointly review literature and research on alcohol and drug testing
technology and procedures, suggested changes and improvements to the program, and employee
education and training programs.
RTD will strictly adhere to all standards of confidentiality. Testing records and results will be
released only to those authorized by federal regulations to receive such information. RTD will strive to
protect employees' rights to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
4.1.1 Drug Testing Procedures
RTD will designate a medical review officer (“MRO”) to receive drug test results and evaluate,
interpret and verify the results in conjunction with an employee's medical history, to determine whether
a positive drug test result was caused by the use of controlled substances or by an employee's medical
condition. The MRO will then report all test results to the RTD via electronic file. The MRO shall be a
licensed physician (doctor of medicine or osteopathy) with knowledge of drug abuse disorders. In
carrying out his or her responsibilities, the MRO shall examine alternate medical explanations for any
positive test result. This action may include conducting a medical interview and review of the
individual’s medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors. The MRO shall review all
medical records made available by the tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have
resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall not, however, consider the results of urine
samples that are not obtained or processed in accordance with 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Employees may be required to submit to urine drug testing and/or breath alcohol testing under
circumstances set forth in this policy. Testing shall be conducted in a manner to protect the rights of the
employee, assure the integrity of the drug testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and
ensure that test results are attributed to the correct employee. Collectors will use techniques, equipment
and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the federal government. All testing will be
conducted consistent with federal requirements of 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended and Part 655.

Pursuant to federal regulations, drugs to be tested for are marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). (RTD reserves the right, not based on federal regulations, to
test for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Librium, Xanax),
nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude), and nonamphetamine stimulants, by separate urine specimen
if there is reasonable suspicion of such drug use (see section 4.2.2 of this policy).
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen at a laboratory certified by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). For specimens that are not negative (at or

12.C.a

Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the MRO is responsible for contacting
any such employee, on a direct and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes to
discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the positive result. An MRO staff person may
make the contact; the MRO’s medically licensed or certified staff person may gather information. If,
after reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may contact RTD’s
designated management official for assistance in contacting the employee. RTD’s designated
management official will take maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO contact.
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO nor RTD’s designated
management official are able to contact the employee within ten (10) days of the date the MRO received
the confirmed positive test result from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.
The MRO may also verify the test result as positive if RTD’s designated management official has
successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact
the MRO and 72 hours have passed since the time RTD’s designated management official contacted the
employee. The MRO may reopen the verification of positive test if the employee presents documentation
of serious injury or illness or other circumstances which unavoidably prevented the employee from being
contacted within the designated time period, and if the employee then presents a legitimate (in the
MRO’s opinion) explanation for the positive test, the MRO shall declare the test to be negative.
The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive test that the employee has 72
hours in which to request a test of a split specimen provided at the same time as the original sample. If
the employee requests an analysis of the split specimen within 72 hours of having been informed of a
verified positive test, the MRO shall direct, in writing, the laboratory to provide the split specimen to
another DHHS-certified testing laboratory for analysis. All costs for such testing shall be paid by the
employee (by payroll deduction if necessary) unless the additional test invalidates the confirmatory test.
The methods of collecting, storing and testing the split sample will be consistent with 49 CFR Part 40. If
analysis of the split specimen fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s) or metabolite(s) found in the
primary specimen, or if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing, or untestable, the MRO
shall cancel the test and report cancellation and the reasons for it to the DOT, RTD and the employee.
Federally-mandated urine and breath forms must be used for all federally-mandated testing.
Specimens shall be collected and identified as required by 49 CFR. Specimens and written records shall
be stored by the laboratory, MRO and RTD as required by 49 CFR Part 40. Among other requirements,
all records pertaining to a given urine specimen shall be retained by the drug testing laboratory for a
minimum of 2 years, and all specimens confirmed positive shall be kept in their original labeled specimen
bottles and placed in properly secured long-term frozen storage for a minimum of 1 year. The laboratory
shall be required to maintain any specimens known to be under legal challenge for an indefinite period.
RTD’s contracts with laboratories shall require that the laboratory maintain employee test records in
confidence, as provided in DOT agency regulations; and that the laboratory shall disclose information

Department of Transportation (DOT) requires employees to submit to an observed collection
under the following conditions:
1. Return-to-duty tests.
2. Follow-up tests.
3. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
temperature on the original specimen was out of the accepted temperature range.
4. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the original
specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
5. Anytime a collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the
employee’s conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen.
6. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
laboratory reported to the MRO that the original specimen was invalid and the MRO
determined that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result.
7. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the MRO
determined that the original specimen was positive, adulterated or substituted, but
had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed.
4.1.4 Alcohol Testing Procedures
Alcohol testing will be performed by a qualified Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) or Screening
Test Technician (STT). The BAT or STT must receive qualification training meeting the requirements in
49 CFR Part 40 as amended. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a
second, confirmatory, test will be performed. If the confirmatory test indicates an alcohol concentration
of 0.04 or greater, the confirming test will be considered a "verified positive" test under this policy.

4.2

Categories of Tests

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

A dilute specimen is a specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are lower than
expected for human urine. Dilute negative results 2-5 mg//dl requires an immediate recollection under
direct observation.

4.2.1 Pre-Employment Drug Testing
All applicants for employment will be tested for drug use prior to employment in any position at
RTD, and prior to transfer from a non-safety-sensitive position into a safety-sensitive position. Receipt by
RTD of a verified negative drug result is required prior to employment or transfer. A verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use) will disqualify an applicant from again applying for
employment or transfer for 24 months from date of collection; in addition, the applicant will receive a
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

12.C.a

Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) referral letter and must provide evidence from the SAP proof of
having successfully completed a referral, evaluation and treatment plan prior to further consideration of
any subsequent application. If the pre-employment drug test is cancelled the applicant will be required
to re-test with a negative test result.

4.2.2 Reasonable Suspicion Testing
An employee will be tested where there is reasonable suspicion that the employee has engaged in
drug or alcohol use. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing for safety-sensitive employees shall be
performed just before, during and just following the performance of a safety-sensitive function. To come
under reasonable suspicion, the employee must be observed by a supervisor trained in the detection of
drug or alcohol misuse. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion determinations of drug use shall
receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of
probable drug use. Supervisors designated to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists for alcohol
testing shall receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech and performance
indicators of probable alcohol misuse. Reasonable suspicion testing is required when (1) one trained
supervisor can (2) articulate and substantiate physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable
drug use or alcohol misuse by (3) observing the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the
employee. Examples of conditions which may result in reasonable-suspicion testing include, but are not
limited to, the following:
1.

Physical signs and symptoms consistent with use of prohibited substances.

2.

Evidence of manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited
substances.

3.

Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused
by human error, including but not necessarily limited to any accident in which the
RTD Accident Investigation Team (AIT) is summoned.

4.

The employee is involved in an accident in which, at the reasonable discretion of
the supervisor, negligence, carelessness or poor judgment may have been involved.

5.

Fights involving physical contact, assaults, and flagrant disregard or violation of
established safety, security, or other operating procedures.

6.

Accidents in which an RTD vehicle rear-ends another vehicle and causes damage.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 days or more for any reason, and have been
out of the random pool, must successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of
a safety-sensitive function.

4.2.3 Post-Accident Testing

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

14

Packet Pg. 191

12.C.a

In case of a non-fatal accident in which either (1) an individual sustains injuries requiring
immediate treatment at a medical treatment facility, (2) the RTD vehicle is a bus, van or automobile and
one or more vehicles incur disabling damage that requires towing from the site, or (3) the RTD vehicle is
a vehicle operating on rails and is removed from revenue service, tests will be conducted on all
employees on duty in the RTD vehicle (unless the employee's behavior can be completely discounted as
a contributing factor to the accident) and on any other employee whose performance could have
contributed to the accident.
The above post-accident testing procedures are separate from reasonable-suspicion testing
conducted under section 4.2.2 of this policy.
Post-accident testing will be done as soon as possible, and no later than eight hours after the
accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours after the accident for drug testing. An employee involved in an
accident must not use alcohol until after the employee undergoes alcohol testing or eight hours have
elapsed, whichever comes first. Every effort will be made to conduct alcohol testing within two hours
after the accident. In the event the alcohol test is delayed beyond two hours, RTD will prepare and
maintain a record stating the reason(s) for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight
hours following the accident, all attempts to administer the test must cease and RTD must update the
record.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for
the injured following an accident or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the
period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency
medical care. However, any employee who under the above circumstances fails to remain readily
available for drug and alcohol testing (including notifying RTD of his or her location), or who otherwise
leaves the scene of an accident without appropriate authorization prior to submission to drug and alcohol
testing, will be considered to have refused the test. Under section 3.5 of this policy, leaving the scene
of an accident without valid reason is a serious violation subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

In case of an accident involving any RTD vehicle (regardless of whether or not the vehicle is in
revenue service) that results in a death, tests will be conducted on all employees on duty in the RTD
vehicle and on any other employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident.

4.2.4 Return-to-Duty Testing
As part of the employment assessment and return-to-duty requirements set forth in sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy, any employee with a verified positive drug or alcohol test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) must test negative for drugs
and alcohol before returning to work, and will be subject to follow-up random drug and alcohol testing
after returning to work.
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

15

Packet Pg. 192

12.C.a

Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to unannounced random drug and
alcohol testing in accordance with FTA regulation 655.45. Random selections shall be a sufficient
number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than
the minimum annual percentage rate of 10% of the safety-sensitive workforce for alcohol and 25% for
drugs or at the rates set forth by the FTA in Part 655, as amended. Each such employee shall be in a
pool from which random selection is made. Each such employee shall have an equal chance at selection
and shall remain in the pool even after being tested. The basis for random selection shall be by a
scientifically valid random number generation method initiated by computer. To ensure that employees
have a reasonable expectation that they might be called for a test on any day they are at work, the
dates for random testing shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random tests are
unannounced and immediate. Employees are required to proceed to the test site immediately upon
notification. Random testing may also be conducted pursuant to other sections of this policy. A safetysensitive employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse just before, during and just following
the performance of a safety-sensitive function. In addition, RTD senior staff will be expected to
participate in random testing (testing of non-safety-sensitive senior staff is based on RTD’s independent
authority and not federal regulations).

4.3

Employee Status Pending Test Results

Employees who are tested for reasonable suspicion or post accident testing will be immediately
removed from service without pay and will not be allowed to return to work until test results are
reported.
If a negative test result is reported, either from an initial test or a confirmatory test, the employee
will be notified immediately, returned to work, and compensated for the period of absence from work.
As a general rule, when an employee is sent for a random test, the employee will not be removed
from service pending receipt of test results.

5.0 Consequences of Positive Tests
5.1

Special Consequences for Safety-Sensitive Employees

A safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory alcohol test result of 0.02 or greater, but less
than 0.04, shall be immediately removed from service for a minimum of eight hours, or until re-tested
below 0.02 or until the employee's next shift. A safety-sensitive employee with a verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) shall be
immediately removed from service until after an employment assessment and release to return to duty
by a Substance Abuse Professional (“SAP”) under section 5.3 of this policy.

16

Packet Pg. 193

12.C.a

Discipline for a positive drug or alcohol test is set forth in paragraph 3.3 above.

Employment Assessment

Any employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or
alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) will be immediately removed from duty and must be promptly
assessed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is either (1) a licensed physician, or a
licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional with knowledge of
and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-and drug-related disorders; or (2) an
addiction counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors
Certification Commission. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any,
the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited substance abuse or misuse.
Assessment by an SAP does not exempt an employee from discipline, and does not guarantee
continued employment or reinstatement. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid
by the employee or the employee's own insurance provider.
If the SAP releases the employee to return to duty, the employee must promptly follow the
rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP, must pass a directly observed return-to-duty drug and
alcohol test (non-observed return-to-duty for positive/refusal results that were collected under RTD
authority), and must fulfill the return-to-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy.

5.4

Return-to-Duty Requirements

Employees who re-enter the workforce following (1) completion of a disciplinary suspension for a
verified positive drug or alcohol test, (2) a favorable employment assessment, and (3) successful returnto-duty testing, shall be subject to the following requirements:
1.

Unannounced observed follow-up drug and alcohol testing for one to five years
depending on the circumstances of the case and as recommended by the SAP.
Safety-sensitive employees must pass a minimum of six follow-up tests within the
first 12 months back in safety-sensitive duties.

2.

An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements recommended by the
SAP, with the cost of such requirements to be borne by the employee or the
employee's own insurance provider.

3.

Compliance with all recommendations of the SAP, and release to RTD from each
treatment provider of records of attendance, recommendations, and compliance.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

6.0 Employees Who Seek Assistance Prior to Violations

Employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency prior to violation of this policy
will be referred to the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for appropriate treatment and/or rehabilitation
program. Employees will not be subject to discipline for their participation in such programs. Employees
participating in or completing a treatment or rehabilitation program will continue to be required to comply
with RTD performance standards, policies, and rules and regulations, including but not limited to this
policy, and may be subject to discipline if these are violated.
If determined necessary by RTD-approved medical professionals, medical leaves of absence may
be arranged to allow for proper treatment of employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug
dependency, and RTD may make other reasonable accommodations pursuant to federal law.
RTD offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which is confidential, voluntary, free of
charge, and independent of RTD. EAP counselors can provide drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation programs. Employees can call the EAP office directly and confidentially at 1-800-284-1819
to obtain additional information and to make an appointment. Alternatively, RTD encourages employees
with dependency problems to seek assistance through appropriate treatment or rehabilitation programs
with qualified Substance Abuse Professionals of their choice.
Upon successful completion of a treatment or rehabilitation program for drug or alcohol
dependency under this section, the employee must pass a non observed return-to-duty drug and alcohol
test and the employee will be subject to non observed random follow-up testing for a period of one year
to five years with a minimum of six times in the first year. An employee who fails to comply with non
observed random follow-up testing may be subject to discipline under section 3.5 of this policy.

7.0 System Contact
Employees are expected to fully understand and obey this policy. If you have any questions about
this policy or its effect on you, please ask your supervisor. Any persons with questions regarding this
policy or related matters are also invited to contact RTD's Labor Relations Manager at 303-299-6543
(D0-M1L) (represented employees) or RTD's Senior Manager, Human Resources Services at 303-2992100 (BLK-11) (salaried employees).

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Employees are strongly encouraged to seek assistance to overcome alcohol or drug dependency
problems before accidents or violations of this policy occur. RTD is strongly committed to working in a
positive manner with such employees.

APPENDIX A
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

The attached materials contain discussion of the effects of drug and alcohol abuse on the health,
work, and personal life not only of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at
large. The materials also discuss the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol problems, and possible
methods of intervening.

NOTE: RTD provides its employees a confidential Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) which provides employees and their immediate families a broad range of
confidential counseling and referral services for personal and job-related problems,
including drug or alcohol abuse. The program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. The EAP provides up to eight sessions of counseling for a problem and, if
warranted, refers the employee or family member to another agency or helping facility.
The employee is responsible for charges after a referral is made; however, the EAP can
often find an agency whose services are free or covered by insurance. Sick leave may
be used to visit EAP counselors during regular business hours.

Drugs and Alcohol: Effects, Signs, and Solutions

Contrary to popular belief, relatively few drug or alcohol abusers are on "skid row." For example,
only three percent of alcoholics are destitute; most hold jobs and have families.
Drugs and alcohol affect their users' judgment, performance and safety-awareness, which in turn
directly affects the safety and well-being of the users' families, all other employees, and the public at
large.

Effects of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Drug and alcohol abuse affect a person physically and mentally. These effects occur not only
during actual intoxication (which can last from almost immediately in the case of alcohol, to one to 24
hours after intake for other drugs), but also during residual hangovers, fatigue rebounds, and longer
periods of mental impairment. Physical and mental effects may include:


Slow reactions
Poor coordination
Fatigue
Delayed decision-making
Poor or erratic judgment
Confusion
Learning difficulties
Poor memory
Loss of concentration
Depression or anxiety
Difficulty in sorting out priority tasks
Neurotic or psychotic behavior
Refusal to accept authority

Drugs and alcohol can also lead to many serious physical problems. For example, cocaine use even in small amounts, or by first-time users -- has been linked with heart attacks. Amphetamine abuse
can lead to strokes. Alcoholism can cause fatal cirrhosis of the liver. Use of heroin and other
intravenously-injected drugs expose the user to transmission of AIDS.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

One of every ten U.S. workers abuses alcohol or drugs. In fact, some studies conclude that up to
20-25 percent of the nation's workforce may be abusing alcohol or drugs. Experts estimate that there
are 10 million alcoholics in this country, 6 million current cocaine abusers, 16 to 20 million people who
frequently use marijuana, and several million persons who abuse prescription drugs.

Some persons wrongly believe that marijuana is relatively "safe." However, in addition to
marijuana's links to many of the above physical and mental disturbances, research indicates that
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

21

Packet Pg. 198

12.C.a

marijuana is a "gateway" drug leading to further drug use. Almost 60 percent of marijuana users will go
on to use other drugs.
RTD's mission to provide safe and efficient mass transit is directly threatened by employees' drug
and alcohol abuse. For example, each year approximately two million motor vehicle collisions occur that
involve drinking and driving, injuring 700,000 persons and killing 25,000 persons. One of every two
Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related traffic accident in his or her lifetime.

The first signs of drug or alcohol abuse may be hard to distinguish from signs of other problems
such as job stress, overwork, fatigue, or emotional problems. To make recognition even more difficult,
drug- and alcohol-abusing employees often develop survival skills to avoid detection. Supervisors and
co-workers need to be aware of the following general signs of drug and alcohol abuse:


Absenteeism or tardiness. Employees with substance abuse problems may be absent an average of
two to three times more than the normal employee. They may exhibit a pattern of absences on
certain days, such as Mondays and Fridays.



Staff turnover. Chemically dependent people have disorganized lives. Many quit rather than face
detection; others transfer or are fired for poor or unsafe performance.



Equipment breakdown. Substance-abusing employees often lose interest in maintenance of
equipment and may use broken equipment as a way to avoid work.



Erratic performance; poor work quality. Mental and physical agility and concentration deteriorate
with substance abuse. The abuser may miss deadlines, have poor concentration, work in bursts of
energy, and overlook important details. The person becomes unreliable.



Poor morale. Substance abuse creates wide mood swings, anxiety depression, and anger. Coworkers often see substance abusers as poor "team workers" and safety hazards. Abusers often
blame work problems on someone or something else.



Increased accidents and "near-misses." Impaired employees are 3.6 times more likely to cause an
accident. Even small quantities of drugs or alcohol in the system can cause deterioration of
alertness, clear-mindedness, and reaction speed. For example, studies show that a person's driving
ability substantially decreases at a blood alcohol content level of .04%. This is the equivalent of
approximately two beers or one martini consumed in one hour.



Theft. Drugs are expensive, and drug users need lots of money to support their habits. As
substance abusers' value systems and judgment are affected by drugs, their loyalty and dedication to
their co-workers and employers is weakened.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse

The following signs may also indicate involvement of drugs or alcohol in a person's problems:

Sores around the nose, or marks on the arms

Note that each symptom, by itself, may point to problems other than drug or alcohol abuse.
However, when a pattern begins to develop, a supervisor, manager, co-worker or family member needs
to be alert and act quickly. Fueled by drug or alcohol abuse, these behaviors can quickly lead to
accidents, productivity problems, higher operating costs, greater absenteeism, and worsened service to
the public.

Solutions for Drug and Alcohol Abuse
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in trying to help or reach the drug or alcohol abuser is
denial. To overcome a drug or alcohol dependency, a person must first and foremost be able and willing
to recognize the problem. However, some abusers, especially cocaine users, erroneously believe that
the drug actually improves their performance. Others insist that they can "control" their addictions on
their own. Denial must be confronted and overcome before the abuser can begin to recover.
Supervisors and co-workers endanger the lives and safety of the abuser, and his or her family, coworkers and the public, if they try to "cover up" for the abusing employee or do the employee's work.
Co-workers and supervisors should not allow a suspected substance abuser to continue working
at a lower level, and should not let friendship with the employee or fear of exposing an "embarrassing"
problem lead them into concealing the problem. They should not share in the abuser's denial by
encouraging the abuser to believe that he or she doesn't have a problem.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

12.C.a

Co-workers and supervisors should pay attention to the warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse,
talk to the abuser about concerns you have for the abuser's health or job, and refuse to cover up for or
take excuses from the abuser.
Supervisors should also know how to administer and apply RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy and
other performance rules and policies.
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

23

Packet Pg. 200

12.C.a

Co-workers and supervisors should encourage a suspected abuser of drugs or alcohol to seek
assistance from RTD's Employee Assistance Program. The abuser should be reminded that any help
offered through the EAP program is strictly confidential. Such EAP programs have 70-80 percent
success rates for substance abuse recovery. This is higher than rates for other programs, because with
EAP programs the employee has the commitment of the company behind him or her.
A person dependent on drugs or alcohol can also be referred to his or her personal health care
provider or clergy member, to private alcohol or drug treatment clinics, or to self-help groups such as
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
Additional information on drug and alcohol use and abuse can be obtained from the Employee Assistance
Program or RTD's Department of Administration.

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Successful intervention in the workplace often starts with a frank, firm, but sensitive discussion
with the person, focusing on problems with the person's performance or safety. To deal with the
person's likely denials, problems should be clearly documented so that the person can be shown clearcut evidence of what is wrong.

APPENDIX B
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Many elements of RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy are required by federal regulations covering
transit employees in safety-sensitive positions. Other elements of RTD's policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Federal regulations require RTD to identify which
provisions of its policy are mandated by the regulations and which are not.
The parts of the Regional Transportation District Drug and Alcohol Policy not mandated by federal
regulations are as follows:
1.

RTD’s Policy applies to more than safety-sensitive employees covered by federal regulations. It
applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers, and
contractors. Visitors and vendors are also expected to adhere to the Policy while on RTD
property. (See Policy section 2.1.)

2.

RTD’s Policy contains hours of compliance beyond those required by federal regulations.
Specifically, employees are subject to the Policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, on regularly scheduled days, and when
volunteering for or assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. (See Policy section 2.3.)

3.

Discipline is not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.0 and 6.0.)

4.

Possession/use of prohibited substances, criminal convictions, noncompliance with treatment
requirements, improper use of policy, and alcoholic beverages on RTD property are not addressed
in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.)

5.

The RTD-Union agreements for Union review of the Drug and Alcohol program and blind testing
results, and for joint review, are not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy section 4.1.)

6.

RTD has reserved the right, not based on federal regulations, to conduct reasonable-suspicion
testing by separate urine specimen for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines
(e.g. Valium, Librium, Xanax), nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude,), and nonamphetamine
stimulants. (See Policy section 4.1.1.).

7.

The following tests for non-safety-sensitive positions are not addressed in the federal regulations:
Pre-employment, Reasonable Suspicion, Post-Accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up and Senior
Staff Random testing. (See Policy section 4.2.)

Be Cautious. All medications, prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications
have the potential to be dangerous. Use medications cautiously and always in
accordance with your physician’s directions. Do not perform any safety-sensitive
function if you are impaired by any medication; however this caution should not be
construed to require any FTA covered employee to delay or deny any necessary medical
treatment.
Inform your prescribing physician, dentist or other medical professional. Before accepting
a prescription, inform you physician of your safety-sensitive position and explain your job
duties. Do not assume he/she will remember your explanation from one visit to the next.
Remind him/her of any other medications you might be taking; make sure to include those
medications prescribed by other physicians. Make sure the physician has your complete
medical history. Ask if you will be able to perform your duties safely on these
medications. If no, ask if there is an alternative.
Solicit information from you pharmacist. Anytime you need additional information about
an Rx or OTC, ask your pharmacist. A pharmacist will be very knowledgeable about the
medication ingredients, side-effects, precautions, drug interactions, and effects when
combined with other drugs. Even if you have already obtained information from your
prescribing physician, your pharmacist may be more knowledgeable and be able to
provide additional information and insight. Read warning labels and side-effects provided
on information summaries provided with Rx and OTC’s.
Do not over-medicate. Always follow the prescription directly as written. Never increase
the dosage or frequency of use without explicit directions from your doctor. Not only is
this practice medically risky, but increased dose of a medication may cause impairment
when the same medication used as recommended may not.
Check the strength of the prescription. Sometimes medicines are prescribed in different
strengths (i.e., 500 vs. 250 MG). Do not take a pill without first checking the dosage
and comparing it to the prescription, even it you have taken this medication before or this
is a refill.
Never take someone else’s medication. Even if you have taken this medication or one
like it before, this is illegal, dangerous, and it may cause impairment.
Always monitor your reaction. Anytime you take any medication (Rx or OTC) watch for
any side-effects which could impact your ability to perform your job safely including
drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, etc. Try to get accustomed to the medication first
before reporting for work. The same applies even if you have taken this medication in
the past with no previous side-effects. An individual’s reactions to a medication may
vary with each treatment, the nature of the illness and other medications taken.
Avoid Rx/OTCs that have been problems in the past. If you have taken medications in

the past that have caused negative side-effects, make a note of the active ingredients
and avoid these in the future. Inform your prescribing physician of your problem with the
previous medications and ask for alternative medications that do not have this ingredient.
For OTCs read the ingredient portion of the label and ask the pharmacist for assistance.
Ask for alternative treatments or dosage schedule. If you notice side-effects that could
pose a safety risk, consult your prescribing physician (or pharmacist in the case of an
OTC) about alternative treatments, medications, dosages, or schedule of use. You may

your medications following your shift rather than before.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 28, 2013

Subject:

August 2013 Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve
moving the proposed August 2013 Service Change as summarized below and described in Attachment A
on to public review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. For this year we will continue adjusting
services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a
whole while also focusing attention on the recent implementation of the West Corridor Light Rail Service
and the associated bus service changes. Routine service changes not associated with or included in the
West Corridor Service Plan are necessary to maintain system on-time performance and provide the
appropriate level of service according to customer demand while we will also need to monitor customer
response to the implementation of West Corridor bus and rail service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The proposed August 2013 Service Changes reflect the continued budgetary challenges faced by RTD.
The guiding principles for service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance
service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Extend 8:00am weekday westbound trip from 8th/Colorado to instead originate at Centrepoint &
Sable Transfer Center at 7:21am. Relieves overloads on the following trip at 7:36am from
Centrepoint & Sable. The cost is estimated to a be $10,300 annualized
Route 9 – West Tenth Avenue
School trippers would be discontinued due to parallel Light Rail service. (Offset against part of
cost of Route 100W trippers added.)

Route 12 – Downing/N Washington
Add 3:20pm northbound trip from Downing/Colfax to 106th/Melody, relieving overloads on the
following trip. Cost impact estimated at $8,300 annualized.
Route 14 – West Florida
It is proposed to extend the weekday trip that (in April) starts at Wadsworth/West Arkansas at
6:39 a.m. to instead begin service at Lakewood Commons at 6:24 a.m. Estimated cost are
projected to be $2,600 annualized
Route 16 – West Colfax
Peak and midday overloads are occurring at a level which clearly exceeds RTD service
standards. These overloads occur on a regular basis on the link between Decatur-Federal
Station and the Civic Center. This segment carries a heavy burden of social services and court
traffic throughout the day, with space needed for disabled customers and strollers or walkers.
West between Decatur-Federal Station and Wadsworth, peak period overloads are occurring,
but more data is needed in order to place extra trips.
RTD will add shuttle trips as soon as possible (June 9, 2013) to lead every Route 16 trip
between Decatur-Federal and the 10th/Broadway route terminal on weekdays between the
hours of 6:15 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. This will not only add back capacity, but also improve W-Line
connections for Civic Center with matching headways, making the use of Light Rail more
practical for trips west of Federal.
Proposed for August runboard:
It is proposed to extend peak period extra service to the Zephyr Street terminal (Wadsworth
Blvd.) and to extend one additional AM trip from Golden to Oak Station and one additional PM
trip from Oak Station to Golden. Projected cost impacts for this proposal total $840,000 and 8
peak buses, including requirements for the Golden trip extensions.

Attachment: Attachment A (1589 : August 2013 Service Plan)

Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Schedule adjustments
No cost anticipated

Route 17 – Red Rocks College
With the extension to Indiana Street, the span of service that was appropriate for college hours
begins too late for most commuting purposes. It is proposed to add a round-trip from Federal
Center Station to Indiana Street on weekdays at 5:37 a.m. Estimated weekday cost $5,200
annualized weekday

Packet Pg. 214

12.D.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
Add 7:21am westbound trip from Centrepoint & Sable to Evans Station. Relieves overloads on
both the 7:06am and 7:36am westbound trips. Weekday cost impact estimated at $15,500
Route 46 – Cherry Creek/Dahlia/DTC
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments.
No cost impacts anticipated

Route 87X
The former Route 87 Express had three trips into CCS in the morning peak and three trips out
from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 128 boardings. The portion of the route west of
Wadsworth near Hampden was replaced by Route 30Ltd, which has twice as long a span of
service and a one-seat ride to the center of Downtown, as well as good transfer connections to
the Union Station and Civic Center. Although slower than Route 87X, that portion of the change
has received little criticism.
It is proposed to restore the route on its former alignment, with the exception of the segment
south of Yale Avenue, which was replaced by Route 30Ltd. That portion would be replaced by
running on Wadsworth to and from the Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride.
Requirements for restoring the route, based on the August 2012 Service Recap with interlines,
rounded up to 2 peak buses and $82,800 annualized.
Route 100 – Kipling Crosstown
A deviation from the current route on Quail Street is proposed to bring service closer to the new
Jefferson County Public Health location at 645 Parfet Street. Both northbound and southbound
buses would loop from Quail & Eighth via West Eighth Avenue, Parfet Street, West Sixth
Avenue Access Road and Quail Street. A minor adjustment would be made in the Route 100W
– North Kipling school tripper service to mesh with this change. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100X – South Kipling Express
The former Route 100X had four trips into Civic Center Station (CCS) in the morning peak and
five trips out from CCS in the afternoon peak. It averaged 191 boardings. Its service pattern
was replicated by the Route 100Ltd at all of the neighborhood walk-on stops made by Route
100X, as well as at the Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride. Route 100Ltd is heavily interlined and would
require time changes for conversion to Route 100X.

Attachment: Attachment A (1589 : August 2013 Service Plan)

Route 76 – Wadsworth Crosstown
Route 225 – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline
Cut weekday routing of the Route 76 back from Lafayette to US 36 & Broomfield PnR. Replace
current Route 76 service with Route 225 extension from Broomfield to Lafayette PnR. Extend
Route 225 to US 36 & Broomfield PnR from Lafayette PnR, hourly headway, weekday only, to
replace current Route 76 segment. No cost impacts are anticipated.

In order to maintain connectivity for non-Civic Center Station bound riders, it is proposed to recreate Route 100X via the Route 100Ltd alignment between Ken Caryl Park-n-Ride and Federal
Center Station, and via the Regional routes alignment between Federal Center Station and Civic
Center, with a short dwell at Federal Center Station (FCS). Minor schedule adjustments would
be made. The fifth (final) trip in the evening would operate between FCS and Ken Caryl and the
reverse peak trips would also operate only between FCS and Ken Caryl and return.

Packet Pg. 215

12.D.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Requirements for revising the route, incremental to the current costs for Route 100Ltd and for
special service that is replacing Route KC, are estimated at 1 peak bus and 6 weekday hours.
Gate assignments would be adjusted at Federal Center Station. The newly implemented Route
CS – Civic Center Station to Federal Center Station short turns trips would be reduced where
replaced by Route 100X. Annualized weekday cost estimated to be $76,400

Route 120X – Thornton/Wagon Road Express
It is proposed to add a SB AM trip from Thornton Park-n-Ride at about 8:40am, to alleviate the
consistent 20+ passenger overloads on the current 8:45am SB trip. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $12,700.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
Reduce peak frequency between Nine Mile Station and Ulster/Tufts from every 15 to every 30
minutes. Ridership on peak direction trips averages between 2 and 3 passengers/trip. Savings
= 5.0 hours.
Add 1:37pm and 2:07pm northbound trips from Nine Mile, and 1:45pm southbound trip from
Montbello, to relieve standing loads on current 30 minute midday frequency. Cost: 3.7 hours
weekday.
Anticipated weekday savings estimated to be $13,400 annualized
Route 130 – Yale/Buckley
Modify service through Heather Gardens as follows:
Weekdays southbound, service will operate via Yale and Peoria to Nine Mile Station during the
AM peak and evenings after 7:00pm. Service will operate via Heather Gardens midday and PM
peak.
Weekdays northbound, service will operate via Heather Gardens during the AM peak and
midday, and via Peoria and Yale during the PM peak and evenings.
All Saturday, Sunday, and holiday service will operate via Yale and Peoria.
No cost impact anticipated.
Route 131 – Iliff
Reroute off of Vaughn Way between Iliff and Yale, use Abilene instead. Eliminates
neighborhood impact on Vaughn Way, will better serve future Iliff LRT Station.
No cost impact anticipated.

Attachment: Attachment A (1589 : August 2013 Service Plan)

Route 116X – South Simms Express
The reinstated Route 116X would be maintained as restored; with further modification
anticipated in January 2014, when Route 116Ltd and the Green Mountain call-n-Ride service
can be analyzed. The cost of reinstating this service is estimated at $76,400 annualized.

Route 133 – Hampden/Tower
Add 4:41am southbound trip from Centrepoint/Sable (feeds H-Line train at 5:23am), and add
4:55am and 5:25am northbound trips from Nine Mile (this productive route – 35 boardings/hour does not start northbound service until nearly 6:00am currently).
Weekday cost impacts estimated to be $23,800 annualized.
Route 153 – Chambers Road
Extend northbound evening service one hour later to 11:42pm from Arapahoe Crossing.
Cost impacts estimated to be $14,500 annualized.

Packet Pg. 216

12.D.a

Attachment A
May 15, 2013
Route 204 – Table Mesa/Moorhead/North 19th
Running time adjustment; remove Vassar loop. No additional cost impact anticipated
Route 209 – CU/Table Mesa PnR
Re-route back through CU campus, via clockwise routing along Regent and Colorado to
alleviate overloads occurring on Route Stampede; move south-end layover to Manhattan Circle,
due to City of Boulder installation of a traffic signal at South Boulder Road. Remove the ‘Adams
Circle’ loop and service to Golden West from the route. Golden West is served by VIA, special
services.
No cost impact anticipated

Route 228 –Louisville/Broomfield
Discontinue first Sunday morning southbound morning trip and add a Saturday southbound PM
trip from Flatiron Mall to US 36 & Broomfield Park-n-Ride. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 323 – Skyline Crosstown
Reroute north-end layover/recovery location to Pace/17th SB, FS and remove current
Deerwood loop, due to constituent complaints received; create deadhead for NB to SB northend turn-around via Pace, Olympia, Pace routing. In addition, due to a request by the City of
Longmont, it is proposed to add an AM school tripper on this route by using the current BOLT
block 27 pull-out. Weekday annualized cost estimated to be $5,300
Routes CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver
It is expected that the new Pine Junction Park-n-Ride will be opened during this Fall. Minor
schedule adjustments will be made in preparation for this change. Weekday cost impact
estimated to be $5,900 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow RTD to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to the
former location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips.
No cost impact anticipated
Route JUMP – Boulder/Lafayette via Arapahoe
It is proposed to remove the excess layover at Erie Community Center in the mid-day and
balance the current trips at Lafayette PnR, WB to ½ hour frequency; will result in some mid-day
schedule adjustments. No resource impact anticipated.

Attachment: Attachment A (1589 : August 2013 Service Plan)

Route 225 – Boulder/Lafayette Via Baseline
Schedule adjustment weekday, Saturday and Sunday. No cost anticipated.

Route KC – Ken Caryl/FC/Denver
This service has been cancelled in favor of operating reinstated service on the Route 116X –
South Simms Express. The annualized savings of $70,300 would be used to operate the 6
weekday trips (3 in each peak period) on the Route 116X.
Route SKIP – Broadway
It is proposed to add one school tripper in the PM from Fairview High School to
Broadway/Walnut at 3:29pm (or as warranted by the BVSD bell-times) due to overloads on the
current 3:25pm trip. Additionally it is proposed that schedule adjustments be made to the

With the opening of the West Line Light Rail, three new Call-n-Rides began operations on April
27, 2013. As with all new services, actual operations may require adjustments after a few
months in operation. Adjustments will be made based on customer travel patterns and
customer requests. There should be no additional costs associated with these modifications
except for the Golden Call-n-Ride. Annual weekday cost: $8,025.
