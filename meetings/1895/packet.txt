Federal Funding and Bus Rapid Transit Key Messages
Chair Sisk welcomed Mr. Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, to the
Study Session. Mr. Van Meter introduced Mr. Brian Welch, Senior Manager for Planning
Technical Services and Ms. Nadine Lee, Project Manager for US 36 Bus Rapid Transit
(BRT), who will all share in presenting the Key Messages.
Mr. Welch started the presentation by referring to the Power Point sent to the Board of
Directors in the Agenda Packet. He addressed the current federal funding process for New
Start. He pointed out that in order to receive New Start federal funding, the agency needs
to have the infrastructure to successfully run the program as well as have the finances to
fund the program. Mr. Welch pointed out RTD’s great record with New Start funding,
having received funding for the South-West Rail line and the West Rail line. Mr.
Washington interjected reminding the Board of Directors of the question raised to Patton
Boggs in December, 2013 RE: North West rail chances to receive any federal funding. The
answer at the time was the chances were not good due to the New Start criteria, which
include environmental benefits, cost effectiveness, existing land use patterns, congestion
relief, mobility improvements, and economic development effects. Mr. Welch compared
the ridership of projects in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas. Director Folska pointed out
that due to population density Denver projects are comparable in nature to those in bigger
cities. Mr. Van Meter interjected with a brief background of the FasTracks Plan
Development and how the East Rail, the Gold Rail, and the West Rail were chosen as they
fit the best under the then New Start guidelines. In 2004, RTD FasTracks assumed
$815M in New Start funding for the mentioned rail lines. As Congress is currently
revisiting the New Start guidelines, the Directors have an opportunity to potentially weigh
in on not just the guidelines but what projects are eligible. Mr. Washington gave more
context and mentioned how those 3 rail lines were selected under the T21 funding, which
was valid from 2001 until 2003. AfterT21, SAFETEA-LU, a 6 year bill was put in place.
After SAFETEA-LU expired nothing else was set in place until Map 21, a 2 year bill set to
expire on September 30, 2014. He mentioned the importance of “the ask” as influencing
the new transportation reauthorization bill.
Mr. Welch concluded with next steps: move forward with South East Corridor, focus on
reauthorization of Map-21, and continue to proactively analyze RTD New Start and Small
Start candidate corridors.
Ms. Lee’s presentation covered the industry perspective of BRT. She started with local
BRT examples. The Mall Shuttle is a fast and frequent connection through downtown and
its businesses with a high ridership. The 0 Limited with exclusive lanes during peak
periods have aided in the development of the South Broadway businesses. Other local
BRT examples include the 120X, 122X, and the 86X. For BRTs to qualify for funding,
Ms. Lee pointed out they must emulate services provided by rail fixed guideway systems,
including stations, Park and Rides, arrival and departure information, intelligent

6.A

Mr. Van Meter addressed funding challenges for BRTs, such as the Federal Transit
Authority (FTA)’s definition of BRT determining the eligibility for funding and how many
transit agencies’ definitions do not conform to FTA’s definitions. Each transit agency
approaches BRTs differently due to the characteristics of each corridor and how unique
investments make each BRT successful. He sees influencing policy to enable federal
funding eligibility for RTD BRT projects as a goal for the Directors while they are in
Washington, D.C. He encouraged the Board of Directors to thank the Congressional
Delegation for their support and ask for continuing support by:
 Restoring the original definition of BRT from the prior transportation bill
 Restoring the prior transportation bill option to allow current year or future
forecasts for New Starts cost-effectiveness evaluations
Mr. Washington expressed his desire to send the Board of Directors to Washington D.C.
with a position of knowledge. He explained how Map21 streamlined the process and how
Denver has the only Public-Private Partnership (P3) in the country. The project is 60%
complete, on budget, and on schedule; Congress and other transit agencies will assume
the Directors are knowledgeable on P3s. The House Transportation and Infrastructure
committee has a P3 panel, a group of 11 congress members looking at how to increase
transit. RTD will testify in front of the panel on March 5th for the second time. The first
time was on April, 2010.
Chair Sisk opened the floor to the Board of Directors. Director Walker asked Mr.
Washington if there were other agencies that have the capability and support in the
communities to support a P3. Mr. Washington replied that in order to have a P3, the
agency needs a revenue stream. RTD has a 4 tenths of a cent sales tax from the
November, 2004 vote. Maryland and Charlotte, NC have a revenue stream, whether from
sales or property taxes. The challenge they face is the lack of staff expertise to execute
it. RTD worked with the FTA to properly execute P3; therefore no other agency in the
country knows how to execute a P3. Director Walker asked if maybe in the future, RTD
may want a dedicated bus lane. He indicated that zoning is also important. Mr. Van
Meter said there was no yes or no answer, and that theoretically it could be possible. Ms.
Lee pointed out how local cities rely on the transit component to make progress successful
and how development occurs at the city level placing the infrastructure even when the
BRT is not fully developed.
Director Tobiassen encouraged the Directors to socialize with other organizations and
leaders in order to have a broad base of support and have the message come from other
venues. He suggested meeting with the Congressional Delegation locally for “the ask” and
interact with them socially in Washington, D. C. He noted the possibility of a BRT on

Packet Pg. 6

transportation system technology, traffic signal priority, off-board fare collection,
advanced bus technology and frequent service.

6.A

Director Lubow asked about the possibility of asking for funding for the North West Rail
and other unfunded corridors as part of the rewriting of the policy. Mr. Washington replied
that the recommended asks were determined due to the alignment with the FTA’s policies.
RTD has a great reputation of getting funding since it has made the right asks. He
stressed the North West rail line has been in thought since 2002 and not forgotten. Mr.
Welch added other transit agencies are also strategic when it comes to funding requests.
Mr. Washington reiterated that it is important that we make the “right” ASK.
Director Anderson explained the process Arvada went through from a local government
perspective to position themselves for the Gold Rail line starting in the late 80’s and early
90’s by making land decisions on the probability of a rail line as well as participating in
major studies to make sure the town would be able to compete for viability. She
mentioned how Gene Putnam and the Thornton City Council worked to change the
expectation on what ridership may be. She noted RTD has done a great job at being
strategic when asking for federal funding and how the local cities have also worked to
make sure the steps are in place in order to ask for federal funding. Finally, she pointed
out how Map21 is up for restructure and this may be the best time to ask for policy
changes.
Director Folska asked what the threshold is between a Small Start and a New Start. Mr.
Van Meter replied it was $75M. She mentioned as the land value in participating
municipalities along a BRT improves, it may be difficult to establish Transit-Oriented
Development (TOD). Mr. Van Meter replied that it could be done but with major
investments. Director Folska noted that a developer may find it hard to get a loan for
property in such area and the possibility to explore a hybrid definition of BRT. She used as
an example partnering with Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) with a High
Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane from Ft. Collins to Pueblo. Mr. Van Meter replied that
under SAFETEA-LU a BRT was defined as a fixed guideway or a combination of factors
that support long term corridor investments. Director Folska asked in regards to revenue if
recreational marijuana could be taxed. Mr. Van Meter and Mr. Washington replied that
RTD is seeking a total of 1% tax on recreational marijuana.
Director Solano pointed out the economic development in Adams county tying Ft. Collins
to DIA and would like to see the local municipalities working towards TOD. Mr.
Washington noted that RTD supported the Small Start funding from 124th to 162nd but
going to Fort Collins is outside of the RTD District. If they wanted, they could be
incorporated, which includes RTD collecting sales taxes for the area.

Colfax and how it may apply to Aurora, get an update from the Colfax study and look at

6.A

Director Malpiede thanked the staff on their outstanding work and encouraged the
Directors to go to the Congressional Delegation with a unified voice.
Chair Sisk exhorted the Directors to go to Washington, D. C. with a clear message since
RTD has a great reputation to uphold. He understood Director Lubow’s point, and
encouraged the Directors to advocate for the message presented while keeping ears open
for new alternatives.

Other Matters
Chair Sisk recognized Mr. Washington as a recipient of the Juanita Gray Award. Mr.
Washington noted the award was an agency award for the West Line, not a personal
award.
Chair Sisk recognized Director Folska as the recipient of the Advancing Women in
Transportation in Colorado Diversity Leadership Award. Director Folska mentioned she
received the award on behalf of RTD and the great work on encouraging diversity
throughout the agency and district. She recognized Ms. Laura Kessler, a Bus Operator for
Boulder Intercity, as the Helene M. Overly Memorial Graduate Scholarship recipient from
the same organization.
Director Walker announced Denver and RTD as the host of the 2015 American Public
Transportation Association (APTA) Conference. Director Anderson asked if there would be
fundraising involved. Director Walker mentioned that he will be talking to his counterparts
from other agencies on the details and will know more as plans become finalized.
Mr. Washington announced Ms. Marla Lien, RTD’s General Counsel, was selected as the
Vice Chair for Legal at APTA.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the West Colfax
Business Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD Shelters & RTD Site
Maintenance
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all
documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of
ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to
reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash
receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014
Adopted Budget for local government requests.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Cory Granrud, Park-n-Ride Design Manager, explained that the
West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID)
approached RTD and requested that we transfer 7 of our older
steel “Daytech” shelters for the WC-BID to refurbish into an
artistic, one-of-a-kind functional shelter along West Colfax
between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd. He stated that all of the
proposed shelter locations meet RTD’s typical criteria for
shelter installation and maintenance. He said that as part of
this agreement RTD would continue to provide routine,
custodial maintenance at the locations. Cory Granrud noted

that all glass and structural components will be reviewed by
RTD staff to ensure a safe environment for our patrons.

Committee Chair James asked if short term capital costs and
maintenance would be the same as in the past. Henry
Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, explained that
capital costs would not be the same as we will not have to
replace the shelters. He stated that WC-BID will refurbish,
maintain, and eventually replace the shelters; this means that
in the short and long term capital RTD will come out ahead.
Director Folska thinks this is a brilliant idea. She stated that
the snow removal at shelters is very important; the snow
plows just pile it onto the sidewalk from the street so it makes
it hard or any riders, especially those in wheelchairs, to get on
the bus. She said that she is glad RTD will still be responsible
for snow removal. Director Folska wonders if this model can
be replicated in other communities. Cory Granrud said that
staff is always welcome to working with our communities but
it is not something that RTD actively promotes. Director
Folska asked staff to consider promoting it sometime in the
future.
Committee Chair James shared that in reviewing this action,
he asked for further information about RTD’s policy in regards
to bus stops. He noted that RTD has a policy of installing and
replacing shelters at locations where ridership is high enough.
He said that staff will be giving the Board an overview of
those policies and highlighting possible partnership
opportunities at a future meeting.
Director Bagley encouraged the other Directors to vote in favor
of this recommendation. He pointed out that this action has
similarities to what was done in the Southeast corridor. He
said that RTD partnered with Denver South EDP, the
Transportation Management Associates, and cities along the
route in upgrading the stations.

Director Anderson believes this is an excellent idea. She sees
business improvement districts (BIDs) as another partner for
RTD rather than a private corporation. She stated that BIDs
are working to improve their neighborhood and make the bus
stops a safer, nicer area for our passengers. Director
Anderson likes that RTD will continue custodial maintenance
because she thinks that is important for our reputation.

C. Updates
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD), reviewed
a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the March 4,
2014 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Bagley said that as the Board may know, he and Director James
have been very interested in TOD since they were elected to the Board. He
stated that TOD has really come a long way. Director Bagley expressed his
excitement about the progress of the pilot programs. He believes that staff
has done exemplary work. Director Bagley noted that so much of TOD relies
on local governments because of zoning, permits, etc. He recognized all the
work that had been done with DRCOG and cities such as Denver, Lakewood
and Aurora for their stationary plans. Director Bagley noted that TOD takes
time and asked staff to keep up the good work.
Director Anderson echoed Director Bagley’s comments. She shared that in
the 30+ years she has been involved with the City of Arvada they have
tried to find a way to make the Arvada TOD area into a nice place. She
noted that it was a very ugly area in the past but through everyone’s
combined efforts this TOD project will enhance what Arvada had already
done with Olde Town.
Director Deadwyler asked for the RTD definition of TOD. She also asked for
examples and tours of successful TOD locations within the District. Bill
Sirois noted that TOD is not one size fits all; however, there are four
characteristics that are included in TODs: 1) Compact and Dense, 2)
Walkable, 3) Mix of Uses (i.e. commercial, residential, retail), and 4) Transit
as Central Focus. He said that there are several places within the District
that he would call Transit Adjacent Communities (TACs) where the
community is near transit but it is not the central focus. Bill Sirois stated
that right now a fully built TOD is still under construction. He shared that
development really happens over a long period of time.
Committee Chair James noted that the Washington, D.C. transit system is a
much more mature transit system that has had the opportunity for TODs.

Director Daly asked why there was a project closing delay with the Alameda
Station Pilot. He also wondered if this would affect the construction
schedule. Bill Sirois explained that this was RTD’s first foray with the
developer securing financing. He stated that there are challenges when
working with lenders such as getting them to understand the project. Bill
Sirois said that it is taking longer than expected but the developer expects to
be ready for closing by the end of March. Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit
Oriented Development, stated that the construction schedule is about 18
months after closing.
Director Folska thanked staff for their presentation. She noted that it is not
unusual for developers to have financing and funding delays. She pointed
out that this happened with Denver Union Station as well. Director Folska
requested that staff re-send the TOD Design Criteria to the Board that was
sent several months before.
Chair Sisk asked who owned the property at 26th and Welton. Bill Sirois
stated that it is RTD owned property. It was purchased in 1994 when the
line was built. He said that the community wanted substitute parking for
street parking that was to be lost to the line; however, the lot has not been
used for its intended purpose so RTD entered into an 8 year option with a
developer who was looking to redevelop the Rossonian with the City of
Denver. He explained that this project has had some struggles over the
years but now Civil Technology Inc. and Palisade Partners LLC applied for a
Challenge Grant through the City and County of Denver. He said that RTD
chose to give them a small extension as they went through the Challenge
Grant process.
Chair Sisk wondered if RTD was generally selling our properties during the
TOD process and why. Chair Sisk would like to see other opportunities for
RTD to have a sustained financial plan outside of Sales and Use Tax and fare
revenue. He challenged staff to look at opportunities for RTD to retain the
property to lease to developers. Bill Sirois stated that is something staff
supports and did try to pursue as part of the pilot program; however, staff
saw a lot of pushback from the development community on that type of
model. Bill Sirois believes that there will be opportunities in the future and
noted that RTD executed a long term lease at Denver Union Station. He said
that this is the first option staff pursues but wants to be open to other
solutions if the Board decides to sell property to catalyze development.
Director Deadwyler noted that the citizens of Five Points have known about
the sale of the 26th and Welton parking lot for quite some time. She said
that is one of the reasons the community is also concerned about the closing
Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 4, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

He thinks the upcoming APTA Legislative trip will also be a good opportunity
for the Directors to see some successful TODs.

6.C

Committee Chair James commented that this is a good example of RTD
being able to participate in stationary planning to benefit all parties as best
they can. He noted that last week the Central Corridor Extension Study was
just launched with a public meeting that was very well attended. He said
there is a lot of interest in that area.
Director Folska asked if that was the study about what kind of
transportation technology the community would like to see in their area. Bill
Sirois said the focus of the study is really about determining the operations
of the central corridor. He stated that while street cars have been raised as
an issue that is not really the focus of the study.
Director Folska wondered if providing an extension for the option to
purchase the lot at 26th and Welton required Board approval. Bill Sirois
explained that the extension was within the General Manager’s authority.
Committee Chair James agrees with Director Bagley that the TOD process is
a good one. He said that there is still a way to go before the Board will see
a really good TOD but the Alameda Station is a great example of the
progress of TOD; it could take decades but the step to build an apartment
building is really a move in the right direction.

 CAC Update
Committee Chair James indicated that due to the meeting change, Hugh
Wilson, FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, would
provide the Board with an update that was originally scheduled for the
FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting.
Hugh Wilson shared that at the February meeting RTD staff reviewed the
service changes that are associated with the Denver Union Station (DUS)
Bus Concourse opening. He said that Rob Rynerson, Senior Service Planner,
taught them that it was much more complex than just moving buses from
Market Street Station to DUS. Hugh Wilson stated that the CAC also
received a Northwest Area Mobility Study Update as well as a presentation
from Kevin Flynn, Eagle Project Manager.

of the 29th Street Station which had additional parking across the street.
Director Deadwyler stated that the remaining parking available has fees and
in an area with many low income people the fees are too high. She asked
staff to keep this in mind as they decide what to do with the 29th Street
Station. Bill Sirois said at this time staff wants to hold on to the property at
the 29th Street Station to see how development germinates before taking
action.

6.C

Hugh Wilson extended an invitation to the Board to attend the CAC
Quarterly Meeting that will be in Arvada on March 19th. He said the agenda
will have an update from RTD staff on the Gold Line Construction as well as
a presentation from Trammell Crow about the Olde Town Arvada TOD
project.

Chair Sisk thanked Hugh Wilson and the other CAC members for the time
and effort they put forward. He shared that he had his two-on-one several
week ago. He thinks it is wonderful to see the energy and dedication that
the members have. Hugh Wilson stated that those meetings have been
exceedingly helpful in establishing communication between the CAC and
Directors.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley reminded the Board that General Manager Washington would be
testifying to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Public-Private
Partnership tomorrow, March 5, 2014. He encouraged the other Directors to read
the testimony General Manager Washington sent if they had not yet had a chance
to do so. Director Bagley stated that it provides a lot of in-depth information which
is very valuable.

Mayor keeps calling the Gold Line a light rail line. She thinks it is very
important for everyone to remind our communities of the difference between
light and commuter rail.

C. Updates

 APTA Legislative Conference Overview
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, noted that the Directors
should have a packet with information for their APTA Legislative Conference
trip. She said that the folder contained fact sheets for both FasTracks and
Base System. She asked that the Directors thoroughly review the overview
of events provided. Sherry Ellebracht pointed out that there is a meeting
scheduled for Monday, March 10, 2014, at 11:00 a.m. with Federal Transit
Administration’s Acting Administrator Therese McMillan. She said that the
Directors’ briefing with Patton Boggs would be on Monday evening. Sherry
Ellebracht shared that Patton Boggs had already scheduled 14 meetings with
an additional 2 or 3 left to schedule.
Chair Sisk highlighted that Charlie Cook would be the speaker for the first
General Session on Sunday, March 9, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. He shared that he
has heard Mr. Cook speak on several occasions; Chair Sisk thinks that Mr.
Cook is really wonderful to hear. Chair Sisk also noted that while there are
no formal dinners, there are evening meetings that have been scheduled.
The Directors have the Patton Boggs briefing on Monday and then a PublicPrivate Partnership (P3)/Finance meeting with George Mason University
staff.

 Local Update
Sherry Ellebracht stated that Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, was unable to
attend the meeting due to being sick but provided her with an update. She

2014 but Roger Sherman did not believe there were any agenda items that
would affect RTD. She said that the next Metro Mayors Caucus meeting
would be April 2, 2014.
Sherry Ellebracht shared that the Colorado Transportation Coalition has
decided not to release any additional analysis about the MPACT64 polling.
She explained that they would release an executive summary but would not
be doing a lot of the cross tabs that had been discussed.

Sherry Ellebracht noted that the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) two-on-one meetings with Directors have been going very well. She
said that Roger Sherman thanks the Directors for being so responsive.

 State Update
Sherry Ellebracht explained that at the State level there will be a
construction defects bill presented within the next few weeks. She said that
Brandeberry~McKenna will pass the bill on to the Board once it is available.
Chair Sisk commented that there has been some discussion about late bills
being presented to the legislature. He wanted to make the Board aware that
Senator Jones may bring a late bill related to P3s that would have a
potential impact for how CDOT does P3s but may impact the way RTD does
them as well.

 Federal Update
Sherry Ellebracht shared that Mike Dino of Patton Boggs was in Washington,
D.C. already so he was not able to attend the meeting. She informed the
Board that RTD was just notified that we would be receiving $150 million
for Fiscal Year 2014 (FY14) appropriations for our Full Funding Grant
Agreement (FFGA). She explained that RTD asked for $160 million to make
up for shortfalls from previous years; however, RTD received the full $150
million we were programmed to get in FY14 and staff is thrilled.

B. Recommended Actions

• Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract for the provision of “Group 24” contracted fixed-route
transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for an
amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the
amount of $22,578,190 (option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2),
for a total five year amount not to exceed $107,367,070. In addition, RTD
will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to
be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term,
$4,725,730 for option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of
$23,098,814 for the five year period. This results in a total contract
amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract period
and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the
most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request
for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide “Group 24” Public Transportation
Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on
August 17, 2014.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014
Board Meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations,
reminded the Directors of the four fixed-route contracts: First
Transit Denver, First Transit Longmont, Viola, and First Transit
Commerce City. Two proposals were received in response to
the Request for Proposal 14-DH-003 for the Provision of
Group 24 Public Transportation Services: one from First
Transit and one from MV Transportation. Both proposals were
evaluated and the evaluation team found the First Transit
proposal better from a technical perspective even though it is
$13,000 higher than the MV Transportation proposal.
Director Anderson requested Mr. Abel to give her a call offline
to further explain the cost difference in facilities.
Committee Chair Solano stated that the service provided by
First Transit to Commerce City is horrible. He asked to
identify who “Group 24” is. Mr. Abel noted the name is a title
assigned to this package of service, and the group numbers
are subsequent. Committee Chair Solano asked if the proposal
included new buses. Mr. Abel replied that RTD is in the
beginning stages of a new vehicle distribution program.
Committee Chair Solano stressed his point of First Transit not
representing Commerce City well. He said that he would be
voting no on this item.
Director Menten pointed out that due to legislation RTD was
originally aiming to a minimum of 50% contracted out services
and then it got changed to have a maximum percentage. Mr.
Abel noted that the Honorable Terry Considine, Colorado State
Senator, introduced legislation in 1988 for RTD to have a
minimum of 20% fixed route service hours contracted out,
subsequently amended to 35%, amended again in the early
2000’s to 50% to include all rubber tire service hours
(including paratransit as well as fixed route services). In 2007
it was amended to a maximum of 58% of all rubber tire
service hours. If the recommended action is approved, RTD
would still be at the high 56%/low 57% range.
Director Deadwyler asked for clarification on the Group 24 and
wondered if they were a combination of all of RTD’s
contracted services. Mr. Abel clarified that each of the four
contracts consists of different routes and schedule that RTD
packages together and requests proposals. Group 24 was
previously known as Group 20, but it was renamed and sent

C. Updates

• Special Services 2013 4th Qtr Report
Mr. Abel introduced Carolyn Conover, Manager for Contracted Services, and
Brian Matthews, Special Services Manager, who referred the Directors to the
Special Services 2013 4th Quarter Report found on pages 10-11 of the
Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and
Audit Committee (OCUS/FAA) Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.
Director Hoy asked Mr. Matthews to remind him of when the Federal
Heights contract is up. Mr. Matthews said that it was due to expire at the
end of the year. Mr. Abel clarified that the Federal Heights contract is
funded through a Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
Program Grant (CMAQ) that has a finite period.
Director Folska asked for a definition of operator complaints. Ms. Conover
identified operator complaints as those based on the operator performance,
such as bus running late, discourtesy, or careless driving. Director Folska
asked if the number of rides is increasing at the same time as the number of
complaints. Mr. Matthews answered in the affirmative, pointing out that
there were 400,000 boardings for the year. He also noted that most of the
complaints during 2012 were due to the suspension of services in the
Jefferson County area. Director Folska asked if operators get judged on
complaints received. Mr. Matthews answered in the affirmative if the
complaint is specific to the operator. Mr. Abel clarified that there are no
sanctions to operators if the complaint is due to lack of service.
Director Anderson noted that the Golden Call-n-Ride has been the most
successful and asked about the possibility of being ready for fixed-route
service in the near future. Mr. Matthews said that the subject is an active

back out for proposals as the contract was about to expire.
Director Deadwyler asked if this proposal was just for bus
services and Mr. Abel agreed that it was just for rubber tire
service hours.

Chair Sisk said that it is a great job in his opinion that there were 270
complaints in 2013 out of 400,000 boardings and that the number of
complaints went down from 442 in 2012. He asked for an update on the
Parker Call-n-Ride. Mr. Matthews pointed out RTD’s continued work with
the town of Parker. There was an instance of an operator documenting
fictitious ride numbers. He also pointed out how it is a hard, large area to
serve since a lot of people own cars.
Director Daly noted the improvement on the Belleview Call-n-Ride and asked
for further explanation on the performances of the Belmar and Evergreen
Call-n-Ride. Mr. Matthews pointed out the newness of the Belmar service
since it started with the West Rail Line and how it seems to have not caught
on yet. RTD is considering eliminating the service. Evergreen’s numbers have
dropped because regular riders have passed away. RTD is doing a bit of
marketing to seniors in the area and hoping to pick up new riders.
Director Lasater pointed out the necessity to keep marketing in Lone Tree
and Parker as they are close in proximity. He also noted that he has
received complaints from both areas on the inability to get service during
peak times. He mentioned that the rule of thumb for Call-n-Ride is to service
a five square mile area; however, Parker is 20 square miles. He asked Mr.
Matthews to address why the town of Parker was marketing for the Call-nRide without RTD assistance. He also wanted to know more about the
operator referred to during Chair Sisk comments. Mr. Matthews mentioned
that there was an operator who admitted he wanted the Call-n-Ride to
succeed and took matters in his own hands. He was let go in June, 2013.
The ridership numbers from January to June of 2013 have been removed
from the system. Regarding marketing, Mr. Matthews said that he’s asked
the marketing team to put a plan together for the area for 2014. Since the
Parker Call-n-Ride started, the marketing has been at a grass root level,
contacting Home Owner Associations, schools/teachers for field trips, retail
stores like Walmart and King Soopers, Recreational Centers and other onsite
promotions. Operators in the area are also on board to promote the
program. Mr. Abel noted that during peak hours there is limited capacity
due to subscriptions. Director Lasater indicated that cities on the fringe of
the District have similar issues and to consider marketing to the aging
population as this sector is growing in the area. Marketing could include
how to use the SkyRide since not all seniors would qualify for the Call-n-Ride
services.

conversation within his team. Director Anderson noted that this is the first
Call-n-Ride she recollects that increased the need for the number of buses.
Mr. Matthews pointed out that the Green Valley Ranch Call-n-Ride ridership
went up very quickly as well.

• 4th Quarter 2013 Customer Complaint Analysis
Mr. Abel and Ms. Conover pointed the Directors to the 4th Quarter 2013
Customer Complaint Analysis found on page 15 of the OCUS/FAA Packet
for the March 18, 2014 meeting.
Director Daly wondered on the possibility of educating the public on learning
to identify the block numbers on the buses in order to understand if a bus is
truly running late. Mr. Abel noted that would be a challenge for the
customer to understand.
Director Tobiassen asked for an update on the program to work with
operators regarding wheelchairs, strollers, etc. Ms. Conover mentioned that
it is still a challenge for operators when dealing with conflict and having to
address it on the bus. Mr. Abel informed the Directors that negotiations
with the legal staff of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition reached an out
of court settlement, which includes returning to practices from prior to
2002, including requesting individuals with strollers to fold them down and
passengers with large items will need to utilize the area behind the
wheelchair securement area.
Director Folska noted that the correct name for the Colorado School of the
Blind is the Colorado Center for the Blind (CCB). The School is located in
Colorado Springs. She asked if CCB was part of the settlement. Marla Lien,
General Counsel, answered that the settlement was primarily for mobility
devices. Director Folska asked for a copy of the policy once finalized. She
also asked for an update on the software program collecting customer
service data/complaints. Mr. Abel mentioned that the settlement agreement
includes some new data collection policies and that his team is currently
working with the Board Office Staff to schedule a broader Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) Study Session in the near future.

Director Bagley noted how in 2012, RTD has $10.7 million in service cuts
across the district and how a number of routes were modified in the
southwest area of the District. He pointed out that the current numbers in
ridership for South Jefferson County are healthy but not robust. He asked
Mr. Matthews if he had any general comments on any of the routes. Mr.
Matthews replied that South Jefferson County’s ridership is overall low and
that RTD has made some changes to fine tune and adapt to the community.
The goal is to increase the boardings to 4 per hour instead of the current 3.
Director Bagley noted that 3 is an improvement on the 2.8 from 2012. He
inquired about the efficiency of the Flex route. Mr. Matthews pointed out
that the ridership is low and that Flex route 67 was discontinued.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2013
There was no discussion on this item.

• 4th Quarter Access-a-Ride Performance Report

Director Deadwyler shared with the Directors how she spent ten hours at
Access-a-Ride on Monday, March 17th, and would like to work with Board
Staff, RTD Staff, and other Directors to come up with ideas and suggestions
to improve the service. She appealed to her colleagues to promote the
employment opportunities within Access-a-Ride in their Districts.
Director Hoy asked what the goal is for the Access-a-Cab program since the
program is fairly similar to Access-a-Ride and how should the Board measure
success. Mr. Abel said that the goal is to grow the Access-a-Cab program
and decrease the need for the Access-a-Ride program since the former one
is more cost-effective. Revenue hours were down 2% last year.
Director Menten asked for an explanation of the “assault” category on the
Monthly Complaint Breakdown found on page 29 of the OCUS/FAA Packet
for the March 18, 2014 meeting. Mr. Buter said assault is defined as
unsolicited touching from operators to customers. Both instances on the
report referred to customers who, due to their disability, had problems
controlling their arms or legs while the operator was attempting to secure
the wheelchair.
Director Daly asked about the Access-a-Cab program in unincorporated
areas. Mr. Buter said most complaints of the Access-a-Cab program come
from the suburbs and during games and concert time frames.
Director Folska agreed that cabs are hard to get in the suburbs. She then
asked about what could be done regarding ADA passengers that are passed
up by bus operators. She shared from her experience that at first she didn’t
know standing up was the cue for the operator to stop and maybe other
customers don’t know to do this. She suggested the operators stop at any
stop that has potential customers and ask if they need a ride. Ms. Conover
said that on most complaints, the passengers were not necessarily at the
stop, but were inside the shelter, or behind the shelter. Operators are
addressed to look for passengers at the stop. Mr. Abel added that it is not a
practice for the operators to stop for customers who are not giving them the

Mr. Abel introduced Larry Buter, Manager for Paratransit Services, to the
committee. Mr. Abel referred the Directors to the 4th Quarter Access-a-Ride
Performance Report found on page 24 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the
March 18, 2014 meeting. He pointed out the Access-a-Ride program has
increasing ridership without increasing hours of program.

Committee Chair Solano said he had a few complaints of customers who
were calling Access-a-Ride/Cab and couldn’t get to the Adams County
Assembly to participate in the democratic process. Mr. Abel asked if there
were any fixed routes serving the location of the assembly. Committee
Chair Solano replied that he didn’t think so since it is rural Adams County.
Mr. Abel noted that through ADA, Access-a-Ride operates in areas with
fixed-route service. Committee Chair Solano suggested that this policy may
need to be addressed as well.
Director Deadwyler encouraged the staff to ensure the services offered by
contractors are performed to RTD’s standards as our customers don’t know
that the no show for Access-a-Cab is an independent contractor.

• 4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Mr. Abel introduced John Tarbert, Chief of Transit Police to the Committee.
He then referred the Directors to the 4th Quarter 2013 Security Statistics &
Fare Inspection Summary found on page 33 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the
March 18, 2014 meeting.
Director Hoy expressed how impressive it is to have 250,401 patrons
checked for proper fare.
Director Tobiassen commented that the feedback continues to be positive
for Aurora police officers traveling on the system and thanked Chief Tarbert
for his work.
Director Lasater pointed out how on a recent personal light rail trip with his
wife they were checked for fare both ways and how the officer was very
cordial with two EcoPass users who had not validated their cards. He noted
they seemed to be foreign nationals and perhaps did not understand the
process and asked what could be done to educate riders on this subject.
Chief Tarbert explained that his team is on an educational process timeline
before starting to enforce the validating system.

standing up cue for a ride. Director Folska asked how the paratransit
complaints received are divided up between contractors and RTD employees.
Mr. Buter said 80% are from contractors and that at times there are
complaints about policies. Director Folska asked then what could be done to
improve the quality of training they receive. Mr. Buter said the primary
complaint is the lack of operators.

6.E

• Light Rail Vehicle Procurement Update - Siemens Visit
Mr. Abel introduced Phil Eberl, Manager for Light Rail Vehicles (LVR)
Maintenance, and Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail
Operations, to the committee. Mr. Eberl and Mr. Jenkins went through the
presentation starting on page 37 of the OCUS/FAA Packet for the March 18,
2014 meeting. They also distributed a first conceptual design of the
potential RTD vehicle to be constructed.

Director Lasater observed that the knee to back configuration may
potentially preclude 50% of the ridership as he is aware of many people who
can’t ride backwards and suggested a seat model where the backs could
flip. Mr. Jenkins noted other carriers have those kind of seats but isn’t sure
that’s the model RTD would like to use as this may disorient some of the
blind customers. He said the actual configuration is not yet decided.
Director Daly double checked that the models have no bike racks and the
storage is the same as current. Mr. Eberl confirmed.
Director Hoy asked as to the advantage of knee to back seating as it doesn’t
change capacity. Mr. Eberl said it was a preference from staff and
customers dealing with dirty seats. Phil Washington, General Manager,
added that the maintenance and service done to keep the seats clean is
pretty significant as many people use the knee to knee configuration as foot
rests. Director Hoy asked how the cab size would increase. Mr. Jenkins
answered that the actual size is the same, but by configuring the operator
seat in the middle it makes the cabin bigger and even adds space for an
instructor seat.
Committee Chair Solano asked the Directors to refrain from cell phone use,
including texting, during the meeting.
Director Walker asked about the weight capacity and type of seats. Mr.
Jenkins replied the seats are 2 place bench seats with a thick cushion able
to support up to 600 lbs. as they are also supported from the ceiling.
Director Menten asked about the savings per car. During Director Menten’s
question, Committee Chair Solano again asked the Directors to not use their
cell phones during the meeting. Mr. Eberl answered that RTD is saving 7%
by requesting to build vehicles Siemens has already built before. This
percentage is under budget projections and any customization would bring

the cost up. He refrained from committing to solid numbers. Mr. Jenkins
added the priority is a robust vehicle that is as “off the shelf” as possible.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Mr. Abel introduced Judy McMurphy, Program Manager for Information
Services, to the committee. Ms. McMurphy gave an overview of the
completed work at Sports Authority Field and the plan for validator
installation at Auraria, Southmoor, 16th St & Stout, Orchard, and 27th &
Welton. The new configuration of the Smart Card would allow a contract to
extend for 5 to 6 years with no need to recharge every year. Her team
continues to work with Xerox, the vendor, to determine a solution to resolve
the capacity issue by analyzing rider habits, status of Smart Card recharges,
passes on hold or suspended, etc.
Director Anderson asked Ms. McMurphy how RTD would know when
someone drops out of college, graduates, changes jobs, passes away, etc.
Ms. McMurphy replied that the ride sponsors (company contracts) can
access the platform to change the status of a card. This card becomes “hot
listed” and anyone riding with it will have it confiscated and be subject to a
fine. Mr. Abel stated that there’s an economic incentive to deactivate
unnecessary cards as subsequent contracts are built on past card usage. He
also told Director Anderson that these are some of the challenges his team is
working through.
Chair Sisk said he was intrigued by the progress made and wondered how to
read “going live”. Chair Sisk asked how much of a delay is anticipated. Ms.
McMurphy hesitated to give a firm answer until she had more details and
had a response from the vendor. Chair Sisk appreciated the hesitation and
not giving a firm date that could not be followed through. Mr. Washington
added that the capacity issue is the main factor on the delay and that he
wanted his staff to be clear and transparent with the Board and outline the
potential scenario of a delay.
Director Lasater asked as to the reasoning of a 6 year contract and how
would a Smart Card user know if their card doesn’t work when validated.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska asked for the definition of “Made in America”. Mr. Eberl
answered that in order to be “Buy American” compliant, it has to be 60%
built and/or assembled in the United States. Siemens imports the steel but it
is completely built and assembled in Sacramento, CA, easily exceeding the
compliance requirements. Director Folska added that the Honorable Michael
Bennett, United States Senator for Colorado, observed the need to market
the “Made in America” status of our fleet. Mr. Washington replied that his
team is having those discussions.

6.E

Ms. McMurphy explained that validators are vocal with deactivated cards.
The system also displays a series of asterisk and a red light. She added the
6 year time frame will help college students not having to go through the
renew/recharge process if they take a break from school. Management wise
it is helpful because once it’s done there’s no need to do it again.

D. Other Matters

Director Deadwyler reminded the Directors about the need for Access-a-Ride
operators and to promote the employment opportunities within their Districts.
Director Daly attended the 2014 Awards Banquet of the Hispanic Contractors of
Colorado with Chair Sisk, were Director Rivera-Malpiede received the Community
Advocate Award. He congratulated her on the recognition.
Committee Chair Solano reminded the Directors of the North Metro Ground
Breaking on Thursday, March 20th and encouraged the Directors to attend.
Chair Sisk asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to remind the Directors about the
basic guidelines during election season. Ms. Lien reminded the Directors that the
Fair Campaign Act prohibits the use of public funds to advance election efforts in
any way. This includes communication from RTD email; the use of RTD sponsored
materials, such as postings, event tables, brochures; and the use of RTD expense
funds. The Directors may use the title RTD Director.

C. Updates

• Certificates of Participation Issuance and Ratings Agency Update
Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, introduced Brenden Morgan,
Manager of Debt and Investment, to the committee. He updated the
Directors on the FasTracks financial plan as they anticipate the financing of
certain components of the FasTracks projects related to the design,
construction, procurement and/or acquisition for the FasTracks North Metro
corridor. Staff is preparing for this financing through the issuance of
Certificates of Participation (COPs), with an aggregate principal amount of
approximately $470 million during the second quarter of 2014 with final
maturity in 2044. Staff expects to present these documents to the Board in
April and request through the Resolution authorization to issue the
certificates, to establish the parameters and to approve agreements required
in connection with the issuance of the certificates. Mr. Morgan introduced
Marshall Crawford, Pedro Ramos, and Mitchell Schmidt from J.P. Morgan,
Brad Langner from Piper Jaffray, Chad Fuller from BMO Capital, and Bob
Walsh from Loop Capital to the committee. These gentlemen represent the
institutions which, along with Harvestons, a DBE firm, will underwrite the
COPs.
Director Hoy asked how the recent credit rating downgrade of RTD from
Fitch Ratings affects the COPs. Mr. Morgan replied that it is hard to say as

Packet Pg. 37

this will depend on market conditions, but overall it is not good and will be
of some cost to RTD.
Chair Sisk pointed out that rates have gone up and asked what the rates
would be for these COPs. Mr. Morgan said that he didn’t have a solid
number with him but could make it available. With a cost of issuance of
$470 million, he said it would be at about 1% though that percentage is
flexible.

Terry Howerter introduced Jannette Scarpino, Budget and Financial Analysis
Manager, to the committee. Ms. Scarpino presented to the committee the
2014 Summary Budget Calendar and reminded them of the calendar’s
purpose: to assist the Board members in anticipating and planning their input
into the development of the 2014 Amended Budget, the 2015-2020
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), and the 2015 Budget. She looks forward to
Board collaboration in creating RTD budgets.
Director Bagley thanked Ms. Scarpino for going through the budget with him
last October. He emphasized to the Directors the importance of the budget
and exhorted his colleagues to reach out to Ms. Scarpino if they had any
questions regarding the budget as her team works so hard to prepare it and
to have the Directors’ input.
Director Folska asked if Ms. Scarpino had an idea what might be presented
in the amended budget. Ms. Scarpino said that specifics were difficult right
now but there are a couple of capital projects that need to be straightened
out with better numbers.

• Fiscal Sustainability Task Force Recommendations
Mr. Howerter said that staff will provide quarterly updates to the committee
on the recommendations of the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (FSTF) to
keep the Directors informed of the progress. Ms. Scarpino updated the
committee on key completed and ongoing recommendations from the FSTF,
such as adherence to the fund balance policy, sales and use tax exemption,
technology and energy innovation, and naming rights. She directed the
Directors to pages 61-64 of the Operations and Customer Service
Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet for the
March 18, 2014 meeting for a comprehensive list of updates on the FSTF
recommendations.
Director Hoy complemented Ms. Scarpino on the written update as it was
the best reading in the packet and laid out a lot of items that he had
forgotten. Ms. Scarpino thanked Director Hoy for reading the written
update.

Director Folska made a comment on naming rights, specifically about ING as
they are a fine group to be associated with. She also noted that Denver
Union Station will be known to most people as the Crawford Hotel so it is
important for RTD to differentiate the train, bus, and plaza from the hotel.
She congratulated Ms. Scarpino on the work with naming rights. Ms.
Scarpino noted that Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for
Communications, was in the audience and that the point is taken.

• Fourth Quarter 2013 Performance Measures
Bruce Abel joined Mr. Howerter and Ms. Scarpino for this update. Mr.
Howerter pointed the Directors to pages 65 and 66 of the Operations and
Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration and Audit Committee
Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting for the self-explanatory report. Ms.
Scarpino highlighted some problem areas, such as facility complaints,
response to customer complaints, and the high level of vacancies in bus
mechanics and operators. She also noted that the Assistant General
Managers were in the audience to answer any questions.
Phil Washington, General Manager, commented the areas pointed out are not
problems, but rather challenges.
Chair Walker agreed with Mr. Washington adding that what is a problem
today may be seen as a benefit in hindsight.

• January 2014 Financial Summary
Mr. Howerter noted that his team is still working on closing the December,
2013 ledgers. Preliminary numbers for January can be found on page 77 of
the Operations and Customer Service Committee/Financial Administration
and Audit Committee Packet for the March 18, 2014 meeting.
He explained the 1% sales tax on retail and medical marijuana as January,
2014 was the first time RTD received the retail sales tax. The 1% for
January, 2014 totaled $999,415. As a point of reference, he explained the
state collects 12.9% (2.9% regular tax, 10% additional tax) for retail

Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten asked for a legal update on the challenges for the sales tax
parity. Marla Lien, General Counsel, reported that the measure for
preliminary injunction that would’ve stopped implementation of the sales tax
parity bill was denied, so the bill has taken effect. State is collecting taxes in
accord with 2013-1272 that brought sales tax parity. RTD filed a motion to
dismiss because the plaintiff in the case was a 501(c)3, a non-tax entity.
Instead of refuting, they added a tax payer (person) on February 20th,
allowing the plaintiff to amend its complaint. The motion to dismiss will not
proceed. RTD will be filing an answer to the complaint next week.

marijuana sales, and that number for January, 2014 was $1.8 million. This
number projects about $21 million for the year. They also collect additional
taxes, like a 15% on growers and additional revenues for issuing licenses.
The Governor’s budget for the 2014-2015 fiscal year anticipates $133.6
million in revenue from retail and medical marijuana, which seems a bit
optimistic when using the January, 2014 numbers.

Director Folska noted that the numbers might accelerate as businesses keep
opening and that this point of revenue will be interesting to follow.

No other matter was presented.

Recommended Action
D. Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for
the provision of “Group 24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit,
Inc. This contract is for three years for an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with
two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190 (option year 1) and
$23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed
$107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an
amount estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract
term, $4,725,730 for option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of
$23,098,814 for the five year period. This results in a total contract amount not to
exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract period and $130,465,884 for

the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and responsible
proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide
“Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is
scheduled to be effective on August 17, 2014.

Other Matters
Chair Pro Tem Hoy asked if there were any other matters. He stated that he believes the
North Metro Groundbreaking went well and that everyone was on point.
General Manager Washington provided these updates:
 April 22-24, the House Transportation and Infrastructure P3 panel will be in Denver
to tour a number of transportation and infrastructure related projects (i.e. RTD, US
36 Mayors and Commissioners, DIA). He had extended this invitation when he was
testifying before this Committee in Washington D.C.; however, the T&I staff are
coordinating the activities during this trip and RTD will be following their lead. They
are expecting 10 of the 11 P3 Panel members to participate. He will keep the full
Board advised as the planning proceeds. Director Folska recommended that we
include State Representative Nancy Todd in this schedule as she chairs the
Legislative Transportation Committee. General Manager Washington indicated we
would look at this but emphasized the T&I staff will be making the decisions around
who to include.
 DUS Grand Opening—General Manager Washington indicated two primary events
during this time along with the normal schedule of activities.
1. DUS Gala-May 8, 2014—They currently have reservations for over 700
people with a planned capacity of 1000. There is a cost associated with
this Gala of approximate $100 per head. They do expect this to be a sellout
event. They are not planning to have speakers at this event but have a
video featuring about 15-20 people which they will run during the event.
2. May 9—They will begin the morning with a P3 Roundtable that will be
hosted by Patton and Boggs. This roundtable is expected to run from 8:30
a.m. to 11:00 a.m. where they will walk to the noon event. 2 panels are
planned: P3 Public Sector Perspective (i.e. Eagle, DUS, US 36) which will
include Theresa McMillan (FTA), General Manager Washington, Don Hunt
(CDOT) and anticipated moderator who is chair of the APTA P3 Committee.
Chair Sisk will probably provide some type of opening remarks but they are
looking for a high profile individual to facilitate-perhaps Michael Melaniphy,
President of APTA.
P3 Private Sector—Anticipate panel to include Goldman Sachs, Kiewit,
Plenary Roads and Fluor who are all big players in the P3 space. The lady
from George Mason who moderated in Washington D.C. will moderate this

panel. They are planning to use a local high profile like Bill Mosher to
facilitate.

They are anticipating a capacity of about 500 people which will be by
invitation only.
Director Tobiassen inquired if APTA has any white papers on P-3. General
Manager Washington indicated that he will check but RTD is the national
expert as the only domestic transit agency with P3 experience.
Director Bagley commented it would be nice to invite the George Mason
team. General Manager Washington indicated they have been invited.
Director Folska noted that when they met with Department of
Transportation Under-Deputy Secretary Victor Mendez in Washington D.C.,
they were quite interested in the public engagement component of this and
had asked RTD to provide a white paper. It would be good to invite Victor
Mendez to this event. General Manager Washington indicated he plans to
extend this invitation.

Director Bagley indicated he was at the meeting to follow up on his previous
request to extend an invitation to Tami Door-- DDP, and Elba Wedgeworth, to
attend a Board meeting to talk about the collaborative efforts with RTD. He would
like to see this happen prior to the May 9 opening of DUS. General Manager
Washington responded he thinks this is in the bailiwick of the Board office.
Director Bagley requested Paula Perdue to follow up with Chair Sisk on making this
happen.
Director Tobiassen inquired on thoughts about how to make sure the CAC is fully
engaged. This is a good group of people and we need to be using them effectively.
Director Folska inquired what will happen to CAC upon the completion of
FasTracks. General Manager Washington responded that he believes their role will
evolve as the project evolves into the operational side of FasTracks.
General Manager Washington indicated staff will have a Free Metro Ride Bus
outside the 1600 Blake Street address next Tuesday for the Board to see.

had worked for 25 years at RTD. Chris’s manager, Jack Tommins from the Platte Division
spoke about how he and Chris had served in the army and were instrumental for a number
of years in a clothing drive at RTD for homeless veterans. Jack stated that Chris was a
wonderful employee with a “can do attitude.” He served the district well.
Chris responded by thanking his bosses and Jack and everyone he has worked with over
the years. RTD was a good ride but it comes a time to say goodbye.
Scott Reed, AGM Communications, indicated that Laurie Masten, who was retiring with
20 years, was not present. However, we wish her well and much happiness.

Special Recognition
Dave Genova made a special recognition of Gino Greco, Regional CEO, with the American
Red Cross. Dave spoke to the partnership between RTD and the Red Cross and shared
RTD is the recipient of 30 AEDs (defibrillators) in 17 locations and we have over 200
employees trained in CPR and how to use. He presented Mr. Greco with an award from
RTD for this special partnership.

Speaker “X” who wanted to remain anonymous and stated she represented Lisa
Fellows, indicated they wanted to meet with RTD on a number of issues.
Kira Lapin indicated that she had moved from Chicago where they had a system
that senior citizens ride for free. She thinks RTD ought to look into this system.
Scott Kerr, Bayaud Enterprises, stated that he is a neighbor to the “W” line. He
indicated that his organization works with the low income and they had participated
in an effort a couple of years ago to look for better transportation options. Nothing
came from that effort. Low income need more access to light rail but cannot afford
to ride the train. RTD is making the assumption that all low income people have
access to the organizations that participate in our discount program. For some of
these people, they are on a waiting list just to get in the door to seek assistance.
We need to expand our program to include those who have fallen through the
cracks or on a wait list to see a non-profit worker.
Doug Gragg stated that RTD need to look for ways to bring the cost of ridership
down for the disadvantaged or low income residents.
LaTerrell Bradford was speaking on behalf of the low income people who were
members of the 9to5. She indicated it is a hardship for them to purchase a pass.
She encouraged RTD to work with 9to5 to create an income based bus pass
program.
Ana Claudia Magalhaes, Denver, shared that she was a college student and had
access to a pass that is good through May 17. However, she will graduate and will
no longer have access to this pass. She is concerned she will not be able to ride
the bus. It will be difficult for her to pay off her student loans, start a new career
and pay her other bills while trying to afford the high cost of public transportation.
She would like RTD to come up with options for people like her who will not be
able to afford this cost.
Norma Brombila who spoke via an interpreter, stated that she is the mother of five
children, 2 of which are in high school and another one soon to be. She has to buy
all of them a bus pass and even with the school discount, this is not enough. Her
husband is also a transit rider who has to pay for a pass. This is an extreme
hardship for her and takes money away from the rest of her family or paying other

obligations. She would like RTD to take into consideration an income based
program for low income.
Leticia Bradford expressed that she loves RTD and the beautiful corridors that have
been created. However, she works at Walmart and makes less per hour than the
cost to travel to get to work. She would love to see transit better subsidized for
low income people.
Evan Herzoff from Lakewood stated he has been riding RTD for most of his life. He
left the workforce in 2011 and is now attempting to re-enter the workforce. He
gets a small subsidy each month that he has to make that stretch. It is not only
the cost of the fare but the fact that RTD has been cutting routes making it very
difficult to get around in a reasonable amount of time to apply for jobs. He believes
we need to consider a master EcoPass program based around income levels.
Igor Kagan representing Bend me Arc, a Jewish outreach organization, stated that
they support an income based transit program. Igor quoted a Jewish belief from
the Book of Deuteronomy relative to our personal responsibility to help others. He
believes RTD should meet with the 9to5 organization about transit options.
Dave DeLay stated that he provide rehabilitative support for Bayaud Enterprises.
They are a participant in the discount program and work with low income trying to
find a job or struggling to emerge from homeliness. However, even though they
spend about $45K each year on transit passes, this is just the skim of the iceberg
on the actual need that exists. There is still a large percentage of the population
who are not being served. In the 2-tier program that we have, that second tier has
limitations around how much discount or quantity they can purchase. RTD needs
to be willing to engage in a conversation for expanded options.
Zoe Williams, 9to5 representative, read a statement from James Leal, president of
the resident leadership council at Westridge Homes that represents approximately
600 homes in subsidized housing. James was unable to attend but shared the
need for affordable transportation. Zoe Williams also asked that RTD create a
special task force that can help shape a policy that will allow RTD to be a great
connector of people so they may get where they need to go.

General Manager Washington shared that he participated in a Smart Growth
National Conference in Denver. There were about 1500 professionals from the
fields of education, transportation and housing. He did two sessions, one which
was referenced by Chair Sisk and the other around FasTracks.
On Friday, 2/14, he received short notice to provide a tour for Senator Bennet of
Denver Union Station (DUS). He was able to get the CEO of Sage Hospitality,
Walter Isenberg, to join them on this tour. Senator Bennet was pleasantly surprised
about the progress at DUS, including the hotel provisions and the development
around the station. Although Senator Bennet was instrumental upfront with the
project, he had not had a recent tour to see what great efforts and phenomenal
success have occurred.
General Manager Washington thanked Directors Rivera-Malpiede and Tobiassen for
their attendance at the Colorado Black Roundtable. They spoke to a packed room
and talked about opportunities for small businesses.
He has been asked to testify before the US House of Representatives-House
Transportation & Infrastructure Committee P3 Panel. He will share the RTD
experience with P3-the Eagle project.
Other matters:
o General Manager Washington shared information of the untimely death of
Robert Parmley, an RTD employee from East Metro, and expressed
condolences to the family.
o General Manager Washington announced that the National Publication of PR
Daily has recognized the RTD Social Media PR for West Corridor. This was
an open competition which makes this award very special.

Access-a-Cab Program

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to extend Agreements with Metro Taxi, Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to
provide Access-a-Cab services. In addition, as long as the program remains successful and
beneficial to RTD, the General Manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate
and enter into agreements with each participating cab company for three (3) years with
two 1-years options.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to approve Access-a-cab
program.
Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Anderson passed out a copy and made the following
comments:” I will be voting against the amended motion
because I believe that it takes flexibility from staff to work
with cab companies that are seeking ways to provide a safe,
cheaper, more efficient way to provide services to those in our
community that need individual transportation options, but not
necessarily the traditional way of providing service through
Access A Ride in larger busses.
The federal mandate to provide these services does not
preclude RTD from working with a mix of providers that can
use newer types of vehicles that meet the variety of needs of
our populations that require specialized services. The original
motion provided staff with flexibility to work with differing
providers to use innovative ways to provide this service. It
does not preclude other providers from stepping forward with
a better way of delivering this service. I believe the original

Packet Pg. 56

8.A

I have been lobbied by several people with ideas on how to
better serve the ADA community. I have also been lobbied by
the ADA community itself. Both sides are looking for better
and more efficient ways to provide and use this service. The
RTD Board of Directors has recognized this issue in the past
and I believe that the staff request in the original motion
allows for that flexibility.
The amended motion actually interjects a type of inflexibility
that will not allow staff to continue to explore ways to provide
more efficient, safe, and easy to use service for our most
vulnerable users. It locks RTD into a three year agreement
with two 1 year options. I hardly think that that will give the
staff enough flexibility in exploring ways to provide our highest
subsidized service in a manner that is less costly and in a way
that might provide a more pleasant ride.
I see this as a way to provide a pseudo contract that locks
RTD into three particular cab companies for three years. It
does not protect the ADA community.
The Board of Directors can monitor this process and protect
our ADA constituents without killing flexibility and innovation
in exploring differing ways to provide a much needed service.“
Director Deadwyler commented that she will be voting on this
amended recommended action. She feels we do need
something in place to monitor for our most vulnerable. She
does not have faith that staff will act if left alone. The Board
has the responsibility to monitor before an agreement is made.
She wants to remind the Board that taxi cab drivers are
independent agents. That means they have the right to refuse
service any time they want. They are not under any
obligations to perform.
Director Folska stated she agrees with the comments about
the need to be innovate but RTD has standard operating
procedures (SOP) to monitor contractors. She also wants to

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of February 18, 2014)

motion allows a way to better serve those who need special
care.

8.A

Director Bagley commented that he agrees with much of what
Director Anderson read. We have a cogent and rational set of
ADA communities that staff works tirelessly to monitor. He
thinks staff has the knowledge and experience to monitor
these issues and he will vote no on the motion.
Director Menten asked a number of questions around how can
she get a better understanding of the criteria of who is
supposed to use access-a Cab. Bruce Abel, AGM, explained
that people get qualified for the access-a Ride program based
around a number of criteria. Once qualified for access-a-Ride,
they are qualified for access-a-Cab. We have a 3 step
certification program that they will be happy to show to
Director Menten at any time.
Director Anderson stated that her primary concern was
extending the 3 years with 2-1 year options. She thinks this
ties the hands of staff.
Director Folska noted we already have two directors who have
first-hand experience with the access-a-Ride program and
using access-a-Cab. In her opinion, they would be the best to
update Director Menten. She also noted that Global
Transportation was one provider who went out of business.
She believes that the system “regulates” itself and flexibility
exists for exits and entries into this space.
Director Hoy inquired about the pricing structure for riding; it
was his understanding that RTD pays the cab companies $12
and these companies do not lower their rates. AGM Abel
confirmed Director Hoy’s understanding that the customer
pays for the first $2.00. RTD subsidizes the next $12.
Anything over $14 is paid by the customer. Director Hoy
inquired about the contract term today. AGM Abel responded
that today it is a 1 year contract. Director Hoy inquired of legal
if this will turn this into a 3 year contract. Marla Lien, Legal

Packet Pg. 58

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 18, 2014 5:30 PM (Approval of Board Meeting Minutes of February 18, 2014)

assure the ADA community reliability, consistency and
oversight. She does not see evidence that changing the
language to put defined times in it would negatively affect our
ADA support.

8.A

Director James stated he believes if it is not broken, don’t fix
it. He will vote against.
Director Menten reflected on another discussion on shared taxi
service and asked if this will preclude the Uber model from
happening here. AGM Abel responded that from a staff
perspective, they do not have an issue.
Director Lubow expressed that her personal preference would
be to do these contracts annually but in the face of the action
item, she will support this motion.
Director Walker commented that this motion really does not
save the Board time which he believes was the intent from
staff, so he does not plan to support this motion.
Director Sisk called for the question.

terminable earlier.

From the Floor:

Director Anderson made the motion to reconsider the original
motion as stated “It is recommended by the Operations and

documents necessary to extend Agreements with Metro Taxi,
Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab

subsequent years, hereafter.”
Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow stated she was unhappy with the original
motion. She wanted to make an amendment to the original
motion to add 1 year terms. Some discussions pursued about
what Director Lubow was trying to do. Legal Counsel Lien
stated she could not make this motion at this time.
General Manager Washington made a statement that staff
normally brings this back to the Board anyway on a quarterly
basis. They will have a chance to see how the access-a-Cab
and access-a-Ride programs are performing.

RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working
capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards
completion of the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable as of
December 31, 2013.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to approve the RTD
funding of DUSPA Project.
Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Lubow asked for a clarification of the action.
Are we saying that a loan was made to DUSPA that we
now want to forgive? CFO Howerter provided an
explanation that this money was initially advanced to
DUSPA; they have performed a number of
improvements but do not have assets so we need to
take the receivables of the books. We have already
written these off.
Director Folska asked about the structure of DUSPA.
Who are the representing RTD members and others on
the Board? Director Bagley explained that he was the
voting member and Director James was the alternate.
Other entities represented on the DUSPA Board were
from the City and County of Denver, CDOT, DRCOG,
etc. Director Folska inquired if Director Bagley has
voting responsibility on the DUSPA Board for financing
issues. Director Bagley responded that he does vote on
financing issues.

Director Lubow commented about the 9to5 comments during public participation.
She thinks they made a passionate and compelling argument and we need to work
with them for other options. We need to look to see if a greater range of low
income people can be added. Scott Reed, AGM Communications, indicated that
he, Mike Turner, Mike Washington and others had met with the 9to5 earlier. RTD
has expressed concern that there was no mention of the existing RTD low income
discount program which 9to5 had previously participated in. They understand their
positions and will keep the dialogue open.
Director James indicated there was a disconnect with the people who had spoken
earlier. He wondered procedurally if we could have attempted to clarify while they
were still here.
Director Deadwyler indicated she was re-reading the letter from RTD to Zoe
Williams. It looks to her that we need to review what we actually said. She noted
that many of the people who spoke do not have access to the organizations in our
discount program and we need to consider how we can reach these people. Scott
Reed responded 9to5 used to participate in our discount program but they do not
anymore.
Director Menten asked what the official protocol to respond to public comments is.

Subject:

Budget Transfer for West Rail Line Track
Paving

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of the remaining funds from the Wadsworth
parking structure project to install track paving at three RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
BACKGROUND
RTD Light Rail Operations Division was notified by the train operators of pedestrians’ crossing over the
open ballast area to board trains at three stations. All of the light rail stations have an ADA approved
crossing; however, they are in a specified location and are not being used by the general public.
Additionally, representatives from Safety and Security noticed this action shortly after revenue services
started. As this poses a significant safety issue, we are proposing to fill the ballasted area between the
designated ADA crossings with concrete. This would create a solid, safe crossing structure for the
general public to use as needed and diminish the prospect of an individual tripping or falling in or near
the tracks.
The three specific stations are located at the Federal Center, Auraria West and the Sheridan Station.
DISCUSSION
Work will include the track paving at these three stations along with all required coordination with RTD
Light Rail personnel for site access. Work will be conducted during a scheduled Light Rail shut down or
with single tracking during off-peak areas so as not to inconvenience the traveling public and to provide
worker safety during the project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
As part of the West Rail Line (WRL) transit corridor, located between the Auraria Campus in downtown
Denver and the Jefferson County Government Center in Golden, RTD constructed two parking structures
at Wadsworth and Sheridan. Swinerton Builders was awarded a contract for both structures. The
portion of the overall WRL budget for the garages was $37.2M. The project was completed on schedule
and under budget. Funds from this underrun will be used to fund the track paving work. Funding for this
transfer is available in the 2014 Adopted Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is Recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to transfer $650,000 of
the remaining funds from the Wadsworth parking structure project to install track paving at three
RTD West Line Light Rail Stations.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to transfer the funds. Instead, leave the three West Corridor Light Rail Stations as they currently are
with the pedestrian’s crossing over the open ballast. This alternative is not recommended as it

Property Acquisition for the North Metro
Rail Line Phase 2

F.

Clarke,Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 25, 2014

Resolution
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail
Line Phase 2 from 72nd Avenue to 124th Avenue, Adams County, Colorado and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General
Manager or designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property
transactions.
BACKGROUND
Right of way necessary for the construction of the project must be acquired. Properties required for
Phase I (south of 72nd Avenue) were approved by the Board in September 2011 and May 2013. Property
needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process.
This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff recommends proceeding with the acquisition of all property identified,
subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or design/build activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or the Project Manager to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the FasTracks budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Rail Line Phase 2 and authorizing staff to proceed with
all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law and to provide the General Manager or his
designee with authority to enter into all contracts necessary to execute real property transactions.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2014
NORTH METRO RAIL LINE PHASE II PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Rail Line Phase II; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list
the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation
to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the
authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it
deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the
power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the North
Metro Rail Line Phase II, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a
significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit
from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that
there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in
furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are for the benefit of the public
health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Manager, as the Board’s
delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for the
acquisition of the property and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any property through good
faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power
of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property
owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of
owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties
as soon as permitted by law.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: March 25, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the West Colfax Business
Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD
Shelters & RTD Site Maintenance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of
ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the
purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the
2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
BACKGROUND
The West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) has received a grant from Denver’s Office of
Economic Development. As a part of this grant the WC-BID is proposing to refurbish 7 older “Daytech”
passenger shelters, which currently belong to RTD, into an artistic, one-of-a-kind, functional artwork to
replace the older shelters along a portion of W. Colfax between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd. The WCBID has commissioned an artist to perform this refurbishment and will provide any and all special
maintenance needs for these shelters and other transit amenities (benches and trash receptacles). RTD’s
Facilities Maintenance currently maintains the existing shelters and provides site custodial services.
DISCUSSION
The WC-BID has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 7 of the older Daytech style shelters with
map cases & wood benches, and 2 existing trash receptacles to them for refurbishment, reinstallation
and future capital maintenance thereof. The WC-BID also has requested reimbursement from RTD for
the purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. Additionally, it is requested that RTD continue
to provide routine custodial maintenance at the proposed 7 locations, which would include sweeping,
trash removal, snow removal and periodic washing similar to that currently performed by RTD.
RTD currently has 5 shelters (of 3 different styles) at 7 of the proposed locations; a 6th shelter was
recently removed for redevelopment at the southeast corner of W. Colfax and Irving. All locations have
sufficient passenger boardings to warrant RTD shelters and site custodial services.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements at the
following 7 locations along West Colfax; 1) Winona EB, (2) Raleigh WB, (3) Raleigh EB, (4) Meade EB,
(5) Knox Ct. EB, (6) Irving WB, and (7) Irving EB:. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:






Routine and Capital Maintenance Responsibilities
Transfer of shelters, benches, and trash receptacle ownership
Easement/License Agreements and/or ROW determinations and allowances
Resolving structural design issues
Bus Operations, Facility Maintenance, IT, Safety & Security concerns and/or needs

Packet Pg. 83

11.C

The proposed IGA includes provisions allowing RTD full and continued use of the transit improvements
by its patrons and maintenance personnel. The IGA also addresses an initial 5-year term with automatic
annual renewal provisions. Termination options are included if the WC-BID does not uphold the terms of
the IGA, which includes capital maintenance of the shelters.
An RTD Management Directive entitled “Special Design Requests for Bus Passenger Shelters” identifies a
Board Policy in regards to local governments requesting passenger shelters that differ from RTD’s
standard design. It states: “RTD agrees to share in the cost of installing another type of shelter in an
amount equal to the average cost of installing an RTD standard shelter, provided, that the local agency
agrees to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and agreements, to retain full ownership of such shelter,
to indemnify RTD from any and all damages that may arise out of public use of such shelter, and to
maintain such passenger shelter in good repair and in a clean and safe condition at all times.”
The Capital Programs Engineering staff believes this proposal is within the limits of this policy, with the
possible exception of the maintenance aspect. RTD will provide routine custodial maintenance of the
bus stops. WC-BID will provide any and all capital maintenance, which includes repairing and/or
replacing damage from ordinary wear and tear, vandalism, destruction, glass replacement and painting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD would reimburse WC-BID for the cost of five new trash receptacles, which is estimated at $5,000.
Funding for this reimbursement is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
The Daytech shelters to be transferred to the WC-BID are fully depreciated and have no book value.
Therefore, the donation would have no financial impact to RTD.
There would be no net impact to RTD’s shelter maintenance costs because RTD currently provides
custodial services at the seven sites, and would continue to do so under the IGA. In the long run, RTD
would save the cost of replacing the seven Daytech shelters, which is estimated at $87,000. The
timing of these savings is not known because RTD had not programmed replacement of these shelters in
2014.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business
Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2
trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash
receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local
government requests.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in leaving
the local area bus stops in a poor condition that is unacceptable to the WC-BID. This could
potentially mean the loss of its grant funding. This would require that RTD continue its custodial and
capital maintenance of the 5 existing shelters. This could result in RTD needing to upgrade all the
RTD bus stops with new amenities and providing both custodial and capital maintenance at our sole
cost.
3. Delay acceptance of the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This could result in a

Packet Pg. 84

11.C

possible loss of the currently approved WC-BID grant, which needs to move forward with committed
action by the end of the 2014 2nd Qtr.

Award of “Group 24” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of “Group
24” contracted fixed-route transit services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years for
an amount not to exceed $61,038,650 with two (2) one-year options in the amount of $22,578,190
(option year 1) and $23,750,230 (option year 2), for a total five year amount not to exceed
$107,367,070. In addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount
estimated to be approximately $13,536,453 for the initial three year contract term, $4,725,730 for
option year 1, $4,836,631 for option year 2, for a total of $23,098,814 for the five year period.
This results in a total contract amount not to exceed $74,575,103 for the initial three year contract
period and $130,465,884 for the five year period. This proposal represents the most responsive and
responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 14-DH-003, to provide
“Group 24” Public Transportation Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective on August 17, 2014.
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated by Senate Bill 88-164 revised in 1999 under HB99-1030, revised in 2003 under
HB03-1103, and revised in 2007 under SB07-251, RTD “may implement a system under which up to
fifty-eight percent (58%) of the District’s vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses
pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts.”
In January of 2014, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals
to provide contracted fixed-route transit services, referred to as “Group 24”. The Group 24 service
package represents the re-bid of service currently operated by First Transit under Contract Group 20,
and includes local and express service in the Denver metro area. The RFP was mailed to 14 firms
who indicated an interest in proposing on opportunities to provide contracted fixed-route services.
Proposals were due on February 26, 2014.
The Group 24 service offering consists of 110 buses operating 35 routes providing approximately
326,000 revenue hours per year. A summary of the routes included in Group 24 is included as
Attachment A. The entire Group 24 service package is currently operated by First Transit.
Implementation of Group 24 service is scheduled to be effective August 17, 2014. The award of
“Group 24” service to First Transit as recommended, will maintain RTD’s current status of providing
approximately 57% of RTD vehicular service by private contractor.
DISCUSSION:
Two (2) proposals were received in response to RFP 14-DH-003 for the Provision of Group 24 Public
Transportation Services. Proposals were received from First Transit, and MV Transportation.

Packet Pg. 89

12.D

It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 14-DH-003, that RTD award a contract for Group 24 fixed route transit service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%); b) experience/qualifications
and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal attainment (5%).
The evaluation team consisted of Mike Gil, Deputy AGM, Bus Operations; Dean Shaklee, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Steve Gieske, Assistant General Superintendent, Maintenance; Carolyn
Conover, Senior Manager, Contracted Services; Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services; Zamy Silva,
Manager, SBO; Amanda Murray, Civil Rights Specialist; and Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the two
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Qualifications.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in these
categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by MV Transportation. The
score for the “SBE plan and goal attainment” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD SBO
staff (both First Transit and MV Transportation met the SBE goal) and was then added to the technical
score of each proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each proposal was calculated by the RTD
procurement staff and was then added to the technical score and SBE score of each proposal to
determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted in First Transit
being the highest rated proposal followed by MV Transportation. First Transit received an overall total
score of 93 (out of 100); MV Transportation received an overall total score of 87. It was the consensus
of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best proposal in terms of understanding of the
project, proposed management team, proposed organization/business plan/approach to deliver the
requested service.
First Transit was not the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period
between First Transit and MV Transportation was $66,047 or $13,209 per year. The overall rating
represents the evaluation process conclusion that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal
outweighed the strengths of the MV proposal. While the strengths of the MV Transportation proposal
included, experience with “Maximus” maintenance reporting software and a detailed start-up plan, the
MV Transportation proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of vehicle maintenance plan; facility
plan; personnel plan; and the recent/relevant experience (day to day operations) of the managers
proposed.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the First Transit Commerce City division consistently meets/exceeds many of the RTD
quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured positive and productive relationships
with Denver metropolitan area governments and communities. The team is experienced in providing
service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and, consequently, no disruption of service when
transitioning from the “Group 20” contract to the new “Group 24” contract. First Transit also proposed
very detailed maintenance, operations and safety/training plans; and committed to obtaining the ASE
Blue Seal rating with the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence by 2016. The local
operation is also supported by experienced professionals at the Regional level.
First Transit provides medical, dental, life, and short-term disability insurance for employees. First
Transit pays 100% of the cost of the employee-only premium for medical insurance and contributes

Packet Pg. 90

12.D

$100 per month toward the employee-plus-one benefit level, and $200 per month toward the family
benefit level. First Transit pays 100% of the cost for life insurance coverage for each full-time
employee, and 100% of the cost of the short-term disability plan for each full-time employee.
First Transit’s proposed first year price for “Group 24” is 6.8% lower than the current contract price of
the “Group 20” contract that it replaces. First Transit’s proposed hourly rates for the five-year period of
the proposed contract range from $60.06 (contract year 1) to $64.70 (contract year 5). The hourly
rates for RTD’s other current fixed-route contracts range from $61.97-$69.48 (current contract year) to
$65.44-$69.48 (contract year 5). The total five-year proposed price represents a $29.6 million savings
over the estimated cost for RTD to provide the service.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the
recommended firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in
response to the RFP issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of
technical, SBE and price issues consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and
communicated in the RFP document.
In addition to the hourly costs paid to the Contractor for the provision of service, the actual diesel
fuel costs incurred by the Contractor in the provision of the specified service will be paid by the
District through the contact. RTD will reimburse the actual cost for diesel fuel to the Contractor as a
separate cost item.

The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the estimated cost for RTD to
provide these services would be higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider.
The estimated cost of internal operation was prepared by RTD’s Finance Department and is based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
providing other fixed-route services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services
included in the Group 24 service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating
and maintenance base for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD
operation. This is done in order to evaluate the total cost that would be incurred by RTD to provide
the services. RTD currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without
building or leasing additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the
provision of the services. The cost of providing facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance
base for First Transit’s provision of the services is included in First Transit’s Direct Service Cost as
shown in Attachment B.

Packet Pg. 91

12.D

Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted
2014 RTD budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and therefore, there is no impact on the
2014 budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of service in future years.

ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MV Transportation, the second ranked proposer. This is not
recommended as it does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation
process and RTD’s procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the Group 24 service package. This is not recommended as the proposal
process has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive
than RTD is currently paying for the provision of these services, is less expensive than
the RTD internal cost estimate (ICE) and is less expensive than the estimated cost for
RTD to provide these services internally.
