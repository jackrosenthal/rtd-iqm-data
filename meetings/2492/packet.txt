Subject:

Amendment to Lease for Office Space at Civic
Center Plaza – 1560 Broadway, Suites 510,
605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend and
extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District and CO-Denver Post
Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC
for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5 th, 6th, 7th and 10th
floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center
Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT personnel, Paratransit Services and Contracted
Services. This amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046
square feet to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for
all to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 square feet, base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot, has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of the lease at $21.50
per square foot, January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the remaining 11,423 square
feet will be $20.00 per square foot in the final year). Funding for the space to be used by the FasTracks
program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year
budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be appropriated in future year
budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 2005 the Planning and Development Department of RTD required office space for employees and
contractors to be housed together for the management, planning, design and construction of the
FasTracks Project. Property Management with the assistance of a broker viewed and evaluated several
downtown office buildings within a reasonable distance of RTD’s main administrative office at 1600
Blake Street and adjacent to transit. Several other factors, including cost, network cabling, ability to
expand and public meeting facilities were used in evaluating space. Currently, RTD’s Planning and
Capital Programs departments and IT personnel occupy the space on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the
Civic Center Plaza. In January of 2006, Paratransit Services and its related call center moved into the
building on the 10th floor. In May 2012, IT required additional space on the 10th floor and a lease was
entered into.
DISCUSSION
The proposed lease extension for the current office space and the addition of 3,046 square feet on the
6th floor will provide needed office space for the current users through 2022. The Civic Center Building
is considered to be Class A office space. Current market rents for Class A office space average $24 per
square foot, with operating expenses at approximately $9.00 per square foot for a total rent per square
foot of approximately $33. The lease extension as negotiated provides for a base rent of $16.50 per

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

square foot annually with a $0.50 per square foot annual increase. In addition, RTD is responsible for
its’ pro rata share of operating expenses, historically and currently approximately $7.00 per square foot
annually. At approximately $23.50 to $26 per square foot, the negotiated extension is below or at
market rate.
Using information collected from CoStar, JLL (Jones Lang Lasalle) and other sources, lease comparables
were evaluated. Recent renewal rates average just over $40.00 per square foot in gross effective rent
(including operating expenses and net of rent abatement). As part of the negotiation of the extension
and amendment, a tenant improvement allowance of $1,056,910.00 will be given to RTD who will have
the option to apply toward tenant improvements or to defray future rents. Extension of the current
leases will provide a significant presence at the newly refurbished Civic Center Station and provide
needed office space.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Annualized base rent for the entire leases premises will be approximately $1.5 million for the first year
and approximately $1.8 in the final year. Funding for future year leases of office space to be used by the
FasTracks program is included in future years in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and the funding
for space used by the base system will be appropriated annually. RTD has the ability to use the
approximate $2.2 million allowance provided by owner at any time during the term of the lease
(approximately $1.2 million from previous extension and $1 million with the current extension).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District
and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOPOne Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075
and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the
building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT
personnel, Paratransit Services and Competitive Services and Transportation Contracts. This
amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046 sq. ft.
to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for all
to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 sq. ft., base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot base rent and has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of
the lease at $21.50 per sq. ft., January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the
remaining 11,423 sq. ft. will be $20.00 per sq. ft. in the final year). Funding for the space to be
used by the FasTracks program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional
Transportation District and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center
Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650,
700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903
square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

CEO

Date: July 5, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

June 24, 2016

Board Meeting Date: July 19, 2016

Subject:

Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution certifying easements as necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer
Center project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain
law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the construction of the
Southwest Plaza Transfer project the right of way necessary for certain utility easements for the
construction of the project. Easement needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared
beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may
ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the
acquisition of the easements identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the
contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property,
including easements, for a public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent
domain. RTD staff and its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and
adhere to these processes, which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in
court filing and eminent domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and
right of way plan specifies the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Acquisition of right of way is included in the project budget for the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center
project.
ALTERNATIVES

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
SOUTHWEST PLAZA TRANSFER CENTER PROJECT EASEMENT ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plan;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the easements; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the identified easements and to obtain
immediate possession of the easements; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the easements as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center Project, although financially compensated
according to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a
sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the easements within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
easements.

Packet Pg. 8

1.B.2

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the easements and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any
easement through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such
easement through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the easements as soon as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2016.
