Board Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is comprised of residents
from around the region. Members are appointed by the RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time
to advise the agency on a range of transit issues that affects citizens, as well as impact the region.
The recruitment strategy used to solicit candidates included publicly advertisements through the RTD
website, local publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to submit an
application explaining why they wanted to serve on the CAC; describing what unique experience and
skillset they would bring; listing affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add value; and
providing a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC membership.
A total of 22 individuals submitted applications for six CAC seats. Five current members’ terms expired
on July 31, 2021. Two are ineligible for reappointment, and three have requested a reappointment. One
additional vacancy is due to a former member moving out of the district.
DISCUSSION
The CAC Nominating Committee reviewed factors related to current members seeking reappointment
such as attendance, participation at meetings and maintaining Committee consistency and recommends
reappointment of the three current members who requested reappointment. The Nominating Committee
then carefully reviewed all applications for new membership to fill the three remaining positions and held
interviews with several finalists.
The following current members are recommended for reappointment to an additional three-year term
expiring July 31, 2026:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Communications Report

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Pauletta Tonilas, Assistant General Manager, Communications
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors holds a bi-monthly Communications and
Government Relations Committee meeting. The meeting is an opportunity for staff to provide the Board
with an overview of communications activities and progress, highlighting matters of particular interest to
Board members. Staff also fields questions from Board members or clarifies information as necessary.
DISCUSSION
Below are some of the notable communications highlights included in this discussion item. A more
comprehensive overview is included in the slide deck attachment to this Board report.
•

Recruitment Campaign
Through a collaboration amongst Communications, Operations and Human Resources staff, a
campaign has been launched entitled “Move Your City” to recruit operators and mechanics. The
campaign includes short videos, targeted digital advertising, web and social media posts, on-vehicle
advertising, trades with some media partners and on-site promotion at targeted destinations and
events.

•

System-wide Fare Study and Equity Analysis
Staff has engaged with various groups and community-based organizations through virtual meetings
as part of the first phase of the System-wide Fare Study and Equity Analysis. During the meetings,
staff collects real-time input from attendees via the Mentimeter interactive feedback tool. An online
survey is also being used to inform the System-wide Fare Study and Equity Analysis as it progresses.
Staff and the General Manager and CEO held a regionwide telephone town hall meeting on June 30
to share information with the public and solicit feedback. The meeting drew over 5,200 people.

•

MyRide Card Transition
The agency is preparing to transition from the card-based MyRide smart card system to an accountbased ticketing system. The current MyRide cards will not work on the new validators that will be
installed for use with account-based cards once the validator replacement begins. The Customer Care
staff will conduct the process to transfer MyRide stored value balances through two options: 1)
transfer balance to the Mobile Ticketing App stored value, or 2) exchange balance for paper fare
product. Customers will need to contact Customer Care through a secure web form, by telephone or

Packet Pg. 8

1.C.2

by visiting an RTD Sales Center. The transition process will begin six to eight weeks prior to the start
of validator replacement and will be widely promoted through a robust communications plan.
•

Customer Contacts
The Salesforce customer relationship management (CRM) system allows staff to provide more
comprehensive and robust reports on customer communications that come through the Customer
Care Division. A summary of Customer Care contact volume (telephone, social media, email, website
comment form) and the most prevalent types of comments/complaints during May and June 2021
are detailed in the table below:

May 2021
37,235 – Total Customer Interactions
35,361 – General questions, service assistance
1,719 – Complaints for research and follow-up
155 – Staff commendations

June 2021
39,937 – Total Customer Interactions
37,804 – General questions, service assistance
1,977 – Complaints for research and follow-up

177 – General discourtesy

Most Common Complaint Types
354 – Service concern
233 – Customer passed at stop
210 – General discourtesy

•

Take a Trip
As the agency continues its road to recovery from the pandemic, a new ridership campaign will
encourage customers to “take a trip.” The campaign focuses on gaining more trips by encouraging
customers to use RTD services for social activities, essential trips and popular destinations, and
reminding the public of the community benefits and value of transit. The various ads will convey
lightness, humor, poignancy, whimsy and edginess to give people a break from the seriousness of
the pandemic. Staff conducted message testing with the RTD Customer Panel who provided
feedback that general messages and those that focus on social activities and destinations resonate
most right now since many people are still working from home. The campaign will adjust messaging
to reflect the dynamic changes as the region continues to recover.

•

Board Member Telephone Town Hall Meetings
The annual series of Board member telephone town hall meetings will occur in September and
October 2021. This is an opportunity for Board members to connect with their constituents, answer
questions and get immediate feedback through live electronic polling. Staff will work with Board
members to prepare for their respective town halls.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Government Relations Report

Committee Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) has a Government Relations Program facilitated and overseen
by the agency’s Government Relations Officer. Part of the role of the Government Relations Officer is to
coordinate and develop strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve
as a point of contact for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Below are the notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since the last
Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on June 8, 2021. This report is
reflective of available information through July 31, 2021 and will be updated verbally as needed during
the Committee meeting.
Federal
Since the last Government Relations report in June, Congress and the White House have continued to
work to find agreement on an infrastructure package that will provide significant investment above
current baseline levels in the FAST Act. As part of that effort, the House of Representatives passed H.R.
3684 – INVEST in America Act – by a largely party-line vote of 221-201. The INVEST in America Act
represents a nearly 60% increase in funding through the Highway Trust Fund for the Federal Transit
Administration. Included in H.R. 3684 is $7.9 million for RTD’s Central Rail Corridor Replacement
project. RTD is appreciative of Congresswoman Diana DeGette for securing this funding for the agency
in the House transportation bill.
As of the writing of this report, the White House and a bipartisan group of Senators agreed in concept to
a package. As Congressional aides have worked to developed legislative language on that agreement,
disagreement over the pay-fors (e.g., IRS tax enforcement) has surfaced putting the entire package in
jeopardy. A verbal update on the most current status will be provided during the Committee meeting.
Last on Federal matters, RTD is very appreciative of the support provided by Governor Polis and
Congressman Neguse for RTD’s application for RAISE Grant funding to help fund the planning and
environmental linkages study of the Northwest Rail Corridor Peak Service Plan. Per language in last

Packet Pg. 31

1.C.3

year’s FY21 Appropriations bill, awards for the RAISE Grant must be announced by November 22,
2021.
State
The First Regular Session of the Seventy-third General Assembly adjourned on June 8, 2021. On June
21, 2021, the Legislative Audit Committee voted to approve a request from Rep. Rod Bockenfeld to
audit RTD during the 2024-2025 timeframe. Two areas of study were approved for that pending audit:
1. Financial benchmarks and sustainability of RTD; 2. The implementation of the RTD Accountability
Committee recommendations. Lastly, on State matters, the General Manager and CEO presented before
the Transportation Legislative Review Committee on August 4, 2021.
