BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, Interim General Manager
and CEO

Date: March 3, 2016

From:

Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager, Capital Programs

GM

Date:

March 2, 2016

Board Meeting Date: March 29, 2016

Subject:

Operations and Maintenance – North Metro
Rail Line

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General
Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors for the operation and maintenance and
any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail Line in accord with the Board approved
annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of the North Metro Rail Line.
BACKGROUND
On June 29, 2010 the RTD Board of Directors passed Resolution 10 authorizing the General Manger to
execute a Concession Agreement for the Eagle Project. The Eagle Project includes the East Corridor,
Gold Line and a portion of the Northwest Rail Line. The Concession Agreement also anticipated that the
Concessionaire may be required to participate in other RTD commuter rail projects.
The Concession Agreement authorizes the Concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), to enter into
an operations and maintenance subcontract for the Eagle Project, and DTP has done so with Denver
Transit Operators (DTO). That subcontract does not cover the North Metro Rail Line. The attached
resolution authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and execute all necessary work orders, change
orders and amendments for operations and maintenance services required to complete testing and
commissioning and to maintain the rail vehicles and other systems as needed prior to revenue passenger
service of the North Metro Rail Line, all within the Board approved annual budget. This grant of
authority will avoid the need for a separate Board action for contract amendments or change orders to
implement those Board approved expenditures.
DISCUSSION
RTD had the opportunity of acquiring the rail vehicles needed for operation on the North Metro Rail Line
at a commercially attractive cost and assuring consistency within the commuter rail fleet. The rail
vehicles acquired will be delivered during 2016 and will require maintenance to assure they are kept fully
serviceable. It is proposed that the fleet be utilized on the Eagle Project in the interim period prior to the
start of revenue passenger operations on the North Metro Rail Line as this will assure the best possible
condition is maintained.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

As the North Metro Rail Line approaches final test and commissioning there will be a need to dispatch
and operate rail vehicles on the line as part of the system proving. Certain of the rail systems such as
the overhead contact system, train control and at-grade crossing system will require maintenance in
accordance with safety and FRA requirements. Denver Transit Partners through DTO has the facility,
equipment and labor capable of providing these services efficiently.
Staff has commenced the process of acquiring the operations and maintenance services required for
revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line and will seek approval of the recommended
approach when that has been determined.
Each year, up to the start of revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line, staff will include
the annual amount for these services in the RTD annual budget. Without the attached Resolution,
contract amendments, change orders or separate agreements in excess of the General Manager’s
Authority would need to be individually approved by the Board, in addition to the Board’s approval of the
budget and RTD service changes. Following approval of the budget by the Board, staff will notify DTP
and or its subsidiaries of such approval requiring them provide the required commuter rail operations and
maintenance, and any additional capital requirements for the coming year. This process is clearly
defined in the Concession Agreement.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This recommendation will be completed within the budget approved by the Board for 2016 and each
subsequent year.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached
resolution authorizing the General Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders,
change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors
for the operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail
Line in accord with the Board approved annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of
the North Metro Rail Line.
2. Decline the recommendation and require staff to seek approval each year or for each change as
frequently as may be required.

RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2016
GENERAL MANAGER AUTHORITY FOR PRE-REVENUE PASSENGER SERVICE
MAINTENANCE PAYMENTS FOR NORTH METRO RAIL LINE
Whereas, pursuant to Resolution 10, Series of 2010 the RTD Board of Directors
authorized entry into a Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for the
design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the Eagle Project which
includes the East, Gold and a portion of the Northwest Rail lines; and,
Whereas, the Concession Agreement anticipated the possibility of the
Concessionaire participating in other RTD commuter rail lines; and,
Whereas, the North Metro Rail Line procured rail vehicles through the Concession
Agreement that are being delivered in 2016 and such rail vehicles will require maintenance
prior to providing revenue passenger service on the North Metro Rail Line; and,
Whereas, the North Metro Rail Line has certain other systems that will require
maintenance prior to revenue passenger service; and,
Whereas, as part of the final testing and commissioning of the North Metro Rail
Line rail vehicles will be required to be dispatched and operated; and,
Whereas, the Concessionaire through its operations and maintenance subcontractor
DTO has the facility, the equipment and the labor to maintain the North Metro Rail Line
including the rail vehicles; and,
Whereas, the Board may authorize service adjustments and capital expenditures
that require modifications to the availability payments or other payments to DTP or its
subsidiaries (including DTP’s O&M subcontractor DTO); and
Whereas the Board retains oversight of all payments and their purposes through the
annual budget process and the service change process,
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
The General Manager is authorized to execute contract amendments, change orders
and other necessary modifications to the Concession Agreement or enter into contracts
with subsidiaries and subcontractors of DTP for purposes of North Metro Rail Line vehicle
and systems maintenance, dispatching and operations, up to the start of revenue
passenger operations on the North Metro Rail Line included in the RTD annual budget and
service plans.
Made and adopted this ___ day of March 2016.

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

NORTH METRO
ACQUISITION

PROJECT

PROPERTY

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro
Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the North Metro Project the
right of way necessary for the construction of the project. Property needs will be identified and specific
legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith
negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like
to proceed with the acquisition of all property identified, subject to any modifications or additions
required by the contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 20, 2011, June 11, 2013, and March 25, 2014, the RTD Board approved the acquisition
of properties for the North Metro Project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build
contractor, additional acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the approved North Metro cost to complete budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the North Metro Project and authorizing staff to proceed with all
requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

delay.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
NORTH METRO PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the North Metro Project;
and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans and tabulation
sheets, which list the property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to
obtain immediate possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the North Metro Project, although financially compensated according to the law,
makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the additional
acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
properties.

Packet Pg. 9

1.B.2

The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any
property through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such property
through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate
with property owners, to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to
address concerns of owners to the maximum extent feasible without negatively
impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the Properties as soon as permitted by law.
