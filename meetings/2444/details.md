#### 1. Resolution No. __ Series of 2016, Operations and Maintenance – North Metro Rail Line

It is recommended that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing the General Manager to procure and/or execute any necessary work orders, change orders and amendments with Denver Transit Partners (DTP) or its subsidiaries/subcontractors for the operation and maintenance and any additional capital requirements for the North Metro Rail Line in accord with the Board approved annual budget up to the start of revenue passenger service of the North Metro Rail Line.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, reminded the Board that staff reviewed this item at last month’s FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting.  He explained that staff is asking for the ability to enter into a contract with Denver Transit Partners for the operation and maintenance of the North Metro Line between now and when revenue service begins. He stated that staff has not made a recommendation on an operator for the corridor when it opens.  Staff is planning to come back to the Board later this year to begin discussing operations.

Director Lubow asked for further information as to what additional capital requirements might be required for the North Metro Line.  Henry Stopplecamp said this could be something along the lines of needing additional equipment at the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility or putting in an additional switch to speed up train movements.  He indicated that staff does not see there being any major capital costs but they want to maintain flexibility.  Director Lubow wondered if the same thing had been done on other corridors.  Henry Stopplecamp stated it was also done for the Eagle P3 Project.  The Board would approve any capital costs through the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and the Approved Budget; however, staff would not need to bring the concessionaire agreement for approval for every change.

Director Francone inquired if her understanding was correct that the Interim General Manager’s authority would be limited to the dollar value approved by the Board of $250,000.  Interim General Manager Genova explained for the North Metro Line his authority would cover any agreements, contracts, etc. that fell within the total project budget as previously approved by the Board.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. Resolution No. __ Series of 2016, North Metro Project Property Acquisition

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the North Metro  Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Real Property, noted this is the fourth request for acquisition authority on the North Metro Rail Line since the project has been done in phases.  She stated the properties needed are very small in size and number.  All of the properties have been included within the FasTracks budget.

Director Bagley shared his sense was that the net area of these parcels was very small.  Susan Altes stated that was correct.

Committee Chair Hoy pointed out that these parcels were for items that would typically have very small footprints such as landing pads for staircases.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. Resolution No. __ Series of 2016, Southeast Rail Extension Project Property Acquisition

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the Southeast Rail Extension  Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Motion:              Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Real Property, explained that these properties are for the alignment of the Southeast Rail Extension.  She said the properties are necessary to fill in little spaces along the alignment but are very small in total net acreage.

Director Lasater indicated RTD would be taking small slivers of parcels that were developed already knowing where the extension ran.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.
