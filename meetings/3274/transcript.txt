Special Board Meeting
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I will now call to order Tuesday, July 20 Special RTD Board meeting to
order. We are convened as of 4:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time. And I would respectfully ask everyone to
remain muted unless you are recognized to speak.
Thank you all for joining us this evening. And please note that the official meetings of the RTD Board of
Directors are being held remotely in the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. The official meetings
of the Board of Directors will be held by Zoom and will be audio and video recorded.
The meeting recordings, along with the unofficial minutes of the meetings, will be posted as soon as
practicable on the Board's website. Visit rtd-denver.com, rtd-denver.com. And a live stream of this
meeting is also available via RTD's YouTube page.
Colleagues, being elected as a member of this body imposes an ethical obligation for each of us to
enhance and maintain the public confidence in this agency. As a Board of Directors, it is our collective
duty to our constituents, stakeholders, and staff to conduct our business in an atmosphere of mutual
respect, cooperation, civility, trust, and collegiality.
These are the values we can all agree upon. As such, I encourage each of us to review the operating
guidelines adopted by this Board and to act in accordance with those principles, which are available on
the Board of Directors page on the RTD website. Thank you.
Please note that we will not be taking public commentary during this meeting. Members of the public
interested in speaking directly to the Board are encouraged to do so during the monthly Board meeting,
which is the next meeting scheduled today at 5:30. And for future meeting dates, please refer to the
Board meeting portal located at rtd.iqm2.com. Ms. McManus, could you please do the roll call?

KATE WILLIAMS: Good afternoon. I'm here.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: 13 present, 2 absent, being Director Bouquet and Director Lewis. I'll let you
know when they arrive. So we do have a quorum. And RTD safety's our core value, and I'd like to begin
this meeting with a short safety briefing.
While recent public health orders have been relaxed-- requirements to use face coverings in certain
settings-- don't let your guard down quite so soon. As a reminder, the Transit Security Administration,
TSA, has extended the federal mask requirement for public transportation until September 13, 2021. And
the federal mask requirement states that individuals must wear a face covering while waiting for and while
riding public transportation to include airports and aircraft, train stations and trains, bus stops and buses.
In a moment, the directors will meet in executive session to discuss the third amendment to the General
Manager's contract. Please note that we will reconvene after this session. So pursuant to 24-6402(4)(f)(l), CRS, for consideration of personnel matters regarding performance appraisal process and
criteria, adjustments to base salary and incentive compensation, and draft third amendment to the
employment agreement for the General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Johnson and 246-402(4)(b), CRS, to receive legal advice regarding the same.
I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session pursuant to 24-6-402(4)(f)(l), CRS for
consideration of personnel matters regarding performance appraisal process and criterium, adjustments
to the base salary and incentive compensation in draft third amendment to the employment agreement for
General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Debra A. Johnson, and 24-6-402(4)(b), CRS, to receive
legal advice regarding the same. Do I have a movement?
KATE WILLIAMS: Madam Chair. Madam Chair, point of order. Can we note that Director Dishell has
joined the meeting?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please. Thank you. Director Dishell, welcome.
TROY WHITMORE: He was here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, do I have a movement?
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
DOUG TISDALE: Second, Tisdale.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. I'm going to do a roll call to make sure everybody's on board for going
into executive session. Director Bouquet. Director Broom.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Yes. Did anyone hear me on that one?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, Director Bouquet?

SHONTEL LEWIS: I heard you. I'm not sure if we're-- if I'm in the right place.
JULIEN BOUQUET: Oh, OK.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

SHONTEL LEWIS: I'm looking through my email.
JULIEN BOUQUET: OK.
PEGGY CATLIN: Director Lewis and Director Bouquet are in the executive session already.
JULIEN BOUQUET: The one that Tai-Shrae just sent out I thought was it.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. All right. Tai-Shrae?
KATE WILLIAMS: Director Lewis, Director Bouquet, we can hear you speaking, but you are in the wrong
meeting.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: You can hear the Director Catlin's screen because she is also in the Teams
meeting.
KATE WILLIAMS: Please be aware that you can be heard in the public meeting.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, we'll be with you in one second, you guys. I'm going to go ahead,
I'm going to do a roll call on who is OK with going into executive session. Director Bouquet, are you OK in
going into executive session? I'll just go down to the line. Director Broom.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I have 13 yeses with the understanding that both Director Lewis and
Director Bouquet are already in the executive session. So, General Counsel, I'm going to assume that's
15 in the affirmative. Am I correct in that assumption?
MELANIE SNYDER: No, Madam Chair, they didn't technically vote. So let's have the record reflect that it
was 13 to 0 with Directors Bouquet and Director Williams not present.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right, thank you so much. So with 13 in, we're going to adjourn. But
before I do, I want to note again for the record that immediately upon the conclusion of the executive
session, the Board will reconvene to address any other matters. With all those entitled to participate in the
executive session, please move to the other meeting instance at this time.
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: Hi, Director Lewis. They just moved to the Teams meeting, if you can move over
there.
SHONTEL LEWIS: All right, thanks. [LAUGHS]
TAI-SHRAE PARISH: No problem.
