BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Access-a-Cab Program

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into a contract with Metro Taxi Inc., in order to continue providing a
subsidy for the Access-a-Cab program from July 1 through December 31, 2021 at an amount not to
exceed $705,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Paul Hamilton, Senior Manager, Paratransit Services
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 Minutes
BACKGROUND
In March 1997, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) introduced the Access-a-Cab program
to Access-a-Ride customers. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for
individuals with disabilities. Customers schedule same day trips with Metro Transportation. The
programs are interchangeable for certified eligible customers.
The service provided is not an RTD-branded transit service but rather taxi trips subsidized by
RTD. The current subsidy is $12 per trip.
The Access-a-Cab program is popular, providing 18% of all trips to Paratransit customers.
Expanding on the lessons learned from the ongoing Uber pilot will provide RTD time to develop a
more robust model and a Request for Proposals that allows for Non-Emergency Medical
Transportation, Taxi and transportation network companies to offer expanded customer options
when selecting an on-demand service alternatives.
DISCUSSION
The Access-a-Cab program is beneficial to RTD due to its smaller subsidy per ride when
compared to trips taken on the RTD-operated Access-a-Ride service. Trips taken by customers on
the Access-a-Ride service cost RTD an average of $60 per trip, as opposed to $12.
During the third and fourth quarters of 2021, Access-a-Cab is expected to provide approximately 58,750
cab trips at a total cost to RTD of $705,000. If those same trips were provided through Access-a-Ride,
the total cost to RTD would be approximately $3,525,000.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2021 recommended budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
August/September Service Change

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Acting Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargain Agreement
shared between RTD and ATU 1001, the September Service Change Proposal facilitates both an
opportunity for RTD bus and rail operators to vote new work assignments and the opportunity for
Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations plan for RTD’s transit network. A vital
part of the development of the service plan, involves stakeholder and customer engagement processes.
The stakeholder listening phase took place in April and May and the public meetings phase will begin in
late June. Both the stakeholder feedback and customer input will help inform RTD’s future service plans.
DISCUSSION
With public health restrictions on building capacity and public gatherings lifting there has been an
increase in requests for a return to pre-pandemic service levels. Though current ridership levels indicate
modest increases, the anticipated return to school and workplace planned for the September 2021
timeframe support the need for increased commuter service. The proposals herein, contain a mix of
service enhancements and adjustments that address commuter/school service patterns and contract
compliance, leveraging the resources previously dedicated to supporting social distancing.
The proposed service changes further modify the initial COVID-19 service plan implemented April 19,
2020 and modified in both January and June of 2021. The route services contained in this proposal are
a mix of formerly suspended commuter routes with educational institutions as major ridership
generators. The projected school attendance and the number of requests received for additional
commuter service align this proposal with RTD’s service guidelines.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID induced economic slowdown, the guidance for
the proposed September 2021 service changes also incorporate the Board’s adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle 3:
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.”
