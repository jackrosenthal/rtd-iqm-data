STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy requires that “RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide
sales and use tax forecasts.”
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado
Boulder’s Leeds School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model
reports in March and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and Five-Year
Financial Forecast. The provision of the forecast model report is followed by a presentation to the
Finance and Planning Committee by CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The September 2025 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2026 Budget. The attached
September 2025 forecast model report reflects a change from the March 2025 forecast in RTD’s sales
and use taxes as follows:

“The decision to ease reflected a "shift in the
balance of risks" with the Committee believing
that the "downside risks to employment have
risen." While inflation has ticked up since the
spring, a development acknowledged in the
post-meeting statement, job growth has
downshifted sharply and the unemployment rate
has risen to the top end of the Committee's
central tendency range consistent with full
employment.”

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The economy generally posted slower growth in the first half of 2025, but GDP, income, and
employment growth remained positive at the midpoint of the year. The economy posted a decrease
in gross domestic product of 0.5% in Q1 2025, driven by a sharp increase in imports and inventories
as companies tried to get ahead of anticipated tariffs. GDP rebounded in Q2, rising at an annualized
rate of 3.3%, with more modest growth projected in the second half of the year. Employment
slowed in 2025 with the U.S. adding an average of 74,800 jobs per month through August compared
to 143,000 during the same period in 2024. National employment increased by 1.5 million jobs yearover-year in August, up 0.9%, personal income rose 5% in July, and inflation increased 2.7%.
Consumption remained soft in Colorado in the first half of 2025, which is also reflected in RTD’s sales
and use taxes. The short-term economic outlook is clouded by uncertainty around the impacts of
tariffs, a federal restructuring, interest rates, and inflation, leading to an expectation of slower
economic growth in 2025 and 2026.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
by age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•

•

Economic measurement largely reflects history—activity that has already occurred. GDP is
reported through Q2 2025; personal income is available through July 2025; and
employment, inflation, and retail sales are available through July 2025. While so much
attention has been on the impact of tariffs and the federal structuring, few economic
datapoints have had time to measure the effects. Some leading, but imperfect, indicators
include consumer and business confidence surveys, the equity markets, surveys of
purchasing managers, building permits, and others.
Inflation remained below 3% in the first half of the year nationally (2.6%), and Denver MSA
(2.3%) inflation remained below national inflation.

Executive Summary

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•
•

Other economic conditions point to continued, but slower growth for the year: GDP,
employment, wages, personal income, consumption, and retail sales.
Based on Moody’s Analytics’ baseline scenario, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP is projected to
increase 1.6% in 2025. National retail sales are projected to grow 2.8% in 2025.
Nationally and locally, employment continued to post new record levels in 2025, but growth
is occurring at slower rates. Colorado employment growth slowed to 0.6% in July 2025,
ranking the state 38th nationally.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•
•

•

•

•

•

•
•

•

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but grew
19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022. Revenue growth slowed in 2023 to 0.3%, to total $858.1
million, and declined by a small margin in 2024 (-0.1%, -721,777) due to a decrease in use
taxes. Revenue is projected to increase by 1.1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026.
Reflecting on the forecast error for the first half of the year, the Q1 forecast was low by 1.2%
and the Q2 forecast had an error of 0.0%.
Colorado employment is projected to post very modest (sub-1%) growth in 2025 and 2026
under the modeled scenario. Personal income continues to grow moderately for the next
two years and outperforms inflation.
Indicating loosening in the tight labor market, the national unemployment rate was 4.2% in
July 2025. The rate remained between 4% and 4.2% for 15 consecutive months. The
unemployment rate in Colorado was 4.5% in July 2025.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The 67% upperand lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind economic conditions that
pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast. The mean forecast for 2025 of
$867 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $840 million on the low side and
$894 million for the upper bound. The mean forecast for 2026 is $877 million, with a lower
bound of $809 million and an upper bound of $945 million.
Notable local headwinds include slow net migration, high office vacancy, and slow job
growth. Macroeconomic headwinds include tariffs, federal restructuring, immigration policy,
and consumer confidence.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 81
times and below the actual revenue 96 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.83%.
RTD Government Relations did not report pending or recently enacted legislation that would
have a direct impact on RTD sales and use tax collection as of September 3, 2025.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

•

•

•
•

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
The BRD selected the Moody’s Baseline scenario as the underlying macroeconomic condition
applied to the RTD baseline forecast. This scenario is constructed with a 50% probability that
the economy performs better and a 50% probability that it performs worse. The research
team believed this scenario adequately captures the current economic situation, but
acknowledges downside risks to the outlook.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 25.3%
between 2024 and 2030, reaching $1.1 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon. The
September 2025 medium-term forecast is lower than the March 2025 forecast; 2030 is
lower by 1% and the cumulative revenue projection is down by 1.2%.
A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 6.8% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon, and the 2030 total is 7.5% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 2.8% below the baseline scenario.
Climate change is a direct assumption within the Moody’s Analytics scenario. According to
Moody’s, “The baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent
with a weighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including
those from the Network for Greening the Financial System.”

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After average annual revenue growth rates of 4.9% for the 10-year period ending in 2025 (in
current, nominal dollars), revenue projections for the next three decades average 2.9%
(2026–2035), 2.2% (2036–2045), and 3.2% (2046–2055); the 30-year average is 2.9% (2026–
2055).
The long-term forecast generally moderated in the September 2025 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

Medium-Term Outlook

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2025), medium term (2030), and long term (2055).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.
The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since the project’s inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
For this update, RTD revenue data was available through June 2025; state retail sales and state
taxable sales were available through May 2025; and District taxable sales were available through
May 2025. Data after these dates represent forecasts. Revenue from medical and retail marijuana
sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to accommodate the gap
year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As
such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues excluding retail marijuana
taxes. Therefore, these data are actual RTD taxable sales excluding marijuana sales. However, the
forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues.
This construction was necessary to produce a series without the discontinuity over the period from
July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. The category was merged with All Other General
Merchandise Stores in 2022. This broader category represented 8.5% of the total sales taxes
collected in 2023.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term
Short-Term Forecasts

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in August 2025, with much of the data current through Q2 2025. RTD revenue data were
provided through June 2025, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were current through May
2025. Some data have a longer lag (e.g., state GDP is available through Q1 2025). All reported data
after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the Baseline Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show an economy that continues to grow, but
some of these indicators (e.g., employment) show only modest growth. The rising unemployment
rate signals a loosening labor market, with the rate rising from 3.3% in 2023 to 4.3% in 2024, 4.5% in
2025, easing to 4.3% in 2026. Personal income grows at a moderate rate—5.8% in 2025 and 5.9% in
2026, posting both nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) growth. The Denver-Aurora-Lakewood
consumer price index is projected to increase 2.2% in 2025 before increasing to 3.2% in 2026. (A
longer note about inflation can be found in Appendix A.)

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in
2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales slowed rapidly to 1% in 2023 and 0.5% in 2024.
Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020; rebounding 19.8% in 2021 and 13.2% in
2022; and slowing to 0.8% in 2023 and 0.4% in 2024. Revenue is projected to increase 1.2% in 2025
and 0.3% in 2026. Note that the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana revenue) to
impute taxable retail sales in the seven-county RTD district because retail marijuana is no longer

Summary: RTD posted growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, but revenue growth slowed sharply
in 2023 (0.3%) and 2024 (-0.8%). Growth is expected to remain modest over the next two years,
increasing 1.1% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district,
but those purchasing taxable goods outside the district, are required to pay a use tax on these
purchases at the same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in
2015, but increased 7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and
20.4% in 2020. Use taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%, but fell 5.8% in
2023 and 7% in 2024. The forecast calls for a rebound in 2025 (0.2%) and 2026 (15.4%). The volatility
of use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data. The rebound in use tax revenue likely
reflects modeled growth off the much smaller base of activity recorded for the past two years, but
there remain downside risks to equipment, vehicles, and building that could suppress growth.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2025. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $840 million and as
high as $894 million for 2025. The 2025 lower and upper bounds range –3.2% to +3.1% relative to
the medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2026 with greater uncertainty. The 2026
upper- and lower-bound estimates are -7.8% and +7.7% different than the medium baseline
forecast, showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic
that revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

volatility was unmatched from 2020-2022. For the remainder of the short-term forecast (through
2026), year-over-year growth will range between -0.5% and 3.5%.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2030. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the baseline scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total tax revenues are
projected to grow by 25.3% from the end of 2024 to 2030.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (6 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 34.7% increase from

2024-2030. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario has pronounced growth in 2027,
followed by a convergence in growth rates by the end of the horizon. In the second alternative, in
which the economy grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 21.2% increase between 2024 and
2030, with slower growth recorded through 2026. The differences in the cumulative revenue from
2024 to 2030 illustrate the impact of slower and faster growth in the short run. Seemingly small
differences in growth rates have large cumulative effects. The optimistic scenario produces
cumulative (2024-2030) revenue $390 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic
scenario produces cumulative revenue $163 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative
scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy
and may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2030. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The RTD baseline scenario was constructed using the Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” for the U.S.
macroeconomy. Moody’s Baseline is constructed with a 50% probability that the economy performs
better and a 50% probability that it performs worse.
Near-term growth is dampened by policy uncertainty, though a stronger rebound is projected for
2027. Monetary policy assumes the Fed will steadily reduce interest rates to 3% by the end of 2026.
The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to average 4.3% in Q3 2025, remaining near this throughout
the next decade. Global oil prices are lower, while U.S. natural gas prices are higher than expected.
Tariff assumptions have improved due trade deals with Canada, and Mexico; however, global tariffs
are still expected. Key risks include persistent inflation and job growth leading to slower-thanexpected interest rate cuts or rate hikes by the Fed, geopolitical instability affecting oil prices, weak
consumer confidence, unanticipated financial system volatility, and a potential wage-price spiral.
In this scenario, real GDP is expected to grow 1.6% in 2025 and 1.4% in 2026. Inflation rose to 4.1%
in 2023 and 3% in 2024. The CPI is projected to increase 2.8% in 2025 and 3.2% in 2026. Employment
is projected to pull back slightly in 2025 and 2026 in this scenario.

Colorado retail sales, which is broader than taxable sales, grew 4.9% in 2020, despite the recession,
and grew 17% in 2021. Growth remained strong in 2022 (9.4%) but slowed sharply in 2023 (1.4%)
and 2024 (0.4%). Accelerating growth is projected for 2025 (4.6%) and 2026 (4%); the simple average
of 4.3% is projected for the medium-term forecast horizon. In the medium-term forecast, state retail
sales growth outperforms the nation in many years of the forecast period.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 5.8% in 2025. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2025 increases to 4.6% for the year, and total employment growth remains
slow.

RTD use tax revenue fell 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020 but rebounded 17% in 2021 and 9.7% in
2022. Use taxes decreased in 2023 by 5.8% and in 2024 by 7%, illustrating the volatility of this series.
An increase of 0.2% is projected in 2025, followed by 15.4% growth in 2026. Simple average growth
of 6% is projected over the medium-term forecast horizon through 2030. With 90% of RTD tax
revenues coming from sales taxes, the yearly changes in total revenues closely track those for
sales tax revenues.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
The RTD Optimistic Scenario was constructed using Moody’s “S1: Alternative Scenario 1 – Upside –
10th Percentile”. There is a 10% probability that the economy will perform better and a 90%
probability that it will underperform. In this scenario, the economy continues on a moderate growth
path. The impact from tariffs is reduced in 2026, and the geopolitical tensions diminish. The
economy remains at full employment and the unemployment rate remains stable.
Real GDP grows 1.9% in 2025 and 3% in 2026. The unemployment rate increases a tenth of a percent
in 2025 to 4.1%, but decreases to 3.7% in 2026. Retail sales are projected to grow 3.6% in 2025 and
5.4% in 2026 in this scenario.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 25.3% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2024 to 2030. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
8.9% in RTD revenues for the 2024−2030 forecast period and a 42.1% increase in the high-range
forecast.

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues approach $1.2 billion in 2030, which is 7.5% above
the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster
than the baseline projections early in the forecast. Total revenues grow by 34.7% between 2024 and
2030. Cumulative revenues from 2024-2030 are 6.8%, or $390 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. Scenario S3 depicts a
severe downside economic forecast driven by significantly worse-than-expected consequences from
federal policies (immigration and tariffs). In this scenario, the Fed will have to raise the interest rate
to offset inflation. Geopolitical risks exacerbate the situation. In this scenario, the economy falls into
recession in Q4 2025, with unemployment peaking at 8.4% in Q4 2026. The economy begins to
recover in Q3 2026 but doesn't reach full employment until Q2 2030. Fiscal policy largely mirrors the
baseline, but the larger deficit adds to uncertainty.
Real GDP grows 1.4% in 2025 but falls 1.7% in 2026 before returning to annual growth.

below the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields growth rates lower
than the baseline scenario in 2025 and 2026, then converges with the growth rates in the baseline
projections through 2030. Total revenues grow by 21.2% between 2024 and 2030. Cumulative

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 25.3% to $1.07 billion in the medium term (through
2030). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, growing to
$1.04 billion by 2030, netting 21.2% growth over the period. The optimistic scenario records growth
that results in an increase of 34.7% over the period, to $1.16 billion, outperforming growth early in
the forecast horizon.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues through 2030.
During this period, the economy faces short-term volatility that impacts RTD revenue. After 2025,
RTD revenue is expected to record moderate growth, achieving an overall increase of 25.3%
between 2024 and 2030, increasing to $1.1 billion in 2030.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: The September 2025 long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of
the forecast horizon, which slows in the second decade, followed by moderate growth in the final
decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are
projected to grow by 2.7% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is
0.4%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2026–2035, 2036–2045, and 2046–2055.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline
from 46.2% in 2010 to 43.9% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output
between now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 44.8% by 2055.
However, total population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real
output growth rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2016–2025 and from 2036–
2045. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2055.

with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2030.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next two
decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 0.6% average growth and the
Moody’s model projects 2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon, largely driven by demographic changes.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales (Tables 23 and 24 report
rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales, as shown in the following tables and figures.

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through June 2025, allowing for error evaluation
through the second quarter of 2025. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been
above the actual revenue 81 times and below the actual revenue 96 times, and a simple average of
the error has been -0.83%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings
during and following the pandemic recession). The March 2025 forecast for Q1 was low by 1.2%, and
the forecast for Q2 2025 was essentially spot on (0.0% difference). The cumulative revenue in 2025
and 2026 was revised up by 1% from the March 2025 forecast to the September forecast, but the
timing shifted with slightly stronger growth in 2025 and weaker growth in 2026. There is no
comparison for the 30-year forecast since the forecast horizon was extended to 2055 in this update
(previously 2050); however, the long-term forecast has generally moderated.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2025-2026), medium term (2030), and long term (2055). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office (SDO). The SDO forecasts are available through 2050, so the BRD created a univariate model
to extend state population by age five more years through 2055. Colorado economy forecasts are
derived from updated specifications of the Colorado Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left-hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the righthand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right-hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore, the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts
in these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model

previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two
terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such
as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:

Linkages between National, State, and District Economic Variables

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation had an impact on the RTD forecast. The real-dollar RTD forecast is constructed as
nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous decade, the

inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually. Market disruptions and supply-chain
discord create additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. While price growth improved,
prices were stuck between 3% and 4% for 13 consecutive months before dropping below 3% in July
2024. Prices grew 2.7% year-over-year in July 2025.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022, 4.1% in
2023, and 2.9% in 2024; and a Denver metro area inflation rate of 8% in 2022, 5.2% in 2023, and
2.3% in 2024.
The medium-term inflation rate (consumer price index) is generated by the model. This is an
informational number, and is not a driving variable within the RTD revenue forecast. It is constructed
at a high level (overall price growth, not by component) using the relationships between local and
national inflation. It should be noted that for 11 of the past 15 years, the Denver MSA has recorded
higher rates of growth in prices than the national average, the MSA tied the national rate one year,
and had lower inflation three years (including in 2024). The housing component of CPI represents
45.1% of the basket of goods and services in the inflation measurement, and the Denver-AuroraLakewood region recorded 1.7% growth in housing inflation in July 2025 (compared to 3.9% growth
in the U.S. City Average).
The model projects the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood consumer price index to re-accelerate in 2026
before moderating to levels between 2% and 3% for the medium-term horizon.
The BRD team will continue to monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when
sufficient evidence emerges to suggest changing inflation expectations.

The Input Data—Sources and Description

National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The national and Colorado sales values are not seasonally
adjusted, and the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized to
show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at the
same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level of
trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2023, the opposite
was true.
Figure 10

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters the
equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion

This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:
Bureau of Labor Statistics, www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax

of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the
forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecasted
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three

rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working-age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and is
negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working-age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2055. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2025–2030 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier

determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. However, differences in population growth rates and age distribution
for the nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical
levels. The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income
growth in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing
growth of this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth
in Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and consequently, RTD taxable sales. On the other
hand, moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable
sales, offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other
sales and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2024 and showed slower net migration to the state and the district. In 2025, the U.S. Census
Bureau released updated estimates for population growth through 2024, including net migration
and the national increase. These estimates were incorporated into the model, and adjustments were
made to the short-term population growth forecasts.
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and, therefore,
in sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat. The chart below presents population forecasts from the State
Demography Office.

sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2024 are
historical observations, while data from 2025 to 2055 represent forecasts.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratios for the district and state increase throughout the forecast horizon,
but Colorado and the district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2040, then a rise from 2040 to 2045, followed by a modest decline to
2050.

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of the Economy

Summary: In the second quarter of 2025, the national economic outlook remained ambiguous.
Uncertainty driven by federal policy decisions has elevated the risks of inflation, consumer prices,
and costs for American businesses. Recessionary fears are not as intense compared to the midpoint
of the first quarter, but declining consumer sentiment and ongoing volatility in global financial
markets are still worrisome. Looking ahead, key factors such as tariffs and inflationary pressures are
likely to shape the trajectory of U.S. economic growth. In this uncertain environment, the Federal
Reserve is expected to maintain a cautious stance on interest rates, raising questions about the
resilience of U.S. consumers and the economy.
Gross Domestic Product
National real GDP increased 2.1% year-over-year in Q2 2025, with real GDP increasing at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 3.3%, up from -0.5% in Q1 2025. Personal consumption expenditures
showed resilience, increasing by 0.5% in Q1 2025 and 1.6% in Q2 2025. Gross private domestic
investment fell 13.8% in Q2. Government consumption remained generally strong in 2024; however,
the trade deficit has been elevated in recent quarters. Real GDP is expected to modestly increase
throughout the rest of 2025. In Q1 2025 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP decreased at
an annualized rate of 0.4% quarter-over-quarter (ranked 19th) and 2% year-over-year (ranked 23rd).
Figure 18: United States Real Gross Domestic Product

Confidence
National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been low since
the beginning of 2025. Due to much uncertainty, in Q2 2025, the index was only eight points higher
than the COVID-19 recession. Due to continued uncertainty regarding tariffs, concerns about

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

saving rate, and politics.

Jobless Claims
Initial jobless claims totaled 235,000 nationally the week August 16, 2025, 3,000 higher than the
same period in 2024. Continued claims nationally totaled approximately 2 million in August, up
100,000 year-over-year. National federal (UCFE) claims are elevated from the prior year. The 2,723
initial jobless claims in Colorado filed the week ending August 9, 2025, were down 4.8% year-overyear. Continued claims in the state also rose year-over-year, up 18%, and was 0.7% above the alltime average.

Employment and Wages
Employment slowed in 2025 with the U.S. adding an average of 74,800 jobs per month through
August compared to 143,000 during the same period in 2024. Employment as of August 2025 sat at
159.5 million.

The national unemployment rate increased slightly from August 2024 to August 2025, increasing to
4.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in Colorado decreased to
4.5% in July 2025, ranking 37th in the nation. The rate increased 0.2% since January 2025.
Colorado employment grew by just 0.6% year-over-year in July 2025. Colorado added an average of
1,400 jobs per month through July, compared to 2,200 during the same period in 2024. The state is
projected to add just 22,000 jobs in 2025, according to the midyear Colorado Business Economic

By industry in Colorado, the most jobs added in July 2025 were Government, Leisure and Hospitality,
and Education and Health Services. Job losses occurred in five sectors: Trade, Transportation, and
Utilities; Financial Activities; Professional and Business Services; Other Services; and Construction.

National job openings are up slightly compared to last year, totaling 7.4 million openings in June
2025, a year-over-year increase of 0.3%. Colorado’s job opening rate of 4.4%, tied for the 30th in the
nation in June 2025. The state reportedly had 136,000 job openings and 155,270 unemployed
individuals in June, resulting in a ratio of 1.1 job openings per unemployed person in the state,
higher than the ratio of 0.9 in the nation over the same period.

Real Estate
Residential real estate price growth has slowed in Colorado in recent months. The most recent data
from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index shows that home prices in
Colorado increased 0.9% year-over-year and 0.3% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 2025. All of Colorado’s
MSAs but Fort Collins increased year-over-year. Similarly, all but Grand Junction and Greeley
increased in their quarter-over-quarter price changes.

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado’s value of construction decreased 1.3% year-over-year July 2025 YTD. The
largest increase over that same period was 27.7% in nonbuilding and the largest decrease was 11%
in the residential sector.
Figure 26: Colorado Value of Construction

Residential building permit activity in Colorado continued a slowing trajectory, decreasing 0.7% yearto-date in July 2025. The recent slowdown is largely attributed to a decline in single family
construction activity.

Appendix D: Stagflation Recession Scenario

In this scenario, inflation rises and the economy weakens in the short term. The Fed in this scenario
keeps rates steady to support the weakening economy, but then tightens credit to address the rising
inflation. In this modeled scenario, the recession begins in the second half of 2026. Other risks
persist, including high tariffs and geopolitical conflicts.
Annual real GDP grows 1.6% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026 before declining 2% in 2027; the mediumterm average is 1.3%. The unemployment rate increases to an average of 7.7% in 2026 and 7.9% in
2027. Retail sales turn negative in 2027 before returning to moderate growth. In this stagflation
scenario, RTD revenue falls in 2027 (0.7%) but otherwise grows throughout the horizon.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Investment Policy

October 14, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
October 28, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the 2026 Investment Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Each year, staff presents the proposed Investment Policy for the upcoming fiscal year in accordance
with Fiscal Policy requirements. The Investment Policy may be amended by the Board at any time.
The purpose of the Investment Policy is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment of RTD’s operating funds, debt proceeds and reserve funds.
The primary objectives of RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2)
sufficient liquidity to meet known cash flow requirements and 3) yield to achieve a market rate of return.
Although RTD must legally follow the investment parameters dictated by §24-75-601.1, Colorado
Revised Statutes, this Investment Policy is more conservative in order to achieve the Strategic Priority of
Financial Success.
The most recent modification to the Investment Policy was approved by the Board of Directors on
October 22, 2024, for the 2025 fiscal year.
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting held on September 9, 2025, staff presented a 2026
Investment Policy discussion item that provided initial proposed modifications for Board consideration.
DISCUSSION
Changes in this draft 2026 Investment Policy include:
1) Changing the requirement of including an annual listing of investments held and investment
returns within the Q4 investment report rather than in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report
(ACFR) according to RTD practice, as staff sees this as too much detail to include in the ACFR

Packet Pg. 91

1.D.2

2) Adding the following titles to the list of persons authorized to transact investment business on
behalf of RTD to align with organizational roles: Director of Treasury and Manager of Debt and
Investments
3) Minor grammatical and punctuation edits
Changes have also been reviewed by legal counsel. No other changes have been identified at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action.

2026 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD).

2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer

•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements that
might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification and
purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
ensure that according to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 15-1-304:
“In acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property
for the benefit of others, fiduciaries shall be required to have in mind the responsibilities
which are attached to such offices and the size, nature, and needs of the estates entrusted
to their care and shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then
prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management
of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent
disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of
capital."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses are
inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall

Packet Pg. 94

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy Proposed (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value
of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:

1.D.2.a

Subject: 2026 Investment Policy
Page 3

Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD has authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 32-9-119.
Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the General
Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of RTD in order to assure adequate
protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest

Packet Pg. 95

Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.

1.D.2.a

Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes, or various technical
impediments, leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and
Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below
the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time
Deposits/Time Certificates of Deposit, and Bankers’ Acceptances.
1. U.S. Treasury Obligations. Obligations in the form of bills, notes, bonds, or certificates of
indebtedness backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America. 100% of
the Portfolio may be invested in U.S. Treasury Obligations. The maximum maturity for
investments in U.S. Treasury Obligations shall be limited to five years.
2. Federal Agency and Instrumentality Securities. Obligations, participations, or other
instruments of any Federal agency, instrumentality, or United States governmentsponsored enterprise as described in Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 24-75-601.1(1)(b)
(an “Agency” or “Agencies”). Such securities shall be rated in one of the two highest rating

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS
6.1 Sale of Securities
RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment precludes
pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will outperform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding

Packet Pg. 99

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy Proposed (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

The market value of collateral securities shall be marked-to-market daily. RTD shall have
specific written agreements with each firm with which it enters into repurchase
agreements.

1.D.2.a

RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered a
security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD, and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD, or an investment advisor hired by RTD, will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services, and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to purchase
and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own approved
list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State of Colorado
and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940.

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY
7.1 Safekeeping and Custody

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy Proposed (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

Subject: 2026 Investment Policy
Page 8

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements discussed below, all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third-party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP
number, and any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody
institutions shall provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in
account, including book value and market value of holdings at month-end.

For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian, provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has a perfected interest in the securities used as collateral and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.

All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Staff will include an annual listing of investments held and investment returns within the Q4
investment report.
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the average maturity of the investment
portfolio.

9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return, commensurate
with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the composition of the
Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various indices may be used to
monitor investment performance.
The current Board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash equivalents)
is the ICE BofAML 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and five years and with a target duration of one year), the
designated performance benchmark is the ICE BofAML 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy Proposed (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

7.2 Delivery vs. Payment

RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns that
may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds’ investments. For purposes of this Policy,
“bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of participation, or
other financial securities issued by RTD.

20265 INVESTMENT POLICY

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent
and systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District (RTD).

2. SCOPE
This investment policy applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of RTD
(collectively, the Portfolio).
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through Board-approved bond resolutions or indentures
of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated for
investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.

3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD will
be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To attain
this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy with Redlines (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 20265

Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:
•
•

Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

•

Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD, thereby
reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open market prior
to maturity.

3.2 Liquidity
The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which that might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.

4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any external
investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor” standard to
insure ensure that according to Colorado Revised Statutes, Section 15-1-304:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs of
the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual investments
as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by lawIn
acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing property for
the benefit of others, fiduciaries shall be required to have in mind the responsibilities which
are attached to such offices and the size, nature, and needs of the estates entrusted to
their care and shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then
prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy with Redlines (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or market
price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion and
appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislativehas authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Sections 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated
to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) and her designees. The GM/CEO’s designee will
hereinafter be referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO).
RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures

Attachment: RTD 2026 Investment Policy with Redlines (5197 : 2026 Investment Policy)

of the property of another, not in regard to speculation but in regard to the permanent
disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of
capital."

The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.

Subject: 20265 Investment Policy

The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error, misrepresentation
by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.

Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the GM/CEO any material financial interests in financial
institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any material
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes, or various technical
impediments, leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.
Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the security
is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations
(NRSROs) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second highest rating category
(AA) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and
Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or security is downgraded below
the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in the Portfolio, the CFO will review
the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.

6.2 Competitive Bidding
RTD shall obtain competitive bid or offer information on all purchases or sales of investment
instruments on the secondary market. A competitive bid or offer can be executed through a
bidding process involving at least three separate brokers/financial institutions. If RTD is offered
a security for which there is no readily available competitive offering on the same specific issue,
the investment officer may document quotations for comparable or alternative securities. When
purchasing original/new issue securities, no competitive offerings will be required as all dealers in
the selling group offer those securities at the same original issue price.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD, and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD, or an investment advisor hired by RTD, will maintain a list of financial institutions authorized
to provide investment services, and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities only from
those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i) primary
dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that qualify under
Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices. However,
fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where securities
may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to reinvest
proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.

1.D.2.b

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third third-party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP
number, and any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody
institutions shall provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in
account, including book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian, provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has a perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.

8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2026 Debt Service Defeasance

October 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager, Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) shows that maintaining net revenue coverage equal to or greater
than 1.2x as required by the Fiscal Policy will be challenging in the coming years. To create relief for the
net revenue coverage calculation for 2026, staff examined various financing options, one of which was
deferring and extending the repayment of certain debt service obligations, commonly referred to as
“scoop and toss,” to reduce debt service during 2026. After a rigorous examination, it was determined
that the costs of executing this option in a manner that is helpful for 2026 and deferred repayment of
such obligations until after the FYFF period would likely exceed $5 million.
A more efficient option that has an equally beneficial impact on net revenue coverage in 2026, without
the additional cost of increased interest expense is the provision of payment in 2025 of certain debt
obligations due and payable in 2026. This technique is referred to as defeasing a debt obligation to
maturity.
A defeasance is a financial technique in which an issuer sets aside cash in an irrevocable escrow held by
a financial institution to cover, together with investment earnings, future principal and interest payments
on an existing obligation. The cash is invested in U.S. Government Treasury Bonds maturing prior to the
need to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on the defeased obligations. Bondholders are
paid all due principal and interest on the due date by the escrow account. This process discharges the
issuer's payment obligation for the defeased obligations, allowing them to be removed from the issuer's
balance sheet for financial reporting, even though the original debt remains outstanding until the escrow
fully repays the obligation on the due date. This is a technique that RTD has used in the past when
refunding or refinancing debt.
In 2026, RTD is scheduled to make the following principal and interest payments:
FasTracks Bonds, Series 2022AB
Principal: $12,130,000
Interest: $9,971,810

Packet Pg. 118

1.E.1

Certificates of Participation, Series 2020
Principal: $3,525,000
Interest: $3,083,875
Certificates of Participation, Series 2023
Principal: $9,965,000
Interest: $369,125
Certificates of Participation, Series 2025
Principal: $14,115,000
Interest: $4,117,375
Total: $57,277,185
DISCUSSION
Providing for the preceding scheduled principal and interest payments in 2025 will create operating
expense relief in the net revenue calculation equal to $68,688,000. This allows for RTD to spend
$68,688,000 more in 2026 operating expense than it could otherwise while remaining compliant with
the 1.2x net revenue coverage requirement of the 2026 Fiscal Policy. Note that this action further
reduces the 2025 net revenue coverage, which was budgeted at 0.5.
Additional defeasance opportunity is available for 2026 in order to provide more time to balance
operating expense given the revenue forecast and net coverage ratio policy; however, the downside of
this approach is that the resulting higher operating expense would further reduce unrestricted reserves
and increase the need for additional debt issuance to cover capital requirements in the 2026-2030
forecast period.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The initial estimated cost of the defeasance, including legal counsel, trustee fees, and related
professional services, is less than $75,000.

BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2026 Proposed Budget represents the agency’s financial plan for the coming year.
Pursuant to §29-1-105, Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD is submitting the 2026 Proposed Budget to the
Board of Directors and will make it available for public review by October 15, 2025, as required by §291-106, Colorado Revised Statutes, providing a transparent appropriation process allowing for Board and
public input and comment. Staff will present the 2026 Proposed Budget as a recommended action item
for consideration by the Finance and Planning Committee during its November 11, 2025, meeting. The
item on that date will include a description of changes since the October 14, 2025, Discussion Item
Board report presentation. The Board will consider the 2026 Proposed Budget for adoption during its
December 2, 2025 meeting.
The 2026 Proposed Budget and associated attachments are included in this Board discussion item and
will also be posted to the RTD website with hard copies available in the Board Office for public review.
Furthermore, notices of these postings will occur in the Denver Post and the Boulder Daily Camera as
required by §29-1-106(3)(a), Colorado Revised Statutes, to “be published one time in a newspaper
having general circulation in the local government.”
The 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) was approved initially by the Finance and Planning
Committee on September 9, 2025, and has been utilized for fiscal sustainability guidance in developing
the 2026 Proposed Budget. The FYFF is scheduled to be further discussed during the October 14, 2025,
Finance and Planning Committee and referenced during the 2026 Proposed Budget study session on
October 22, 2025.
DISCUSSION
The attached 2026 Proposed Budget document includes narratives describing the financial assumptions
and alignment with RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan. In addition, tables, charts and commentary are
included for evaluation of the considerations included therein.

1.E.2

Staff have developed the 2026 Proposed Budget to conform with RTD’s Fiscal Policy directives while
best meeting the transit needs of its customers and communities at large.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2026 Proposed Budget aligns 2026 expenditures with anticipated funding sources, while
maintaining the 2026 Fiscal Policy requirements. RTD’s internal controls and budget appropriation
process provide those charged with leadership and governance responsibilities with the opportunity to
adjust and realign appropriations, within their delegated authority, throughout the fiscal year as
necessary.

General Manager and CEO Message
Over the last year, the Regional Transportation District continued
its efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair, addressed
impediments to employee recruitment and retention efforts,
demonstrated its commitment to building customer and community
connections, and made notable gains in creating a welcoming
transit environment for employees and customers alike.
Debra A. Johnson

• As RTD’s Transit Police Department continues to grow, the addition
of sworn officers better enables RTD-PD to build connections
and respond to calls throughout the agency’s service area. The
xpande its unhoused outreach coordinators and
department has expanded
clinici
added mental health cli
clinicians, an approach pioneered in transit
policing by the
he Chief o
of Police and Emergency Management.

FT

The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget encapsulates RTD’s ﬁnancial plan for the
forthcoming year. This budget aligns with the agency’s 2021–2026
Strategic Plan, which outlines an ongoing commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success. With this commitment also comes
a continued emphasis on the strategic initiative of Customer and
Community Connections, alongside the newly introduced initiatives of
Enhancing Public Trust, Building a Better RTD, and Service Excellence.
This budget reﬂects an intentional focus on the four initiatives which
are interwoven into work plans across all agency departments and
divisions. RTD will continue to make meaningful progress toward
established success outcomes by centering its work on each of these
factors. While RTD’s Finance staff, Leadership Team, and subjectrries
matter experts provide overarching guidance, every employee carries
a responsibility and an opportunity to work in a manner that brings
about meaningful improvements.

R

RTD saw substantial milestones and successes in 2025
25 that were
the direct result of continued coordination by teams
ms and individuals
throughout the agency. Both within and outside
e RTD,
TD, people took
note of the following achievements:

D

• Following the announcement in March
and
ch 2022 of a robust plan an
timeline to “Reclaim Union Station,”” a collaborative and multimulti-faceted
strategy aimed at enhancing safety and security at this mu
multimodal
transit hub, RTD in April 2025 reported
percent
d a nearly 60 pe
per
reduction in security-related calls and a three-year
decrease in
hree-year d
reports of criminal activities at this location.
• Thanks to the diligence and care shown by nearly 100 RTD staff,
from rail laborers to track maintainers, in May the agency lifted the
last of 31 light rail speed restrictions that were put in place over the
prior year as RTD implemented more rigorous standards for regularly
inspecting its more than 120 miles of light rail track. During this
period, crews removed and replaced more than two miles of track
along the D, E, H, and R lines.
• RTD’s most recent annual customer and community surveys, the
results of which were announced in June, showed double-digit,
year-over-year improvements in perceptions of personal safety and
security, the cleanliness of buses and trains, on-time performance,
the frequency of service, and the agency’s overall value in the
Denver metro area.

I extend my gratitude to each one o
of RTD’s employees, whose
commitment
have made these gains possible. They
mitment and dedication ha
hav
ng their best selves to wor
bring
work every day in public service and make
a meaningful diff
difference in the health of the region. I acknowledge
the
e contributi
contributions of the agency’s Board of Directors and its labor
partners. I also thank every customer, stakeholder, local
and contract pa
partners
leader, and partn
partne
partner who engaged with RTD. The agency will continue
to be agile and ﬂexible as it endeavors to meet the transit needs of
the individu
individua
individuals and communities within its service district.
Mo sspeciﬁcally, I express my sincere gratitude for CFO Kelly Mackey
More
wh rolled up her sleeves upon her arrival to the organization in May
who
and has delved into the agency’s inner workings. Additionally, a big
a
thanks to Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager of Budget; Brenden Morgan,
Senior Manager of Debt and Investment; Heidi Wagner; Senior
Manager of Finance; and all of their respective teams for leaning in
and supporting this critical undertaking in these unpredictable times.
Lastly, my wholehearted appreciation to the Leadership Team who
served as thought partners while I grappled with difficult decisions
to ensure a balanced budget while retaining the agency’s power and
service levels.
RTD is comprised of people moving people and each of these
individuals makes lives better through connections. On behalf of this
entire team, I invite you to keep watching as we make our transit
system one that is better for all.
Sincerely,

Next Phase of Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project Begins
In September, RTD launched the next phase of its multi-year Downtown
Rail Reconstruction Project. The $152 million dollar project, which began
in 2024, is focused on fully reconstructing the light rail track infrastructure
that serves the Downtown Loop, Welton Street Corridor, and runs along
Colfax Avenue. In 2025, crews focused their efforts on reconstructing the
Kalamath Street crossing, which was originally constructed more than 30

Hundreds of Bus Operators Recognized in 5280 Safe Driving Program
RTD in 2025 recognized 436 bus operators who maintained accidentfree driving and avoided preventable incidents in 2024 as part of its
5280 Safe Driving Program. Twelve of the operators honored with this
recognition maintained an accident-free driving record for at least 20
years. Sixty drove over 100,000 miles last year, and 188 maintained
accident-free records for ﬁve consecutive years. RTD launched the 5280
Program in 2021 to commend its operators for keeping transit safe for
customers who rely on RTD services to make connections. Mebrahtu
Tsegaye, a bus operator with RTD for 24 years, said, “The key to a
longstanding safe driving record is to “put yourself in the passenger’s
shoes and be patient and respectful.”

who had completed their training. In what is now known as the OneRTD
Operator Graduation, graduates are individually recognized during a
ceremony that is open to friends and family. The monthly graduation
events are also streamed lived on YouTube, shared agency wide in
employee-facing publications, and posted to RTD’s website and social

Continued Growth of Transit Police Department
RTD-PD continued its two-year momentum in building the agency’s police
force as part of its Welcoming Transit Environment strategic initiative. Led
by Chief of Police and Emergency Management Steve Martingano, the
department implemented a four-step action plan in 2025 that focuses on
visibility, customer education, fare enforcement, and technology. Since
August 2019, when RTD-PD had just 19 POST-certiﬁed officers, Transit
Police has grown to include 100 sworn officers, alongside a complement
of contracted security personnel. The addition of officers enables RTDPD to increase round-the-clock patrols throughout the district, build
relationships within geographic sectors, take a proactive approach
h
to policing efforts, and provide a regular presence on vehicles and
properties across the agency’s service area.

Substantial Increase in Fare Checks
RTD-PD increased its fare checks by more than 500% since May
2024, with a speciﬁc focus on ensuring that individuals on light rail
and commuter rail trains are customers who have paid fare to board.
The growth of the Transit Police Department has allowed for increased
patrolling across RTD’s stops, stations, and vehicles. As of August 2025,
officers were conducting nearly 500,000 individual fare checks a month
on the rail system. The tactic is one part in the four-step security plan
resulting from an in-depth review in 2024 that led Transit Police to ramp
up fare enforcement in support of customers and employees.

Growth of Homelessness Outreach Program
RTD’s homelessness outreach program grew from one unhoused
outreach coordinator in January 2022 to four as of May. Each individual

Sales and use tax revenue of $877 million, which
comprises 77% of RTD’s expected funding sources in
2026, is derived from the September 2025 forecast
provided by the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business; it anticipates decline of 2.9% as
compared to the 2025 Adopted Budget, based on
economic indicators.

The decrease in capital from 2025 is due mainly to
the 2025 appropriation of capital for the multi-year
light rail reconstruction effort that was budgeted at
$145 million in 2025 for downtown track, and unused
appropriations will be carried forward into 2026. This

To achieve 2026 Budget for operating expense,
RTD has incorporated a number of cost-saving
opportunities. Various service contract savings
are estimated at $17 million. The closed, salaried
employees’ pension plan contribution is budgeted
at $7 million in 2026 as compared to $15 million in
the prior year, as it is adequately funded. Vacancies
are targeted at $7 million in savings, and overtime
modiﬁcations may result in $5 million in savings. The
2025 non-represented merit increase as a lump sum
will result in $4 million in savings. In addition to no
movement within salary bands related to 2024-2025
merit, the 2026 Proposed Budget does not include
merit for the 2025-2026 performance period. The
proposed budget also does not include an allotment

The revenue in FY 2026 is budgeted to decrease
compared to the 2025 Budget. The 2025 customer
fares were estimated to increase 4.5% over the
2024 budget due to slight growth in ridership and
increased fare inspections. Fares continue to provide
approximately 5% of RTD’s revenues. Through July
2025, sales and use taxes have increased 1.2% from
2024. The 2026 Budget includes an assumed 2.9%
decrease in tax collections from 2025, as outlined in

is primarily comprised of FTA Section 5307 grant
annual apportionments for preventive maintenance.
Other revenue comprises just 2.8% of total revenue
and consists of investment income, advertising, and
other miscellaneous revenue. It is expected to be
relatively ﬂat when compared to 2025. RTD forecasts
its revenues conservatively to ensure that only
reasonably certain funding sources are contemplated
when developing expenditures and considering ﬁscal
constraints. This approach provides improved budget
certainty while also supporting ﬁscal sustainability.

FT

Salaries and beneﬁts have decreased $24 million
due to excluding merit increases for 2026 for nonrepresented employees, eliminating PTO Sellback,
and deferring hiring of vacant positions until later in
the year. Retirement beneﬁts have decreased due
to reducing the lump sum contribution to the closed,
non-represented employee pension plan from $15
million to $6.5 million, as it is deemed sufficiently
funded. These reductions in salaries and beneﬁts
were offset somewhat by the increased wage rates
for represented employees that were negotiated and
agreed to in the most recent Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA).

Insurance costs are relatively small in relation to
overall expenses but are expected to increase in
2025 due to claims experience and increasing
premiums, primarily for general liability insurance.
RTD is self-insured for general liability and worker’s
compensation claims. RTD has certain excess liability
limits under the Colorado Government Immunity Act
for claims involving personal injury and
property damage.

Materials and supplies decreased $4 million to match
more closely with 2025 utilization rates for fuel,
revenue vehicle parts and other consumables. These
se
expenditures could change as RTD approaches
hes the
opportunity to lock a price for diesel fuel for
or 2026.

R

Outside services will decrease signiﬁcantly
ﬁcantly
cantly in 2026
due to the one-time nature of the East Colfax BRT
BR
pass-through grant that was appropriated
ppropriated in 2025.
Services also decreased to more closely align with
wi
current expenditure levels.

Utilities, which are primarily comprised
ised of
o energy
costs for facilities and traction power, are decreasing
to better align with current rates and usage.
Leases and rentals comprise a small portion of RTD’s
expenses, and those costs will go down in 2026
compared to 2025. These costs are primarily related
to facility leases such as the Civic Center building,
and other certain smaller agreements associated with
communication towers and storage facilities.

Operating Expenses
Operating expenses will decrease in FY 2026
compared to the 2025 Budget, excluding the 2025
East Colfax BRT grant of $187 million, by $123 million.

The other expenses category includes miscellaneous
transactions and adjustments.

Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures for 2026 are largely driven by the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Details of these
budgeted capital expenditures are provided in the Appendix, and a schedule depicting and describing the 2025
capital carryforward will also be provided with the ﬁnal recommended 2026 budget appropriation. The increase
in capital from 2025 is due mainly to the 2026 appropriation of capital for the additional work that is needed
on the light rail system, primarily for infrastructure. This reconstruction effort ensures the light rail track and
infrastructure, the earliest of which opened for revenue service in 1994, is maintained in a state of good repair.

This Plan is a primary input to RTD’s Five-Year
ar
Financial Forecast (FYFF) and annual budget,

capital and operating resources are prioritized
rioritized
toward maintaining a State of Good Repair
pair (SGR) and
maximizing long-term asset value.

As
Management Plan (AMP), RTD
D translates knowledge

into investment priorities that

cla
cl
Over the current planning horizon, RTD is focused
on maturing the agency’s Asset Information Maturity
(AIM), the accuracy, completeness, and utility of data
that underpin all asset related decisions. This multiyear effort improves the integration between asset
condition and performance data, risk assessments,
and ﬁnancial planning, providing a stronger
foundation for both strategic and tactical decisionmaking. As data quality improves, RTD’s TAM Planning
framework will evolve.

Attachment: 2026 Budget_Book_2025_Proof8 (5201 : 2026 Proposed Budget)

The TAM Plan’s purpose extends beyond compliance,
it is RTD’s public case for investment, demonstrating
to the Board, federal partners, and the communities
served that the agency is managing assets
responsibly and transparently. Through this Plan, RTD
shows how limited taxpayer resources are prioritized
to sustain safe, reliable service and long-term
system value.

A

RTD’s TAM Plan outlines the policies, processes, and
data that guide the management of transit assets
throughout their entire life cycles, from acquisition
to renewal, replacement, and retirement. The Plan
ensures that asset decisions are risk-informed,
performance-based, ﬁnancially sustainable, and that
they directly support RTD’s mission to make lives
better through connections and its vision to be the
trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and
value to our customers and community.

reducing operational risk, and ensuring investments
achieve full design life. These practices will be
extended across additional asset classes including
facilities, and systems infrastructure.

T

The Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan is a
cornerstone of RTD’s Asset Management System,
providing the foundation for how the agency manages
more than $9 billion in capital assets to deliver
safe, reliable, and equitable transit service across
the Denver metro region. The Plan aligns with both
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations (49
CFR Part 625) and internationally recognized asset
management principles (ISO 55000) to ensure the
sustainable stewardship of public infrastructure.

Recent TAM enhancements, such as the age-minus
methodology for light rail track renewals, demonstrate
RTD’s commitment to improving asset performance,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Long Range Financial Plan

October 14, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Long-Range Financial Plan serves as an extension of the Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) through
the 30-year time horizon, which is currently 2055. This plan is submitted to the Denver Regional Council
of Governments (DRCOG), the federally designated metropolitan planning organization for the Denver
region pursuant to the Federal Transit Act, 23 U.S.C. 5301, et seq. DRCOG will incorporate RTD’s plan
along with the plans of other member governments and partners in the Regional Transportation Plan
(RTP) that is updated every four years as required by 23 CFR § 450.324 in order for projects to receive
federal funding. The RTP guides the long-range vision and investment framework for the region’s
multimodal transportation system. DRCOG relies on financial forecasts developed by RTD to determine
the amount of funding available for use in RTD’s transit network. RTD’s lenders also utilize the plan to
ensure that RTD has the financial capacity to repay its debt.
DISCUSSION
The Long-Range Financial Plan focuses on evaluating whether RTD can fund the ongoing operation and
maintenance of the Base System and the FasTracks corridors while repaying its debt obligations. Key
elements of the plan for the years 2026-2055 include the following:
•

•

Revenue Projections
o Sales-and-use tax forecasts from the September 2025 forecast from the Leeds School of
Business at the University of Colorado Boulder
o Fare revenue forecasts based on the current pricing structure, Consumer Price Index (CPI)
increases every three years and existing fare check strategy with DRCOG ridership
projections
o Future formula grants forecast based on historic appropriations, escalated at CPI
Operations and Capital Replacement
o Continued operating costs based on the final year of the Five-Year Financial Forecast,
escalated at 3% CPI with vehicle, hour and mile adjustments for increased transit
utilization
o Replacement of revenue fleet and other assets based on current asset inventory and
replacement schedules

Packet Pg. 237

1.E.3

Replacement of maintenance facilities as projected to be required
Issuance of additional Certificates of Participation (COPs) in the Five-Year Financial
Forecast to fund a portion of capital replacement requirements
o Any incremental costs (capital and operations) for DRCOG RTP bus rapid transit (BRT)
corridors above those funding levels currently provided by RTD that would be paid for and
financed by stakeholder project sponsors
Reserves
o A balance of three months’ operating expenses in the Board-appropriated operating reserve
o Short-term use of the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to fund FasTracks state
of good repair efforts in the Five-Year Financial Forecast
o Reserves fully utilized with a gap between revenue projections and expenditure
requirements
Other Assumptions Beyond the FYFF
o That the Concession Agreement with Denver Transit Operators for the A, B, and G Lines
remains in place through 2044, with RTD assuming operations thereafter
o That the entire light rail system will be converted to level boarding
o That a new bus operating facility will be built or acquired
o That a new light rail operating facility located in the eastern portion of the light rail system
will be built
o That the existing Automatic Block Signals System for light rail is converted to a
Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) Moving Block Signal System
o That the agency does not assume ownership of private contractor bus operations facilities
o
o

•

•

The Long-Range Financial Plan does not incorporate proposed defeasance of a portion of 2026 debt
obligations.
Implementation of the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan would add approximately $1.4B to the capital
costs above what is listed in the Long-Range Financial Plan schedules. Due to complexities and
unknowns in the fleet replacement schedules, the Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan is not able to be
incorporated into the Long-Range Financial Plan by year at this time.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended Long-Range Financial Plan does not provide RTD with the means to maintain its
current system in a state of good repair through 2055. Between 2026 and 2055, RTD would not have
the capacity for service expansion or new projects beyond those needed to maintain a state of good
repair, and the FISA alone would not be sufficient to fund the unfunded FasTracks corridors.
Unrestricted funds and capital replacement reserves are fully utilized by 2031 for the existing
infrastructure state of good repair. Additional debt issuance and revenue is required in the Long-Range
Financial Plan.

Decrease in net position of $178M is $137M favorable to budget and driven primarily by:
•
•

Federal grant revenue draws typically occur in the second half of the year
Operating expense $245M favorable to budget due to timing of East Colfax BRT and slower spending
