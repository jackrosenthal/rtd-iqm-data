Committee Meeting Date:

Board Meeting Date:
August 10, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2021-2026 strategic plan developed in concert with the Board of
Directors, General Manager and CEO and the members of the executive leadership team.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the agency’s General Manager Executive Search process in 2020, finalists for the General
Manager and CEO position were asked to present their near-term strategies for the agency for the first
few months as the agency’s executive lead. Then-candidate Debra A. Johnson submitted a transition
plan, which detailed her proposed plans, which revolved around specific strategic goals surrounding
leadership, safety and security, financial management, operations, customer service, community
engagement and stakeholder outreach, right-sizing staff and evaluating talent, capital programs and
FasTracks, diversity and inclusion, and technology and innovation.
Following her appointment as General Manager and CEO, but prior to her first day in the position, Ms.
Johnson once again communicated with the Board on October 20, 2020 and shared those same goals
were part of a communication in which she proposed timely and focused organizational priorities for her
first 30, 60, and 90 days and beyond.
Further, in one of her first meetings as General Manager and CEO, during the November 19, 2020
General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee, Debra Johnson presented her
initial 120+ day plan, in which she described steps to create organizational alignment regarding
strategic priorities and performance metrics.
The strategic plan, which covers the 2021 through 2026 planning horizon, is a culmination of efforts
that began following the announcement of the hire of the agency’s new General Manager on August 25,
2020. The plan is an ambitious but actionable roadmap that establishes agency-wide strategic priorities,
success outcomes, and performance metrics for each department to be assessed against.
The iterative process used to establish the basis for the strategic plan began with individual meetings
with each Director, followed by workshops and collaborative group meetings between the project team
and each department. Staff met with the Board on April 27, 2021 to present focused strategic steps
along the agency’s road to recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial Boardfocused discussion relative to the mission, vision and values was held on May 5, 2021. Following on
June 5, 2021, the full Board of Directors in-person met for a strategic planning workshop to discuss and
establish performance outcomes associated with priorities. Lastly, on June 26, 2021, the full Board of
Directors and RTD’s leadership team met for a strategic planning retreat to finalize the alignment of

Packet Pg. 2

2.A

strategic priorities and outcomes. In addition to the workshops and retreat, the Board had the
opportunity to engage on multiple occasions with the project team through RTD’s Board Committee
meetings – primarily the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.
DISCUSSION
The strategic plan incorporates the agency’s updated mission, vision, and values as follows:
Mission We make lives better through connections.

value to our customers and community.
•

2.A

The strategic plan establishes four strategic priorities and their associated success outcomes determined
by the Board in June 2021:

FINANCIAL IMPACT
While staff will base budgeting decisions on the strategic priorities outlined in the strategic plan that will
have significant financial impacts, there is no direct impact from the Board’s adoption of the strategic
plan itself.

Moving Forward

Packet Pg. 6

2.A.a

I recognize the value that a high-quality
transportation system brings to its
community and the region it serves. I,
along with the dedicated employees
of the Regional Transportation District,
are committed to delivering service that
both supports the needs of the agency’s
customers, stakeholders, and community
members and enhances the day-to-day lives
of residents and visitors across the Denver
metro region.
Over the next year, the agency will be
focused on realizing the vision to be
the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to the district’s
customers and community. RTD strives
to make lives better through connectivity
and facilitating economic development.
RTD will continue the pursuit of this
vision by exploring long-term models that
benefit current and future customers, the
community, and employees.
This Strategic Plan outlines a road map for
specific initiatives and programs the RTD
team will undertake over the coming year;
it also provides a framework for measuring
success beyond the one-year period. A
well-crafted strategic plan provides the
leadership team and stakeholders with
guiding goals, projects, and programs to be
implemented in the short-term to achieve
longer-term outcomes. In the event of an
unforeseeable event, such as a global
pandemic, the plan can be easily paused
and then resumed once the crisis has been
managed or has passed.

Page 3

DEBRA A. JOHNSON
Having clarity on the bigger picture also
provides the organization with the flexibility
to adapt the plan to changing conditions.
This plan details RTD’s aspirations and
the steps for attaining goals; it articulates
the organization’s vision for establishing a
valuable partnership with the surrounding
community, pursuing customer excellence,
becoming a regional employer of choice,
and achieving financial success.
RTD’s 2021 Strategic Plan is both ambitious
and actionable. No strategic plan should
be an easy reach; one cannot spell
“CHAlleNGE” without “CHANGE.” The plan
will serve as the guiding vision for strategic
success. I truly believe that this plan will
elevate RTD to new heights through a
focused pursuit of excellence.
Sincerely,
Debra A. Johnson

CONCLUSION
The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan is a blueprint for organizational excellence. The General Manager
and the Executive Leaders in concert with the Board of Directors established four strategic
priorities – Community Value; Customer Excellence; Employee Ownership; and Financial
Success – that serve as the functional pillars to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure RTD’s
overall performance.
Simply put, the plan details the following:
1 ) WHY RTD delivers service, as defined in the agency’s Mission, Vision and Values.
2 ) WHAT the agency strives to achieve, as embodied by its strategic priorities, established by
the Board of Directors working in concert with the General Manager and CEO and executive
leaders, to drive success outcomes.
3 ) HOW the agency will successfully fulfill the strategic priorities, as detailed by specific tactics
to achieve the success outcomes.
4) W
 HO is ultimately responsible for achieving ambitious annual performance goals, as
measured quarterly through metrics identified in departmental scorecards.
The formula is evident with a laser-focus on these four strategic priorities; this Plan lays a
foundation for sustained organizational success and alignment.
