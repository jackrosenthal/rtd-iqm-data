### B. Recommended Actions

No recommended actions were presented.

#### 1. Local Government Update - CRL Associates

Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, introduced Roger Sherman from CRL Associates.

Roger Sherman said he wanted to address 4 items.  The first item is the General Manager (GM) transition.  He noted that this item is of interest to the local governments and key stakeholders throughout the region.  He pointed out that stakeholders who participated in the 2009 GM Transition process praised RTD for its transparency then and look forward to the same process during the current transition.

The second item Roger Sherman addressed was the Metro Mayor Caucus on March 25th.  He said that GM Phil Washington was recognized during the meeting.  There was a construction defects update which will be expanded on during the State Government update.  He noted that the Metro Transportation District (MTD) was revisited as a discussion topic.

The third item is the Denver elections.  Roger Sherman said that the ballots will be in the mail next week.  He pointed out that transit and growth are a hot issue for all the races as well as the current City Council; the latter having just voted on an On Demand transportation bill.  He added that if a candidate does not receive 50% plus 1 votes there will be a runoff election the month after.

The final item Roger Sherman addressed is the November municipal elections.  He said that RTD will lose some supportive mayors as they are term limited.  He noted that it will be interesting to watch how the races play out.

Director Lubow wondered if the MTD conversation includes funding for the Northwest rail line.  Roger Sherman explained that the MTD itself has not had their first meeting.  He added that he could not see it not be part of the discussion.

Director Solano thanked Roger Sherman for the succinct and informative report.

Committee Chair Folska asked Roger Sherman to define “On Demand” transportation.  Roger Sherman said that he probably could not do it very well, but from what he can observe it has to do with utilizing technology to provide more transportation options.  Committee Chair Folska added that “On Demand” to her means personal transportation and to think that public transportation would be able to provide such service might be erroneous.  Roger Sherman pointed out that is the language the Denver City Council is using.  Transportation is of importance to the City Council and they are spending time learning from other cities.

Committee Chair Folska thanked Roger Sherman and CRL Associates for their assistance in the strategic planning of the GM selection process.

Director James provided clarification on “On Demand”.  He said that other cities are using On Demand transportation as a hybrid of Uber/Lyft and airport shuttles.  It utilizes smart phone data to place the services where the demand would be.  It asks users to walk a couple of blocks and share rides.  He noted that Councilmember Mary Beth Susman has been one of the most active in the council in regard to utilizing shared resources.

Director Solano said that utilizing technology for these purposes makes sense.

#### 2. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs

Jenifer Brandeberry from Brandeberry~McKenna distributed to the Board copies of Governor Hickenlooper’s Stand Up 4 Transportation Day proclamation.    She noted that the General Assembly is two thirds of the way through.  She pointed out that the Senate passed the state budget last week.  Jenifer Brandeberry does not anticipate any changes as the budget moves through the House of Representatives.

She noted that Senate Bill 221 passed.  This was the bill John Tarbert, Transit Police Chief, worked on.  The bill cleans up police officer statutes as it pertains to transit agencies.

She pointed out House Bill 1264: the Homeless Person Bill of Rights.  It is calendared for next week. She added that the bill has a fiscal note attached to it.  The Colorado Municipal League and other entities are opposed to the bill because they believe navigating homeless services should be a municipal function.  The way the bill is currently written may steer folks away from services they need.

The Senate Bill Roger Sherman referred to during his update as the construction defects bill is Senate Bill 177: Owner occupied housing.  The bill will be discussed on Friday, April 10th.

Jenifer Brandeberry added that they continue to monitor other bills, including the workforce bills due to the WIN program.

Director Solano said that he appreciates Brandeberry~McKenna’s work.

Chair Sisk expressed his gratitude to Brandeberry~McKenna, CRL Associates, and Squire Patton Boggs.  He said that RTD is fortunate to have such capable people as liaisons with the State Legislation.  He wondered who was sponsoring the homeless bill.  Jenifer Brandeberry replied that Representative Joe Salazar and Senator John Kefalas.  She added that the bill is based on a national piece of legislation that has the goal to help homelessness.  She noted that locally Denver and Boulder have made progressive strides in providing services.  She pointed out that this may be part of the reason why the bill keeps getting bounced back.

Director Menten asked for specific examples on how Senate Bill 221 affects the jurisdiction of RTD police.  Chief Tarbert explained that the bill simplified the wording of the original law.  He added that RTD will never have a large police force but it does need friends within the District.  The bill allows for RTD police and off duty police officers working for RTD to cross jurisdictions within the District in order to do their job more efficiently.  Director Menten asked if RTD needed police officers for fare enforcement and how many people are on an average checking fares.  Chief Tarbert replied that police officers are not needed but they can also do fare enforcement.  He noted that, for example, the Southeast corridor has 7 officers working on the alignment.  Off duty police officers currently must exit the train at the end of their jurisdiction.  Fare inspectors can travel throughout the line.

Director Solano said that from his criminal justice background he understands the problem of fare jumpers.

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino from Squire Patton Boggs noted that both the House of Representatives and the Senate passed their resolutions early.  He noted that the House passed a Medicaid “Doc Fix”; he mentioned this as a possible precursor for doing something for transportation funding.  Mike Dino added that the current transportation reauthorization expires on May 31st.  There is no plan to put a new program together to replace the authorization.  He pointed out that the Highway Trust Fund is estimated to have $5 billion to fund programs through October and an additional $3 million to fund until the end of December.  RTD and other agencies should expect to see payments at least through July.  After that there may be some reductions.

Mike Dino noted that Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx announced a revised version of the Grow America Act.  Mike Dino added that the President continues to look for options to repatriate taxes from U.S. corporations overseas.

Director Francone asked Mike Dino if he had any information on the bill that is being co-sponsored by Congressman Ken Buck to reauthorize funds towards bridges and roads instead of public transportation.  Mike Dino replied that he had not heard of any at this point but will look into it.

Director James expressed his disappointment at Congress since the report did not include any remarks on Stand Up 4 Transportation.  He said that it made it seem like Congress is not listening.  Mike Dino noted that there is a lot of support for transit and RTD, especially in the Colorado delegation.  He noted that similar bills to the one Director Francone mentioned have surfaced in the past but have not gotten anywhere.  Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, added that there is support by Congress members across the country.  She believes the bulk of the message will happen after the event with videos and testimonies.

Director Menten asked if the Directors could have an update on the APTA webcast on the voluntary program based on geographical hiring.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that there were two measures introduced on March 6th in the Federal register.  One was a notice of proposed rulemaking, which allows for local hire preferences for labor only.  She noted that neither RTD nor the State of Colorado have a local hire preference policy.  The second one is a pilot program, not mandatory, of a local contracting initiative giving preference to a local entity if the policy was in place.  She does not believe that either one of those programs, as they are written, would require RTD to do anything more than what it is doing.  The concern that these two measures have stirred is that this may open the door for communities to enact these laws as doing so would no longer affect their ability to receive Federal funding.

Director Solano was not available when asked for a comment.

Committee Chair Folska thanked CRL Associates, Brandeberry~McKenna, and Squire Patton Boggs for their updates.  She asked them to include their updates in the packet distributed to the Directors before the meeting.
