Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the attached document as the current official version of the 202126 Strategic Plan (Plan), which incorporates revisions to the Plan previously adopted by the Board in
June and October 2024.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO

PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board during a Special Board
Meeting held on Tuesday, August 10, 2021.
The five-year Strategic Plan includes the agency’s vision, “To be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering
excellence and value to our customers and community,” its mission, “Making lives better through
connections,” and values: passion, respect, diversity, trustworthiness, collaboration and ownership. The
Plan also establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars used to
plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources

Each Strategic Priority is associated with a measurable Success Outcome.
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions to develop tactics to improve agency performance in specific areas.
These tactics were distilled into overarching Strategic Initiatives beginning in the 2023-24 employee
performance cycle, and a fourth Strategic Initiative was developed for the 2024-25 cycle:

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Back to Basics: RTD strives to enhance the reach and impact of internal communications and to
redouble agency efforts to maintain assets in a state of good repair leveraging sound asset
management principles
People Power: Recognizing the critical importance of its people, the agency’s most important
resource, in achieving the agency’s mission, RTD seeks to vigorously address impediments to
recruitment and retention efforts and to foster a culture of learning and development
Welcoming Transit Environment: RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal behaviors and
Code of Conduct violations on agency services and workplaces and, in doing so, to improve
community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles
Customer and Community Connections: RTD is committed to fostering community building and
enriching the customer experience
During the Board’s annual retreat in 2024, Board members discussed opportunities to enhance agency
transparency and bolster communication and engagement with jurisdictional partners, stakeholders, and
customers. At that time, Board members collectively discussed the development of a series of openended questions intended to probe whether the agency is meeting its performance goals:

Community Value

Customer Excellence

How is RTD achieving its How is RTD meeting
vision to be the trusted customers’ needs?
leader in mobility?
How has RTD delivered How is RTD creating a
value to the communities welcoming transit
it serves?
environment?

Employee Ownership

Financial Success

How well is RTD
How has RTD
attracting highly skilled
demonstrated good
and engaged job seekers? stewardship of taxpayer
dollars?
What is RTD doing to
How has RTD developed
inspire employees to build trust as the leader in
a career?
mobility?

As noted on page 20 of the Strategic Plan document printed in 2021 and as contemplated by the Board
and staff that year, performance metrics are subject to change during the duration of the Plan. Adjusting
agency metrics, and thereby adjusting agency operations and performance, in order to achieve success
outcomes is an essential element of the Strategic Plan.
As such, draft revisions to the Agency Performance Scorecard, the essential core of the Strategic Plan
used to monitor progress toward the established Success Outcomes, were developed by staff in
collaboration with the Board Chair and Performance Committee Chair in 2024. Both the abovereferenced open-ended questions posed during the Board’s 2024 retreat, as well as a detailed discussion
with the Performance Committee during its meeting on Tuesday, May 21, 2024, directly informed those
draft revisions. The Board adopted revisions to the Agency Performance Scorecard during the monthly
Board meetings held on June 25 and October 22, 2024.

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

In regard to the Strategic Plan, the Office of the State Auditor (OSA), in an August 2024 report
regarding its recent fiscal governance audit of RTD, recommended that:
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Board of Directors (Board) should ensure that it
receives sufficient information from RTD management so that it can monitor RTD’s
progress in meeting its strategic priorities by…[d]eveloping and implementing a written
policy, bylaw, or other form outlining what changes RTD management can make to RTD's
strategic plan, or other Board-approved or -adopted long-range plans, without Board
consultation and approval, and to what extent management must provide updates to the
Board on any changes made to these plans.
In its response to OSA, RTD stated:
The recommended action report that will accompany the next iteration of the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan in printed form will include reference to the elements that are within staff’s
authority to amend, such as work plans associated with strategic initiatives, and those
elements that must first be considered and approved by the Board prior to revision. Any
revisions to the Strategic Plan contained in this future iteration itself must first be
considered by the Board. Staff intends to present the updated 2021-2026 Strategic Plan
document for the Board’s consideration and approval by March 2025.
DISCUSSION
As pledged in RTD’s response to OSA recommendations in August 2024, a revised Strategic Plan
document has been developed for the Board’s consideration and is attached hereto. The document
features updated design and narrative elements, centered around the revised Agency Performance
Scorecard approved in October 2024.
In adopting this recommended action, the Board and staff acknowledge and affirm that any substantive
changes to the Strategic Plan’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategic Priorities, and Success Outcomes
require a Board vote; those elements remain unchanged in the revised Strategic Plan document attached
hereto. The Board and staff also acknowledge and affirm that administrative and ministerial matters and
staff-level efforts to effectuate the Strategic Plan, such as Strategic Initiatives, tactics, projects, and
individual employee contributions, remain within the purview of staff to perform and adjust as needed as
directed by the GM/CEO or the GM/CEO’s delegates.
Copies of the reprinted 2021-2026 Strategic Plan will be provided to the Board Office and to all current
and newly hired employees in the interest of organizational alignment.
Staff anticipates collaborating with the Board in 2025 and into 2026 regarding an approach to develop
and, prior to the current plan’s expiration in August 2026, implement the next iteration of the agency's
Strategic Plan.

value to customers as well as to the broader Denver metro region while
sustaining planet Earth

“The Strategic Plan
is RTD’s ‘north star,’
and its four Strategic

Debra A. Johnson

• Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly

• Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all

Leveraging the strategic framework found in this updated Plan document, we have
collectively made great strides toward making RTD the public transit provider the
Denver region’s residents and visitors have come to expect. The agency’s progress
toward its long-term vision is a direct reflection of the commitment, dedication, and
hard work of this agency’s 3,000+ employees and its elected Board of Directors.

DRAFT

DRAFT

The Strategic Plan is RTD’s “north star,” and its four Strategic Priorities serve as the
functional pillars upon which decisions are made in addition to being used to plan,
develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance:

While the Strategic Plan has successfully guided and informed the agency’s
strategic endeavors over nearly four years, the journey that began in 2021 is far
from over. RTD continues to evolve to meet the diverse mobility needs of customers
and communities across the region, much as it has over the agency’s 56-year
history. New challenges and opportunities arise, new partnerships are forged, new
technologies emerge, the region’s population centers and activity hubs shift and
expand, and all the while, RTD continues to rise to meet the occasion.

Thank you,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

As I look back on my tenure with the agency, I am proud of what we have achieved
collectively, and I am excited for the prospect of future successes. As I have said
many times, RTD is on the precipice of change, and I stand proud to serve alongside
the individuals who comprise this agency as we continue along this important
journey. Together, as “One RTD,” we will shape a brighter future for this region.

Strategic Plan
The following pages outline the Strategy Pyramid on which RTD’s
Strategic Plan is built. The agency’s vision, mission and values
outline what we aspire to achieve, what we do and what we stand
for. Successive levels in this structure note what we will focus on for
the life of the plan, as well as in the short- to medium-term to achieve
long-term goals. Intentional areas of emphasis in the
agency’s work explain how we will get there – and how each
employee will contribute.

The Strategic Plan is a living document and is subject to periodic
revision during its duration. The version before you is the second
iteration of the Plan first adopted by the Board of Directors in August
2021; it reflects updated agency performance metrics approved by the
Board in 2024 as well as strategic planning best practices garnered
since the Plan’s inception. The Plan’s Vision, Mission, Values, Strategic
Priorities, and Success Outcomes remain unchanged.

DRAFT

To make purposeful progress in any personal or professional
endeavor, you must have a plan. French author Antoine de SaintExupery declared it more than 80 years ago when he wrote: “A goal
without a plan is just a wish.” American educator Stephen Covey
was more direct in his approach to this idea, stating that to achieve
effective results, one must “begin with the end in mind.”

Duane, who operates Routes 3, 130
and 52 for RTD through contractor
Transdev, decorates the bus to
which he is assigned for every
major American holiday, including
Independence Day, Memorial Day,
Halloween, Easter, St. Patrick’s Day,
Valentine’s Day and New Year’s
Day. “My philosophy is, ‘My bus
is my office space, and I want to
be proud of what I am in,’” said
Duane, who joined Transdev close
to two years ago. “For my 10-hour
shift, I want to be happy, and all my
passengers want to be happy.”

“On behalf of the RTD team that
convened on Nov. 14 for the
Veterans Day Networking Breakfast
at Blake, I wanted to personally
thank Business Program Manager
Betsy and the Communications
and Engagement Department for
planning and hosting a wonderful
event to celebrate RTD’s military
veterans that served either in
an active-duty, reservist and/or
national guardsmen capacity. This
provided a momentous opportunity
to recognize and honor the military
veteran community, as well as the
opportunity for staff across the
agency to share stories about their
military careers and connect on a
more personal level.”

“I arrived at the airport after being
on a business trip for two weeks. I
was lugging a backpack and two
47.5-pound suitcases with two
weeks of clothing and all my tools.
I took the A Line to Peoria Station
and transferred to the R Line to
Lincoln Station. When I got on the
train, operator Gerald noticed the
many bags I was carrying with me
and asked where I was getting off.
He told me that he would make it
a point to stop at the platform at
Aurora Metro Center Station so I
could use the ramp. Getting the
heavy bags on and off using the
stairs is not easy. The operator was
happy, good-natured and did care.
I so much appreciated the extra
effort he put into it.”

Operator remains professional during
tense situation with customer

Bus operator’s commitment to safety,
friendliness sparks joy

“Route 105 operator James handled a
tense situation masterfully. When the
bus arrived at Southmoor Station, there
were quite a few buses ahead of us,
including another Route 105 bus, and
the driver had to pull around to Gate C.
Another customer was irate about that,
ignored the driver’s request that he move
away from the front door until we pulled
into the gate, yelled that he was going
to miss his train and then said, ‘This isn’t
even the right gate,’ followed by some
offensive language. I commend the driver
for remaining professional.”

“I wanted to pass along a driver’s
commendation. Mallard, the driver of the 8
a.m. eastbound Route 28, is an exceptional
driver and representative of RTD. This route
passes a senior center. He always welcomes
passengers aboard and ensures they are
seated safely before departing. As a regular
rider, I see this all the time. He also does this
without any delay in schedule. He knows the
regulars and is a genuine and nice guy.”

Impact Team’s assistance
appreciated during recent
maintenance work on A Line

Employees across the agency
displayed incredible teamwork
and dedication in delivering
Zero Fare for New Year’s Eve
service, benefiting thousands
of customers across the region
who relied upon RTD as they
celebrated. Thanks go to all rail
operators, supervisors and staff,
with many going above and
beyond to provide additional
trips into the morning hours. Also,
approximately 35 Transit Police
officers assisted customers on
New Year’s Eve, many riding trains
and buses. A few officers rode
bus Routes 15 and 0, as well as
the W Line, throughout the night.

“I was on the alignment checking
the crossings and the stations
when I ran into Information
Specialist Cali on our Impact
Team at Central Park Station.
The Impact Team was crucial in
helping customers coming from
our bus gates to the A Line and
instructing them how to board
the train to the airport. They also
assisted getting those traveling
to Denver Union Station back to
the correct bus gate. We were
lucky to have the Impact Team
on site helping, and there were
several relieved customers that
expressed appreciation for the
additional assistance.”
– Fabian, Employee

We will commit ourselves to continuous learning and do what it takes to
deliver our shared vision.

Construction manager uses
experience as a designer to

“Kim’s background as a
designer makes him an excellent

demonstrates a comprehensive
understanding of the field of rail
engineering. In addition, he is
instrumental in developing the
Capital Programs construction
group’s resource allocation model.
This model helps us assess our

We will approach our work in a collaborative manner, seeking and acknowledging

“I would like to highlight our Facilities
Maintenance (FM) group as they
tirelessly ensure that our employees
are kept safe during the hazardous
winter weather months. Without
their continued efforts to keep the
walkways clean and dry by coming
to work in the early hours, we would
likely have more to worry about
walking on icy, slippery surfaces. I
am particularly grateful for my FM
group here at Platte, and I would
like to highlight Bobby and his crew,
not only for his efforts outside my
building, but also inside the Platte
Wellness Center.”

“Shout out to Edward on the N
Line. He was so kind to my kids,
engaging them and making
them ‘official junior conductors.’
He taught them about trains
and how he operates them.
One of my kids had a terrifying
experience on a train last
year. Last week was the first
time riding the train since that
incident, and my daughter felt
very apprehensive. Edward didn’t
know any of this, but his way of
talking and having fun with her
helped her overcome her fear
and enjoy the ride.”

RTD Gives supports families in
need this holiday season

Zero Fare for Youth made a
permanent fare change

Eliminating transit-related traffic
fatalities and injuries

For its winter donation drive,
RTD chose to partner with A
Precious Child, a Broomfield
nonprofit that provides support
for families living within RTD’s
eight-county service area. The
organization’s empowerment
resource center provides a costfree store where families can shop
for clothing, food, home goods and
other essentials. At the conclusion of
the RTD Gives drive, RTD collected
enough winter clothing donations
from team members and customers
to fill a dozen 34-gallon-sized
contractor bags.

Zero Fare for Youth was launched in
September 2023 as a one-year pilot
program, enabling all youth 19 and
younger to use RTD services at no
cost. After it began, RTD received
positive feedback from many
schools about the program’s impact
in reducing truancy, and it garnered
support from school districts, youth
organizations, and customers
across the Denver metro region.
The Colorado legislature passed a
bill in May 2024 to appropriate up
to $5 million to RTD to continue a
zero-fare program for youth. With
approval by the Board of Directors
in July 2024, the program became
a permanent fare change.

RTD is bolstering efforts to
eliminate traffic fatalities and
injuries within its transit operations
and infrastructure by outlining
agency-specific initiatives related to
a Vision Zero strategy. Vision Zero
is an internationally recognized,
data-driven systems approach
to increase personal safety in
transportation spaces. The initiative
recognizes that traffic-related
deaths and serious injuries are
preventable and disproportionately
affect vulnerable populations,
including cyclists and pedestrians.
A resolution adopted by the
Board of Directors in October
2024 highlights RTD’s current and
ongoing efforts related to roadway
and customer safety.

Platte bus operator’s approach
to his work is the ‘gold
standard’

Hundreds of bus operators
admitted to 5280 Safe
Driving Program

“The Triennial Review is one of
the Federal Transit Administration
(FTA)’s management tools for
examining recipient performance
and adherence to current FTA
requirements and policies. The
triennial is not just a financial
review – it is a review of the entire
agency, touching nearly every
department throughout the district.
The FTA wants to ensure we are
protecting and maintaining their
investment. Dozens of colleagues
across the agency worked diligently
to gather requested documents
and provide information in a timely
manner. I commend them all.”

“Richard is the gold standard
of bus operators. Without fail,
he goes the extra mile. Greets
everyone cheerfully when they
get on the bus. Gives a person
a quick moment to get in their
seat, along with not hitting the
numerous bumps in the bus lane
hard, so people don’t fall or get
shaken. Calls out the major stops.
Repeatedly thanks people and
wishes riders a great day. You feel
like you matter, that the day will be
better from that ride.”

In May 2024, two-thirds of RTD’s
bus operators were admitted to
the 5280 Safe Driving Program,
meaning the recipient had driven
for at least one year without a
preventable accident. More than
200 operators had driven accidentfree for at least five consecutive
years. For the first time, mileage
was considered – honoring 77
operators who drove at least
100,000 safe miles. Platte operator
Destiny, who carries more than
six years of safe driving, said she
consciously takes time before
starting her day to center herself.
“You have to be cautious, you have
to read the road ahead, you have
to take care of your passengers,”
she said. “I go out there and do
the best I can. I go slow. There’s no
need to be in a hurry.”

Internal Communications
team refines its strategy to
communicate with employees

In 2024, Maintenance of Way
(MOW) employees replaced rail
along the Southeast Corridor to
restore normal service speeds for
customers. Due to the scope of
rail replacement and maintenance
needed, this project might ordinarily
be outsourced to a third-party
contractor. “They’ve really risen
to the occasion,” Dennis, RTD
Light Rail Maintenance of Way
Manager, said of the team’s efforts.
“They’ve been able to leverage
their knowledge, skills, and abilities.
What’s impressed me is how they’re
able to problem solve and come
to a collective agreement on how
to mitigate hazards and do the
work safely.”

RTD completed the first phase of its
downtown rail reconstruction work
three weeks ahead of schedule.
The multi-phased rail project, which
began in early June 2024, will
resume in 2025. The first phase of
the Downtown Rail Reconstruction
Project focused on reconstructing
light rail track and infrastructure
at five key intersections in the
Downtown Loop.

Taking into account research and
observations shared in listening
sessions in 2023, the Internal
and Executive Communications
team in 2024 refined its strategy
and introduced new tactics to
ensure RTD’s workforce of more
than 3,000 employees remained
engaged and informed. The team
collaborated more closely than
ever with individuals, groups, and
divisions across RTD to share
information of agencywide interest.
In addition, an Employee Ownership
Task Force group began meeting
in March that focused its efforts on
improving employee satisfaction
with the communication of agency
news, projects, and initiatives. The
group’s recommendations were
presented to the Leadership Team
in December.

Hundreds of managers and
supervisors complete training

In July 2024, RTD-PD gained a
team member unlike any they had
seen before – a full-time college
student named Johan Sherpa, a
senior at University of Colorado
Denver studying criminal justice.
Sherpa joined the Transit Police
Department through its new
police cadet program, providing
insights about day-to-day work and
providing credit for most colleges
and universities. RTD Acting
Co-Chief Steve Martingano created
the program for students to learn
about the agency and explore the
public safety field. “The program
dedicates time and resources
to make sure someone knows
what they’re coming into when
considering being an officer,” he
said. “Police work is more of a
calling and a passion.”

In June 2024, more than 480 RTD
managers and supervisors from
throughout the agency completed six
modules of training developed by the
agency’s reimagined Development
and Training Division. The team
worked for nearly a year to make it
possible. Employees were intentionally
placed into mixed cohorts so that
their classmates were not necessarily
the people they see every day.
Recognizing that participants came to
training with differing roles, lengths
of tenure and experiences at RTD,
the training ensured that managers
and supervisors received uniform
information around expectations for
these positions, including how to take
ownership, support team members,
and lead a team. Groups took part in
ample discussion about how agency
values could be incorporated into
daily work. “I think that was the most
important thing: getting back to
basics and level setting training,” said
Development and Training Manager
Dr. Melissa McDowell.

A substantial safety and security
project completed in 2024 is in use
on all RTD buses: the addition of
live look-in equipment in case of an
emergency situation. The live lookin software supersedes a system
on agency buses for decades.
Using the prior technology, dispatch
could only hear audio inside the
bus. With the addition of the live
look-in system, RTD’s public safety
dispatchers can use a secure,
cellular network connection to
hear audio and view video in real
time from the cameras on board
that vehicle. The agency’s light rail
vehicles will be retrofitted with this
ability by June 2027, in accordance
with state requirements. Commuter
rail vehicles, maintained by
concessionaire Denver Transit
Partners, already have this
capability on the company’s own
private wireless network.

Starting in May 2024, RTD’s Transit
Police Department made a change
long desired by staff: It added an
overnight team of RTD-PD officers
to respond to calls across the
agency’s system. Assistance with
call response in early morning
hours previously was provided
by Allied Security, police officers
on secondary contracts with RTD
or other police agencies as they
were able. “By having RTD-PD staff
respond,” noted Co-Acting Chief
Glyn Horn, “we will always be that
priority for both our employees
and customers.”

“Transit Police Officers Dominick
Castiglione, Brian Beary, and Erik
Giles demonstrated exceptional
dedication and professionalism in
handling a bomb threat involving
a bus near Sheridan Boulevard
and West 82nd Avenue in Arvada.
The vehicle was inspected by
Westminster Police Department
and the Denver County Sheriff K-9
unit, and no suspicious items were
located. Despite the tense situation,
the officers ensured the safety of
passengers and the bus operator
during the process.”

often provides his customers with
more than a wide smile and a warm
greeting – he has helped many
people plan a trip, understand the
agency’s fare structure, and figure
out efficient connections. And he
does this in English and Spanish.
It is these qualities that led Rubio

specifically, Favorite Regional Bus
Driver. Treating his customers with
respect and dignity is important to
Rubio, who is focused on delivering

Public transportation plays a
critical role in the health of the
communities it serves. RTD’s
dedicated team of transit
professionals encounter customers
who may be experiencing a
personal crisis on any given day.
As the conversation around mental
health awareness and personal
safety continues, RTD is doing its
part to provide help by creating and
sharing a Safety and Mental Health
Resources card. These flyers are
printed in English and Spanish and
include contact details for Customer
Care and the Transit Police
Department, helpful community
groups and 24-hour crisis support.
Updated cards were first placed
on light rail trains and fixed-route
buses in August 2024, and by early
2025, they were added to RTD’s
commuter rail lines. Transit Police
colleagues also carry copies of
these cards to provide customers.

After 30 years of continual
light rail service, the agency
invested tens of millions of
dollars into reconstructing track
in the downtown loop, as well as
completing the final phase of the

to customers on this scale required
a new approach, one that RTD
carefully crafted leading up to this

A complimentary, high-frequency bus service provides another convenient transportation
option between Union Station and Civic Center Station.
The service operates with limited stops during morning and evening rush hours along 18th and
19th streets. Free MetroRide is part of RTD FasTracks’ 2004 voter-approved plan to expand
transit across the downtown Denver area.

Flatiron Flyer

SkyRide

The Flatiron Flyer service features 18 miles of express and high-frequency bus service
between downtown Denver and Boulder, serving Westminster, Broomfield, Superior,
and Louisville. Express lane extensions, queue jumps at highway ramps, enhanced
shelters, ticket vending machines, and electronic monitors with bus arrival information all
contribute to enhanced travel time, reliability, and customer experience.

Express service to Denver International Airport (DEN) via two separate routes serve Boulder
and Greenwood Village, respectively, and several stops in between. The 104L, 145X, and 169L
bus routes also serve the airport.

FlexRide

Commuter Rail

FlexRide is on-demand micro transit, delivering first- and last-mile service within select
RTD service areas. It is an ideal service for customers traveling to appointments, to run
errands, or to connect with other RTD services in specific neighborhoods. Customers
may book reservations online or by phone. FlexRide fares mirror regular RTD fares with
discounts available to seniors, LiVE participants, youth, individuals with disabilities, and
Medicare recipients.

Three commuter lines are operated by Denver Transit Operators (DTO), a privately held
company that is contracted by RTD to operate and maintain this system within the
Denver metro area. The N Line is directly operated by RTD. The four commuter rail lines,
i.e. A, B, G, and N, carry more passengers, operate at higher speeds, and make fewer
stops than light rail. The A, B, G, and N lines provide fast, convenient service from
Denver Union Station.

46

Access-a-Ride is the agency’s branded ADA complementary paratransit service. It provides
curb-to-curb localized transportation in the metro area for customers with disabilities. Customers
can select from either a subscription service or a reservation service, with the ability to schedule
rides up to seven days in advance. Fare is limited to twice the applicable charge for a similar trip
on a fixed route. Also available for eligible Access-a-Ride customers is Access-on-Demand.
RTD works closely with the ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee, a representative panel from
the disabled community, health care and social services officials, service providers and state/
local representatives, on all aspects of the service.

Light Rail
Using electric-powered trains, light rail transit runs on the street, in highway medians, or
underground. With a mix of widely spaced stops to cover long distances, and more frequent
stops in the downtown area, light rail consists of the D, E, H, L, R, and W lines.

Fiscal Year 2025 Budget Summary
Revenue
RTD derives revenue primarily from sales and use taxes collected within RTD’s boundaries. These taxes comprise
67% of RTD’s funding sources and are subject to economic volatility necessitating maintenance of three months of
operating reserves in accordance with RTD’s Fiscal Policy RTD is also a recipient of federal funding which comprises
26% of revenues and is apportioned to RTD based on information provided to the FTA’s National Transit Database
(NTD). Customer fares only contribute 4% of revenue and are collected according to fare modifications implemented
in 2024 which lowered and simplified RTD’s fare structure. The remaining 3% of revenue is collected from investment
income and other miscellaneous sources such as advertising revenues.

Operating
Expenses

$1,233,611,000

RTD’s largest annual expenditures support the core mission to provide transit services to customers. Appropriations
for these operating expenses are developed from the System Optimization Plan (SOP) to deliver efficient transit
services including the necessary expenses for support services. The largest portion of these expenses is for people
power in which RTD employs over 3,000 dedicated employees. RTD also contracts over 50% of transit services to
private employers.

Debt
Service

$229,427,000

Debt Service
RTD has incurred debt obligations that were primarily entered for the voter-approved FasTracks transit system
expansion as well as lease-purchase agreements to finance the purchase of equipment such as buses and trains.
These obligations consume a significant portion of revenue sources each year and management constantly monitors
these obligations for opportunities to reduce the debt service burden through refinancings and has limited financial
risk by only issuing fixed rate debt with call provisions.

Financial Forecasts
Annual budgets are developed from longer-term financial forecasts which seek to balance projected revenues with
projected expenditures to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability. Each year, RTD develops a Five-year Financial
Forecast (FYFF) which establishes the financial constraints to which annual appropriations must adhere. In addition,
RTD periodically provides a 30-year financial forecast to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) for
coordination with state and local agencies to develop a regional Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP).

In Fall 2025, RTD will begin preparation efforts to conduct a new COA
in 2026, focusing on future service modifications and community needs.
The process to complete an updated COA will typically take 18 months
and the final plan will incorporate feedback and input from customers,
stakeholders, and the public.
The COA will analyze boardings, customer demand, operator staffing
levels, land use population growth, transit-oriented and housing
developments, employment centers, and travel patterns. The final COA
will serve as RTD’s roadmap, ensuring the agency remains efficient and
responsive to community needs.

DRAFT

In July 2022, the RTD Board of Directors adopted the System
Optimization Plan (SOP), the agency’s branded name for its COA. The
SOP is a detailed evaluation of travel patterns, demographics, and transit
routes in the service area, and it includes recommended modifications to
RTD’s fixed-route services to better meet near-term mobility needs in the
region. RTD’s planned route reinstatements and modifications can be
found in the 2022 SOP.

The FFTP takes a “Facilities First” approach, which focuses on preparing the facility
infrastructure and the workforce before new vehicles are delivered. The plan details the strategy
and actions that RTD should take in the near-term (2025–2035) to meet RTD’s 2050 net zero
emission goal.

Work conducted as part of the FFTP included:

The near-term strategy outlined in the plan provides RTD with the flexibility to take immediate
cost-effective emission-reduction strategies, while also providing the agency the opportunity to
take advantage of future improvements to pricing, availability, and technological capabilities.

• A fixed-route fleet analysis, which assessed various propulsion systems and their ability to meet RTD’s
existing and future provision of services
• A facility analysis, which assessed RTD’s facilities and the upgrades needed to support a new fleet
technology, as well as evaluated how a potential new facility could help support new fleet technologies
• A workforce analysis, which assessed the skills needed to maintain newer technologies, and to
ensure RTD’s workforce will be prepared for a transition
• A financial analysis, which utilized RTD’s mid- and long-term financial plans to evaluate costs and
identify potential funding sources for a transition

The near-term strategy outlines a plan for the purchase of 451 new diesel hybrid buses and 75
battery electric buses by 2035. The purchase of these vehicles will be dependent on necessary
upgrades being completed at RTD’s bus facilities prior to the procurement of those vehicles.
The total incremental capital cost of implementing the near-term strategy outlined in the FFTP
is $591 million, a figure that includes the facility upgrade costs and the cost to purchase diesel
hybrid and battery electric buses, which are significantly more expensive than diesel buses.
Federal and state funding sources are available to help pay for some of these costs; however,
the amount of available grant funding is significantly less than RTD’s needs.

The Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan (FFTP) assessed RTD’s current and future operations to determine a
path forward for how the agency can lower emissions in its facilities and fleet. While all RTD rail is electrified,
this holistic approach was necessary, as transitioning a large fleet of buses to alternative technologies will
have significant implications on the infrastructure needed to support such an endeavor.

The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) provides direct feedback to the RTD Board of
Directors on public transit and customer concerns. Areas of feedback include operations,
preventative maintenance projects, new capital projects, customer communications, and state
and local transportation legislation.
The CAC has 17 seats comprised of residents and businesspersons from around the district,
each appointed by the RTD Board of Directors. Members serve for a maximum of two,
three-year terms, with approximately one-third of the committee’s 17 seats up for appointment
each year. Members receive a transit pass to access RTD’s services in recognition of their
time commitment.
RTD promoted CAC membership through extensive outreach, including emails to 150+
organizations, a news release to major media outlets, and distribution to 670 contacts,
including TMOs, public information officers, and media subscribers.

Subregional Service Councils
In 2022, the agency established Subregional Service Councils (SSCs) to more directly engage with local stakeholders on matters
related to service planning and local transportation issues. Based on travel sheds for RTD services, the councils split the agency’s
district into five separate subareas: Southwest, Southeast, Northwest, Northeast, and Boulder County.
The councils provide a forum for dialogue about the agency’s services and any related concerns or opportunities. Meetings typically
occur quarterly, and membership includes local jurisdiction staff, transportation management organizations, transit advocates, and
non-profits that represent RTD’s customers. The agency specifically included transit advocates and non-profit organizations to have
a more diverse representation on the SSCs. This ensures that under-represented customer groups have a voice in the planning of
RTD’s services.

APAC provides feedback and advises RTD on issues and concerns related to paratransit services and its operation. APAC
applications are open year-round, with rolling three-year terms. RTD recruits via IVR messages and targeted outreach to paratransit
centers to ensure balanced individual and organizational representation.

Customer Feedback Panels

RTD Impact Team

RTD Listens

The Impact Team, introduced in 2024, consists of RTD employees who are routinely deployed to RTD stations and facilities. These
ambassadors provide assistance in real time, answer questions, demonstrate how to use our services, and offer specific information
that helps customers achieve a greater comfort level with our services.

An essential component of RTD’s Strategic Plan involves critical ongoing feedback from those we have the privilege to serve.
The agency establishes and maintains mutually beneficial relationships with community partners, customers, and stakeholders,
as well as outreach programs, across our service area. These continual engagement efforts help us to collaboratively identify
service delivery challenges and opportunities, brainstorm solutions, and provide assistance where and when customers need
it most. Following is brief snapshot of several formalized outreach and engagement programs.

Represented Workforce
More than two-thirds of RTD’s workforce are represented by either the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU 1001) or the
Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Lodge 72. Both unions advocate for their members by negotiating collective bargaining agreements.
The unions also work closely with RTD’s leadership to ensure their workers have an optimal work environment that supports their
safety and well-being.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
General Manager and CEO Annual Performance
Assessment Overview

April 14, 2025

REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Performance Committee (committee) is responsible for oversight and management of the General
Manager and CEO’s (GM/CEO) employment agreement, compensation package, and annual
comprehensive performance assessment. Following the committee’s consideration, the GM/CEO’s
performance assessment and any corresponding incentive and adjusted base compensation are reviewed
and approved by the Board.
On September 24, 2020, RTD and GM/CEO Debra A. Johnson entered into a five-year employment
agreement (Agreement). The Agreement sets forth her compensation and benefits, as well as a program
by which the Board, in consultation with Ms. Johnson, establishes performance goals and metrics,
annually evaluates her performance, and utilizes a framework for determining future incentive awards
and increases to base salary subject to her meeting or exceeding these goals.
The Agreement has been amended by the parties on eight occasions. During the regular monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board adopted the Seventh Amendment to the agreement,
which required the Board, no later than October 31, 2024, to “retain an external consultant to conduct a
total compensation study (“Total Compensation Study”) and take appropriate action consistent with the
Compensation Philosophy adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023. Such Board action includes a
review of the Total Compensation Study findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of
the Compensation Philosophy principles, consideration of any information provided by the GM/CEO
Johnson, and consultation with GM/CEO Johnson prior to the Board taking any action. Such review and
action does not require the Board to adopt any Adjusted Base Salary or other compensation increase.”
Also on January 30, 2024, the Board approved the 2024 General Manager/CEO Performance
Assessment Framework. The approved framework, which currently remains in place for the period of the
GM/CEO’s current employment contract per the Eighth Amendment, described herein), was developed in
conversations between past Chair Lynn Guissinger, then-current Chair Erik Davidson, the Performance
Committee, the Executive Committee, the Chief People Officer (CPO), and GM/CEO Johnson.
On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted the Eighth Amendment to the agreement, which:

Required the Board, by January 31 each year, to determine, with respect to GM/CEO
Johnson’s annual performance assessment, outcome ratings with corresponding point
distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values, and Attainment
of Short-term Goals
Established a cadence of quarterly performance discussions between the Board and GM/CEO
Johnson
Established that, in light of the Board’s adoption of and adherence to a GM/CEO
Compensation Philosophy on September 26, 2023, GM/CEO Johnson is ineligible for overperformance goal incentive payments and automatic Cost of Living Adjustments formerly
contemplated in the Agreement

DISCUSSION
Consideration of this Discussion Item demonstrates RTD’s commitment to the Strategic Priority of
Employee Ownership. The attached presentation provides an overview of the current GM/CEO annual
performance assessment framework as well as a timeline of the Committee’s and the Board’s
considerable progress toward establishing a purposeful, repeatable process to evaluate and manage the
performance of the GM/CEO, which is one of the Board’s most important functions. Additionally, the
presentation outlines the 2025 performance assessment process as well as next steps.

ABOUT RTD:
The Denver metropolitan area and the State of Colorado are world-renowned destinations for recreation,
sports and culture. The entire region is welcoming, diverse and offers fantastic places to live and raise a family
with some of the best public schools, colleges and universities that the nation has to offer. Whether enjoying
restaurants and breweries, taking in iconic scenery, or experiencing culture and history, the surrounding region
is an excellent place to live and work.
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is the region’s public transit agency created in 1969 by the Colorado
General Assembly, connecting Denver residents through an affordable, safe, clean, reliable, accessible, and
customer friendly community-oriented transportation network. As a nationally recognized leader, RTD
provides public transit services, including rail, bus, access, and shuttle services across 2,400 square miles to 40
municipalities (3.1 million people) within eight counties including Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Jefferson and
parts of Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas and Weld Counties. RTD is governed by a 15-member, publicly elected
Board of Directors each serving a four-year term.
The region prides itself on innovation, inclusion, multi-culturalism, diversity, and environmental sustainability
and RTD’s vision is further enhance the region’s quality of life as well as to augment the pattern of urban
development throughout the region. RTD continues to develop dynamic programs to benefit both business
and the community it serves, making RTD an important cornerstone for the Denver community.
In 2004, RTD embarked upon the nation’s largest public transportation capital expansion program. RTD has
been steadily working on its commitment to deliver on this voter-approved program, known as FasTracks.
While, circumstances have changed and budgets have been stressed with economic events occurring such as
the 2008 recession, in 2019, RTD embarked upon a two-year “Reimagine RTD” effort. Even with this effort
underway, uncertainties still exist with COVID-19 and other unforeseen factors arising.
As such, RTD is continuously listening to its communities’ needs and striving to find necessary funding and cost
savings that will support creative transit solutions in order to uphold its commitment to provide safe, timely,
affordable, convenient, accessible and equitable transit solutions to the entire region. By reimaging transit and
creating a new vision, RTD is committed to supporting the economic engine that the greater Denver region has
become while also being a key partner in social, economic, environmental, and sustainable development
programs.

GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.

NU

AR

On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31. Following an election year, this timing also allows newly elected
Board members an opportunity to participate in the goals and metrics development discussion.

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with

DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals and associated weighting for the performance period
commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing through October 15, 2025 (2025 performance period).

BO

The proposed goals for the 2025 performance period, which are tied to the Strategic Initiatives of
Customer and Community Connections, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment, are as
follows:

02

5

Strategic Initiative: Customer and Community Connections – RTD is committed to fostering community
building and enriching the customer experience.

28

,2

Short-term Goal 1: No later than September 30, 2025, to increase light rail service availability
to 96% (50% of goal) and to increase annualized on-time performance for fixed-route bus to
83% (20% of goal), for light rail to 83% (20% of goal), and for commuter rail to 96% (10%
of goal).

Y

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
overall customer satisfaction and perception of on-time performance.

JA

NU

AR

Historically, RTD’s bus and commuter rail service availability metrics have remained above 99%,
meaning that, for every 100 trips scheduled, more than 99 trips are operated. Light rail service
availability has been impacted in recent years due to several factors, including but not limited to
operator availability and state of good repair and preventative maintenance activities. Overall light
rail service availability for 2024 was 94.34%, meaning that, of the 223,205 trips scheduled,
208,412 were actually operated.

FR

O

M

On-time performance is influenced by numerous factors, including elements both within RTD’s
control (e.g., operator availability, scheduling, and maintenance) and outside of it (e.g., regional
traffic patterns and road congestion, service impacts resulting from construction and street
detours, weather, and supply chain issues). Increasing on-time performance by even small
increments requires budgetary support as well as a considerable, concerted effort of Bus and Rail
Operations teams as well as Service Planning, Human Resources, Capital Programs personnel
among others.

Short-term Goal 2: To achieve total vehicle boardings of 69,562,000 during the period from
October 1, 2024 and ending September 30th, 2025, where the percentage goal achievement
is calculated from a baseline of 66,307,000 boardings.

BO

AR
D

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to
community perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s
provision of service to major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase
goal of 6%.

02

5

RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service
delivery contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP) adopted by the Board in July 2022.
Funding in calendar year 2025 for the increase in revenue service hours of approximately
102,000 was included in the 2025 Budget, approved by the Board on Tuesday, December 3,
2024.

28

,2

Annual boardings for the period commencing October 1, 2023, through September 30, 2024,
totaled 65,767,000. A 3% year-over-year increase as contemplated in this goal would equate to
nearly 2,000,000 additional boardings, the equivalent of 5,400 additional boardings daily.

AR

Y

*RTD’s estimated 2024 revenue hours totaled 3,089,109. Note that this estimate does not
include demand-response revenue hours.

JA

NU

Strategic Initiative: Welcoming Transit Environment – RTD seeks to reduce the impacts of criminal
behaviors and Code of Conduct violations on agency’s services and workplaces and, in doing so, to
improve community and employee perception of personal and public security on RTD property and
vehicles.

O

M

Short-term Goal 3: To increase customer survey responses by 4% from CY2024 to CY2025
in relation to questions pertaining to customers’ perception of a) feeling safe and secure
while waiting at stops or stations and b) feeling safe and secure aboard vehicles.

FR

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics related to
customers’ perceptions of personal safety and security.

Attachment: 2025-01-28 Approved 2025 GM-CEO Short Term Goals (as amended) (5111 : General Manager and CEO Annual Performance

For the first 11 months of 2024, average on-time performance for fixed-route service by mode is
as follows:

Packet Pg. 132

PA
CK
E

T

Customer Excellence surveys conducted in 2024 indicate that 55% of bus and rail customers felt
personally safe and secure while waiting for fixed-route transit vehicles, and 62% of bus and rail
customers felt personally safe and secure while aboard vehicles. While these responses are
significantly higher than national averages for transit agencies, staff anticipates that an increase
in customer perceptions of safety and security will yield corresponding increases in boardings as
well as customer satisfaction with RTD services.

A draft of these goals is attached for the committee’s consideration during the Performance Committee
meeting scheduled for Tuesday, January 21, 2025. Should the Board not adopt short-term goals for the
GM/CEO by the January 31 deadline specified in the contract, the goals automatically revert to those
adopted for the prior performance period.

AR

Additional Goal added during the January 28, 2025 Board Meeting:

BO

Short-term Goal 4: To identify at least four comprehensive Vision Zero strategic initiatives that
are new or innovative to RTD, to be identified no later than October 15, 2025.
At least two strategic initiatives will aim to increase ridership through encouraging
modal shift by reducing barriers to access (50% of goal)

At least two strategic initiatives will aim to eliminate traffic fatalities or serious injuries
within RTD's operations and infrastructure. (50% of goal)

proper maintenance and operational strategies.
Benchmarking: Many systems, such as Phoenix’s Valley Metro light rail, consistently approach or exceed
the proposed 83% and 96% targets, providing a practical benchmark for other transit agencies.
Incentives for Improvement: Cities like Seattle and San Diego, where on-time performance currently falls
below targets, highlight the need for focused improvements. Setting ambitious yet realistic goals ensures
these agencies prioritize investments and operational enhancements.
Public Confidence: Meeting or exceeding these targets is critical for maintaining public trust and increasing
ridership, as seen in San Diego’s significant ridership growth despite challenges in meeting OTP targets.

Combined boardings on RTD’s system in May, April, and October of 2024 were 17,349,000 boardings1. These were
the most recent three months with available data that did not include a major maintenance project suppressing
boardings. A baseline calculated from recent performance is the best approach for purposes of evaluating
performance improvement, as it reflects growth that was achieved during 2024, and which therefore should be
expected to be repeated in the subsequent performance period. Annualized, and adjusting for 2019 seasonal trends2,
maintaining ridership at the level achieved during those three months would result in 66,307,000 boardings3.

The achievement target is based on growing boardings above this annualized number by 5%. Five percent (5%) is
an achievable target, based on the expectation that the agency should be able to drive increased boardings from 1)
restoration of service frequency on many routes 2) additional service offered on some new routes and 3) it would
represent a post-COVID recovery to 65.8% of pre-COVID (2019) ridership, still below the recovery achieved by the

While it is a common practice in organizations to base employee performance assessments on a combination of
objective and subjective measures of performance, for CEOs, basing emphasizing objective performance goals is the
best approach.

AR

Y

28

Intuitively, the reason for this is simple - few top executives are selected for CEO roles without having shown
experience and leadership characteristics that demonstrate their ability to perform the basic responsibilities required
of the job. Despite this, not every CEO is able to achieve the quantitative goals that are set by stakeholders and
which are necessary for the organization to be sustainable over time. For RTD, the proposed 2025 goals are all
quantitatively measured, and are among the most important measurements for determining whether the organization
is effectively serving the public that pays, largely indirectly, for its existence.

Academic research into the subject shows that the best performing CEOs are those who have their incentive
compensation based entirely on quantitative criteria. In their study “Firm Performance Implications of Using
Qualitative Criteria in CEO Bonus Contracts” (Advances in Management Accounting, Vol 31, pp. 55-89, 2019,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3077142), Nancy Chun Feng and Ahmet C. Kurt report that
their analysis of data for S&P 500 companies reveals that employee productivity, asset productivity, capital
expenditures, and future stock returns are lower when the CEO’s bonus payment depends in part on qualitative
criteria. Other research demonstrates that in the case of CFOs, they report lower satisfaction with compensation
when
incentive
compensation
is
awarded
subjectively
(https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2013/sep/20138319.html). In line with this observation, other
academics have long argued that qualitative assessments in decision-making were irrelevant when one could make
a reasonable judgment based on quantitative criteria. His thesis has been proven to work in different settings, such
as graduate school admissions and financial analysis.
Recent past performance frameworks for the current GM/CEO have specified that Objective Goals be 50% of the
basis for her performance assessment. Since all of the Short-term Goals that have been proposed for this period
focus on important issues that have a basis for quantitative measurement of performance, returning to the 50%
weighting for Short-term goals would put RTD’s GM/CEO performance assessment better in line with best practices.

Without increasing per-rider fares over current levels, and excluding fares derived from para-transit services,

in calendar year 2024 by reducing fare evasion.

Widespread fare evasion is a clear problem on RTD’s assets. The goal of increased fare collections without fare level
increases can and should be accomplished by increased efforts to address fare evasion. Reasons to reduce fare
evasion include:

Lax enforcement of laws like the requirement for most riders to pay a fare to use RTD suggests to customers
that RTD does not care about rider conduct. Enforcement of the basic responsibility for riders to pay fares is
an important demonstration that following the rules on RTD assets is expected and breaking these rules will
have consequences.
The future ability of RTD to better serve its community may depend on its securing additional funding from
taxation, or from state or local entities funded by taxation. Making the case to elected officials and the tax
paying public - many of whom do not use RTD or who largely do not represent those who do - is made more
difficult when RTD does not take care to collect the fares it is owed from the riders who are obligated to pay
for their rides.
Every rider’s fare may not be able to be checked on every ride, but by creating the expectation that it often
will be, many riders will simply pay their fare as a matter of course. Over time, fares from reducing fare
evasion should far exceed the 2025 goal, and can generate enough money to allow RTD to meaningfully
increase its services to the public.

Increasing collected fares by reducing fare evasion by $5 million would mean collecting fares on approximately 1.8
million trips over 12 months where they are not currently collected at the cheapest standard fare, or roughly 2.5%
of expected 2025 boardings. It equates to collecting fares on some 5,000 more of the roughly 180,000 boardings
each day. Personnel used to collect these fares will have the side benefit of increasing the visible presence of RTD
authorities on assets, improving perceptions of rider safety and security.

The Goal (and the mandate) does not include Access-on-Demand, which is a premium paratransit service
Guidelines for Access-a-Ride metrics are also established by the FTA; RTD risks liability if those KPIs dip too
low
This enhancement aligns with our Board-approved Strategic Plan Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success
Returning directors know that former Director Lewis and I personally pressed to include Access-a-Ride metrics
in our KPIs. I have also asked for AaR metrics to be included in any GM/CEO performance goals that include
service performance KPIs for FY25. As such, this should be no surprise - and I do sincerely hope the BoD can
