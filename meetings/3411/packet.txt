BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Reimagine RTD Project

Committee Meeting Date:
June 15, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO
William Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
90 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Reimagine RTD project, which commenced in the summer of 2019, is a generational effort that
includes RTD’s first-ever System Optimization Plan (SOP) and a Mobility Plan for the Future. Board
discussion to date has focused primarily on the SOP, which will be the topic of Board action in July
2022. This Study Session is intended to accomplish the following:
• Provide a brief update on the draft SOP prior to Board action in July 2022
• Enable Board discussion on signature aspects of the Mobility Plan for the Future
DISCUSSION
Reimagine RTD provides the opportunity for the agency to answer the question of “what’s next” for
RTD. The first portion of the Mobility Plan for the Future segment of the presentation is intended to
summarize three possible long-range financial scenarios, including an explanation of strategies to balance
costs with revenues. Each scenario portrays alternative futures for ridership, system expansion, and
finances.
The second portion provides perspective on policy concerns discovered during the Reimagine RTD
process, and is intended to stimulate Board reflection on three horizon-year topics that entail both
challenges and opportunities:
• Board has varying perspectives on the goals for how and where to provide service
• Long-term, under all scenarios, there is a substantial gap in funding
• Significant gap is evident between public/stakeholder expectations and what can
be provided now and in the future, both from a financial and a people power perspective

Key Fiscal/Financial Findings
§ Prior to 2020:
• Operated more service than allocated resources
• Deferred state of good repair

§ Long-term financial projections indicate limited/no capacity to:
• Grow bus/rail services
• Make substantial capital investments
• Complete any FasTracks segments over 20 years
There is a significant gap between public/stakeholder expectations and
what can be provided now and into the future

What We Have Learned – Key Policy Concerns
1. Varying Board perspectives regarding how/where to provide service
2. Substantial long-term funding gap
3. Significant gap between public/stakeholder expectations, what can be
provided now/future

Does the Board support these recommendations?
Are there any elements missing?

§ Develop clear messaging about value of increasing funding, based on priority list
§ Obtain regional priority list support/buy-in
