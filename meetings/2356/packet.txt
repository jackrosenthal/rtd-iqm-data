BACKGROUND
Staff is required to present the 2016 Requested Budget to the Board of Directors prior to
posting it for public inspection. RTD must post its 2016 Requested Budget for public
review and comment by October 15, 2015 in order to meet Colorado legal requirements
(CRS 29-1-101). The preliminary 2016 Requested Budget is included in this document in
order to comply with these requirements.
At this time, Staff is presenting the preliminary first draft 2016 Requested Budget.
Preliminary 2016 Requested Budget numbers are subject to further revision and a budget
update will be presented at the October 20th Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting. The 2016 Recommended Budget will then be presented at the November 10th
Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with Staff requesting approval to
move to the Board of Directors for ratification of the 2016 Adopted Budget on November
17th.
DISCUSSION
The Board has requested that staff keep it informed on key budget issues that RTD is
facing and provide opportunities for Board members to offer early input during the
development of the 2016 annual budget. Our previous communication included the 20162021 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), which forms the basis for the 2016 budget and which
was approved by the Board in August, as well as a presentation on our budget theme,
assumptions and target expenditures for 2016. The budget is driven by the three top
strategic goals established by the Board of Directors for 2016, which consist of fiscal
sustainability, openings of rail lines and BRT, and technology.
During development of the 2016-2021 SBP for the Base System, staff presented a
balanced budget to the Board for 2016. Staff has worked to develop a preliminary
proposed budget for the Base System as set forth in the approved 2016-2021 SBP. Staff
also incorporates FasTracks budget numbers for both FasTracks Project and FasTracks
Operations. The FasTracks budget is developed separately from the SBP. Both the Base
System and FasTracks preliminary budget make up the 2016 Requested Budget presented
here.
The 2016 Requested Budget is compared to the 2015 Amended Budget below with
change from period to period (in thousands). The summary data is from the attached
Exhibit I.

Overview
The 2016 Requested Budget is a first draft budget and includes estimates for sources and
uses. The budget items will continue to be reviewed and the final version incorporating
any necessary adjustments will be the 2016 Recommended Budget scheduled for adoption
in November. This Requested Budget will be updated for items such as fare revenue
estimates, sales taxes, grant revenue, and capital expenditures for both new capital and
capital carry forward amounts. Operating expenses will likely be revised for specific
changes.
As stated earlier, staff has developed the 2016 Requested Budget based on guidance from
the SBP for 2016 for the Base System and by incorporating the FasTracks 2016 budget.
The 2016 Requested Budget on a combined basis includes the following:
(1) Fare revenue:
a. A fare revenue increase is budgeted for 2016 to align with the new fare
structure and the opening of FasTracks service lines. Farebox revenue of
$158.1 million in 2016 is budgeted to increase $34.7 million over 2015
due to the new fare structure and the new FasTracks lines (I-225, US36,
East, Gold, and Northwest Rail). Base System ridership growth is
expected to be flat to minimal. Ridership projections are derived from
RTD’s planning model and the FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation.
(2) Other operating revenue:
a. This amount includes advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and
miscellaneous operating revenue.
b. Other operating revenue is increased at the CPI over the 2015 Amended
Budget but otherwise kept flat. The amount will change if more

information becomes available for the 2016 Recommended Budget. The
current run rate for other operating revenue is generally on track with the
2015 budget.
(3) Sales/use tax:
a. Combined sales/use tax of $590.5 million is budgeted to increase 8.0%
over the 2015 projection, concurrent with the CU-Leeds School of
Business September forecast.
b. The 2015 projection will increase 6.2% over 2014 actuals in the CULeeds School of Business September forecast.
c. The 2016 budget will incorporate no further updates from CU-Leeds
School because the December forecast will be received after the 2016
budget is approved by the Board.
(4) Grant revenue:
a. Total grant revenue is estimated at $334.6 million, an increase of $49.3
million over the 2015 Amended Budget.
b. Operating grant revenue is $96.2 million the Base System and $0.4
million for FasTracks. Base System operating grant revenue is budgeted
to increase $18.6 million from the 2015 Amended Budget due to an
increase in capital maintenance, fixed guideway, bus facilities funding,
CMAQ, CDOT, and FASTER grant funding for specific programs.
FasTracks operating grant revenue is budgeted to decrease $0.8 million
due to a decrease in STAMPS grants. The $0.4 million in grant funds for
FasTracks in 2016 is a CMAQ grant for the Free MetroRide.
c. Remaining grant funds consist of capital grant revenue of $238.0 million.
Of this amount, $19.5 million is budgeted in the Base System and
$218.5 million is budgeted in FasTracks.
Combined capital grant
revenue is expected to increase $30.7 million from the 2015 Amended
Budget with most of that coming from FasTracks due to an estimated
$58.2 million New Starts grant for the Southeast Rail Extension. The
combined increase to capital grant funds is offset by decreases in the
Eagle Corridor CMAQ grant, the Civic Center SOGR grant, and other
grants such as for the Boulder Transit Village.
d. As more information becomes available and the capital carry forward
budget is finalized, capital grant revenue estimates will change
accordingly in the Recommended Budget.
(5) Investment income:
a. Combined investment income totaling $1.5 million is projected to
decrease $2.8 million from the 2015 Amended Budget due to continued
low short term rates along with deployment of invested funds.
Unrestricted investable fund balances are projected to decline as project
funds are drawn down for fleet purchases and construction projects. For
this reason, the largest percentage decline in investment income will
come from FasTracks.
(6) Other (non-operating) income:
a. Other non-operating income is up slightly from the 2015 Amended
Budget due to more accurate estimates; included in the estimate is the
University of Colorado payment for naming rights on the A Line and an
increase in the Build America Bonds subsidy for FasTracks.

2016 Requested Budget
September 29, 2015
Page 7

Attachment: 2016 Requested Budget Board Report 092915 (2529 : 2016 Requested Budget)

b. Recurring non-operating revenue is increased at the CPI (with the
exception of the Build America Bonds subsidy) over the 2015 Amended
Budget. The amount will change if more information becomes available
for the 2016 Recommended Budget. The current run rate for other
income is generally on track with the 2015 budget.
(7) Operating expenses:
a. District-wide operating expenses (including expense projects) of $563.6
million are budgeted to increase $8.1 million from the 2015 Amended
Budget, which represents an increase of 1.5%. Base System operating
expenses are budgeted to increase $5.6 million, FasTracks Project
expenses are budgeted to decrease $52.1 million, and FasTracks
Operations expenses are budgeted to increase $54.6 million.
b. Note that the expense projects carry forward (previously approved
expense projects) is not included in the 2016 Requested Budget; this will
be identified and included in the final 2016 budget.
c. FasTracks Capital Programs will account for $52.0 million of the decline
in FasTracks Project expenses due in large part to completion of the
US36/CDOT managed lanes carry forward project.
d. Operating expenses are allocated to the FasTracks Operations using a
cost allocation model that allocates historical unit costs on the basis of
resource drivers. The BRT service is allocated on the basis of unit costs
by service hours. Sales tax is allocated from FasTracks in an amount to
fund FasTracks operations costs and result in sources minus uses of
zero. FasTracks Operations consists of West Line, Denver Union Station,
Free Metro Ride, and US36 BRT.
e. FasTracks Operations also includes the $45.7 million estimated service
payment to Denver Transit Operators for Eagle operations and
maintenance beginning in 2016. The expense is included in the Rail
Operations budget.
f. Diesel fuel is budgeted at $2.23/gallon, which is the lock price in 2016.
This price is $0.72 less per gallon than the lock in 2015, resulting in an
incremental savings of $7.4 million from 2015.
g. Gasoline is currently budgeted at an average cost of $3.40/gallon, which
is $0.14 less per gallon than the price used in the 2015 Amended Budget
for an incremental savings of $0.630 million.
h. Certain items in the 2016 Requested Budget totaling $7.6 million
materialized after the SBP was approved, including RTD’s increased
contributions to the salaried and union pension and benefit plans,
merit/progression adjustments to salaries, and various other smaller dollar
items including the public outreach safety campaign, digital marketing,
and postage for promotional events of which all are deemed necessary
for roll-out of the FasTracks service lines in 2016. These items will be
covered by the increased sales/use tax dollars forecast and slightly higher
forecasted grant revenue.
(8) Debt:
a. Budgeted principal payments of $61.7 million on a combined basis are
$2.8 million higher than the 2015 Amended Budget.

Packet Pg. 9

2.1.a

b. Base System principal payments of $51.9 million are $1.9 million higher
than the 2015 Amended Budget due to scheduled amortization of the
Base System COPs issued for fleet purchases.
c. FasTracks principal payments of $9.8 million are $0.8 million higher than
the 2015 Amended Budget due to issuance of COPs and scheduled
principal amortization on current debt.
d. Budgeted financing proceeds of $150.0 million will result from debt
issuance of new bond funds for capital program construction for
FasTracks (mainly the Southeast Rail Extension). No debt issuance is
anticipated for the Base System because 2016 fleet purchases were
funded by COP issuances in 2015.
e. Such financing proceeds, or the issuance of new debt, will be lower by
$179.1 million in total from the 2015 Amended Budget. FasTracks will
issue $130.8 million less debt than budgeted in 2015. Both Base
System and FasTracks will draw from previously issued debt to fund
major capital purchases and construction in 2016.
(9) Interest expense:
a. Interest expense is budgeted at $117.3 million, an increase of $21.9
million from the 2015 Amended Budget due to issuance of COP debt in
2015 and anticipated debt issuance in 2016 noted above.
b. Of total interest expense, $27.3 million is budgeted for Base System and
$90.0 million is budgeted on FasTracks.
c. Capitalized interest is budgeted at $32.9 million, a decrease of $12.0
million from the 2015 Amended Budget. Capitalized interest is the
interest expense associated with construction projects that is capitalized
as part of the asset value on the balance sheet.
(10) Capital expenditures:
a. Base System new capital expenditures total $111.6 million. This is the
amount approved in the SBP and escalated at the CPI of 3.1%.
b. FasTracks new capital expenditures are estimated at $526.2 million.
This is a preliminary amount subject to change in the Recommended
Budget as estimates for project expenditures in 2016 are reviewed and
completed.
c. Capital carry forward (previously approved capital) is not estimated at
this time but will be included in the Recommended Budget because it is
based on the 9/30/15 close of RTD’s financial statements.
(11) Reserves:
a. The combined TABOR reserve is budgeted at $20.5 million.
b. The FasTracks contingency reserve is budgeted at $15.9 million at yearend. This reserve was set at $30.0 million in the 2015 Amended Budget
and was reduced by a Board-approved transfer to the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) project. The SERE transfer will be replenished in 2016
and the reserve will be drawn down by $14.1 million for North Metro
which was approved in the Annual Program Evaluation
c. The FasTracks construction reserve plus start-up operations reserve are
budgeted at $81.3 million, reflecting draws of $3.7 million and $15.0
million, respectively, for FasTracks continuing construction.
(12) Fund balances:
a. Base System:

2016 Requested Budget
September 29, 2015

2.1.a

i. Increase of $3.0 million to Board-appropriated fund per the SBP
for a total fund balance of $25.2 million.
ii. Increase of $3.0 million to capital acquisition fund per the SBP for
a total fund balance of $18.0 million.
iii. The unrestricted fund balance is budgeted at $5.2 million, which
is the fund balance estimated in the SBP. This target remains
viable after having adjusted for unanticipated expenditures and
other necessary items, as well as revised sales tax and grant
revenue. The objective is to arrive at a budgeted unrestricted
fund balance as close as possible to that estimated in the SBP.
iv. Fund balances are increased in a manner consistent with Board
policy and the SBP. The total of the above fund balances is
expected to be 10.7% of projected Base System operating
expenses, or $48.4 million by the end of 2016.
b. FasTracks:
i. The total of the Board-appropriated fund, the capital acquisition
fund, and the unrestricted fund is $19.4 million and reflects 2
months
of
operating
expenses
for
both
FasTracks
Project/Construction and FasTracks Operations plus the CU
payment for naming rights on the A Line.
c. District-wide:
i. The total combined fund balances are expected to be 12.0% of
projected District-wide operating expenses by the end of 2016.
The preliminary 2016 Requested Budget and Fund Balance report which shows the
operating and capital sources and expenditures of the District for Base System and
FasTracks is included as Exhibit I.

WELCOME TO YOUR
TRANSIT SYSTEM
Attachment: 2015 Report to the Region (2638 : Handout - Report to the Region)

At RTD, we’re proud of our accomplishments in building one of the
best transit systems in the country for our customers. In May, we
celebrated one year since the opening of the Union Station Transit
Center and the Free MetroRide with both projects receiving numerous
awards for innovative transit solutions in downtown Denver and the
region. By 2030, Union Station is projected to serve 200,000 daily
passengers in and out of the station, with 500 trains per day.
And there’s more to come in 2016, as we prepare to open the new bus
rapid transit system along US 36, and four rail lines – the A line to the
airport, the B line to Westminster, the G line to Arvada, and the R line
through Aurora. When complete, our FasTracks expansion program
will provide 122 miles of new rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, and
21,000 new parking spaces.
We’ve completed construction on the commuter rail maintenance
facility, received delivery of the first commuter rail trains, started train
testing on the A line to DIA, and this summer, we began receiving
Flatiron Flyer branded buses for the bus rapid transit service traveling
between Boulder and downtown Denver.
In addition, we began a comprehensive fare study to determine
the best structure to meet the needs of our customers as our
system continues to grow. We’re maintaining our current fleet and
infrastructure through a robust state of good repair program, and
focusing on developing transit-friendly communities to promote
pedestrian-oriented environments that allow people to live, work,
shop, and play in places accessible by transit.
Finally, on April 9, we participated in Stand Up for Transportation
Day, a national day of advocacy. Sponsored by the American Public
Transportation Association, Stand Up for Transportation encouraged
the public to take a stand and ask Congress to pass a bill that funds
long-term transportation programs, such as bridges, roads, tunnels,
buses and trains.
With all of this growth, safety and exceptional customer experience
remain our top priorities. As we expand, fueling growth, connections,
and enhanced mobility, we are committed to providing our customers
with a world-class transit system.

FROM THE BOARD CHAIR
Attachment: 2015 Report to the Region (2638 : Handout - Report to the Region)

In my third year on the Board and second year as elected Chair, I am
delighted to share the progress that is being made across the District. I
want to thank and acknowledge my fellow Board members who spend
countless hours to ensure RTD’s success. I also want to recognize the
dedicated and professional work of our employees, contractors, and
sub-contractors who are the core to our success. In the past year, we
have worked together as a team to achieve significant milestones and
some of our major accomplishments include:
• Conducted a fare study in an effort to simplify RTD’s fares and better
meet our customers’ needs across the District.
• Completed construction of the new commuter rail maintenance facility.
• Received first shipment of commuter rail cars for the East, Gold,
Northwest, and North Metro Rail lines.
• Started testing on the East Rail Line, also known as the University of Colorado A line
to the airport.
• Provided nearly 105 million passenger trips across the RTD system and logged more than 4
million service hours for both bus and light rail operations.
• As a national model, staff and Board members continue to be invited to the White House,
Pentagon, and various federal agencies to participate in discussions related to policy,
transportation infrastructure investment, and innovative financing.
• Completed the Central Rail Extension Mobility Study to determine transit priorities in the
northeast and downtown Denver neighborhoods, and establish a long-term vision for the
Central Rail Line.
• Implemented the Automatic Train Stop (ATS) system that will stop a train in the event of a
major incident on the tracks.
• The Southeast Rail Line extension is moving forward. The RTD Board of Directors
approved $207 million for the extension of the existing Southeast Rail Line. The project
was also accepted in the first phase of the Federal Transit Administration New Starts
Capital Investment Program along with funding from local governments and businesses
contributing 16.5 percent.
We’re proud of these achievements and the many more to come. RTD will have a busy 2016
as we open five major transit projects being delivered through RTD’s FasTracks program.
We’re currently in the process of searching for a new General Manager, with the goal of hiring
by January 2016. I am so pleased we have a strong leadership bench built on the long-term
investment RTD has made in developing an outstanding leadership team, from which we
selected our Interim General Manager, Dave Genova. Our focus is to maintain the continuity,
stability, and health of RTD as we move forward and continue to provide safe and quality
service for our passengers.
As we look ahead, RTD is making dramatic progress, propelled by innovation, collaboration,
leadership, and creative solutions.

FROM THE INTERIM
GENERAL MANAGER

As we look for innovative ways to overcome challenges, we embrace
this exciting time that continues to demand a keen focus on a broad
range of complicated issues. We’re driven to maintain and strengthen
the operations of our current system for our passengers, residents,
and taxpayers while achieving new milestones as we work toward the
successful completion of our FasTracks transit expansion investment.
We continue to collaborate with our partners and the community to
look for new opportunities to complete the remaining partially-funded
projects sooner rather than later.
We are managing more than $5 billion in FasTracks-funded projects
and programs that are either completed, in construction or under
contract. In March we broke ground on the North Metro Line and in
May, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of the Union Station
Bus Concourse, the second of our FasTracks projects, offering more
transportation services, connections, and access than ever before.
As part of our “Enhancing the Rider Experience” campaign, we have
launched our Smart Card Program (designed to bring simplicity and
stored value to our fare media), purchased nearly 200 new buses for
our fleet, created a fare taskforce to review and work to simplify our fare
system, and are bolstering our asset management program to ensure
that our rolling stock and facilities stay in top condition for the benefit
and safety of our riders.

Attachment: 2015 Report to the Region (2638 : Handout - Report to the Region)

With presentation of this year’s Report to the Region, I am privileged
and honored to say that this past year was yet another year of
continued success and achievement at RTD. As we continue to develop
our world-class transit system and enhance the passenger experience,
we’re building innovative ways to deliver superior service from all facets
of our system. In the process, we’re setting new standards for the future
of transit throughout the nation.

We take pride in the
delivery of a wide range
of top-notch services
and excellent public
transportation options to
the millions of residents
we serve.

RTD is an organization made up of extraordinary employees doing
extraordinary things. We take pride in the delivery of a wide range of
top-notch services and excellent public transportation options to the
millions of residents we serve.

RTD BUS AND LIGHT RAIL

Attachment: 2015 Report to the Region (2638 : Handout - Report to the Region)

At RTD, our goal is to provide a safe, sustainable transit option for
all members of the communities we serve. We constantly strive to
enhance our services, expand our network, and conserve resources,
all while maintaining our current system. By connecting communities
and providing easy and convenient transit options, we hope to
increase the quality of life for our riders.
RTD offers a comprehensive and robust system of bus and light rail
service – with some impressive numbers to prove it. And every year
these numbers keep getting better:
Active Bus Fleet:
1,037 total buses

Light Rail Operations:

• 596 - RTD owned and
operated

• 46 light rail stations

• 441 - RTD owned and leased
to private couriers

• 172 light rail vehicles
• 48 miles of track
Combined Service:

• 324 Access-a-Ride vehicles

• 104,962,344 annual boardings

• 54 Call-n-Ride vehicles

• 45,246,715 fixed route service
miles operated annually

Parking Facilities:
• 74 Park-n-Ride facilities

• 138 regular fixed routes

• 26,418 parking spaces
In 2014, we opened the Union Station Transit Center, with a new 22bay underground bus concourse serving 16 bus routes, including the
Free MetroRide. And there’s a lot more to come. In 2016, with the
opening of the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit system and four rail lines –
the A line to the airport, B line to Westminster, G line to Arvada, and
R line through Aurora, you’ll be able to get just about anywhere you
want to go.

On any given day, RTD
provides transportation
to more than 300,000
passengers on its bus
and light rail system.

We provide service to Rockies, Broncos, and CU Buffs games with
more than 470,000 annual boardings as well as providing service to
Avalanche and Nuggets games, special events at the Pepsi Center,
BolderBoulder and Race for the Cure.
In addition to our fixed-route buses and special services, we
also operate dedicated Access-a-Ride service for our customers
with disabilities.
As we continue to expand and increase our services, these numbers
will only continue to grow, proving a longstanding commitment to
better serve our community.

2014–2015 FASTRACKS MILESTONES
Aurora Line/I-225 Rail (Nine Mile to Peoria)
The 10.5-mile light rail line will extend from the existing Nine Mile
Station to a future station at Peoria, which will allow passengers
to transfer to the East Rail Line, soon to be known as the A line to
the airport. The rail line will serve major destinations throughout
the city of Aurora, including the Aurora City Center, the Anschutz
Medical Campus, and the future VA Hospital. Construction on the
segment from Nine Mile Station to the new Iliff Station is complete as
part of the I-225 highway widening project with RTD, the Colorado
Department of Transportation and SEMA Construction. Kiewit
Infrastructure Co., the project contractor, will complete construction.
Central Rail Extension (Downtown Loop to 38th & Blake)
The extension of the Central Rail Line will run slightly under a mile
from the 30th & Downing Station and will connect with the East Rail
Line at the 38th & Blake Station which is under construction. We
conducted the Central Rail Extension Mobility Study in late 2014. The
study identified the most feasible rail route and operating plan that
will provide a direct connection between the 38th & Blake Station and
downtown Denver with no transfers. As the project progresses, we will
continue to update the cost estimate.
Eagle P3
The Eagle P3 project is building RTD’s first commuter rail lines—
the A line to Denver International Airport, B line to Westminster,
and the G line to Arvada and Wheat Ridge. Under a single 34year concession contract with Denver Transit Partners (DTP), this
innovative public-private partnership is the nation’s first transit project
to use design-build delivery, privatized operations and maintenance,
and a significant level of private financing. The Eagle P3 project
also includes the purchase of 66 new commuter rail trains and the
construction and operation of a new commuter rail maintenance
facility, located in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood. Funding for the
project combines a grant from the Federal Transit Administration, local
revenues from RTD, and private equity from DTP.

East Rail Line (Union Station to DIA)

Attachment: 2015 Report to the Region (2638 : Handout - Report to the Region)

The 22.8-mile commuter rail line between Union Station and Denver
International Airport has started train testing as civil construction
has been wrapped up. Power lines are being electrified, and the
project team has rolled out a robust safety education campaign,
going to nearby schools and meeting with neighborhood groups
and community organizations. Rail car delivery from the assembly
plant in Philadelphia is averaging four per month until all 66 trains
are in Denver. Later this year, Denver Transit Partners will provide
official notification of the date for the opening of the line. All stations
have been constructed with canopies and other platform facilities
being installed, and construction of all Park-n-Ride lots is underway.
Roadway construction, mostly along Smith Road has been completed
with the exception of Smith, Albion, and 40th, which will be finished to
coincide with the line opening in Spring 2016.
Free MetroRide
The Free MetroRide, RTD’s newest downtown bus service, officially
began service on May 12, 2014. This high-frequency bus service
provides the “final mile” between Union Station and Civic Center
Station during morning and afternoon rush-hours.
Gold Rail Line (Union Station to Ward Road)
Construction of the rail alignment is wrapping up, with final relocation
of the BNSF Railway track west of Olde Town Arvada and the
installation of the eastbound Gold Line track. Construction of all
seven stations is underway. RTD and Arvada completed the approval
process of reconfiguring the parking and bus transfer facility at the
Olde Town Arvada Station, and the city has begun work on the parking
garage adjacent to the platform which will be completed by opening
day. All 11 bridges are nearing completion. Power pole installation has
begun, with overhead wiring as the next step. The new commuter rail
maintenance facility, in Denver’s Globeville neighborhood, has been
completed and rail cars are being stored and tested at the facility. The
first train operators have been hired and are in training. The line will
open Fall 2016.
North Metro Rail Line (Union Station to 162nd Avenue)
Design on the North Metro Rail line is nearing 90 percent completion
and early construction has begun on the first phase of the project
between downtown Denver and 124th Avenue. Old tracks and
ties along the rail line are being removed and recycled, and utility
relocations are underway. Bridge construction is scheduled to begin
this summer, marking the start of a two and a half year project, which
is scheduled to open in 2018. RTD continues to seek funding for
phase 2 of the rail line from 124th Avenue to Colorado Highway 7,
and has an option with Regional Rail Partners, the contractor on the
project, for a fixed price as long as funding is acquired and committed
by December 2015.

The Westminster segment of the Northwest Rail Line (6 miles from
DIA to Westminster Station) is under construction and will open
in Summer 2016. RTD and the City of Westminster, along with the
commuter rail concessionaire Denver Transit Partners, have agreed on
a reconfiguration of the Westminster Station at 71st Avenue and Irving
Street that will provide transit parking in a garage instead of a surface
lot. The agreement also includes an enhanced pedestrian underpass
to the platform that will provide a connection to the city’s other
projects – a regional park and mixed-use transit-oriented development
near the station.
In addition, the 15 month-long Northwest Area Mobility Study, was
conducted to determine transit priorities in the northwest region. The
results include completing the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit commitments,
the planning and implementing of up to seven arterial bus rapid transit
routes (as funding from non-FasTracks sources is identified) the first
being Colorado Highway 119 and US 287, and working with the
Colorado Department of Transportation on improving the bi-directional
commute on the I-25 HOV lanes during peak hours. Completion
of the Northwest Rail Line is the long-term preferred mobility
option for the corridor and will be annually reviewed for
implementation opportunities.
Southeast Rail Line Extension
(Downtown to RidgeGate Parkway)
The 2.3-mile light rail extension will move the current end-of-the-line
station at Lincoln Avenue and I-25, south to RidgeGate Parkway. As
part of its application for federal funds, RTD has been accepted into
the first phase of the Federal Transit Administration New Starts Capital
Investment Program.
Additionally, local business associations and businesses in the
southeast metro Denver area have committed to contributing $25
million in cash and $15 million in right-of-way, permits and other inkind contributions to get the light rail extension project completed.
This local match would comprise 16.5 percent of the project cost and
far exceeds the 2.5 percent match RTD has asked of its local partners.
Of the project’s total $207 million cost, RTD’s investment would be
$66 million or about 32 percent.
Four teams have been selected to bid on building the rail line
extension. The teams received a Request for Proposal in February and
their proposals were due to RTD in May. After a finalist is selected and
the RTD Board awards a contract, the Notice to Proceed (NTP) for
design work is expected to be granted later this year while the NTP for
construction is expected in 2016.

The 2.5-mile light rail extension will move the current Southwest Rail
Line end-of-the-line at the Littleton/Mineral Station, southeast to the
southwest corner of the C-470/Lucent Boulevard interchange. RTD is
working with local stakeholders in an effort to identify funds to move
the project forward.
Union Station
As part of the redevelopment around the historic Union Station
building, the Union Station Bus Concourse opened for service on May
11, 2014. This new 22-gate underground bus facility serves 76 buses
during peak hours, including the Free MetroRide, which provides easy
connections to all the transportation options available downtown.
US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Construction of the first phase of the US 36 express lanes project,
from Federal Boulevard to Interlocken, is nearing completion. The
express lanes, along with the bikeway, opened in June. Phase 2 of
the project, from Interlocken to Table Mesa, will be completed in
early 2016. The BRT service (known as the Flatiron Flyer) will begin in
January 2016.
West Rail Line (Union Station to Jefferson County
Government Center)
The West Rail Line, better known as the W line, opened on April 26,
2013 and ridership continues to grow. Art installations at stations
along the line have been completed.

Creating greater access,
improving quality of life
RTD’s approach to fostering transit-oriented development continues
to evolve as the District changed the name of this division from
Transit-Oriented Development and Planning Coordination to
Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC). The new name reflects RTD’s
commitment to help create communities that are not just close to
transit, but that are also better connected, more equitable, and have a
diversity of housing and jobs.
RTD’s Alameda Station Pilot Project, officially named Denizen, was
completed in August and is ready to house its first residents. Denizen
is expected to be the first LEED platinum apartment complex in the
Denver metro area, and was specifically designed for residents who
want to use transit. Every unit will have access to shared car and bike
parking, which will be useful by the new dedicated bike lanes built
around the area. The project includes 275 residential units within a
stone’s throw of the Alameda Station, as well as a new transit plaza
with a bus loading area for RTD customers.
The Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station is a mixed-use
development above a new RTD bus facility that anchors one end of
the US 36 Bus Rapid Transit line. This project includes a 150 room
Hyatt hotel, the Depot Square apartment complex with 71 affordable
residential units, a parking garage with 75 spaces reserved for RTD
customers, new public art, plans for a future restaurant as well as the
rehabilitation of the historic Boulder Train Depot. The RTD bus station
has begun operations.

One of our main goals has
always been to create more
sustainable, livable, and
accessible communities
through nearby transit.

Another highlight of the year was the successful re-opening of the
historic Denver Union Station building on July 12, 2014. New life
was breathed into the site with the conversion of the upper floors
into what is now the Crawford Hotel, and the lower floors housing
award winning restaurants and retail shops. The revitalization of Union
Station has won several awards, including Sunset Magazine’s Travel
Award for Best Newly Saved Landmark, NAIOP Colorado’s Deal of the
Year Award, and currently the project is a finalist for the Urban Land
Institute’s 2015 Global Award for Excellence.
We also started planning for the future Civic Center Station
redevelopment, we’re partnering on equitable housing development
opportunities near RTD stations, and working with the RTD Board
of Directors on updating TOC policies that will guide the District’s
approach to future transit-oriented communities.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Statement of net position - As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, total
assets of RTD exceed total liabilities by $3.18 billion and $2.98 billion,
respectively. The largest portion of this excess, 93.9% in 2014 and 93.6%
in 2013, was invested in capital assets, net of related debt. RTD uses these
capital assets to provide public transportation services to customers;
consequently these assets are not available for future spending.
The amount of unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2014 was
$19 million compared to $53 million in 2013. Substantially all of the
unrestricted net position, although not legally restricted, has been
appropriated or reserved by the RTD board for future capital acquisition,
reserve policy requirements, and debt liquidation. The decrease in
unrestricted net position relates to additional debt service for rolling stock
replacement and capital projects, and the financial statement recognition
of the union net pension obligation. RTD is required to record this net
pension obligation but has no liability beyond its contributions.

REVENUE ANALYSIS
(Dollars in thousands)

Sales and use tax – Sales and use tax provided 54.8% and 49.2% of
RTD’s total revenues in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Sales and use tax
is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the service
area. Sales and use tax increased $46,135 (9.8%) in 2014 compared
to an increase of $18,799 (4.2%) in 2013. In 2014 and 2013, the
District experienced growth in tax revenues due to an upturn in
consumer and business spending activity.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided
8.0% and 9.3% of total revenues in 2014 and 2013. Grant operating
assistance decreased $12,699 (14.4%) in 2014 compared to an
increase of $19,316 (28.0%) in 2013. Certain one-time grants were
received for the FasTracks project in 2013. The operating assistance is
a federal grant revenue program used to perform capital maintenance
and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local
contributions provided 22.0% and 25.5% of total revenues in 2014
and 2013. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $36,135
(14.9%) in 2014 and decreased $69,110 (22.2%) in 2013. The
decrease in 2014 resulted from lower capital contributions related the
completion of the Denver Union Station (DUS) multi-modal hub capital
project. The decrease in 2013 resulted from lower capital contributions
related to nearing completion on capital improvements being made to
the Denver Union Station multi-modal hub as well as having received
one-time contribution relating to an intergovernmental agreement on
the East Rail Line during 2012.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 12.8% and 12.4%
of total revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Farebox receipts,
monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and
rail services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares grew by
$2,656 (2.3%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $4,912 (4.3%) in
2013. The increase in 2014 was due, in part, to a full year of revenue
service of the West Line light rail line which opened April 2013 while
additional increases in both years were due to a higher participation in
fare media programs.

EXPENSE ANALYSIS
(Dollars in thousands)

Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense
category accounted for 15.6% and 16% of the total expenses in
2014 and 2013. Purchased transportation represents the costs of
contracted transportation services for bus, Access-a-Ride, and Calln-Ride services. Purchased transportation costs increased $1,936
(1.7%) in 2014 compared to $1,876 (1.7%) in 2013. The increase in
both years was primarily due to negotiated contract increases.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category
accounted for 8.5% and 9.2% of the total RTD expenses in 2014 and
2013 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $2,642
(4.1%) in 2014 compared to an increase of $6,498 (11.1%) in 2013.
The decrease in 2014 primarily occurred due to a decrease in diesel
fuel prices from an average of $3.26 to $3.12. The increase in 2013
occurred due to the opening of the W Line and an increase in diesel
fuel prices from an average of $2.73 to $3.26 per gallon.

Salaries and wages – After several years of wage and salary freezes,
salary and wage expense is the largest expense category accounting
for 19.5% and 19.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2014 and 2013,
respectively. Salary and wage expenses increased by $7,453 (5.5%) in
2014 compared to an increase of $8,103 (6.4%) in 2013. Increases in
both years occurred from salary and wage performance (result based)
and progression increases.

CAPITAL ASSETS UPDATE
Investments in capital assets include: land and rights-of-way,
buildings and improvements, leasehold improvements, revenue and
non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s
investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, in
2014 was $5.4 billion compared to $4.7 billion in 2013. The increase
in capital assets in 2014 was $717 million (15.3%) compared to an
increase of $641 million (15.8%) in 2013. RTD acquires its assets with
sales and use tax revenues, farebox revenue, federal capital grants,
and proceeds from the sale of revenue bonds, and certificates of
participation. The significant investment in capital assets during 2014
was primarily due to the cost of planning, design, and construction of
FasTracks projects.
Investments in capital expenditures will continue due to expansion of
RTD’s FasTracks program. The program will build a comprehensive,
integrated, region-wide transit network that will provide a reliable
and safe system, enhance mobility, and respond to the growing
transportation needs within the eight-county Regional Transportation
District. Funding for the FasTracks program is secured through
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) grants, sales tax and other
revenues, issuance of long term debt, and public-private partnerships.
CAPITAL ASSET PROJECT UPDATES
Union Station – RTD, with assistance from the City and County
of Denver (CCD), the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG), and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT),
acquired historic Denver Union Station (DUS) in August 2001. Union
Station and the surrounding property were developed as a mixed-use,
multi-modal transportation center located at and in the vicinity of the
original Denver Union Station Historic Building. Expenditures for 2014
were $39 million for the construction of assets.
Along with the redevelopment of Denver Union Station as a multimodal transportation center, a contract was entered in December
2012 with Union Station Alliance (USA) to redevelop the Union Station
historic building. The redevelopment of the historic building included
the Great Train Hall, Amtrak facilities, a 110-room hotel as well as
restaurant and retail services. The building was completed and
opened to the public July 2014. USA leases the historic building from
RTD and will operate and maintain these new amenities.
West Rail Line – Known as the W Line, began revenue service in April
2013. In 2014, expenditures related to the W Line were approximately
$10 million.

North Metro Rail Line – RTD entered into a construction contract
with Regional Rail Partners to complete the commuter rail line from
Union Station to 124th Avenue by 2018 with an option to extend
construction to 162nd Avenue when additional funding is identified.
In 2014, expenditures related to the North Metro Rail Line were
approximately $96 million.
Northwest Rail Line – In 2014, the Northwest Area Mobility study
was completed to determine cost-effective improvements and
explore several options, including regional bus rapid transit, alternate
alignments to Longmont, and building a segmented rail system as
funds become available. RTD and other stakeholders are actively
utilizing the study to determine how this project will proceed.
East and Gold Rail Line Public-Private Partnership (Eagle P3) –
In 2010, RTD entered into a public-private partnership to design, build,
finance, operate and maintain several of the transit improvements
included in the FasTracks program. The Eagle P3 project is a $2.19
billion project that includes the East, Northwest Rail electrified
segment and Gold Rail lines and the Commuter Rail Maintenance
Facility. The Eagle P3 partnership was awarded to Denver Transit
Partners (DTP) through a competitive bid process culminating in a
contract price that was $305 million below internal estimates.
In 2014, construction expenditures related to the Eagle P3 project
were $407 million. Project elements are described below:
• East Rail Line – The East Rail Line is a 22.8-mile commuter rail
corridor between Union Station and Denver International Airport.
• Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility – The Commuter Rail
Maintenance Facility was designed to service the four planned
commuter rail lines (East, Gold, North Metro, and Northwest)
included in the FasTracks plan.
• Gold Rail Line – The Gold Rail Line is an 11.2-mile rail corridor
between Union Station to the vicinity of Ward Road, traveling
through northwest Denver, unincorporated Adams County, Arvada,
and Wheat Ridge.
• Northwest Rail Line Electrified Segment – The Northwest Rail
Line electrified segment is a 6.2-mile electric commuter rail line
between Union Station and Westminster Station at 71st Avenue
and Irving Street.

Sales and use taxes are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 54.8% and 49.2% of the total revenues in 2014 and 2013
respectively. Sales and use tax revenues are affected by changes
in the local economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
monthly State Coincident Economic Activity Index places Colorado
among the top states for economic growth. Since 2012, Colorado’s
economy has had the fifth best growth according to the measure.
The index is one of the most up-to-date broad measures of state
economic activity and matches growth in a state’s gross domestic
product (GDP) over time. It combines four state-level indicators to
track current economic conditions − employment, average hours
worked in manufacturing, unemployment rate, and inflation-adjusted
wage and salary disbursements.
Sales tax revenue is also helped by the State’s collection of a new
sales tax on retail marijuana from the passage of Proposition AA by
voters in November of 2013. In 2014, RTD received approximately
$2.1 million in retail marijuana taxes.

DID YOU KNOW?
With the opening of the A, B, G, and R rail lines
in 2016, RTD will more than double the amount
of rail track across the district from 48 miles to
98.7 miles. The additional miles will make it
easy to get just about anywhere you want to
go with RTD.

our system and services,
we connect more
communities and provide
better transportation
options with an emphasis
on safety and the customer
experience. Now that’s
progress in motion.
