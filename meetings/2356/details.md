## II. 2016 Requested Budget Workshop

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, reminded the Board that the 2016-2021 Strategic Budget Plan was approved in August, which is used as a basis for the 2016 Requested Budget (Requested Budget).  Staff also provided a high level overview of the theme, assumptions and expenditures of the Requested Budget at the September Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting.  She said tonight she would review the preliminary first draft of the Requested Budget.  She reiterated that this is a first draft that is subject to further revision, especially as the capital carry forward has not yet been estimated as it is based on a September 30th close.

Jannette Scarpino indicated that the budget included Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations sources and uses as well as a reconciliation of net assets, reserves and fund balances.  She said the next step is to provide a presentation at the October 20th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.  Staff will present the final 2016 Recommended Budget at the November 10th Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting with a request for adoption of the 2016 Budget at the November 17th Board Meeting.

Director Bagley expressed his appreciation for all the work that staff does in developing the Requested Budget and SBP.  He wondered if there is a specific area that staff worries about in the budget that the Board should pay particular attention to.  He conveyed his concern about the sources of RTD funds and changes that could occur with lower gas prices.  Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer, stated that staff feels comfortable with the expenditures in the Requested Budget, especially now that the Diesel Rate Lock has been established.  She has two areas of concern which are farebox revenue and sales and use tax.  Staff used the projected farebox revenue figure that was approved as part of the SBP.  Heather Copp noted that farebox revenue is down this year and staff is unsure if this trend will continue; however, staff does not have any additional information that indicate those assumptions should be changed.   On the sales and use tax side the actuals were below budget for the first part of the year but have recovered in July.  There is always a concern that sales and use tax will be under what is budgeted but staff will continue to monitor this through 2016 and advise the Board.

Director Hoy inquired if there were funds in the budget for adding new routes.  Heather Copp noted that Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, has been advocating for that.  There is money budgeted for service changes, which is 1% of the operational budget.  Bruce Abel explained that these funds would be for system maintenance and adjustments, not for new routes.  Heather Copp said any significant changes would probably require additional funding and therefore come back to the Board for approval.  Director Hoy pointed out that there is a route in his District that will be extended further North.  He wondered if this was considered a new route or if this would be considered a system adjustment.  Heather Copp stated that would be considered a system adjustment.

Director Francone asked if there was an increase in the budget from 2015 to 2016 and if so, by how much.  Heather Copp stated there was a difference of $345K but that does not include the capital carry forward; however, the funding for these projects is already budgeted but would flow through to 2016.

Director Menten asked if there was a process used to evaluate whether there can be cost savings found in a department’s budget.  Jannette Scarpino explained that as part of the SBP each department is given a target budget that should not be exceeded and Finance works closely with each department so the goals are met.  Heather Copp commented that departments underwent extra scrutiny this year since she was new.  She sat in every budget meeting and went through every department’s budget line by line.  Director Menten wondered if these meetings were productive.  Heather Copp said she thought they were.  She noted that the departments were fairly realistic in their budget requests; however, she believes there is room for improvement with the capital carry forward projects.

Director Tobiassen wondered if there were projects that departments are requesting as high priority but are being delayed due to budget.  Jannette Scarpino explained that is one way that staff balances the budget.  She said she would send Director Tobiassen the complete list of deferred projects that was included as part of the SBP approval.  Director Tobiassen thinks it is important for the Board to remember that there were many things pushed off during the recessions that have created a backlog.  Heather Copp agreed that there was a backlog but staff has been working to address the needs through the SBP process.

Chair Sisk asked if staff was satisfied that there was enough money in the budget for IT.  Heather Copp said that staff needed to do a thorough review of current projects, their status, etc.  She stated that there were some needs in the network area related to redundancy and disaster recovery.  Funding was included in the SBP and 2016 Requested Budget but there will probably never be enough money to do everything staff would like to do; however, she thinks we are in a good place for 2016.

Chair Sisk asked if there was any opportunity to refinance any of our bonds.  Heather Copp stated that the only one available for refinancing was the 2002A bonds.  Staff is not recommending a refinancing at this time because the savings will be minimal and RTD would give up flexibility for a call provision in 2018-2020; however, staff continues to monitor opportunities on a regular basis.

Director Folska noted that Jannette Scarpino said the budget would be posted on October 11.  She wondered if that was typical.  Jannette Scarpino explained that a notice is published in the Denver Post and Boulder Daily camera stating that a copy of the budget is available for review at the RTD Administrative Offices.

Director Folska expressed concern over departments being incentivized to use their full budget one year so it does not get cut back the next.  She wondered how staff addresses this and creates incentives for departments to find cost efficiencies.  Interim General Manager Genova said that managers are evaluated on how they handle their budget.  Heather Copp explained that when a department comes in under budget it does not mean the budget is automatically cut the next year.  Instead there are discussions about what caused the savings and if the funds might still be needed the next year.

## III. Fare Task Force Update - Low-Income Program (Bruce Abel)

Tony McCaulay, Senior Manager of Marketing, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the September 29, 2015 Study Session Agenda Packet.  The presentation included background information about the current Nonprofit Agency Reduced Fare Program as well as staff recommendations to simplify and streamline the program.  The current program sells the following fare media at the following discount:

- 10-Ride ticketbooks (all types) – 60% discount

- Monthly passes (all types) – 25% discount

- Monthly passes (local regular only, limit 25/month) – 40% discount

He explained that the proposed change would provide a 50% discount for all fare media (10-Ride ticketbooks, Day-pass coupon books and monthly passes).  Additionally, the proposed changes would streamline administration for the Non-profit agencies by reducing the reporting requirements and frequency of reporting.

Director James wondered if staff had solicited the input of the nonprofit community, like Mile High Connects, and how this program might work with a low income pass program.  Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, noted that this program is separate from the Affordable Fares Task Force.  He thinks this program will be different from what comes out of the Affordable Fares Task Force.  Director James inquired what staff had budgeted for the revised program.  Tony McCaulay said it would be about a $1.2 million increase.  Scott Reed noted that it was difficult to judge demand which is why staff is proposing a monthly cap on sales.  Staff is suggesting a monthly cap so there is not a scenario where a few agencies buy all the passes at the beginning of the year.

Director Lubow thanked the staff for their work.  She thinks the streamlining seems very effective.  She expressed that while this proposal is great it is still incredibly important to keep working on a low income pass program.  She asked as to the timeline for a low income pass.  Scott Reed pointed out that there would be some overlap between the Nonprofit Program and a low income pass program.  He said that currently the Affordable Fare Task Force is looking to find funding partners as everyone recognizes that it is difficult to get a sustained level of finding for this type of program.

Director Walker inquired how much RTD will receive in fare revenue.  Tony McCaulay stated that RTD would receive $3.5 million for $7 million in fare revenue.  Director Walker wondered if agencies could purchase a month’s worth of stored value on a SmartCard.  Tony McCaulay said that would not be available at the beginning; it might be an option down the road for monthly passes but SmartCards are too expensive to be issued as a single ride or round trip ticket.

Director Francone inquired if the delivery would be at the expense of the nonprofit agency as opposed to RTD.  She wondered if there were any security concerns with allowing the passes to be delivered.  Tony McCaulay stated she was correct that the nonprofit agencies would pay for the delivery.  They also have the option of going to District Shops to pick the tickets up.  He explained that RTD uses FedEx for delivery because they require a signature.  FedEx is currently used to deliver tickets to a number of our sales outlets and there have been no issues to date.

Director Francone asked staff to confirm that RTD will not be doing any kind of income verification, credit checks, etc.  Scott Reed stated that was correct; the current process will remain in place which requires the nonprofit agency to do the means testing to determine eligibility.

Director Francone expressed concern about arbitrarily increasing the cap for the program from $6 million to $7 million.  She said that she would be more amenable to leaving the cap at $6 million to assess the demand.

Director Francone shared her concern that allowing nonprofit agencies to return unused passes for credit creates another administrative task for RTD.  She thinks the nonprofit agencies would be more judicious and realistic in their purchases if they could not return them for credit.  Tony McCaulay said that returning the passes had been discussed with the departments that would administer the credits and there was not a concern about the added work.

Director Tobiassen expressed his appreciation for the simplification.  He noted that requiring the nonprofit agencies to submit logs seemed to be the accountability mechanism to make sure tickets were getting to the right people.  He wonders how RTD will ensure that is still happening.  He said he is concerned about the liability of RTD if an agency was not getting the tickets out correctly.  Tony McCaulay explained that there will be an annual certification of compliance to be signed by the CEO of the nonprofit agency as well as periodic audits by RTD staff of organizations’ recordkeeping and processes.  Director Tobiassen asked if additional staff is needed for the audits.  Tony McCaulay stated that no additional staff would be needed.  Director Tobiassen suggested that periodic updates would be beneficial for the Board.

Director James wondered how the fare revenue RTD receives under the new program is different than the program today.  Scott Reed stated that staff is anticipating about $200K more in revenue.

Director Hoy asked if staff could apply the new discount to the sales from last year to compare the revenue.  He wondered if RTD would have received more or less money with the exact same sales under the new program.  Director Hoy inquired what the proposed cap would be.  Tony McCaulay explained that there would be a cap of about $575K per month.

Director Hoy asked if the qualification was still based on WIC.  He wondered if staff had considered that there might be people paying full fares who would now take advantage of the reduced fare.  Scott Reed said that WIC was still used to determine eligibility.  He reiterated that people must qualify in order to get the reduced fares.  The new program does not change the number of people who would qualify.

Director Menten appreciates that the program is becoming more streamlined but expressed concern about the discount for ticket books going from 60% to 50%.  She commented that if someone is low income affording a monthly pass is harder than a ticket book.  She asked previously how many people bought monthly passes versus the ticketbooks.  Tony McCaulay stated that in the existing program $3.2 million was spent on monthly passes at $2.6 million was for the ticketbooks.  He said that there has been concern from several agencies about the ticketbooks but hopes that being able to recoup some of the cost from their clients might offset the increase.

Director Menten pointed out that previously there was a period of time in which expired ticketbooks could be exchanged.  She wondered if the opportunity to receive a credit eliminated being able to exchange the tickets.  Tony McCaulay explained that the credit was only for monthly passes; tickets would still be exchanged as they are today.

## IV. Overview of Smart Card Pilot 2 (Georgann Van Gemert)

Georgann Van Gemert, Marketing Account Executive, informed the Board that the second SmartCard pilot program will take place from October 12 to November 13 to test various components such as card functionality, hardware, retail pointe of sales units, etc.  All of the information gained from the pilot will be used to improve the process and develop the marketing communications plan.  She invited the any Board members who wished to participate to let the Board Office know.

Director Francone recognized that there may be concern about expanding the pilot to the public but also worries that RTD employees have more familiarity with the system.  She wonders if there is a way to include the general public.  Tony McCaulay noted that the SmardCards have been tested with our customer panel.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, explained that this pilot involves money.  By using employees the cards can be loaded with “Monopoly Money” in case something does not function properly.  Director Francone commented that since the general public does not get training she would rather do the pilot cold to see if she could figure the system out.

Director Hoy shared that he spoke with an employee who participated in the first pilot.  This employee said that things have really improved throughout the pilot process.  He thanked staff for their hard work.

Director Menten asked what kinds of problems were identified in the first pilot.  Georgann Van Gemert explained that staff is currently compiling that information to report back to the Board; however, she noted that the back end systems, such as if a person took a local versus regional trip or if they transferred, were working perfectly.

## V. Other Matters

Scott Reed shared that the Annual Report to the Region was now available on the website.  He passed out a hardcopy to each Board member.

Director Lubow asked if the General Manager Executive Search Committee (GMESC) had made any decisions about other Board members being able to submit interview questions.  Chair Sisk said that the Committee has decided there will be a subcommittee of two GMESC members who will compile the questions.  When the process begins other Directors can submit their questions to the subcommittee.

Director Francone recognized Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Light Rail, and his team for the wonderful tour they did of the Elati facility for Boy Scout Troup 554.  She said the boys were so excited to use the simulator and could not stop talking about it.  She shared that the parents who accompanied the Boy Scouts were also very impressed.  She said the tour was very much appreciated and thanked staff for their time.

Chair Sisk indicated that the Telephone Town Halls had begun.  He and Director Anderson each had one on Monday evening.  He said his was a very good experience.

Director Deadwyler recognized those who attended the Central Park Station grand opening.  She thought it was a very good event and people were very excited to see the station and artwork.  She thanked Directors James, Solano and Tobiassen for attending.
