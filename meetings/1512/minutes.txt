Discussion Item
Phil Washington, Assistant General Manager of Administration thanked everyone for
coming down and stated that RTD has a very aggressive Small Business/Minority
Business program here at RTD. He also stated that the Eminent Domain Council for
Professional Services contract went out and because RTD had no minority firms in
certified database, there was no goal on the project.
This contract issue came up a week and half ago and RTD discussed how they can
incorporate strong language to encourage Minority Business participation particularity in
the legal area.
Brian Iacono, Sr. Manager, Materials Management Contracts and Procurement talked
about the language to be included and stated that John Dawson had already shared
this language and it is self explanatory.
