Re:

June Board Update

The General Assembly concluded its work on May 9th. The Governor is on the 30-day clock to
sign or veto all legislation passed during the 2018 legislative session. SB18-001 will be signed
this Thursday, May 31st in Loveland at 10:50 am.
BBMK tracked many bills of interest to the District throughout the legislative session but in the
waning days both SB18-204 and HB18-1401 concerning RTD’s fare programs were
defeated. The low-income fare program will likely continue to be of interest to legislators in the
2019 legislative session, and BBMK will continue to work with legislators to educate them on
our efforts regarding these important issues.
BBMK will monitor all the upcoming interim committee meetings. TLRC will convene on
August 20th, 9:00 am in Room 271 and again on September 28th, 9:00 am in Room 271. BBMK
will forward the agenda for these meetings once they are posted. Another interim committee of
interest, which BBMK will keep the Board updated on, is the Alternative to the Gallagher
Amendment Interim Study Committee.
BBMK is monitoring two transportation ballot initiatives filed by the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce and the Independence Institute. Each initiative must submit 98,492 signatures by
August 6th at 3:00 pm to move forward.
•

Chamber Ballot Initiative- #18 Increase State Sales Tax to Fund Transportation
(statutory) – seeks to increase state sales tax to for 20 years beginning in 2018 from 2.9%
to 3.52% and to credit 35% of the net revenue to the highway users tax fund and the
remaining 30% of net revenue to the multimodal transportation options fund, and other
transportation funding.

•

Independence Institute Ballot Initiative- #167 Authorize Bonds for Transportation
Projects (statutory) – seeks to create a “Fix Our Damn Roads” Act that requires the
Department of Transportation to issue revenue anticipation notes in a maximum amount
of $3.5 billion dollars with a maximum repayment cost of $5.2 billion and requires the
department to use the proceeds for specific transportation projects.

Federal Update

Congress Considers FY 2019 Transportation Appropriations
The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have begun consideration of FY 2019
appropriations to fund transportation programs and the Department of Transportation (US DOT)
for the fiscal year beginning on October 1.
The House Appropriations Committee approved the House’s FY 2019 Transportation, Housing and
Urban Development (THUD) appropriations bill last week. While it is unclear when the House will
consider the THUD bill on the Floor, the full House is expected to begin Floor consideration of FY
2019 appropriations legislation with three relatively non-controversial bills (Energy-Water,
Legislative Branch, and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs) when House Members return the
week of June 4, after their Memorial Day recess.
On the Senate side, the Senate Appropriations THUD Subcommittee has held hearings to examine
the President’s FY 2019 Budget Request and various Federal transportation programs, and the
Committee is expected to consider its own FY 2019 transportation spending bill during the week of
June 4.
House Spending Bill Includes Significant Increases for Infrastructure
The House THUD bill includes an increase in funding of about $10 billion, relative to FY 2017, for
a wide range of transportation and infrastructure programs, similar to the increase included in FY
2018.


Transit Formula Funding: The House also provides $800 million above FAST Act
authorized levels for Federal Transit Administration (FTA) formula programs. This
includes: $300 million for competitive bus grants; $50 million for competitive low- and noemission bus grants; $50 million for Section 5311 rural formula grants; $200 million for

47 Offices in 20 Countries
Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP is part of the international legal practice Squire Patton Boggs, which operates worldwide through a number of separate
legal entities.



TIGER/BUILD Grant Funding: The House also provides $750 million for the
TIGER/BUILD grant program, a significant decrease from the $1.5 billion provided in FY
2018, yet well above the $500 million usually provided for TIGER in prior year spending
bills.



CIG Funding: The House THUD bill provides $2.61 billion for the Capital Investment
Grant (CIG) program, an increase above the $2.3 billion FAST Act-authorized level.

US DOT Continues to Publish Grant NOFOs as Congress Presses the Agency to Release
Transportation Funding
US DOT continues to publish notices of funding opportunity (NOFOs) for transportation grant
programs, recently publishing a Transit Oriented Development (TOD) planning grant NOFO which
follows the recent NOFOs for the TIGER/BUILD grant program and the Consolidated Rail
Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program.
Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) recently released NOFOs for its FY 2018 Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP)
and Intercity Bus Security Grant Program (IBSGP). These grants provide funding to public
transportation providers for security enhancements to protect critical transportation infrastructure.
Meanwhile, Congress continues to press US DOT during Congressional hearings to release
transportation-related funding through the CIG grant program and other discretionary grant
programs. The House Appropriations Committee also included in its FY 2019 spending bill several
deadlines for releasing NOFOs, when applications must be due, and when awards must be
announced for discretionary grant programs.
Chairman Shuster to Develop Infrastructure Proposal Before Year’s End
House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee Chairman Bill Shuster (R-PA) is retiring
at the end of this year, but he is planning to release an infrastructure proposal this summer before he
retires. What exactly the infrastructure proposal will look like is unclear, and it could be an
infrastructure bill or a framework of infrastructure principles and priorities; this could be a bipartisan
proposal, as Chairman Shuster has been working on it with the Ranking Democrat of the T&I
Committee, Peter DeFazio (D-OR).
The T&I Committee has been soliciting policy ideas and priorities from Committee members and
will likely release the infrastructure proposal in the coming months. Representative Sam Graves (RMO), Chairman of the Highways and Transit Subcommittee who is seeking the T&I Committee
Chairmanship when Chairman Shuster retires, recently said the Committee will focus on the
proposal after the August recess. Importantly, the proposal will reportedly include principles or
policy ideas that are outside of the T&I Committee’s jurisdiction, most notably a revenue solution
for Federal surface transportation programs, such as a Federal gas tax increase that is the jurisdiction
of the Ways and Means Committee.

Section 5337 state of good repair formula grants; $50 million for Section 5304(d) highdensity formula grants; and $150 million for Section 5338 urbanized area formula grants.

1.C.3.a

Chairman Shuster, who was unable to secure House GOP support for major changes to air traffic
control in his Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, may be looking for a legacy bill
before his retirement. An infrastructure bill that calls for a significant Federal gas tax increase could
solve a significant and longstanding but politically difficult revenue problem – one which the
outgoing Chairman of the transportation committee is well-situated to address.
Stakeholders Awaiting US DOT Guidance on RRIF Loan Cohorts
Attachment: Federal Update 5 29 2018 (3487 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

RTD was successful in securing language in the FY 2018 transportation spending bill requiring US
DOT to define loan cohorts as a single fiscal year and then begin refunding loan subsidies (called
credit risk premiums or CRPs) to borrowers in each loan cohort for which all debts have been
satisfied. US DOT was required to issue such guidance defining loan cohorts – the first step in the
credit risk premium refund process – within 120 days of the March 23, 2018, spending bill.
However, the guidance has not yet been released.
While the RRIF loan secured by the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) has been
repaid in full, there are a few remaining hurdles to repayment of the nearly $29 million CRP on the
loan, chiefly that the other loan in what will likely be a FY 2010 cohort is still in repayment. Squire
Patton Boggs continues to work with US DOT and the Senate Transportation/HUD
Appropriations Subcommittee to address these hurdles and secure repayment of the DUSPA CRP
as soon as possible, consistent with current law.

can be replicated across the RTD service area.
• Recommendations from the 15 stations can then be re-used and support
decision making in other parts of the district to emphasize the impact of the FLM
project.
• All criteria used to select the stations was informed by input from both the PPAC
and IWG groups.
• We offered 20 stations to advisory groups and culled to the top 15 stations that
represent a diverse range of the typologies and overlays.

• Stations with potential to change, or changes in the near future (i.e. stations
within jurisdictions that have completed groundwork or are supportive of first and last
mile solutions)
• Jurisdictional/geographical distribution (i.e. stations selected in diverse political
boundaries)
• Access (i.e. ease of access by various modes)

FASTRACKS PROGRAM OVERVIEW – EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Program has experienced many successes
and challenges since the voter-approved 0.4 percent tax increase in 2004. This document
includes: an overview of the original 2004 FasTracks Program; accomplishments to date;
modifications to delivery, costs and schedule; current financial status; as well as a summary of
next steps.
FasTracks Program Overview
The FasTracks Program was created through extensive stakeholder partnerships to provide
much-needed transit improvements to the Denver Metro area. The 2004 FasTracks Plan
(included as Appendix A) envisioned the program as a 12-year, $4.7 billion series of transit
improvements and additions. The plan’s goals included:



Provide improved transportation choices and options to the citizens of the district;
Increase transit mode share during peak travel times; and



Establish a proactive plan that balances transit needs with future regional growth.

The following map identifies the key elements included in the 2004 FasTracks Plan, including:


119 miles of light rail and commuter rail: construction of new rapid transit in six
corridors and existing rapid transit enhancements and extensions in three corridors;




57 new rail/BRT stations;
18 miles of bus rapid transit (BRT);



Enhanced bus network and transit hubs (FastConnects);



31 new Park-n-Rides and expansions to nine Park-n-Rides (adding more than 21,000
parking spaces);



The renovation of Denver Union Station into a major multimodal center providing access
to nearly every rapid transit line and regional buses, local circulators and intercity
rail/bus service;



Transit facilities and amenities to improve safety, convenience and use of the transit
system; and



Opportunities for transit-oriented development (TOD).

History
Following passage of FasTracks, RTD initiated work on preliminary engineering and
environmental clearances for the FasTracks Corridors. In 2006, as a result of safety concerns
(and partially in response to a deadly 2005 rail accident in California) the freight railroads
mandated that only Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) compliant passenger rail vehicles
would be allowed to operate in their rights-of-way. This eventually led to a change in scope and
technology for the Gold Line from light rail to commuter rail. Concurrently, in 2006 – 2007 RTD
undertook capital and operating cost analyses of commuter rail technologies for the East, North
Metro, Northwest Rail and Gold Line Corridors. Capital cost estimation for these corridors in the
original FasTracks Plan assumed diesel technologies, which have lower up-front construction
costs. However, RTD determined, based on multiple factors including lower forecasted
operating costs, that Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) technology would have lower life-cycle costs
than diesel for the East, North Metro and Gold Line Corridors. The choice of EMU technology
was also influenced by the desires of local governments and citizens, expressed during the
course of the environmental clearances, for electric-powered rather than diesel-powered
commuter rail. This decision resulted in higher capital costs for these corridors based on
infrastructure (such as overhead catenary), vehicle and right-of-way requirements. In 2008, the
federal government’s requirement that FRA compliant passenger railroads install Positive Train
Control systems to enhance safety added an additional capital cost requirement for these
projects that was not included in the 2004 cost estimates for FasTracks.
In 2007, the FasTracks Program was negatively impacted by decreased sales and use tax
revenues and increased costs of construction materials and was forecast at the time to need an
additional $1.5 billion to deliver the remaining projects in less than a decade. This perfect storm
caused the agency to explore strategic and creative ways to complete FasTracks. The problem
was exacerbated by the country’s slow dive into the 2008 recession. As Denver recovered from
the Great Recession, then Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, and other political and business
leaders supported RTD in using innovative thinking to complete the program. They viewed mass
transit as essential to making Denver a metropolitan force that could compete with cities not
just in the United States, but throughout the world.
RTD began extensive stakeholder outreach and coordination to identify innovative ideas to
complete more of the FasTracks Plan sooner, including determining whether there was support
for an additional tax increase. This outreach included establishing the FasTracks Metro Mayor’s
Task Force to increase the technical understanding of regional stakeholders and elected officials
concerning the FasTracks Program and the agency’s financial plan. This outreach approach

Attachment: FasTracks Program Overview_5_29_18_Exec Summary (3491 : FasTracks Program Overview)

2.C.4.b

2.C.4.b

RTD’s outreach also included extensive interaction with the private sector. RTD immediately
began evaluating whether there were opportunities to implement a Public Private Partnership
(P3) for any of the FasTracks projects. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum, Transformation

Through Transportation (T3), to seek innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon
as possible, enhance customer experience and reduce operational costs. This call for
innovations enticed more than 200 high-level executives from a cross-section of large and small
firms to attend, including engineering, construction and financial firms as well as major
companies not typically involved in transportation projects.
After much research, RTD realized that voters were likely not willing to vote for a tax increase
and decided it was too risky to move forward with an additional ballot initiative given the
economic situation. Therefore, RTD turned its focus to closely collaborating with the private
sector and the public to continue building towards the ultimate FasTracks vision. The
collaborative environment established with regional stakeholders, elected officials and the
private sector resulted in the following major accomplishments for the program:


RTD gained support to move forward with the P3 for the commuter rail line to the
airport (i.e., the Eagle Project), making RTD the first U.S. transit agency to successfully
leverage private-sector investment and federal funding to build a commuter rail system.



RTD received and accepted unsolicited proposals from the private sector that ultimately
resulted in construction of the I-225 corridor and a substantial section of the North
Metro corridor.



RTD analyzed the remaining FasTracks projects and determined that the Southeast Rail
Line was a strong candidate for additional federal grant funding. The federal funds,
combined with an unprecedented local contribution provided by the local stakeholders in
the project area, allowed RTD to begin construction on that rail line.



RTD established the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to capture and track any
excess revenues available in a given year so that they could be leveraged in the future
to build the remaining FasTracks projects.

Status
RTD has made significant progress in completing the FasTracks Program to date. Since its
inception, RTD has expended over $5.6 billion on improvements in the region, has stimulated
$2 billion of development around Denver Union Station alone, has provided $1.032 billion of
revenue to small and disadvantaged businesses and has created over 15,000 full-time jobs.

The same report also noted that RTD was forecasting capital cost increases due to: 1) Material,
labor and right-of-way escalation; 2) Third party requests/enhancements; and 3) Scope
clarifications/changes. The following graphic demonstrates the changes in commodity inflation
rates from 2003 – 2017.

As described previously, RTD first identified a funding gap for FasTracks in 2007. In a May 2007

2.C.4.b

To proactively address the funding gap for the FasTracks Program, RTD:


Instituted a more detailed annual FasTracks budget analysis and forecast named the
Annual Program Evaluation (APE).



Conducted extensive public outreach, presenting options for program delivery given
funding constraints.



Applied to the FTA seeking entry into the Public Private Partnership Pilot Program
(Penta-P) for the Gold Line and East corridors, which ultimately led to the successful
award of $1.03 billion in federal funding. The Eagle P3 award resulted in a cost savings
to RTD of $305 million compared with internal estimates, with the savings used to
complete more of the program.



Convened a Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) FasTracks Task Force with representation of
one mayor from each of the FasTracks corridors. This MMC FasTracks Task Force met
regularly, with RTD staff support, over the next several years, asking key questions,
assuring local government understanding of RTD decision-making, and providing RTD
with input.

2.C.4.b

Several times, over multiple years, RTD considered pursuing an additional election to
increase sales and use tax. RTD finally determined that the economic conditions were
not suitable for an election.



Formed a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force for the purpose of making recommendations
detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement to help
ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force’s recommendations were
approved by the Board of Directors in 2011, with direction to staff to pursue
implementation.



Convened a group of state and local government economic and financial advisors to
review RTD’s sales and use tax forecasting methodology – resulted in having the
University of Colorado Leeds School of Business to prepare all future sales and use tax
revenue forecasts.



Evaluated “Potential Critical Adjustments” (PCAs) for FasTracks, which included possible
changes to the original FasTracks Plan that did not fundamentally alter the length of
corridors, number and general location of station or the types of vehicles.



Held the “Transformation Through Transportation (T3) Industry Forum” to seek private
sector innovations to complete the FasTracks Program as soon as possible, enhance
customer experience and reduce operational cost.



Revised cost estimates for the Northwest Rail Line, based on inputs from the BNSF
Railway and updated construction costs.



Approved proposal to complete the full I-225 Light Rail Line following a competitive
solicitation that was initially spurred by an unsolicited proposal received by RTD.



Developed a Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) to identify specific cost saving/revenue
enhancing measures that would result in additional short-term funding for the FasTracks
Program.



Developed the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) budget account to identify
and track any additional funds that could be used to complete the FasTracks Program.



Moved forward with constructing the North Metro corridor to 124th Avenue in response
to an unsolicited proposal from the private sector.



Received federal funding for the Southeast Rail Extension which, paired with local
financial commitments, allowed RTD to proceed with construction of this project.



Continually worked on scope refinements and budget containment throughout the
FasTracks Program development.

Federal Funding
The 2004 FasTracks financial plan projected that RTD would be successful in obtaining
competitive federal grant funding in the sum total of $815 million for the East, West and Gold
rail lines. RTD was successful in the pursuit of federal funds for each of these projects. In 2016,
RTD was awarded additional competitive grant funding for the Southeast Rail Extension after
determining the potential eligibility of this project under the FTA’s updated rules and criteria.
Through 2018, the FTA has awarded RTD with over $1.4 billion in federal funding for these
projects, exceeding the original 2004 plan of $815 million by approximately $615 million.
RTD has continued to explore viability for additional federal grant funding for FasTracks projects
that are not yet under construction. Based on current federal criteria, only one project – the
Central Rail Extension – would possibly meet the project justification criteria to receive a federal
grant. However, it does not meet the project financial justification criteria primarily because
applying for federal funding would require a substantial local share that is not currently
identified in RTD’s financial plan. Should RTD’s financial position or federal eligibility criteria
change significantly, the Central Rail Extension or other unfunded corridors could be considered
as possible additional candidates for federal funds.
Potential Next Steps
RTD is committed to completing the full FasTracks Program over time and will continue seeking
innovative ideas and working with partners to move the program forward. However, RTD is
facing significant financial challenges. As the following chart depicts, RTD does not anticipate
having any capacity to issue additional debt until 2026.

2.C.4.b

2017 – 2040 Projected

Currently, RTD does not meet the required 1.2x net debt service coverage until 2026.
Additionally, the original FasTracks Plan included a voter-approved Taxpayer Bill of Rights
authorization limiting total debt for the program to $3.477 billion in principal and $7.129 billion
in total debt service. Given current outstanding sales tax and appropriation obligations and the
debt limits identified in the voter-approved authorization, RTD will not be in a position to issue
additional debt to fund additional FasTracks projects until 2026 at the earliest. As of RTD’s last
debt issuance, there is a remaining authorization of $381.95M in total repayment outstanding.
That would allow RTD to issue approximately $195M in bonds sometime after 2026.
In the meantime, RTD continues to seek opportunities to identify scope refinements and budget
containment with on-going projects and continues to track excess revenues through the FISA,
which as of year-end 2017 has a total balance of $49.4 million. The following table identifies
actual expenditures by project through 2017 as well as total project budgets (total expenditures
through 2017 plus committed expenditures through 2020).

continue advancing FasTracks Projects, including opening of the Gold Line, the Southeast Rail
Extension and the first phase of the North Metro Rail Line. RTD continues to pursue the peak
service model for the remainder of the Northwest Rail line in discussions with stakeholders and
the BNSF. RTD will also continue to pursue all opportunities to identify capital and operations
and maintenance funding for the remaining FasTracks projects, including: reduction of debt;
federal grants; private sector involvement; and project scope review.
