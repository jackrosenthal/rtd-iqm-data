Others Present:

MPACT 64 (Garcia Berry)
Maria Garcia Berry, CRL, said that she would be sharing the preliminary findings of a poll
that the Colorado Transportation Coalition (Coalition) did on behalf of the stakeholders in
the State who were thinking about pursuing a ballot initiative this year for transportation
funding. She explained that the Coalition was not a member of nor do they represent
MPACT64. MPACT64 was created by the Metro Mayor’s Caucus to have a dialog about
transportation issues in Colorado. She stated that the Coalition entered the picture about
two years ago because MPACT64 was considering a gas tax and they had concerns about
this being approved.
Maria Garcia Berry informed the Board that the Coalition’s efforts have all been pro bono;
no public funds were used and this was outside of CRL’s contract with RTD.
Maria Garcia Berry stated that based on the polling results it was clear that there was not
enough support for a tax increase for transportation. She said that economic insecurity is
what really influenced this poll; many people in the state do not have a high consumer
confidence that they will be better off in a year from now. Additionally, many people do
not believe the roads in Colorado are in bad condition.
Maria Garcia Berry informed the Board that Metro voters are most comfortable with bus
transit and BRT over accelerating all rail line construction by a 2 to 1 margin. She
recognized that this information is very important to the Board. She said that the Coalition
will provide the Board with more data once they have the cross tabs. Maria Garcia Berry
shared that 29% of respondents want to accelerate the Northwest Rail Line by 2030 while
58% prefer BRT by 2020 instead.
Maria Garcia Berry said the Coalition was working to do further analysis, specifically by
county, which they hope to have in the next month.
Director Bagley asked if the Coalition would be publishing information on their more indepth analysis or if any additional information would be presented verbally. Maria Garcia
Berry stated that the Coalition has not come to a decision at this time. She said this is a
poll that is owned by the private sector and while they understand that a lot of
commissioners, mayors, etc. want to know what is going on in their city the Coalition
cannot extrapolate for every city; however, the Coalition has agreed to do an analysis on a
county by county basis. Director Bagley stated that he is really looking to have more
information regarding the District. Maria Garcia Berry said the Coalition would look at
that.

Director Folska believes this information is very insightful and informative. She asked if
Maria Garcia Berry thought there might be a change in people’s perception if the minimum
wage was increased. She also wanted confirmation that Maria Garcia Berry said that only
4% of the people polled cared about roads and their improvement. Maria Garcia Berry
stated that she could not answer the question about minimum wage until she had a
breakdown of the age groups of where people are feeling less confident economically; it
will make a difference if this is people nearing retirement or a younger generation. She
shared that she was surprised at the number of people who believed their situation would
be worse off next year. She said that 4% of people cared about transportation. In
relation to road improvement only 30% of the people polled thought the roads really
needed to be improved. Director Folska asked General Manager Washington if these
results align with the Critical Issues in Transportation Report from the Transportation
Research Board. General Manager Washington stated that they did line up.
Chair Sisk thanked Maria Garcia Berry for her report. He knows there is a lot of work
ahead of RTD and this report certainly illustrates that.

III.

Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) Progress (Van Meter)
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning and Development, reviewed a
Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the January 28, 2014 Study
Session Agenda Packet.
General Manager Washington informed the Board that the Rail Capital Costs presented had
not been independently verified by BNSF; these costs came out of the study and were
prepared by a railroad specialist that once worked for BNSF. He stated, as he has before,
that all of the financial analyses are good for today. General Manager Washington
stressed that they do not take into account RTD’s innovation and ability to engage with
the private sector. He said he takes these analyses with a grain of salt.
Director Tobiassen thanked staff for the presentation. He asked for additional information
about a potential Regional Transportation Authority (RTA). He wondered how an RTA was
initiated, who manages it, how does RTD interface with the RTA, etc. Marla Lien stated
that RTAs are a provision of state law and separate from the RTD Act. Any combination
of at least two cities, counties, etc. have to agree to form an RTA with an

Packet Pg. 6

Director Tobiassen thanked Maria Garcia Berry for her report. He asked if there was any
testing for tolling during the polling. He noted that there are some pretty major
transportation projects coming down the pike and the option is to pay for them with taxes,
tolling, and/or Public Private Partnerships. Maria Garcia Berry stated that there were not
any tolling questions included.

6.A

Director Tobiassen asked if a vote would be required should RTD elected to move forward
with the arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. Marla Lien stated that when FasTracks
was approved it was a specific plan that included BRT elements for the US 36 corridor
through Downtown Boulder. The plan did not include any other BRT and there was a very
district plan for the Northwest Rail. She explained that if RTD wanted to amend the
FasTracks plan and use those funds to pay for additional BRT it would require a vote;
however, if RTD was to use Base System funds a vote would not be required to amend
the plan but might need a vote to issue more debt.
Director Menten asked for clarification on the lifespan of our light rail vehicles. She noted
that during the presentation Bill Van Meter said it was 25 years. Director Menten thought
the lifespan was longer. Terry Howerter stated that the lifespan is actually 30 years.
Director Menten shared that she has been asked by multiple individuals for an explanation
of BRT. She wanted to ensure that she was providing them with the correct definition.
She also wondered how close RTD’s BRT service would be to the formal definition of BRT.
General Manager Washington shared that the FTA had recently released a definition for
BRT that staff would provide to the Board. The FTA definition reads:
“BRT is an enhanced bus system that operates on bus lanes or other transitways in order
to combine the flexibility of buses with the efficiency of rail. By doing so, BRT operates at
faster speeds, provides greater service reliability and increased customer convenience. It
also utilizes a combination of advanced technologies, infrastructure and operational
investments that provide significantly better service than traditional bus service.”
Bill Van Meter stated that on US 36, RTD would be running service that is very close to
what most people think BRT is. He said that for the arterial BRT there would not be
dedicated lanes for the buses but through various improvements it would operate much
more efficiently.
Director Bagley shared that in his experience the components of BRT are all very different
and based on the application. He commented that in the presentation, the cost for the
Northwest Rail was presented in 2013 dollars, not year of expenditure dollars (YOE). He
said that when looking at YOE dollars the costs are likely to be significantly higher than
presented. Director Bagley also expressed concern that the costs for the Northwest Rail

Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) that constitutes its charter. She explained that the
RTA has to be authorized by the people of each entity and they must authorize any tax as
well. She said that she did not believe RTD could be part of an RTA. Marla Lien explained
that if an RTA was created to collect taxes and then give the funds to RTD, there would
need to be a vote of the District to approve re-payment of the funds.

6.A

Director Lubow expressed her disappointment that the financial analysis by revenue source
showed $0 across the board. She wondered if this was the same information that RTD
has already provided to DRCOG. Director Lubow also asked if the anticipated completion
date of 2044 for the Northwest Rail would remain the same. Bill Van Meter stated that
the analysis is the same through 2035. He said that the actual completion date for the
Northwest Rail is uncertain in the forecast but at this time it is post 2040. He reiterated
that staff lacks the confidence to put a year on a project that is so far out. Bill Van Meter
also stressed that if our situation gets better, for example the Sales and Use forecasts
improve, these numbers could go from zeroes to positives in 6 months. He said that just
as General Manager Washington stated, this is just where RTD is today. Terry Howerter
noted that it does not take much to change our financial position; even a 0.5% increase
year over year in Sales and Use Tax revenue would make a huge difference.
General Manager Washington explained that there is a reason that RTD adopted the
mantra of build as fast as you can as quick as you can; staff is looking for any window of
opportunity and RTD needs to be flexible and agile so that we may act on it.
Director Hoy asked if the projected Northwest Rail ridership was from current projections
or based on the 2004 FasTracks Initiative. He also wondered if the BRT ridership
boardings would add to each other. Bill Van Meter stated that all ridership forecasts had
been done as part of the study. He also said that Director Hoy was correct; each BRT
route’s ridership was added together for a cumulative total ridership.
Director Hoy shared that he recently spoke with a gentleman from Siemens and learned
that Siemens has a lease program for replacing rail cars. He asked that staff look into this
as our rail cars need to be replaced.
Director Folska noted that this is a lot of information to process. She feels distracted by
all of the information. Director Folska stated that the people in the Northwest want a train
as that is what they voted for. She thinks it is nice to have alternatives but at the same
time RTD is spending a lot of time and money going back and forth when the people want
a train. Director Folska asked if a vote from the entire District would be required to move
forward with arterial BRT. Marla Lien stated that if it used FasTracks funds or increased
debt it would require a vote, otherwise it would not.

Packet Pg. 8

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 28, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

had not been reviewed with BNSF so there was the possibility that they could increase
further. Director Bagley feels that there is more certainty in the arterial BRT projections
even if they are in 2013 dollars versus YOE. He asked staff if that was a correct
assumption. Chris Quinn said that while the analysis does not rely on any outside parties
it was done through very high level engineering numbers.

Director Solano stated that he concurs with Director Folska. He said it does not seem like
we are making any progress. He noted that RTD is spending $2 million on this study. He
asked what we are getting in return. General Manager Washington reminded the Board
that this was a partnership with the stakeholders. He believes that if RTD was to cut this
process short the stakeholders would be very offended. He stated that RTD and the
stakeholders are going through the process that both sides agreed to. General Manager
Washington believes it is extremely important to get the public input that this study is
soliciting. Bill Van Meter stated that now that the stakeholders had all the study
information they could evaluate it to really prioritize the transportation needs for the
corridor.
Director Walker asked if the capital costs identified for the Northwest Rail included
acquisitions and permitting. He also wondered how the daily boardings had been
calculated. Director Walker shared that in his experience it is very hard to predict the
future. Bill Van Meter stated that the costs did include acquisitions and permitting. He
explained that the low projection for daily boardings was based on DRCOG’s Regional
Transportation Plan’s projections; however, many of the local governments thought the
projections were low so RTD staff worked with them to come up with the high end of the
daily boardings.
Director Deadwyler asked if the NAMS process would factor in any of the information
presented earlier by Maria Garcia Berry regarding people’s preference for BRT over rail.
General Manager Washington stated that everything needed to be taken into account. He
believes it is important to find out what people really want.
Chair Sisk requested that all the financial analysis be done in current dollars so that
everyone is comparing apples to apples. He recognized that at times he too has felt like
Director Solano but overall this has been a very good process. He believes it is important
that the stakeholders feel they are involved in the entire process. Chair Sisk stated that
the arterial BRT might be a very good interim solution while we work to build the
Northwest Rail. He noted that the arterial BRT already gives RTD an immediate
opportunity to assist Longmont because the route along 287 is something they do not
have now.
Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that she did not understand the concept of BRT until she
attended the Rail~Volution Conference in L.A. She said it changed her entire point of
view; there were massive stations with Transit Oriented Development stops all along the
line. Director Rivera-Malpiede encouraged the other Directors to learn about various BRTs
throughout the country.

Director Anderson expressed her agreement with Chair Sisk. She also noted that the route
along 287 would provide service to the people of Lafayette.

Director Bagley reminded the Board that RTD would only be buying time slots from BNSF
for rail in the Northwest corridor. He shared this was something that was also done in
Seattle and proved to be very problematic. Marla Lien stated that while RTD would be
negotiating permanent easements with BNSF it would be only for a time slot. She
explained that more time slot would be needed to add capacity to the line which could
prove difficult if BNSF did not want to sell them.
Director Bagley stated that the Board needs to recognize that Boulder County has made
some decisions so cities would not grow together; however, this has had some significant
long term consequences on the population density in those areas.
Chair Sisk noted that the NAMS has been a product of a great deal of significant work
from staff. He believes that staff has worked well to represent RTD. He shared that this
is the part of the stakeholder process that he thoroughly enjoys. Chair Sisk thinks this is
something that was needed because it is bringing into better focus a plan going forward.
He thanked staff for their extraordinary efforts.

IV.

Other Matters
Director Anderson commented that there had been a recent Denver Post article regarding
the actuarial report on the RTD represented employee’s pension fund. She reminded the
Board that this information was known when the Union contract was being negotiated and
voted on last March. She stated that the contract was negotiated with both sides
recognizing that action needed to be taken to prop up the fund and this was done through
some real commitment by the Union and RTD. Director Anderson stated that these things
are not turned around in just a few months; it may take a few years but she has
confidence that both sides will work diligently to get the job done. She also noted that
Julio Rivera, ATU President, said the pension was hurt by having about 50% of the
agency’s bus service run by contractors per a Colorado law. Director Anderson shared
that she was not a supporter of this process and asked if staff could inform the board of
the effects, if any, this might have on the pension fund.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jan 28, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Lubow recognized that Director Deadwyler was correct that it is important to
listen to what RTD is hearing from polling, surveys, etc. She informed the Board that she
is not hearing what Maria Garcia Berry shared from the poll as her constituents are telling
her they want rail; however, she thinks it is very important to evaluate all the information
we are receiving.

6.A

Director Anderson informed the Board that she and Director Daly attended the American
Public Works of Colorado Awards Luncheon where RTD received the 2013 Project of the
Year for the West Rail Line. She said that the City of Lakewood always received an award
for the parks and trails added as part of the West Line development.

B. Updates

• Citizens Advisory Committee Update
Committee Chair Hoy recognized Hugh Wilson, Citizens Advisory Committee
(CAC) Co-Chair. Hugh Wilson introduced the Board to Cyndi Stovall, the
new CAC Co-Chair. He recognized former Co-Chair David Lewis for his hard
work over the past two years. Hugh Wilson thanked the Board for their
attendance at the CAC Meeting in December.
Cyndi Stovall shared that they had their first work session of the year on
January 15, 2014. In addition to electing the new Co-Chair the CAC also
welcomed three new members: Tyler Kealy, Vivian Stovall and Darcy
Wilson. She shared that the Committee discussed various topics and tours
that they would like to focus on over the coming year and how they might
align each meeting topic with appropriate project milestones. Cyndi Stovall
said that the CAC plans to host their quarterly meetings at various locations
around the District also to align with project milestones. She stated that per
the Committee’s direction, Roger Sherman is working to schedule two-onone meetings with the Board to learn how they can best promote the
FasTracks objectives while gaining public input.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked Cyndi Stovall for her update. He thought she
did a very good job. He also recognized the work that David Lewis did
during his time as CAC Co-Chair.

• FasTracks Public Information Update

Pauletta Tonilas reminded the Board that the Communications Department
comes to the Board every quarter with an update. She stated that this
evening’s update was focusing on the FasTracks Campaign that staff
worked on to integrated RTD’s PI, PR and Marketing divisions. She said that
the goal of the campaign was to connect the base system with FasTracks to
show how these will grow together to form RTD’s operations. The
campaign is called “I am FasTracks. I am RTD.” Pauletta Tonilas believes it
is very important to make sure that people know that RTD and FasTracks
are really connected as there are people that think FasTracks is a CDOT or
City of Denver project.
Pauletta Tonilas recognized Joni Goheen, Steve Reilly, Cheryl Holmes, Kate
Wilson and Deborah Menendez-Wilson for their work on the campaign.
Steve Reilly explained that in working on the campaign, Marketing really
wanted to create a greater synergy with RTD and FasTracks. He shared that
it was important to personalize the experience by telling real stories about
real people and the positive impacts that FasTracks and RTD have had on
their lives.
Steve Reilly shared that this campaign is featured in a variety of different
media such as on our vehicle, the website, and various local publications.
He said that every few months the campaign will be refreshed with new
individuals.
Pauletta Tonilas recognized the campaign participants who were in the
audience: Nettie Moore, Karina Sartiaguin, Chanda Hinton, Beverly Grant and
Cha Cha Cruz as well as RTD staff members Joe Christie and Jerry Nery.
She also recognized Ed and Maro Dimmer who were unable to attend as
they gave all their employees the night off due to weather. She said that
staff is really appreciative of the collaborative nature that occurred during
this campaign.

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, reminded the
Board that the Communications Department has been working to change
their structure and focus to utilize our resources in the best manner possible
as FasTracks moves from construction to operations. He said that based on
this, at the end of last year he did an internal and external recruitment for
the new position of Senior Manager of Public Relations and Public
Information and Pauletta Tonilas was selected. He shared that he is excited
to have her in an expanded role that will be important as RTD moves
forward with the transition of FasTracks.

Steve Reilly thanked everyone for being so wonderful and gracious. He
stated that these individuals have a passion, energy and enthusiasm for RTD
and public transportation.

Staff played the video for the Board which is available from the FasTracks
website.
Committee Chair Hoy said that he has not had the opportunity to meet all of
the participants but he did meet Nettie Moore on the W-Line opening day.
He said that she was absolutely delightful and this video really brought a
smile to his face.
Director Anderson shared that her first recollection of Edward Dimmer is
when he would leave his parents’ bakery to pick up flower, sugar, etc. She
said that after she was elected to the Arvada City Council, she and Mr.
Dimmer worked very hard to make Olde Town what it is today. Director
Anderson noted that Olde Town Arvada was home to the first King Soopers
started by Lloyd King. In recognition of him the Arvada Economic
Development Council gives the Lloyd King Entrepreneurial Award each year.
She informed the Board that Edward and Maro Dimmer received the award
last year. Director Anderson believes they are great citizens of Arvada and
truly represent FasTracks.
Director Folska feels this is a wonderful effort and a very dynamic
presentation. She asked if the intent of this video is to be educational and
teach people how to use the base system. She also asked if the video was
multimodal, showing buses and Smart Cards. Pauletta Tonilas explained
that the video is not to teach people how to use the system but to educate
them about the tie between RTD and FasTracks. She said that there were
buses in the video but it did not include the Smart Card system. Director
Folska encouraged staff to add that to the video as she believes it is
important. Scott Reed said that staff does plan on including Smart Cards in
future videos; the goal of this was to turn the focus to our projects as they
come online. He noted that the video did show numerous components that
have been completed to date.
Director Folska wonders if the video really represent the disabled
community. She stated that people with disabilities use our system and

Pauletta Tonilas shared that this year’s annual FasTracks video dovetails
nicely with the “I am FasTracks. I am RTD” campaign. She thanked Michelle
Brier along with Joni Goheen and Dave Mitchell for their work on this video.
She said that the video would be distributed through YouTube, available on
the FasTracks website, and would also be sent to the various local TV media
outlets.

should be in all our marketing collateral. Scott Reed informed her that one
of the riders featured in the video is disabled. Director Folska noted that if a
blind individual was listening to this video they would not be able to read
about the information Scott Reed mentioned nor would they know a disabled
rider was featured because it is not obvious; they cannot see him. Pauletta
Tonilas said that staff will see what they can do; they have discussed
compiling a transcript of all the video’s text to include on our website and
YouTube.

Director Rivera-Malpiede shared how pleased she was to see the diversity of
the people in this video. She said that she has to brag about District C’s
most famous person, Nettie Moore, who has lived in District C since 1924.
She thanked Nettie Moore for participating. Director Rivera-Malpiede
believes it is such an honor to have her in the video.
Committee Chair Hoy asked where the campaign would be disseminated.
Pauletta Tonilas said that it will be on our website, bus and light rail
vehicles, and ads in the local community papers. She noted that the full
stories are featured on our website so we can include more detail.

C. Recommended Actions

• Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Member Appointment
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors appoint one member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to fill a vacancy on
the Committee.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the February 18, 2014 Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
explained that this is a recommendation to fill an upcoming
vacancy on the CAC. He said that member Steve Lawrence
submitted his resignation effective February 19, 2014 due to
his pending deployment with the Peace Corps. Bill Van Meter
noted that when RTD last did our solicitation for CAC
members the nominating committee identified two alternate
candidates. He said staff is recommending that the Board

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

County of Denver (CCD) for the Free MetroRide
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all
documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
with the City and County of Denver (CCD), for the maintenance of roadway
and street furniture improvements constructed for the operation of the Free
MetroRide, formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, explained
that this recommendation is only approving the IGA with CCD;
it is not approving the Free MetroRide.
Director Anderson noted that the citizens of her community
have helped pay for Denver Union Station (DUS), the 16th
Street Mall Shuttle and the Free MetroRide. She informed the
Board that her citizens are going to have their commutes times
extended when buses move from Market Street Station. She
expressed that she is in favor of this IGA with CCD but wants
to make it clear that her community is expecting bus rides to
help with their extended travel time.
Director Deadwyler asked for clarification on what the IGA
covers. Henry Stopplecamp said that as part of the Free
MetroRide RTD is installing bus shelters, bus bulbs, etc. on
CCD’s property; this IGA includes the right to do so. He
explained that RTD will be subbing our the snow removal,

• Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and

6.B

maintenance, etc. to CCD and reimbursing them $10K
annually for this work.

Director Menten asked why the IGA has a retroactive effective
date. Henry Stopplecamp explained that construction for the
Free MetroRide began in late October or November in order for
RTD to be ready to begin service when DUS opens in May.
Director Walker noted that the first two years of the IGA are
set at 10K. He wonders what happens if snow removal,
maintenance, etc. costs come in lower. Henry Stopplecamp
said that RTD would not be reimbursed; however, the contract
allows for prices to be adjusted after the first two years. He
said that RTD also has the opportunity to bring the services
back in-house if the costs get to be too expensive.

D. Updates

• Update on the Southeast Extension Environmental Assessment
Susan Wood, Planning Project Manager, and Andy Mutz, Engineering Project
Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the February 4, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.
Director Menten asked how many people attended the December 2013
public meeting. She also wondered how RTD was advertising the meeting in
March. Susan Wood stated that the meeting was not well attended as only

Packet Pg. 18

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 4, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska wondered the cost for the work RTD is doing
as part of this IGA. Henry Stopplecamp explained that the
work Director Folska is referencing was approved last year;
the construction project is approximately $2.5 million while
the buses will cost an additional $8.4. Director Folska
wondered if RTD was able to get a grant to purchase the
buses. Bill Van Meter said RTD received a grant from the
State to help fund a portion of the bus purchase.

6.B

Director Menten wondered if any of the proposed alignment would be
located in Unincorporated Douglas County. Susan Wood stated that all of
the alignment is within the City of Lone Tree. Director Menten noted that
Lone Tree has a typical Channel 8 public television. She asked if they were
utilizing this channel. Susan Wood said staff would look into that.
Director Menten commented that the chart on page 12 did not show any
impact on public safety. She wondered where the notice would go out if we
do have a safety issue, say an at-grade crossing. Susan Wood stated that
there was no impact on public safety. She said there is one at-grade
crossing and RTD will need to work with the Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) because safety is important.
Director Lubow said it was her understanding that surface parking was less
expensive than structured parking. She noted, however, that she is getting
the impression that structured parking was less expensive in this case. She
asked if that was accurate. Andy Mutz stated that she was correct and it
really defies logic. He explained that there are three reasons in this scenario
that make structured parking as affordable as surface: (1) the expansive
soils and the requirement for RTD to over excavate and replace with
adequate soils; (2) the slope of the site requires a lot of walls for surface
parking and (3) there is not a significant cost increase for the few extra
acres needed for structured parking. He stated that this case is just not
typical because of the site conditions but under normal circumstances
surface parking is much more affordable.
Director Deadwyler said it was her understanding that a decision had not
been made as to what extension to complete next; however, she wonders,
based on the precise details of this presentation, if it has been decided to
begin this extension first. General Manager Washington stated that no
decision has been made but RTD does have a Full Funding Grant Agreement
(FFGA) application out for this extension. He noted that there has been a lot
of activity in this part of the region to bring some funding to the table. If
there is an ask for funding from RTD, that would be brought to the Board.
He stressed that RTD does not want to forfeit an FFGA.

Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 4, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

about 5 to 10 people came. She said it was a very snowy night so they
recognize that could affect attendance. She noted that if staff had heard
from people that they wanted to attend but could not make it they would
have scheduled another meeting. Susan Wood said that for the March
meeting, a notice would be sent to a list of interested stakeholders as well
as in various newspapers, on RTD’s website and on certain stakeholder
websites.

6.B

Chair Sisk stated that while he understands this extension might not be
popular in some areas he fully supports it.

Director Deadwyler asked if the FFGA funds could be used for another area.
General Manager Washington explained that RTD specifically applied for the
FFGA for the Southeast extension because it met federal criteria for the
grant.
General Manager Washington stated that staff plans to present to the Board
the criteria for FFGAs, information on MAP21, etc. at the end of February so
the Board knows what to ask for during the APTA Legislative Conference
and understands why RTD can seek funding in some corridors and not
others.
Director Lasater informed the Board that he has had several meetings with
Lone Tree in which they have assured him that they will have the local
matching funds available. He said that Terry Howerter is working with Lone
Tree to make sure everything is laid out to demonstrate to the Federal
Government that we have the matching funds for an FFGA.
Director Bagley shared that he too attended the public meeting in December.
He said that the people in attendance were really interested in gaining more
information. Director Bagley also stated that in looking at the one at-grade
crossing, this is really nothing compared to I-225 and Downtown. He also
believes when this extension is done it will be as built-up as the stations in
Aurora.
Director Folska noted that the location of the at-grade crossing is not a
heavily trafficked area.
Committee Chair Hoy agrees with staff that it would be valuable for the
Board to have a general overview of how a corridor or line qualifies for
various grants.
Director Lubow asked that the Board also be provided with information as to
how acceptability of a line for private funding is determined.

Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 4, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Daly asked where the at-grade crossing was located as he could not
find it on the map. Susan Wood said it would be near the SkyRidge Station.
Any Mutz explained that the road was just built so that may be why it is not
on the map.

6.B

• Eagle P3 Project Update
Kevin Flynn, Public Information, Brian Middleton, FasTracks Program
Management Consultant, and Greg Straight, Project Manager of Engineering
and Facilities, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is
available in the February 4, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda
Packet.

Director Bagley congratulated DTP and RTD staff for working on this
significant project with over $1 billion in FFGA funding. He said that he
remembers when this project was just a dream but to see it effectively
halfway done is absolutely fantastic. He believes everyone involved is doing
a great job.
Director Anderson thanked the team for their good work. She said this is a
project she has had very little heartburn over. She shared that she has not
had one citizen complaint which is very admirable. Director Anderson asked
staff for a discussion about how the Gold Line might be affecting traffic
along Grandview offline.
Director Folska stated that the progress is a testament to the effort of the
team. She said this is more than a significant project; it is a national model.
She believes it is easy for the Board to take it for granted because it is all
they know but when she is traveling everyone is talking about this project.
She said it is really fantastic to hear. Director Folska asked how many
private financing companies were working on this project. Greg Amparano,
DTP Executive Project Director, said that Lloyds Banking Group, John Laing
and Fluor were all involved in the private equity. He commented that the
total subcontractors are in the thousands so he would not be able to list
them all.
Director Tobiassen thanked the DTP outreach team for their efforts in Aurora
along with the RTD PI team. He said that they are really willing to show up
for everything everywhere. He appreciates their hard work in responding to
any issues. Director Tobiassen asked when the bus tours would be available
again. Kevin Flynn said the plan was for the tours to resume in April and
staff would begin promoting them in March. He shared that the tours were
subscribed to very quickly last year and they expect that will only intensify
this year.

Director Daly asked why four bridges needed to be re-designed. He asked if
the bridges needed to be strengthened. Greg Straight said that the bridges
did not necessarily need to be strengthened. Some just needed
reinforcement while one did need strengthening.

6.B

Committee Chair Hoy thanked everyone for the job they are doing. He
believes this is quite an accomplishment and the team is doing a stellar job.
He stated that it helps all of the Board members when RTD is getting a
project this big done.

Director Deadwyler also thanked the team for their hard work. She thinks
they are doing a fantastic job. She shared that her constituents are
beginning to forgive her for all the construction because they can see that
RTD is really making progress. Director Deadwyler did express concern that
it seems we are closing up more at one time than we did in the past and it
does make travel difficult in the area. Greg Straight said that this is the year
in which we will be finishing up the part that impacts the community as it
relates to detours. Once construction of the bridges, track, etc. is complete
and the project is to a point where staff is working on systems design and
testing, the impacts to the community will dramatically decline.

B. Updates


Local Update – CRL Associates
Roger Sherman informed the Board that they are wrapping up the MPACT64
survey analysis. The coalition has been meeting to talk about how and what to
release from the polling. He noted that the coalition is still getting a lot of
questions from various mayors, council members, etc. so they are trying to
finish the analysis quickly.
Roger Sherman shared that he would be attending the Metro Mayors Caucus
meeting on February 5, 2014. The Metro Area Commissioners meeting that
was to be held on January 31, 2014 was cancelled.
Roger Sherman stated that his team is doing touch-base meetings with various
mayors and will loop the Director in as they meet with mayors in the Director’s
District.



Brandeberry~McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry told the Board that the current legislative session is about a
month in. She noted that her team does not have any proactive bills that they
have been tasked to run on behalf of RTD but they are monitoring a handful of
bills. She said there are four Sales and Use Tax bills that could have an impact
on the District if they make it through. Jenifer Brandeberry stated that she is
doubtful all four will pass but the legislature will look at what is most helpful
from an economic development standpoint.

Director Rivera-Malpiede left early.

6.C

Jenifer Brandeberry shared that Senator Nancy Todd, Chair of the Senate
Transportation Committee, has reached out to RTD and Brandeberry~McKenna.
She would like to do a tour of Denver Union Station as well as DIA. Jenifer
Brandeberry said her team would be working with Senator Todd to coordinate
and they would inform the Board when there were more details.

Director Menten asked for information on how House Bill 14-1164 might affect
RTD as a Special District. She has heard this Bill will remove some of the
Secretary of State’s oversight of Special Districts. Julie McKenna explained
that they have not been closely watching this Bill as it is
Brandeberry~McKenna’s understanding that it does not affect RTD but they
will get further information. Marla Lien, General Counsel, stated that this bill
only appeared on a list of bills to be monitored because the title includes Special
Districts. She said that because RTD’s elections are outlined in our Enabling
Act this bill does not apply to us.


Federal Update – Patton Boggs
Mike Dino reminded the Board that the Federal Government did reach an
agreement on a budget at the end of last year and that in early January they
reached an agreement on appropriations. He said that the New Starts program
was funded at $2.1 billion so Patton Boggs anticipates RTD should get the full
$150 million request for Eagle P3. He noted there is still $17 million
outstanding that Patton Boggs will continue to lobby to get that reimbursed.
Mike Dino said that they are also lobbying to make sure that, in addition to what
was allocated to New Starts, unallocated transit funds are put into New Starts
so the FTA can cover as much as possible. Mike Dino shared that the TIGER
program will have $600 million; that is $127 million more than last year.
Mike Dino stated that the reauthorization will be debated this year. He is not
optimistic that there will be a long term deal. The Highway Trust Fund is almost
bankrupt so Congress will need to help it with approximately $19 billion.
Mike Dino informed the Board that the commuter tax benefit was not renewed;
this means it went from $245 back to $130 per month. He said Patton Boggs
is working to get the benefit into the Tax Extenders Bill. This is a bill that
includes a lot of other credits that expired at the end of last year.
Mike Dino reiterated that Peter Rogoff, FTA Administrator, was nominated to be
the US Department of Transportation’s Acting Undersecretary for Policy. He
will remain in the FTA roll until he is officially confirmed.

Director Anderson expressed concern about the tax holidays the legislature was
discussing. She noted that while this may be okay for some organizations it is
really a burden for an organization like RTD. She wonders if there is any way
for RTD to get an exemption. Jenifer Brandeberry said that since RTD worked
to align our Sales and Use Tax base with the State it would not be prudent to
now ask for an exemption. She does not believe the tax holiday on school
items will pass as it has been introduced multiple years and continues to fail.

6.C

Director Hoy confirmed that while RTD’s FFGA will be fully funded this year, it
was not fully funded in the past. He was speaking with Jeremy Rodriguez of Ed
Perlmutter’s office and this question came up. Director Hoy asked Mike Dino to
reach out to Mr. Rodriguez.

C. Other Matters

Director Lubow noted that she passed out two local newspaper articles indicating
that the public in the Northwest, as well as 14 state lawmakers, were very
concerned about the US 36 management contract. She said there are concerns
about the lack of transparency and negative impacts on the public. These articles
indicate that the public was not aware of certain provisions in the contract. She
believes it would be very useful for the public to get more information about P3s
since there will be more of them in the future. Director Lubow asked for a report
from staff discussing how to address state legislators concerned about RTD’s own
projects. She believes it is timely to discuss this issue now as there are going to be
more P3s. Director Lubow would like to know how RTD protects the public’s
interest.

General Manager Washington reminded the Board that RTD and Patton Boggs was
working on a P3 roundtable to coincide with the opening of Denver Union Station
on May 9, 2014. The plan is to have three separate panels: (1) the Federal
perspective, (2) Denver success stories, and (3) the private sector perspective. He
said that this roundtable would take place in the underground bus terminal and
Patton Boggs is taking the lead on the event.

B. Recommended Actions

• Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and
County of Denver (CCD) for a share of the 16th Street Maintenance (Blocks
1-13)
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to
enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and
County of Denver (CCD) for the shared maintenance cost of the 13 block
portion of the 16 th Street Mall between Broadway and Market Street. This
IGA commits both RTD and CCD to share the cost of maintaining the
granite pavers, curbs and transition stones within the transitway.
Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the February 18, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, stated
that this in an IGA to get reimbursed by the City and County
of Denver (CCD) for work done on the 16th Street Mall. He
introduced Jeff Cluphf who manages the 16th Street Mall
Maintenance for RTD. Jeff Cluphf explained that this IGA

Directors Anderson, Deadwyler, Lasater and Rivera-Malpiede had left early.

6.D

Director Menten asked for further information as to why RTD
was responsible for maintenance. She noted the case RTD vs.
Weaver in 1987 when RTD took over the responsibility. Marla
Lien, General Counsel, explained that RTD contracted for the
creation of the Mall and got one of the first UMPTA grants to
fund it. There was a defect allegation against the architects in
which a settlement was reached requiring the architectural
firm to create a fund that would take care of the Mall
maintenance for 30 years. She said as part of the settlement
there was an agreement between RTD and CCD that RTD
would take care of the maintenance for the duration of the
fund; however, the fund is running out.
Director Lubow asked if staff has ever thought about getting
local businesses to share in the cost of the Free Mall Shuttle.
General Manager Washington stated that staff has thought of
that and they have not given up on the idea. He said that
staff has been asking that for a number of years. This IGA is
due to staff’s efforts to finally get CCD to contribute which is
a big step forward. He stated that staff would continue to
pursue funding from the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP)
and local businesses. Henry Stopplecamp noted that the local
businesses are responsible for cleaning, snow removal,
sidewalks, trees, etc. He stated the only thing they do not
take care of is the actual pavers.
Chair Sisk asked if there are advertising revenues that can be
generated from this 13 block area of the mall. Henry
Stopplecamp said that because we only have the 10 foot area
the buses travel there really is not an advertising opportunity.
Marla Lien noted that the Mall Shuttle itself does generate
significant advertising dollars.
Director Menten wanted to confirm that we would not be
doing something like granite pavers on 18th and 19th as part of
the Free MetroRide. Henry Stopplecamp stated that we would
not be doing anything other than concrete and asphalt.

covers the granite portion of the 16th Street Mall, curb-to-curb.
He said that staff has been working with the CCD for several
years to try to negotiate some cost sharing for the
maintenance. This has resulted in the CCD agreeing to pay
30% of the maintenance costs up to $300K annually. He
noted that this is much better participation by the City than
we have had in the past.

C. Other Matters
General Manager Washington said that as the Board is aware, there was concern
the previous week that the Platte Bus Barn facility needed some work to shore up
some structural defects. He said that staff did do this on a temporary basis and are
working to fix it on a permanent basis. He stated that staff erred on the side of
safety and evacuated the buses and employees in the affected area. He thanked
staff for their responsiveness to the situation.
Director Daly asked where the extra buses were housed. General Manager
Washington said they were parked outside for a short time. Henry Stopplecamp
noted that the facility was back in service at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday so the normal
Monday service was out of that facility.
Director Daly asked if there were any conclusions as to what caused the structural
defects. Henry Stopplecamp stated that staff is working with an engineering firm
to conduct a thorough assessment of what caused the issue and how to best
permanently fix it.

for more information on the capital improvement program that
is taking place on the 16th Street Mall. Jeff Cluphf explained
that this is a project with CCD, DDP and RTD. CCD and DDP
are paying 2/3. He said this will consist of bulb outs,
improved lighting, improved paving, etc. and will incorporate
some of the lessons learned from the 2011 pilot program.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights ADA Program Update
Kenn Hardin, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, shared with the Board that the
handout in the February 11, 2014 Civil Rights Committee Meeting Agenda
Packet summarizes the activities of the Civil Rights Division as it relates to
their newest initiative, the ADA Program. He noted that there were a
number of elements associated with the program. The first goal was to reengage the community through the Americans with Disabilities Act Advisory
Committee (ADAAC) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Committee. He explained that ADAAC committee is the external committee
that meets with Civil Rights staff to discuss their community’s concerns; the
ADA Committee is the internal committee that works to resolve the
ADAAC’s concerns.
Kenn Hardin stated that as part of the ADA Program, his team wanted to
focus on creating milestones to begin implementing key areas of the
program. He said that there were three core areas they would be focusing
on: communication, compliance and training. Kenn Hardin asked the Board
for their opinions and suggestions to help develop this program.
Director Tobiassen feels it is very exciting to see RTD coming up to speed
and recognizing people with disabilities. He appreciates staff’s hard work.
Director Tobiassen wondered if staff was reaching out to people with

Packet Pg. 33

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Director Anderson was absent.

6.E

Director Tobiassen commented that one of the things previously discussed
was making RTD a better place for people with disabilities to find meaningful
employment. He recognizes that it has been a struggle because of the rapid
development of technology; however, he believes that as a large
organization we should be able to influence our software and hardware
vendors to make sure they are providing solutions that RTD can make
adaptable for people with disabilities. He hopes the ADA program can
include meaningful employment as part of the milestones. Kenn Hardin
shared that Director Folska was instrumental in recommending two
individuals for staff to work with in regards to employment; one focuses on
working with Veterans and the other works with employer adaptability for
people with disabilities.
Director Folska believes this work is outstanding. She is excited to follow
the progress in this area. Director Folska asked if there were any plans to
hire a dedicated individual as the ADA Coordinator for the agency. She
believes this position will be very helpful in order to ensure success in this
program. She noted that other agencies and organizations often have an
ADA Coordinator so it is a very common practice. Director Folska also
thinks the ADA Coordinator would be very instrumental in making sure any
software purchased was fully accessible. Kenn Hardin said that this is
something he is working on with General Manager Washington which he will
continue to do.
Director Solano expressed his concern for the Hispanic community,
especially the disabled Spanish speaking individuals. He wonders if we will
be able to effectively communicate with them. Kenn Hardin noted that
Limited English Proficiency (LEP) falls under Title VI; however, anyone with a
disability will be worked with through the ADA Program. He shared that the
Civil Rights Division has many people within the department who speak
Spanish.
Director Deadwyler thanked Kenn Hardin for his work. She believes this
program is wonderful. Director Deadwyler noted that people have more
respect for what RTD is doing if we start from the inside. She shared that
the handicap entrance to the Blake facility is really a hindrance. There is
only one entrance that goes around a corner and is extremely cluttered with
desks and other items. She recognizes that people work in that area but
believes it should be made more safe and inviting for people with disabilities.
Director Deadwyler said that this really needs to be addressed around the
corner where mirrors are needed to avoid collisions. She asked if there were
any plans to make our building more accessible and inviting. General

stated that they were.

Manager Washington said that the facilities managers would look at the
area. He agreed that it is cluttered. General Manager Washington
recognized that one of the challenges that RTD has is that we have
outgrown the Blake building.

D. Other Matters

Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede shared that RTD received a special award on
February 5, 2014. She said that we were recognized by the Diversity Recruiters
Network with the Diversity Spirit Achievement Award for our active support of
diversity in the workplace. She congratulated the entire RTD family.

B. Recommended Actions

• Contract Award for the District Shops HRU Project.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the
not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery
Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of
Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the February
18, 2014 Board meeting.
Director Bagley Seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security
and Facilities, explained that project is a contract award to
replace the Heat Recovery Units (HRUs) at District Shops that
are part of the heating, AC, and ventilation system. He said
that these units are beyond their useful life. He stated that
this project is mostly grant funded with a small local match.
Director Bagley commented that he is very excited that there
is only a 20% local match with grants taking care of the rest.
He thinks it is very good work on the part of staff to get the
grants necessary for this project and they should be
recognized for their work on something that is really
important.
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Director Anderson was absent.

Director Deadwyler noted that several years ago there were
funds in the budget for this project. She wonders why staff
kept putting this project off and what happened to the funds
that were originally allocated for the project. Dave Genova
said this project has been on the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP)
list for a number of years. He explained that this project was
originally funded through RTD budget money but a grant
became available that staff is in the process of
reprogramming. Dave Genova said this grant was originally to
be used to put in a CNG detection system; however, this
project has been put on hold because at this time it is not
needed since RTD is not purchasing any CNG buses. Dave
Genova stated that the money originally budgeted for the HRU
project is being held in the SBP should the need for the CNG
project arise.
Director Menten noted some of the funds are coming from
federal grant CO-04-0043. She asked what program the grant
falls under. General Manager Washington said this is part of
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Terry
Howerter noted that the funding expires September 30, 2014.
Director Daly asked if staff had determined the cause of the
structural issues at the Platte garage. He also wondered if the
buses had been moved back in. Richard Rost, Manager of
Facilities Engineering, explained that the structure is designed
to move through expansion and contraction. He said currently
it is performing like it should but there are some tolerances
that are getting close so it needs to be addressed. Richard
Rost noted that buses are being moved as work needs to be
done. Dave Genova said that his department was working
with Bus Operations to minimize the impact but keeping safety
at the forefront.
Director Deadwyler wondered if the grant funding being used
for the HRU project might be better spent repairing the Platte
facility. She also asked how much the repairs would cost.
Dave Genova stated that staff has identified funding within
the facilities engineering budget so staff is confident moving
forward with the HRU project. He said that a final cost will
not be known until all the duct work has been moved out of
the way but staff is estimating $300-400K for the repairs.
Director Solano asked the following questions:
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.F

1) What the useful life of the units? Richard Rost stated 25
years.
2) What the efficiency of the units? He noted that in houses
you can buy systems with 80 or 90% efficiency. Richard
Rost said that the HRUs are an efficiency based unit but he
will have to check on the percentage.
3) Are the HRUs covered by building insurance? Richard Rost
explained that they were not covered for replacement;
these are the original units from 1989.
4) Were the units damaged? Richard Rost said they were not
damaged but are old. He noted that it is also very difficult
to get repair/replacement parts.

• Transfer of Funds from Light Rail Capital to Light Rail Expense
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
approve the transfer of $703,000 in approved 2014 capital to an expense
line to facilitate the development of revised Light Rail Vehicle specifications.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the February 18,
2014 Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations,
explained that this action is a housekeeping item to move
approved funds from the light rail capital budget to expense
budget so RTD can develop and update our specifications for
our next purchase of light rail vehicles. He said that we will
need more light rail vehicles as I-225 opens and demand
increases. This is part of the process of cleaning up our
specifications.
Director Lasater asked if we would end up with different
vehicles or if the goal is to keep everything the same. He
Packet Pg. 39

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

6.F

Director Lasater believes that $700K seems steep just to
tweak specifications. Austin Jenkins commented that $700K
was the not-to-exceed number but staff did not think it would
go that high. He explained that it does involve more than just
tweaking and he would work with Director Lasater offline to
review the entire process.
Director Hoy asked if these would be replacement vehicles for
our current fleet or to support new rail lines. Austin Jenkins
stated that these would be needed for service on I-225 and
future extensions.
Director Tobiassen shared that he just heard from a
constituent that travels with little people. The constituent
expressed that the straps for people standing were too high
for them to use. He asked if that could be looked at as part of
this process. Austin Jenkins said that staff had also received
an email regarding this and would be discussing it further.
Director Solano wondered if the mechanics would need to be
retrained since the vehicles were not identical. Austin Jenkins
said that there will be some training needed but the vehicles
will be very close to our current vehicles.
Director Deadwyler wondered if any housekeeping would be
done on the old vehicles to incorporate any improvements that
are done as part of this process. Austin Jenkins said that staff
is always looking at how to improve vehicles. He noted that
his team is engaged in an overhaul project of the oldest fleet
right now. General Manager Washington stated yes. He
explained that within the limits of the existing budget staff will
work to bring the older fleet up to the specification of the
newer fleet.
Director Menten asked what the acronyms LTK and FRSC in
the Board Report stand for. Austin Jenkins explained that LTK
Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

expressed concern over having different parts, needing
additional mechanic training, etc. Austin Jenkins noted that
while all our vehicles look alike there are actually 7 versions.
He said that the intent is to continue to purchase Siemens
vehicles. The vast majority of parts and equipment are
compatible between versions and that will continue with this
version. Austin Jenkins explained that there have been a lot
of modifications made to our light rail cars that we want to
incorporate into our specifications going forward.

stands for Louis T. Klauder which is the parent company of
FRSC which stands for Front Range Systems Consulting.

Director Bagley noted that RTD has had some of these light
rail vehicles for close to 20 years. He believes this is part of
the natural progression once RTD moves into maintenance and
operations. RTD is not an agency that only does capital
projects so the change in thinking has to be to maintenance
for the long run. He said that in 10 years RTD will not be a
capital system but a maintenance system and that is
something the Board needs to start thinking about. Director
Bagley stated that specifications of any vehicle are absolutely
critical when looking at maintenance so he is very supportive
of this action.
Director Solano asked what the lifecycle is for a vehicle. He
wondered if vehicles could be retrofitted to go beyond their
useful life. Austin Jenkins said that the useful life of a vehicle
was 30 years. He stated that staff is engaged in an overhaul
project right now; the goal is to make our vehicles work for us
as long as they can.
General Manager Washington reiterated Director Bagley’s
comments about capital programs versus maintenance and
operations. He said this is something staff thinks about every
day which is why the State of Good Repair (SOG) division is
so important. He highlighted the Platte facility as an excellent
example of SOG. General Manager Washington noted that the
reason New York neglected their SOG for a number of years
and are now trying to catch up.

• Access-a-Ride Budget Transfer

Motion:

Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to
the full Board at the February 18, 2014 Board
meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
explained that during the preparation of the 2014 Budget,
RTD’s service provider model still contracted with four
companies for the Access-a-Ride service. He said that the
procurement process that was occurring at the same time
resulted in RTD selecting three service providers instead of
four. This action is a housekeeping item to reprogram the
monies approved at part of the 2014 Budget from four cost
codes to three.
Director Folska wondered if there were any plans to support or
encourage other businesses to take up the fourth space in the
future. She also wondered why Freedom Cab was not one of
the taxi companies that we contracted with. Bruce Abel
stated that the agency and staff are always open and
amendable to working with anyone who wants to work with
us. He said in the case of this Request for Proposal (RFP)
there were 12 different proposers. He explained that the
evaluation was structured so that the panel could select what
was most cost effective for RTD. In the case of this review,
that resulted in three rather than four service providers. Larry
Buter explained that during the roll-out of Access-a-Cab,
Freedom Cab was a provider but asked to be excused from the
program a few years later.
Director Folska asked if staff thought the same level of service
could be provided with three rather than four providers. Bruce
Abel stated that the level of service would be identical. He
noted that the service will also be supplemented with
dedicated cabs as well.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer in the amount of
$5,271,915 to re-allocate previously approved Access-a-Ride 2014 funding
from budget accounts associated with the expired Access-a-Ride service
provider contracts to budget accounts associated with the new Access-aRide service provider contracts.

Director Deadwyler expressed that her biggest concern is
service. She wonders if three service providers will be able to
provide service in all areas. She thinks that Access-a-Ride is
underperforming for the amount of money RTD spends. She is
concerned that if the demand for service cannot be handled
now then three firms will not be able to manage going
forward, especially with the high employee turnover rate.
Director Deadwyler wonders if the information the Board is
receiving is accurate as to how Access-a-Ride is performing.
She believes there are a lot of issues that no one is paying
attention to. Bruce Abel stated that staff did their due
diligence as part of the RFP process when the decision was
approved to select three providers. He noted that this was
also discussed with the Board at that time. General Manager
Washington said that staff will continue to update the Board
on a quarterly basis and will be sure to address Director
Deadwyler’s concerns.
Director Tobiassen shared that in his experience, the quality of
the Access-a-Ride program has improved greatly. He said he
gets very few complaints and when he does, staff moves on
them very quickly to resolve the issue with the constituents.
He thanked staff for their efforts. Director Tobiassen
commented that he will be very interested in monitoring the
quality as we switch to non-dedicated vehicles since that is a
new service. He hopes that it will provide a better level of
service. Bruce Abel stated that staff shares his interest.
Director Folska asked if the Telephone Information Center
(TIC) now has an appropriate coding mechanism for taking
Access-a-Ride complaints. Larry Buter shared that he has
been working with the TIC staff to appropriately enter the
complaints; this will allow his team to better monitor service
and respond to the customers.
Director Folska wonders how staff thinks route match is
working. She has had many constituents tell her that route
match takes them very far out of their way during trips. She
expressed concern that this program might not be as efficient
as possible. Bruce Abel said that the program seems to be

was correct; the total expenditure does not change.

• Access-a-Cab Program
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to extend Agreements with Metro Taxi,
Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD,
the General Manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and
enter into agreements with each participating cab company in subsequent
years, hereafter.
Primary
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel noted that RTD has been engaged in Access-a-Cab
service with various cab companies since the late 1990s,
entering into contracts on an annual basis. He stated that this
action is to secure the Board’s approval to have these
agreements in place for as long as it is beneficial to RTD. He
said staff would continue to keep the Board appraised through
the annual budget process.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler shared that she has noticed the route
match issues as well. She said that several times coming from
her house to RTD the drivers will take her out of the way. She
indicated that even if she suggests a route, the drivers refuse
to take it. Director Deadwyler stated that often this adds an
additional 15 to 20 minutes to her trip. She had heard similar
comments from her constituents.

6.F

Director Hoy asked if these companies all receive the same
subsidy. He wonders why RTD does not ask the cab
companies to bid on the service. Bruce Abel stated that all
companies are paid the same subsidy. He explained that there
are many factors that go into determining the subsidy that
RTD pays. Bruce Abel said that the reason this does not go
out to a competitive bid has to do with dedicated versus nondedicated service. In the Access-a-Cab program there is not a
pool of operators dedicated to the service. He noted that a
dedicated cab component was added as part of the Access-aRide component which will cost RTD $39 per trip versus the
$12 subsidy for Access-a-Cab. Bruce Abel said regulatory
requirements of contracts for service versus paying a subsidy
changes the cost.
Committee Chair Folska asked why staff was recommending
that this action’s renewal terms be different than our standard
contracts. Bruce Abel said that staff could continue to do this
on a year-by-year basis. He explained that staff was
attempting to streamline the process because for this service
RTD does not go out to bid. RTD determines the subsidy and
any company that would like to participate can. He stated
that this is just a formal documentation process so RTD can
legally pay the participating companies. General Manager
Washington said that staff was trying to be efficient and
innovative but if the Board wishes they can continue to come
for approval every year.
Director Deadwyler shared that she has reservations about
Access-a-Cab. She noted that cab drivers work as
independent contractors who while the company says they
want to work with RTD, the drivers decide if they want to
pick-up the passenger. She said that there is a history of a
two hour wait to pic-up a passenger. Director Deadwyler

Director Folska stated that she loves Access-a-Cab. She
thinks this is a great model and really helps RTD and the
constituents. She believes it is even more efficient than
Access-a-Ride; however, Director Folska shared that she is not
comfortable with the language in this action. She noted that it
is inconsistent with the procedures the agency uses when
entering into contracts. She said she has never heard of an
action that allows for continuous renewals without the Board’s
approval. Bruce Abel pointed out that this is not a contract to
provide service. This contract allows RTD to pay the cab
companies a user side subsidy.

6.F

stated that while this might work for someone wanting to go
shopping, it does not work for someone who needs to be
somewhere based on a schedule. Director Deadwyler said
that the program needs to work properly before she can
support this action.

Director Folska made the motion to amend the recommended
action to read as stated by Legal Counsel Marla Lien:

“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to
execute all documents necessary to extend Agreements with Metro Taxi,
Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD,
the General Manager, or his designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and
enter into agreements with each participating cab company for three (3)
years with two 1-year options.”
Director Solano seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Director Folska stated that this action affects the most
vulnerable people in our population. She thinks it is something
that is worthy of the Board’s attention.

• May 2014 Service Changes

Motion:

Director James made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the primary focus of this
action is to implement the changes necessary to move routes
from Market Street Station to Denver Union Station (DUS) and
focus resources on improving on-time performance.
Jessie Carter shared that staff received a good amount of
input during the public hearing process. He noted that a
number of changes have been made to the initial plan. The
key changes are as follows:
 New alignment for Route 8 to allow for an ADA
accessible stop
 Route 16 extension has been canceled as further
analysis proved is was not practical
 Due to a request from TSA employees, the early
morning Route AB trips were adjusted
 At the request of a large employer in Aurora, one Route
130 trip will be converted to Route 130H
Jessie Carter highlighted the changes to Route 15L and 20.
He explained that staff had heard from the residents of the
Wynkoop and Icehouse Lofts asking RTD to try to reduce the
number of trips by their homes. He shared that staff did this
and through a new plan was able to balance out the trips in
the area better. Jessie Carter said that staff met with the
community and had received positive feedback on the
changes.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the May 2014 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost
increase of approximately $1,440,000 and, further, to authorize the General
Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for
private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

6.F

Director Bagley noted that the anticipated cost for the Free
MetroRide is $826K and for the MallRide it is $148K. He said
that these two changes make up the greatest percentage of
the cost increase. He wonders if this funding is coming from
the FasTracks or Base Systems budget. Jessie Carter stated
that the MetroRide will come from FasTracks and the MallRide
from Base Systems.
Director Menten asked for further information about why the
Route 16 extension was cancelled. Jessie Carter explained
that the cancellation has to do with the proposed alignment.
There was a turn that looked doable on the map but when the
route was tested with an actual bus, it just was not feasible.
Director Menten asked what was meant by the public
comment related to Route 86X with regards to very confusing
waiting lines. Jessie Carter believes this has to do with
consistency in payment for express routes. The constituent
wants to make sure that everyone pays as they leave the bus
versus sometimes paying as you board.
Director Menten wondered about the specifics of the W-Line
changes. Jessie Carter explained that three peak round-trips
between Federal Center Station and Unions station to add to
round-trips after 9 p.m. between Jefferson County
Government Center-Golden Station and Union Station.
Director Daly commented that there were not any changes to
the MetroRide Route. Jessie Carter shared that there was a
request from the Art District to extend the route. Staff will be
looking at this for a long term service change.
Director Tobiassen thanked staff for the changes to Route
15L. He thinks this will open a lot of opportunities for people
from the east to access Auraria campus as well as Federal and
Colfax for transfers. He believes this is a great change.
Director Deadwyler asked for further information on Route 20.
She expressed concern that the changes might force people to
transfer buses to get to the VA Hospital. Jessie Carter

Bruce Abel reminded the Board that the plan originally included
changes to the light rail schedules to increase the
maintenance-of-way windows. He said that staff is still
conducting some technical analysis so they are holding off on
the original recommendation.

6.F

Chair Sisk recognized that the Route AB change helps the TSA
and airport employees but he is concerned about the early
morning travelers. He asked staff to continue to look at the
timing of this early morning trip. Jessie Carter said his team
will continue to evaluate this schedule.
Committee Chair Lubow expressed her gratitude that staff was
able to have such productive meetings with the Wynkoop and
Icehouse Loft residents; however, she noted many of them
were surprised that changes were happening that they were
not aware of. She believes it might be helpful to put
responses to public input on the website so people understand
what happens to their comments. Jessie Carter noted that
there is a service change brochure that includes this
information. He expressed that while we are able to make this
information available, we cannot make people read it.

• Service Performance 2012 Networked Family of Services
Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development, reviewed a Power
Point presentation with the Board that is available in the February 11, 2014
Operations and Customer Service Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Menten asked why there is such a difference in the subsidy per
boarding for the BroncosRide versus the RockiesRide. Bruce Abel stated
that the BroncosRide carries more people per hour of service so it is more
cost effective.
Packet Pg. 49

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

explained that Route 20 will now end at Denver Union Station
to compensate for the Route 15L changes. He said that this
will provide connection with routes from the north and west
with the hospitals in the eastern portion of downtown. Jessie
Carter stated that this would have no impact on the riders
coming from the east. He also believes the added
connectivity at DUS will really benefit riders.

Director Hoy believes there is some magic in meeting the minimum
productivity for various frequencies. He noted that if a bus runs every hour
it may not meet the minimum productivity for half hour service; however, if
service was changed to every half hour it might then meet the frequencies.
He asked how staff decides when to make those types of changes. Jeff
Becker said that with new routes staff ties to make the best estimate as to
ridership and frequency of service. He stated that usually ridership builds
and service is added in response. Jessie Carter explained that staff tries to
look for grants to experiment with service. He commented that in staff’s
experience, hourly service often does not benefit from a change to every
half hour. Director Hoy asked to speak with staff further regarding specific
route questions.
Chair Sisk asked how fare revenue is calculated. He wonders how Eco,
College, Monthly, etc. passes factor in. Bruce Abel explained that revenue
figures are a combination of fare box revenue and revenue from passes that
is distributed per ridership statistics. He said if a passenger boards with
some type of pass the driver pushes a button on the fare box for that pass.
The pass revenue is then distributed among the routes proportionate to the
ridership.
Director Tobiassen feels very fortunate that the 169L runs from Arapahoe
and Parker to DIA at a local fare of $2.25. He noted there is also a similar
service in Brighton. He expressed concern that everyone else is stuck with
the SkyRide at over $9.00 per trip. Director Tobiassen believes this makes
taking public transportation difficult for people making only minimum wage
working at DIA. He wonders if there is some way to address the cost to
workers versus travelers. Bruce Abel said that this is an issue that will be
looked at as part of the Fare Task Force.
Director James asked if staff could comment on the responsiveness of
ridership when headways get to the 10 to 15 minute level. Jeff Becker
stated that headway is king. He said that when frequency gets to be at the
10 to 15 minute level people feel this is comparable to being able to get into
their car at any time. They no longer feel like they need to look at a
schedule but can just go and wait for the next bus.
Director Folska wonders if there is the opportunity to utilize technology to
assist with demand management. She wonders if there is an application
that can tell riders where the bus is in real time. She thinks this would really
help engage our riders. Bruce Abel stated that the technology is available
and staff is looking at what is necessary to make this type of technology
work with the new CAD/AVL system.

D. Other Matters
Director Folska said that she thought Director Bagley had an outstanding idea with
his request related to the Access-a-Cab Board Report. She asked that this
information be provided for every Board Report.

Director Folska stated that she believes that should be done as a standard,
consistent policy for every action item that comes to the Board. Marla Lien
explained that Director Bagley’s request was because there was a change to the
original recommendation. This could not be done for every Board Report because
often they are not changed.
Director Bagley believes that any decision that affects policy should come through
the Executive Committee. It is the Executive Committee’s prerogative to make
policy changes, not one Director that makes the recommendation. He noted that
his request was not related to policy but one specific item.
Chair Sisk agrees that staff should not be doing additional work. He said it was his
understanding that Director Bagley’s request was simply a redline copy of the
recommendation so the Board could compare.
Director Menten stated that she did not see anything wrong with Director Folska’s
recommendation for an amendment but she also appreciates Director Bagley asking
for the changes to be outlined clearly in a redline copy.
Director Solano believes Director Folska’s request for an amendment and
subsequent motion was relevant. He does not see how this relates to the
Executive Committee.
Director Bagley agreed that the amendment was not related to the Executive
Committee. He stated that his comment was simply that policy changes needed to
come through the Executive Committee.
Director Deadwyler commented that in the past she has asked for more information
when a recommendation comes to the Board. She would like to see the pitfalls,
risks, etc. better outlined. Director Deadwyler thinks the Board needs to
understand this before voting on an item. She feels that the Board only hears the
positives of a recommendation.
Director Walker noted that staff does provide alternatives in the Board Reports.

Director Walker noted that Director Bagley’s request was to see a redline copy of
the Board Report outlining Director Folska’s amendment. He stated that if there are
no changes to a recommendation there would not be anything for staff to show.

6.F

General Manager Washington believes that two issues are being confused. He said
that when staff recommends something to the Board it is very rarely changed.
Today, the Board did change the language of the recommendations. He said that is
the issue at hand. He stated that since the recommendation was changed, Director
Bagley requested a redline copy to show the change, which staff will provide.

Director Deadwyler stated that she did not like the tone of the conversation related
to Board policy.
Director Daly congratulated Committee Chair Lubow for a great first meeting.

B. Recommended Actions

• RTD Funding of DUSPA Project
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to contribute the
2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the Denver Union Station
Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station
project and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the February 18, 2014
Board meeting.
Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Terry Howerter, Assistant General Manager of Finance and
Administration, stated that in in March 2012, the RTD Board
authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the
Denver Unions Station Project Authority (DUSPA) to provide
working capital to the project. In December 2012 RTD
advanced DUSPA $3.3 million for Block A land sale proceeds.
He said that DUSPA used $1 million to convert the Trail
Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area. The
remaining funds were used to build Wynkoop Plaza. Terry
Howerter explained that this was recorded as a receivable on
RTD’s balance sheet. He stated that staff is asking for this
item to be removed.

Director Deadwyler participated via phone. Director Anderson was absent and Director
Rivera-Malpiede had left early.

Director Bagley appealed for the Board’s approval of this item.
He noted that he has been on the DUSPA Board for 3.5 years.
He stated that the work DUSPA did with these funds are
critical elements for the entire RTD District. Director Bagley
believes with the development around Denver Union Station
(DUS) the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing
(RRIF) and Transportation Infrastructure Finance and
Innovation Act (TIFIA) loans will be paid off much in advance
of the projections. He does not think it makes sense to make
DUSPA incur greater debt in order to pay RTD for investments
that benefit us. Director Bagley stated that the exact numbers
are hard to determine but the District will be well compensated
for this project.
Director James echoed Director Bagley’s comments. He is
confident that going forward the development around DUS will
be strong enough for the loans to be paid off early. He thinks
that RTD will benefit both qualitatively as well as
quantitatively.
Director Deadwyler asked when these funds were scheduled
to be paid back to RTD. She also wondered where the money
came from. Terry Howerter stated there was not a schedule
of repayment as the funds were a working capital advance.
He said the funds came from the proceeds of the sale of Block
A. RTD received about $10 million and advanced $3.3 million
to DUSPA.

C. Updates

• Fourth Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report

Director Hoy commented that in some of the reports the conclusion
indicated that staff would follow-up on the outcome. He wondered if that
follow-up information would be provided to the Board. Anne Marie IsaacHeslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that the follow-up results would be
presented as part of the quarterly audit report following the initial audit
report.

• Fourth Quarter 2013 Investment Report
There were no questions.

• December 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, noted that the December
Monthly Financial Status Report is the unaudited year-end data. He said the
audit should be complete sometime near May so these numbers could
change. Doug MacLeod stated that staff does not believe there will be any
major issues or unusual items as part of the audit but will keep the Board
updated. He informed the Board that this is the first year since 2008 that
RTD has had over 100 million riders. Terry Howerter noted that this was
also one of RD’s best years for Sales and Use Tax collections.
Director Folska wondered if the 7% increase in ridership was due to the
opening of the W-Line. She also wondered if RTD saw a 7% increase in fare
box revenues as well. Doug MacLeod noted that the 7% ridership increase
was just for the month of December. Ridership increased 2.5% for the year
while fare revenue increased 4.9%.
Director Folska asked how well CU Leeds did at forecasting RTD’s Sales and
Use Tax Revenue. Terry Howerter stated that they were off by about half.
The most recent forecast predicted an increase of 2% and it was actually
4.2%. General Manager Washington recognized that forecasting is not
easy, even for only one year. Director Folska highlighted that these numbers
show that CU Leeds is very conservative in their projections and Sales and
Use Tax is exceeding expectations. She believes if we err on the side of
being conservative than RTD will be in good shape going forward.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Feb 11, 2014 5:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, noted that the
audit reports are available in the February 11, 2014 Financial Administration
and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He asked if there were any questions.

6.G

Director Daly noted that CU Leeds forecasts are an improvement over what
RTD was using from the legislature or Governor’s office. He pointed out
that the dashboard was all green and asked staff to keep up the good work.
Committee Chair Walker thought Director Folska brought up an excellent
point related to ridership and flat fare revenue. He said that it would be
possible to see an increase in ridership but flat fare revenue depending on if
the additional riders had monthly passes, discount cards, etc. He stated that
there is not necessarily a correlation between ridership and fare revenue.
Terry Howerter said that Committee Chair Walker was correct. He noted
that as the SmartCard program gets implemented for all service RTD will
have better reporting to look at this.

Director Bagley commented that it is a good practice to under promise and
over deliver. He noted that there has been a tremendous amount of
discussion about increasing ridership. He said that the W-Line demonstrates
that when RTD develops new services, ridership jumps. Developing new
corridors, routes, etc. is how RTD increases ridership. He stated that 10
years from now it will be hard for RTD to grow ridership because we will not
be putting out major new service.

February Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Sisk opened this item by doing a quick walk through of the February Board agenda.
General Manager Washington shared that we will have a special recognition for the
American Red Cross for the grants and AED’s (defibrillators) that they awarded to RTD.
Chair Sisk inquired about the possible public participation for Tuesday night. General
Manager Washington indicated that we believe we have addressed the issue of 18th
Street traffic for the Wynkoop neighborhood but it is possible that a few of them may
show. We do expect representatives from the 9to5 group based around the attention that
the study has received. Director Deadwyler shared her perspective that it would have
been good if we had shared all of our material with them prior to the publishing of this
study. She believes it could have alleviated much of the attention. General Manager
Washington shared that RTD has made numerous attempts to visit with this group without
success. They were also participants in our RTD Reduced Fare Program but made no
mention of this in the study. Director Deadwyler reiterated that the coordinator had not
seen our information prior to the release of the document. As years evolve and leadership
changes, this type of information may have gotten lost in the process. Chair Sisk shared
that they had met with Mary Young (Mile-Hi Connects), General Manager Washington had

shared some information but he concurs that Mary Young appeared not to have been

Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve
moving the February 18 Board agenda before
the full Board.

Discussion:

Director Deadwyler noted that an action listed

MetroRide should have been under
recommended action. Paula Perdue confirmed
this information and corrections to the Board
agenda were made.
Committee members reviewed the updated
Board action for access-a-Cab to make sure the
modification proposed by Director Folska had
been made and a redlined copy was available.
Director Bagley provided a clarification of the
action item for the RTD funding of the DUSPA
Project.

III.

RTD Strategic Planning Overview
Chair Sisk introduced this item. He shared that he, GM Washington and Paula Perdue had
met with the facilitator in preparation for the March 1 Strategic Planning Advance. He
thinks it is important that the Board has an understanding and appreciation of the strategic
planning process we will be going through and how important their feedback is to the
process. He wanted to review this item with the Executive Committee to get their input.
GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair Bagley added that while we
had a successful year in 2013 for the GM Evaluation process, he wanted to enhance the
process and make continuous improvements. He had worked with the General Manager
and Paula Perdue to identify areas for improvement and we had worked together to
develop the graphs and mapping so hopefully Board members will understand the linkage
between what we do at the retreat and how that flows into the goal setting and the GM
evaluation process. All of this is part of the strategic planning process and the Board’s
role as governance and leaders in helping to set direction for the agency. We will go into
further analysis of the detailed mapping at a GM Oversight Committee meeting or perhaps

a 30 minute discussion at a study session so the full Board will have a chance to better
understand the process.

The Committee determined that all of this information is helpful and should be included in
the strategic planning advance preparation material but the focus at the strategic planning
advance (retreat) will be on the high level strategic planning process and timeline. Director
Bagley will establish the framework, Paula Perdue will present this information and General
Manager Washington will provide the example of how he develops his tactical goals and
the tie in to the type of projects/ action items that come before the Board in support of
these goals.
IV.

Other Matters




Director Bagley shared that he had six items for discussion:
o He would like RTD to consider hosting an infrastructure meeting with the South
Metro Business Development Group. Details need to be worked out.
o He would like to invite Tami Door and the Downtown Denver Partnership to a
committee meeting to talk about collaboration.
o He has requested security for the Strategic Planning Advance on March 1 similar to
what we provide at any Board meeting.
o He believes it is important that Board members traveling to conferences provide a
travel-tic of their trip. This provides an accounting of the use of public funds for
travel.
o He has provided a personal response to the letter from Will Toor. He believes it is
important that we provide support and work in a collaborative manner.
o He believes the new committee Chairs need to really be trained on how to focus
their meetings so that unrelated items are put in parking lots or handled quickly so
as not to derail the meeting. Paula Perdue responded that the lunch and learn
workshop on Board meeting effectiveness that was scheduled and cancelled in
December would address these type of tools for committee Chairs.
Director Deadwyler shared her frustration on a number of issues including her
perspective that not all Board members are treated equally or responded to in a timely
manner by staff. She provided two examples that she has had. She indicated that
some of the disruption at the Board/committee meetings comes about out of sheer
frustration and a desire for her voice to be heard. General Manager Washington

Paula Perdue reviewed the graphics of the pyramid that explains the components of the
strategic planning process (i.e. What-vision and mission and the How-strategic goals from
the strategic planning retreat and the tactical goals from the GM identifying the tasks,
activities, programs and projects that they will be implementing to achieve the goals). The
second graphic identified the components of the goal setting process and the performance
management and evaluation timeline.

indicated that he was unaware but advocated for the Board members to use the GMR
process and let the Board or his office know of the request. (Follow-up note: The two
items raised by Director Deadwyler were addressed by GM Washington with his staff.)
Director Folska concurred on some of the concerns and indicated that as new Board
members get familiar, some of this will start to improve. She emphasized that these
issues apply across the Board both with new and seasoned Board members.
Director Hoy shared his experience from the CDOT meeting on the US 36 PPP process.
He indicated there were roughly 300 people in attendance who were quite angry. The
meeting appeared out of control and security called for backup. This is a glaring
example of what happens when you wait too late to engage the public in the process
and not communicate in a timely manner. Director Tobiassen added that the HPTE and
visibility of this issue has been heightened to an international level. The concern was
expressed that this reflects poorly on the PPP process and may have far reaching
negative consequences on the willingness of the privates to participate in the process.
It could negatively impact RTD or other transit properties looking for PPP participation
on our projects.

helper and advanced through the ranks to become senior equipment engineer. He has
provided support for every support vehicle on the property today. He has done an
outstanding job as snow commander. He has 3 children and 4 grandchildren. Bob enjoys
skiing and hunting.
Mr. Reposa spoke and thanked RTD for 38 years. He has had a wonderful time on the job
and always looked forward to coming to work. He has had a history here at RTD of a lot
of firsts-moved from mechanic helper to first certified mechanic; awarded first master
mechanic coordinator position; appointed first quality control inspector; in engineering had
several firsts such as modification of first bus to natural gas, installation of video camera
on buses and first bus for access-r-ride. This has been a joy. He has had a great career
and he is sorry to go.
The Board and audience gave Mr. Reposa a standing ovation.

V.

Public Participation
Chair Sisk opened up public participation and asked participants to please stat their name
and address. They would have 3 minutes and he encouraged the speakers in the interest
of brevity to please speak to additional information if someone else has already spoken on
the subject.

Elise Jones, Boulder County Commissioner, thanked RTD for the delivery of FasTracks
but noted the promise has still not been fully realized along the US 36 corridor. The
BRT is a part of that promise and the MCC/US 36 corridor wants to work with RTD to
make sure the vehicles selected will work for their needs. The MCC would like to
encourage modifications on the MCI vehicles to make wider entrance aisles, add a door
in the back and enhance bike carriage capacity.
Brigid O’Connor stated that she and her family are residents in LODO and love the
lifestyle. She had a simple request. DO NOT load any more buses by their home-no
15L, or O or anything. Their backyard is being bombarded with buses. This is their
neighborhood where they live, work and play. The buses and the increased traffic
create safety issues. She cited concerns around (1) equitable routing solutions (2) Free
Metro Ride using diesel fuel and (3) no consideration for alternative fuel options. RTD
should be reasonable and not try to route all this traffic onto one street.
Steve Romero with Blackfeet Lighting indicated they were a subcontractor on card
readers for our fleeted buses and platform. He indicated there were up to $1/2M in
change orders that did not get paid. He feels his company was dismissed from the
project without reasonable cause. They have been trying to meet with the General
Manager and the Civil Rights Division but without prevail. He has over four years of
documentation that he can provide. RTD’s legal or DBE office is not helping and will

not meet with them. He has exhausted all options and would like to know how he can
get a meeting.
Lori Frasier, past chair of the US 36 Commuting Solutions, indicated that she supports
the Board action for the 59 MCI buses. She also supports the resolution that had been
submitted to RTD to retrofit the buses so that our BRT investment will provide a high
quality solutions to the needs of the corridor. She has witnessed the effect of good
public transportation on revitalization and believes it is vital for the US 36 corridor.
She expressed there is a lack of equity up north and that RTD may be taking a status
quo position on BRT. She encouraged RTD to step up to a true BRT technology and
honor our commitments for this corridor.
Mary Beth Archer, also representing the US 36 Commuting Solutions, provided her
support on the purchase of the MCI buses. She shared that she works for Hunter
Douglas which has over 600 employees who travel to work using public transit and
also bikes. She advocated for sufficient bike storage on the buses and at the facilities,
noting that a dedicated bike way will open about the same time as the BRT. She
believes the BRT solution should be an integration of bikes along with public
transportation. RTD needs to think outside of the box for possible solutions.
Doug Gragg shared that he was not happy to read about the lawsuit between DIA and
RTD and what happened to trigger this after two years. He also expressed sympathy
for the bikes on buses issues coming from Boulder but reminded the Board that other
districts/people have concerns about bikes on buses also. He also asked what do we
know about the company we are purchasing these buses from. Is it a US Company?
David Foster, Denver, identified himself as a lawyer hired to represent the interest of
the residents along the 18 St corridor. These people are true urban dwellers. They are
looking for a true process that will allow them to participate in the decision making
process. They will be appealing the decision of public works for a 2-way street. He has
not been able to find any order approving the two-way street conversion. The RTD
rerouting of bus traffic to 18th Street is relevant to the issue at hand. Is 18th Street
the appropriate place to reroute these buses and traffic which create safety issues and
affect the quality of life.
Amanda Sandoval, aid to City Council Woman Judy Montero, read a letter from Judy
expressing concerns from the residents in LODO. For a copy of the letter, please refer
to the minutes notebook located in the Board office.
Kirsten Marks shared her concern on the impact of buses being routed on the 18th
Street. She cited this is a Historic district which needs to be preserved.
Terri Tiemann indicated that she now lives in the IceHouse Lofts where she wanted to
be in the heart of LODO. This is a wonderful area to live, work and play. She works
from home and is concerned about the impact of the buses and noise level on her
business and quality of life. She is concerned about how she will get in and out of her
parking garage if we have about 30 buses per hour coming through that area. She had
just moved into the area from Brooks Towers where she had experienced buses below

her apartment and knows the impact of the noise and pollution which is the reason
that she moved.
Andy Abramorres shared that he is the president of the Franklin Lofts HOA. They are
concerned about the rerouting of the bus line and that we are not offering any green
solution. He is concerned about the safety of the neighborhood.

General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Update
Director Bagley indicated that the work of the General Manager Oversight and

requirement to look at the salary and compensation for compliance, RubinBrown,
independent audit firm, will provide their comments. Terry Howerter, CFO, then
introduced Cheryl Wallace and Matt Morino who provided their review.
Matt shared the assumptions of this report, noting that the 2013 compensation was in line
with the contract. The only difference was a vacation sellback. The Board authorized a
discretionary performance payout for 2014.

Chair Sisk thanked the Board for responding to his request on committee
assignments. He hopes to have the final assignments available by this Thursday.
This has been a hard decision but he tried to take everyone’s recommendations into
consideration. He thanked the Board members who participated in the Executive
Committee. There may be a few disappointments but he is confident they will be
able to work together in their shared goal to move this agency forward.
Chair Sisk indicated his understanding from the MPACT 64 polls that this issue is
off the table. The voters do not have an appetite at this time for a tax.
Chair Sisk thanked Directors Anderson and Solano for their participation at the

expanded to March 12.

General Manager's Report


General Manager Washington commented on a couple of items:
o US 36 BRT Vehicles—Staff is working with the US 36 stakeholders. He had
received a resolution last Tuesday that they have been reviewing and had
hoped to have a response. They were not able to have a response by this
Board meeting. There are 5 issues they are looking at:
1. Widening of the entrance of the MCI buses. They have also been
requested to look at the possibility for a second door on the bus.
They are in discussion with the manufacturer about these requests.
2. As customary when we roll out a new corridor, we want to roll out
with brand new buses. These buses will be branded specific for BRT.
This process takes about 26 months and right now it is a concern
over timing issues should we delay.
3. RFP/RFI—RTD has agreed to issue a RFI to see what vehicles may be
in the market. This will probably be 6-8 months out. They are
willing to have someone from the US 36/MCC to be part of the
evaluation team for this RFP/RFI. This is consistent with our process.
4. Bike capacity issues—RTD believes we are increasing our capacity
rather than reducing it through increased service frequencies. It is
true that the bike capacity per vehicle went down due to lift
requirements; however, if you add up the frequencies of the buses
that will be traveling along the BRT, the capacity to carry more buses
per hour greatly increases.
5. Pertaining to the issue of bikes on the front of the buses, the staff
does not recommend 3 or 4 due to concerns around safety.

Staff has been willing to engage with everyone about these vehicles and
bikes on buses; however, they understood that the representatives who had
met with them were speaking on behalf of everyone and was reporting back
to the whole community. Staff will continue to work these issues but it is
very important that we have these new, branded vehicles for opening day.
18 St Bus Service—There has been extensive public input opportunities and there

General Manager Washington attended the Transportation Research Board annual
meeting which was held in Washington DC January 14-16. This is a committee
that researches all issues related to multi-modal forms of transportation. He is a
member of the Executive Committee. They have published a list of the critical
issues in transportation for 2013-2014. One of the hot items is the positive train
control which has surfaced as a result of the accidents in other locations. RTD is
implementing positive train control on our Eagle System from the ground up. Other
agencies are having to retrofit which is much more difficult to accomplish. AGMs
Rick Clarke and Dave Genova presented at this meeting.
RTD just celebrated the 2014 Leadership Academy kickoff which is the 3rd class.
This is our next generation of transportation leaders.
While out east, he and Rick Clarke visited the Hyundai Rotem Plant which will be
supplying the commuter rail cars for DIA and Arvada. We have 20 vehicles in the
production shop. People will be surprised related to the difference in size and
capacity from the light rail vehicles.
Washington and FTA have recently made leadership changes. Peter Rogoff, former
FTA Administrator, will assume role as understudy Secretary; Therese McMillian
who we know well is now FTA. We hope to be able to have a meeting with these
officials, including the USDOT Anthony Foxx, while in Washington DC.
Proposed Public Private Partnership (P3) Roundtable May 9—In concurrence with
the grand opening of DUS, Patton Boggs has proposed a P3 roundtable event which
will lead into the DUS grand opening activities. We are looking at three panels: (1)
federal policies (2) Denver Success Story (3) Privates
RTD-DIA legal dispute—The issue of the legal dispute that appeared in the papers is
not unusual especially when you are under construction for $Billion dollar projects.
This is an issue that surfaced about two years ago and the RTD Board was advised
about it at that time. The newspaper account was pretty accurate. The arbitrator
had provided a ruling consistent with the position of RTD which is being appealed
by DIA. He believes it is business as usual while this issue is being worked and it
should not have an impact on our construction timeline.

and had discovered some history around how the projections
were made. He was pleased with their response and knows
this is a complex and challenging agreement. He also heard
that only 10% of our ridership uses the parking facility. They
have put together a business plan that makes sense and puts
operations in a position to generate sufficient revenue for the
future.
Director Daly commented that in looking at the parking
structures on the West Line, there is still a lot of parking
structure with little usage (11% in Sheridan and 29% in
Wadsworth). He thinks they should consider charging for the
surface parking first until the parking structure capacity starts
to fill up.
Director Lasater commented that he has heard the same
complaints whether in-district or out-of-district. The complaint
is Central Parking enforces what is said but the signage is poor
and confusing so often times people are not clear on what
they should do. We need to work on signage, and make it
clear and concise. Chair Sisk concurred.

Board Meeting Date: February 18, 2014

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one
member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to
fill a vacancy on the Committee.
BACKGROUND
The seventeen-member FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) advises the District on matters
relating to the implementation of the voter approved FasTracks program, and performs such additional
duties as requested by RTD. The Committee serves in an advisory capacity through the designated
liaison to the Board of Directors, staff and project consultants
Committee member Steve Lawrence submitted his resignation from the CAC effective February 19,
2014, due to his pending deployment with the Peace Corps.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving on the CAC was publicly advertised through the RTD Web
site, a news release sent to stakeholders, local publications and electronic broadcast media lists totaling
1,541 recipients, current CAC members for distribution to their networks, and through other distribution
channels. Applicants were asked to submit a one-page letter stating their interest in serving on the CAC
along with specific qualifications, highlights of related experience and expertise and a resume if
available. Forty applications were received by the deadline.
The Nominating Committee, composed of two Board members and two Assistant General Managers,
carefully reviewed each application received in order to fill vacant positions at the end of 2013, and to
identify alternates should a vacancy occur during 2014, considering criteria outlined in the Committee
Structure adopted by the Board in 2005, including:






Broad representation of stakeholder interests
Diversity
Demonstrated interest in public transit and/or the FasTracks program
Previous community service
Professional experience.

The following applicant was identified as the first alternate and is recommended for appointment to fill
the remaining portion of Mr. Lawrence’s term expiring on December 31, 2014:
Hannah Polow is a Transportation Planner at Boulder County Transportation. She has worked on projects
such as bike storage along the BOLT route on the Diagonal Highway; encouraging secondary school
students to travel to school in a sustainable manner; the county's transportation master plan; working
with architects to create a successful transportation plan at a human services building; and responding

Packet Pg. 76

11.A

to bicycle issues related to the September 2013 flood. Her personal attention to transportation issues
started as a college student at CU-Boulder—especially how to combine transit with other modes. She
got her Bachelor's from CU-Boulder and holds a Master's in Urban and Regional Planning from UCLA.
She works all over Boulder County and is a resident of Boulder, RTD District O.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no additional financial impact.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors appoint one new member to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory
Committee of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) to fill a vacancy on the Committee.
2. Modify the recommended appointments to the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee. This is
not recommended as the identification of an alternate followed an extensive public application
process and is within the parameters of the Committee Structure adopted by the RTD Board of
Directors.
3. Do not adopt the Recommended Action. This is not recommended as this alternative would delay
the appointment process of the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee.

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD) for a share of the 16th Street
Maintenance (Blocks 1-13)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or designee, to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the shared maintenance cost of the 13 block portion
of the 16 th Street Mall between Broadway and Market Street. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD
to share the cost of maintaining the granite pavers, curbs and transition stones within the
transitway.
BACKGROUND
The 16 th Street Mall transitway, which is used by the RTD shuttle bus, has been maintained by RTD
since the early 1980’s. This does not include maintenance by RTD the adjacent walkways, center
medians or intersections. Recent annual maintenance costs have risen significantly. RTD has also,
over the last 30 plus years, procured granite replacement pavers on an as needed basis for only the
transitway. Maintenance has included repairing or replacing granite pavers, grouted joints, setting
bed and the concrete sub-slab. RTD had at one time participated in tree replacements. This phase of
maintenance was discontinued by RTD during the mid-2000’s.
DISCUSSION
At meetings with CCD staff since late 2012 and through 2013, it has been determined that a cost
share with CCD would be appropriate. The cost for maintaining the walkways, medians and trees
will be further coordinated between CCD and the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP), and will not
include RTD. In the interest of providing a more equitable cost sharing the City and County of
Denver has supported a plan to split the cost of maintenance: 30% for CCD and 70% for RTD. The
estimated annual maximum maintenance cost for 2014 – 2016 is $950,000.00 per year for a total
maximum estimate of $2,850,000, which was used to establish the value of RTD’s current three year
option contract with Gallegos Masonry Construction. If this IGA is approved, CCD will reimburse RTD a
value of 30% of RTD’s annual expenditures, up to a maximum value of $300,000.00 annually.
RTD’s share will be the remaining 70% of the annual maintenance cost. RTD will take the lead in
providing design, construction management and cost control of this work, including sending invoices
to CCD. All direct procurement, construction and inspection costs, with the exception of
management expenses, will be reimbursable.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This IGA commits financial obligations by RTD and CCD. Implementation of this IGA implies future
financial commitments by RTD and CCD, subject to future RTD Board of Direc tors and Denver City
Council approvals. The resultant financial obligations are subject to each agency’s legally required
budgeting, authorization and appropriation process. Nothing in the IGA shall be construed as a
multiple fiscal year obligation by either party.

Packet Pg. 78

11.B

1. CCD will reimburse RTD 30% of the actual maintenance cost, up to $300,000.00 annually.
2. RTD will provide the remaining 70%.
The current year’s maintenance value for RTD’s share is included in RTD’s approved 2014 budget.
The estimated construction workforce is ten employees.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to enter
into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD) for the
shared maintenance cost of the 13 block portion of the 16 th Street Mall between Broadway and
Market Street. This IGA commits both RTD and CCD to share the cost of maintaining the granite
pavers, curbs and transition stones within the transitway.
2. Delay implementing the Recommended Action: This is not recommended because delaying the
implementation of the IGA would require that RTD renegotiate the IGA terms.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the IGA is not implemented, RTD would have to bear
the entire cost of the 16 th Street Mall transitway maintenance, and RTD would not receive CCD’s
share of the maintenance. The result would be a higher RTD maintenance cost.

GM

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 18, 2014

Subject:

May 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost increase of approximately $1,440,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. With the
opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse a service plan has been developed; rerouting existing bus
service from the former Market Street Station to the new underground Bus Concourse facility at Denver
Union Station. Additionally, the Free MetroRide is a new service proposed for the downtown Denver
area. The Free Metro Ride would provide additional distribution/circulation service during peak periods to
supplement the existing Free Mall Ride service. Service changes not associated with or included in the
Denver Union Station Service Plan are also proposed to maintain system on-time performance and
provide the appropriate level of service according to customer demand. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of Union Station Service Plan service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two public hearings were held on January 29, 2014 where the primary subject was the opening of the
Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Comments from these meetings and the service change website
are summarized in Attachment B of this report. It should be noted that three public hearings were held in
November 2013 to discuss the initial bus service plan for the opening of the DUS Bus Concourse.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

Packet Pg. 80

11.C

outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
May 2014 service change. Also included in these changes are items changed by amendment of the
initial proposal, through actions of the Board of Directors:

The City and County of Denver has proposed to change one-way traffic to two-way traffic
on 18th Street between Wynkoop and Blake streets. If 18th Street is available for
southbound traffic to Blake Street, this route would be realigned for use in both directions.
No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 3 – Alameda Crosstown
Midday trips extended to Alameda Station to address passenger capacity constraints
currently experienced when the service frequency of the western segment is reduced from
peak levels. Additional schedule adjustment will also be made. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Ave/North Pecos
Schedule adjustments to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron: southbound buses will use West 45th Avenue from
Lincoln Street, replacing the one-block segment of West 46th Avenue. The new alignment
provides a better stop for passengers needing to use wheelchair lifts.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Schedule adjustments to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 15L – East Colfax
The route is proposed to extend the route from 15th Street to the Decatur/Federal Station
via Blake Street, Auraria Parkway, the Colfax viaduct, Federal Boulevard and West Howard
Place. Eastbound trips would start from West Howard Place to Decatur Street, West
Holden Place, Federal Boulevard, to the Colfax Viaduct, Auraria Parkway, and continue to
the existing route on Market Street. Please see attached map for further details. Costs are
estimated to be $530,000 annualized.
Route 16 Limited – West Colfax
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue alternate weekday trips between Civic
Center Station and Oak Street between 9:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. Half-hourly trips through
to Golden would continue with minor adjustments for improved schedule adherence.
Cost savings estimated to be $133,000 annualized.
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
It is proposed to reroute trips that end at Federal Boulevard to instead end at the new bus
concourse at Union Station. Westbound service from 15th Street would continue via
Market Street to 18th Street. Eastbound service would travel via Wynkoop Street to 17th
Street. The City and County of Denver has proposed to change one-way traffic to twoway traffic on 18th Street between Wynkoop and Blake streets. If 18th Street is available
to southbound traffic, the route would be aligned to use 18th Street, to Blake Street, to

This meeting was attended by 23 members of the public and RTD Board members Director Bill James
and Director Natalie Menten. RTD staff in attendance included: Robert Rynerson, Jeff Becker, Jessie
Carter, Doug Monroe, Chris Marko, and Diane Marquiss.
The comments from public largely centered on the proposal affecting the area around 18th Street
between Wazee and Wynkoop Streets accessing the DUS bus concourse. It was the view of those who
spoke that the routing was a burden unfairly placed on the residents in the area. The attendees
suggested alternative routings be studied to provide a more equitable distribution of the bus traffic
going into DUS. It was pointed out that pedestrian safety along with parking access were of great
concern.
Other comments were heard in favor of changes made to the Route 9 and comments made on behalf of
riders of late night/early light rail service.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: January 29, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

January 29, 2014

Board Meeting Date: February 18, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD) for the Free MetroRide

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver (CCD), for the maintenance of
roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the operation of the Free MetroRide,
formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
BACKGROUND
The Free MetroRide will be a high-frequency bus service that will transport passengers between Denver
Union Station and the Civic Center area. The Monday to Friday, peak rush hours (6-9 a.m. and 3-6
p.m.) headway will be 5-6 minutes. There are no current plans to provide weekend, mid-day or evening
service, however, this could change depending on ridership and funding availability. Service from
Denver Union Station will travel southeast on 19th Street, turn south onto Broadway and then east onto
16th Avenue at Civic Center. From Civic Center, the route continues east on 16th Avenue, north onto
Lincoln Street, and then northwest onto 18th Street to Denver Union Station. The Free MetroRide will
supplement RTD’s Free Mall Ride, which runs on the 16th Street Mall, and like the Mall shuttle, will be
free and uniquely branded.
DISCUSSION
RTD designed, funded, and is currently constructing 13 uniquely branded Free MetroRide bus stops.
Nine bus stops will be street-side, and four will be at bus islands that will extend beyond existing streetside curbs. Each Free MetroRide stop will have a concrete bus stopping pad, custom route markers and
nine stops will have canopies. The bus islands will also have custom seating bollards and planters. 18 th
Street is a City designated bicycle route. The bicycle lanes, as needed, will be located between the bus
island and existing street-side curbs. The customized elements at the Free MetroRide stops and the
bicycle lanes require a repair and maintenance IGA with CCD that clarifies responsibilities.
The IGA includes the following provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements within
CCD’s right-of-way. If approved, it becomes retroactively effective on November 1, 2013. Key
provisions of the IGA include the following:
1. RTD to maintain and repair four bus islands, all shelter canopies, street furnishings at all stops, and
the bicycle lane concrete and pavement markings located between the bus islands and street-side
curbs.
2. Annual payments of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for maintenance, snow removal, and
cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands.
3. RTD shall repair the bicycle lanes, as needed for the four segments located at bus islands, and shall

Packet Pg. 99

12.D

also maintain the bicycle lane pavement markings in those same locations.
4. Major encumbrance permits and fees will be waived by CCD.
5. Any construction moratorium on 19th Street and 16th Avenue will be eliminated by CCD.
6. CCD agrees not to charge RTD for the parking meters.
7. The IGA also addresses provisions for its possible termination and future cost shares.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RTD shall provide an annual amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) to CCD for the
maintenance, snow removal, and cleaning of bicycle lane segments located at the bus islands,
commencing in 2014.
2. If CCD’s necessary and reasonable annual expenses for maintenance are greater or less than an
average of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) for 2014 and 2015, RTD’s annual payment shall be
adjusted accordingly. Invoices shall be provided by CCD to RTD by April 1, 2016. For each
subsequent two-year period thereafter, while this IGA is in effect, RTD’s annual payment shall be
increased or decreased accordingly to actual costs. RTD’s annual payments shall be due on July 1 of
each year.
3. Roadway and street furniture construction costs were included in a separate on-call FasTracks
contract for the current amount of $2.4M, which includes a 35% DBE goal. In addition, 12 buses
were purchased for this project at a cost of $8,389,343.00.
4. Approximately 15 construction employees are being utilized for the work.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the City and County of Denver
(CCD), for the maintenance of roadway and street furniture improvements constructed for the
operation of the Free MetroRide, formerly known as the Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator).
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would impact the
operation of the Free MetroRide , causing inconvenience to the public. The stop improvements are
currently under construction. The Free MetroRide is a component of the FasTracks plan, and is
needed to support the Free MetroRide service that has been established.
3. Delay implementing the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it would cause
inconvenience to the public. Market Street Station bus operations will move to DUS on May 11,
2014. Moving passengers between DUS and Civic Center provides a significant downtown
connection, which is crucial for RTD’s operations and its patrons.

Subject:

Contract Award for the District Shops HRU
Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible
bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit
(HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the
project budget in the amount of $322,103.
BACKGROUND
The scope of the District Shops HRU project is to replace 16 HRU’s that are beyond their useful life with
new units. The existing units were installed when the building was constructed in 1989. The 100%
outside air HRU’s provide gas heating, evaporative cooling, and energy recovery. The units exhaust
100% of the air supplied. The energy recovery section tempers incoming air to cool it in the summer and
warms it in the winter using energy absorbed from the exhaust air process.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on September 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on October 15,
2013 and the bids were received on October 29, 2013 as follows:
1. JCOR - $2,669,400
2. Legacy - $2,733,500
DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal was advertised at 7% with JCOR meeting the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2014 approved budget. With the transfer the construction
budget will be $2,669,400: $1,877,837.20 from federal grant CO-04-0043 with $469,459.80 of local
match and $257,682.40 from the State of Good Repair (SOGR) grant with $64,420.60 of local match.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be
made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. Also, do not authorize a

Packet Pg. 102

12.E

transfer from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of
$322,103. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered competitive,
and delay may result in the loss of grant funds.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project has been fully
designed and the existing units are beyond their useful life and need replacement. Additionally, any
delay may result in the loss of grant funds.

Transfer of Funds from Light Rail Capital to
Light Rail Expense

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $703,000 in approved 2014
capital to an expense line to facilitate the development of revised Light Rail Vehicle specifications.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at the November 2013 meeting. One of the
capital projects approved at that meeting was funding to purchase Track Maintenance Equipment for the
Maintenance of Way Division of Rail Operations.
Since that time we have determined that in order to move forward with the purchase of new Light Rail
Vehicles scheduled for 2015 we need to develop a revised specification.
DISCUSSION
In order to develop a revised specification we need to get outside assistance from LTK, doing business
FRSC, as we have in the past. This will require a transfer of funds from capital to expense to fund the
work order on a contract that already exists.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will not create a financial impact to the district since it is a transfer from capital to
expense. It will have a zero effect on the current approved budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
The DBE requirements were satisfied when the current agreement with LTK (FRSC) was approved.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
develop a revised specification for Light Rail Vehicles to be ordered in 2015.
2. Do not authorize the transfer which will cause a delay in the purchase of Light Rail Vehicles
which have been scheduled for 2015.

Access-a-Ride Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer in the amount of $5,271,915 to re-allocate previously approved Access-aRide 2014 funding from budget accounts associated with the expired Access-a-Ride service provider
contracts to budget accounts associated with the new Access-a-Ride service provider contracts.
BACKGROUND
The 2014 Access-a-Ride budget was prepared in mid-2013 and was based on the Access-a-Ride service
provider model that was in effect at that time. This model included four (4) dedicated-vehicle service
providers. In late-2013, the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts were re-bid and in November of
2013, the Board of Directors approved the award of the Access-a-Ride service provider contract to three
(3) dedicated-vehicle and one (1) non-dedicated-vehicle service providers. As a result, the 2014
approved budget funds for Access-a-Ride need to be re-allocated to the service providers chosen to
provide service in the new Access-a-Ride contract. The Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at
the November 2013 meeting.
DISCUSSION
The total budget dollars being transferred, or re-allocated, is $5,271,915. This budget transfer will result
in some budget line items being reduced and others being increased, and the net effect on the 2014
budget is zero.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will have no impact on the approved 2014 budget because it is simply a re-allocation of
previously approved funds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the budget transfer as recommended in order to proceed with the contract awards.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will cause a
delay in the processing of the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts for 2014.

Access-a-Cab Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to extend
Agreements with Metro Taxi, Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD, the General Manager, or his
designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements with each participating cab
company for three (3) years with two 1-year options.
BACKGROUND
In March of 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-aRide program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers are permitted to schedule same day trips with local taxi cab companies. Local
taxi companies currently participating include Yellow Transportation, Union Taxi, and Metro Taxi.
DISCUSSION
The subsidized Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular. Trips that are taken using the
Access-a-Cab service involve a lesser RTD subsidy per ride than trips taken on the regular Access-aRide service. All persons using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use our Paratransit service,
Access-a-Ride. The budget for 2014 is as follows: Metro Taxi, $1,200,000, Yellow Cab, $800,000,
and Union Taxi Inc., $150,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab is budgeted annually based on ridership
and anticipated demand. The Board will have the opportunity to review these contracts every 3-5 years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2014 approved budget. Funds for Access-a-Cab
service in future years will be requested as part of future budget processes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program.
2. Do not approve the continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program. This is not
recommended as it will increase overall subsidy costs for our programs to serve individuals with
disabilities.

RTD Funding of DUSPA Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager to contribute the 2012 $3.3 million working capital advance to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of the Denver Union Station project
and relieve the related receivable as of December 31, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Denver Union Station Project Authority is constructing the $480 million Denver Union Station
redevelopment project which is funded through a combination of federal loans, state and federal grants,
land sale proceeds, an RTD bond, and FasTracks funds. When the $480 million project is completed, all
project elements will belong to RTD. To date RTD has contributed approximately $222.8 million, which
is comprised of a $168 million RTD Bond and a combination of FasTracks-funded project planning,
oversight and change order costs.
The Denver Union Station (DUS) project is comprised of multiple elements. The light rail plaza opened in
May 2012 and the underground bus complex will open to the public on May 9, 2014. The project is a
key element for the FasTracks vision and will be the central multi-modal hub of the RTD transit system.
It will be recognized as the “Grand Central Station” of the metropolitan area in the heart of the city.
Through its 22 bus bays and light rail and commuter rail platforms the station is designed to
accommodate up to 10,000 people per hour.
DISCUSSION
In March 2012, the RTD Board of Directors authorized an advance of up to $6 million in funds to the
Denver Union Station Project Authority. This advance was authorized to provide working capital to the
project since DUSPA’s funding sources could only be accessed on a reimbursement basis after
expenditures had been made. In December 2012, RTD advanced approximately $3.3 million from Block
A land sale proceeds of the authorized $6 million. Of the $3.3 million advance, DUSPA used $1 million
to convert the Tail Tracks Plaza to a platform walkway and sitting area. The remaining funds were used
to build Wynkoop Plaza.
When the $3.3 million advance was made in December 2012, RTD recorded the $3.3 million as a
receivable from DUSPA to indicate that the funds were anticipated to be paid back at a future date. In
addition, an allowance for $3.3 million dollars was recorded in the event that DUSPA would be unable to
repay these funds. An allowance is required under conservative accounting principles when the
possibility of an inability to repay exists. The project has a fixed amount of funding available for project
completion and there was some uncertainty of remaining costs at the time. This method of accounting
effectively offsets the receivable leaving no future negative impact to RTD’s fund balances.
As the project approaches completion, it is clear that all funds DUSPA has received are needed to
complete the project. If DUSPA were to repay the advance to RTD, DUSPA would have to borrow those
funds, thereby incurring interest and increasing the project cost to RTD. After careful consideration,

Packet Pg. 110

12.I

staff has determined that contributing the $3.3 million to the project and relieving the receivable would
be the best course of action. With an effective date of December 31 2013, we would remove the
receivable and its allowance from RTD’s balance sheet while showing the $3.3 million invested in the
RTD owned capital asset.
In the future, RTD may realize a financial benefit to compensate for the additional $3.3 million project
funding from the possible early retirement of DUSPA’s debt. DUSPA’s debt obligations are funded
through tax increment financing (TIF) generated from property, sales and lodging taxes in the DUS taxing
district as well as the RTD bond. Due to accelerated development in the TIF district, DUSPA is currently
receiving TIF revenues at a rate higher than originally forecasted in the financial plan. These excess TIF
revenues will be applied toward the early payment of outstanding principal on DUSPA’s TIFIA and RRIF
loans. If these two loans are repaid before RTD meets the entirety of the RTD bond payment schedule
(approximately $12 million per year for 30 years) RTD’s bond obligations to DUSPA will cease at that
time. Because DUSPA would not have to borrow the $3.3 million, this has the potential of saving RTD
at least $3.3 million in future bond payments.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Because the receivable allowance was recorded in 2012, there will be no financial impact. Approval of
this action item would simply result in a financial statement entry at December 31, 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the staff recommendation to authorize the General Manager to contribute the $3.3 million
working capital advance to the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) towards completion of
the Denver Union Station project and relieve the related receivable.
2. Do not approve the staff recommendation and wait until project close-out to see if DUSPA has funds
to repay RTD. This is not the recommended action because it is unlikely that there will be funds
remaining which would cause DUSPA to borrow additional funds thereby increasing the cost to RTD.
3. Do not approve staff recommendation and seek repayment options through alternate means.
