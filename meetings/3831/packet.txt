BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Successor Strategic Plan Consultancy Solicitation

September 8, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the scope of work summary for a solicitation for a consultancy to
assist with the development of the successor five-year strategic plan for the 2026-2031 planning
horizon.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-26 Strategic Plan is an ambitious but actionable roadmap adopted by the Board of
Directors on August 10, 2021, that established the agency’s vision, mission, values, strategic
priorities, success outcomes, and key performance metrics. The Board subsequently adopted
revisions to the Strategic Plan in June and October 2024 and approved the current official version of
the plan that incorporates those revisions in April 2025.
Staff has successfully leveraged the 2021-26 Strategic Plan over its duration to gauge progress
toward measurable success outcomes and to make incremental enhancements in terms of
opportunity areas with respect to the four Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. As a result, nearly every community,
customer, employee, and financial performance metric has seen substantial improvement from 2022,
the first full year of the plan’s lifespan, to present.
DISCUSSION
As the sunset of the 2021-26 Strategic Plan approaches, RTD is seeking the services of a qualified
consultancy with ample transit agency experience related to strategic plan development and
maintenance; workshop and retreat facilitation; board, agency leadership, and stakeholder
engagement; and the development of measures, methodologies, and data systems used to manage
agency performance. The key deliverable for the project will be the successor five-year strategic plan
for the 2026-2031 planning horizon.
The strategic planning process led by the consultancy will include discovery of key aspects of the
agency, including but not limited to the vision, mission, organizational structure, transit service
delivery, and local, state, and federally required programs. The selected consultancy will lead and

to assess desired strategic outcomes and identify strategies, reflective of industry trends and transit
agency best practices, to achieve those outcomes.

demonstrable transportation/transit consulting experience to assist in planning and implementing.

• Task 1: Initial Discovery: Review of relevant agency documents, including but not limited to
prior strategic planning development documentation, relevant board materials and audits,
budgets, agency performance
