BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2013

Subject:

Proposed 2013
Statement

and

2014

Fiscal

Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal Policy Statement as well as accept these modifications
for 2014.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement are brought to the Board for approval during the
year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy Statement for the
following fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step in development of the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy Statement was approved by the Board of Directors in
October 2012 for the 2013 fiscal year. The approved policy modifications for 2013 were primarily to
define the FasTracks Fund Balance Policy to maintain three months of operating expenses excluding
depreciation for FasTracks operations. This modification was approved to be consistent with the Base
System Fund Balance Policy which follows GFOA recommended best practices to provide stability of
service levels during economic downturns or other unforeseen financial events. The 2013 Fiscal Policy
Statement modifications specifically addressed the operating fund balance needs of the FasTracks
program because the opening of the first FasTracks corridor for revenue service will occur in 2013.
DISCUSSION
Board approval is requested in order to update the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2013 to include the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) and to use this updated Fiscal Policy Statement in the
development of the 2014 Strategic Budget Plan and 2014 Requested Budget.
Recommended changes to the Fiscal Policy Statement are shown in the accompanying marked-up
document with changes indicated in red.
The proposed changes to the Fund Balance Policies section are requested in order to align fiscal policies
with the establishment of the FISA beginning in 2013 as approved by the Board of Directors in
December 2012. This Fund Balance Policy modification will add a separate fund, referred to as FISA, to
track funds that become available from the sources identified in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). The
FISA was established to identify and appropriate funding for FasTracks projects that are currently
unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA fund must be approved by the Board of Directors.
The proposed changes to the Debt Policies section are requested to reflect the most recent bond rating
agency credit ratings that were completed with the December 2012 bond issuance.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The proposed change to the Budget Policies which removes the reference to excluding depreciation from
the budget, reflects the revised methodology to roll forward budgeted fund balances for consistent
comparison to actual results.
All other policies remain unchanged from the previous Board approved 2013 policies.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Changing the policy as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2013 Budget. Items identified
in the RAM that will provide funding for the FISA will primarily begin in 2014. As opportunities arise in
2013 to contribute funds to the FISA, the proposed 2013 Amended Budget will be adjusted accordingly.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports this
alternative because the changes address the Fund Policy needs of the FISA and RAM as well as
provides current information regarding credit ratings and budgeting methods.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff has reviewed the RTD Fiscal Policy
Statement and welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board.
3. Do not adopt the recommended changes to RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not
recommended because the District’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current
language and would not best facilitate the needs of the District’s financial operations and tracking
of the FISA.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
2013-20143 PROPOSED FISCAL POLICY STATEMENT

REVENUE POLICIES
1. The Board of Directors will review potential fare increases annually at the time of the
development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). As part of this process, staff will
review potential fare increases to establish a fare structure with due consideration for:
 consistency and equity throughout RTD;
 ease of use and simplicity;
 maintaining or increasing ridership and fare revenues;
 acceptability and marketability of fare structure to customers and the general public;
and
 verification and enforceability of fare payment compliance.
2. Fare policies should take into account the special needs of transit dependent, elderly,
youth, student, handicapped, and commuter patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. One-time
revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure the
continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board will
support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state financial
resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that would limit or
diminish revenue.
6. Staff will identify on an annual basis excess property and equipment, and will make an
ongoing attempt to sell such excess property and equipment to enhance cash flow.

INVESTMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will review its investment policy annually with the Board to ensure consistency with
the following objectives (in order of priority):
 safety of invested funds;
 maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow needs; and
1

attainment of the maximum yield possible consistent with the first two objectives

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)



2. RTD will review its investment performance on a quarterly basis with the Board.

EXPENDITURE POLICIES
1. RTD will endeavor to achieve service levels that will make the transit system easier to
use, improve travel times, and be more effective.
2. RTD will continue to look for and implement the most cost-effective and reliable
methods of delivering transportation services.
3. RTD will maintain all assets at a level that protects capital investment and minimizes
future maintenance and replacement costs.
4. RTD maintains a risk management program which will provide protection against loss
and mitigate exposure to liability.
5. A safety program will be maintained to minimize RTD's exposure to liability and thereby
reduce the number of claims against RTD.
6. RTD will develop service changes that are needed to respond to budget shortfalls using
the system-wide and route-specific productivity measures that have been approved by
the Board.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT POLICIES
1. RTD will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including
projected capital construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs,
and revenues to fund the capital and operating programs. Capital projects to be
included in the SBP will be evaluated using the following criteria:
 total project cost (design and construction) and schedule for completion;
 source of funding;
 operating and maintenance costs for the remainder of the SBP period;
 benefits and contributions to RTD and the community, including but not limited to the
effect on future operating and maintenance costs, economy, service, and ridership;
 consideration of alternatives (joint development, etc.); and
 consequences of not funding
2. Priority will be given to replacement of existing assets before consideration of new
assets except as allowed for in the FasTracks financial plan (see 7.).

Fiscal Policy Statement - effective February 19, 2013

Attachment: FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement (1497 : Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement)

3. RTD will use the first year capital program from the adopted SBP as the basis for the
capital program to be included in the annual budget.
4. After completion of design of a capital project, cost estimates will be revised. If the cost
estimates exceed Delegation of Authority limits, the project will be brought to the Board
for reconsideration.
5. Facilities will be designed using current technology and allow for future technological
changes in order to be efficient and cost-effective and to protect the public welfare.
6. RTD shall allow for multi-year capital projects to be carried forward in accordance with
the carry-forward resolution adopted by the Board.
7. RTD will prepare an annual update of the FasTracks financial plan incorporating the
actual costs incurred and the most recent available projections of capital improvement
costs, service levels, and operating costs and revenues to fund the FasTracks capital
and operating programs.

FUND BALANCE POLICIES
1. RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature or
to meet unexpected increases in costs. This unrestricted fund balance will be
comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund and an
undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three
months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For FasTracks,
the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
twothree months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation. RTD will
consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance replenishment. For
example, RTD may define the revenue sources that would typically be looked to for
replenishment of fund balance to include non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses.
Year-end surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.

2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board appropriated fund
balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and occur only
in specific circumstances such as severe economic downturns. With Board approval,
these funds may be used to avoid cash flow interruptions, reduce the need for shortterm borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond rating. The source
of replenishment of this fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
3

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.1.a

3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement fund
on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for scheduled major
vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of replenishment of this
fund will be identified and will take place in a prompt manner.
4. RTD will designate excess and undesignated working capital that may accrue at each
year-end to be placed in an unrestricted fund to be used to respond to unanticipated
events.

5. RTD will maintain an emergency (TABOR) reserve equal to three percent of nonFederal revenues, as specified by Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution.
6. RTD will maintain all revenues in excess of expenditures for Denver Union Station in a
reserve for future development of Denver Union Station as a rapid transit hub, as
specified in the intergovernmental agreement as amended on April 20, 2004.
7. The Board shall establish threetwo reserves for future construction under the FasTracks
plan:
 The FasTracks Contingency Reserve will be appropriated at a level of $30 million
each year. These funds will be available to fund adjustments to the FasTracks
construction schedule, relating to logistics or cost savings opportunities that might
arise after the annual budget is adopted, and will not be used to fund the (nonFasTracks) base system capital or operating activity.
 The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will be used to provide funding for
future FasTracks projects that are currently unfunded. Expenditures from the FISA
will be subject to Board approval with the staff recommended project goals identified
in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM). Funding of the FISA will be provided from the
sources identified in the Board approved RAM and other sources approved by the
Board.
 All other FasTracks funds which have not been appropriated, or otherwise
designated as reserved, in the current budget year will be maintained in a reserve
for future FasTracks capital and operating expenditures and will not be used to fund
the (non-FasTracks) Bbase Ssystem expenditures.

DEBT POLICIES
1. Capital projects funded through the issuance of bonds or Certificates of Participation
(COPs) shall be financed for a period not to exceed the expected useful life of the asset.

3. Before bonded long-term debt is issued, the impact of debt service on total annual
expenditures will be analyzed.
4. Bond financing or COPs will not be issued to support current operating expenditures.
It is the intent of RTD to maintain a high quality investment-grade credit rating. The
benefit of maintaining RTD's bond ratings at the highest reasonably attainable level in
light of current economic conditions and availability of capital funding is to receive lower
interest rates and lower bond or certificate insurance premiums than would be possible
with lower credit ratings. RTD’s current ratings are listed below:

0.6% sales and use tax. RTD will maintain a minimum gross sales tax revenue bond
coverage ratio for FasTracks (annual FasTracks sales and use tax revenue to annual
FasTracks sales and use tax debt service) of two times for debt backed by the 0.4%
FasTracks sales and use tax.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Taxable Sales Tax Revenue
Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the first of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in the
RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISCUSSION:
RTD issued its $116 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2004A (the “2004 Bonds”) in 2004 for
the purpose of financing a portion of the southeast light rail corridor. At present, $5.750 million par
amount of the 2004 Bonds remain outstanding.
RTD issued its $100 million Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2005A (the “2005 Bonds”) in
2005 for the purpose of refunding the 2000A and 2002B bonds then outstanding. At present, $98.865
million par amount of the 2005 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2004 and 2005 Bonds on a callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings
of approximately $24.2 million (3.06% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum savings of 2% which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold.
The 2004 Bonds are callable November 1, 2013 at par and the 2005 Bonds are callable November 1,
2015 at par.Pursuant to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance
refunded (refunding bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding
bonds)) once, and (b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of
outstanding bonds) without limit. The 2005 bonds were advance refunding bonds so the 2013
refunding bonds would not qualify for tax exemption and would be issued with a taxable status.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.2

While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2004 and 2005 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent an increase in
interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time due to a reduction in time proceeds
of the refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2004 and 2005 Bonds. Despite the cost
associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2004 and 2005
Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a
financing team and commenced documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity
for RTD to reduce its interest expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
refunding bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a
preliminary official statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase
agreement and the Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the
Resolution to authorize the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in
connection with the issuance of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Goldman Sachs, Loop Capital, Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series
2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds,
Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take advantage of the interest
expense savings currently available to the District.

A Series of Bonds entitled to the benefit, protection and security of
the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution is hereby authorized in the maximum principal amount
set forth in Section 201 hereof, and maturing in the years and in the amounts set forth in the Sale
Certificate, and shall be designated as, and shall be distinguished from the Bonds of all other
Series by the title, “Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.” If set forth in
the Sale Certificate, the Registered Coupons are hereby authorized.

The purpose for which the Refunding Bonds are being issued is to

3.
The Refunding Bonds shall be dated as of the date of their delivery
or as otherwise required by Section 301 of the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution. The
Refunding Bonds shall mature, bear “A” and “B” interest (if set forth in the Sale Certificate,
including interest evidenced by Registered Coupons), from their dated date to maturity or prior
redemption, and be sold, all as provided in the Sale Certificate, subject to the parameters and
limitations in Section 201. Interest on the Refunding Bonds shall be calculated on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1,
commencing on the date provided in the Sale Certificate.
4.
The Refunding Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiples of $5,000, provided that no Refunding Bond
may be in a denomination which exceeds the principal coming due on any maturity date, and no
individual Refunding Bond will be issued for more than one maturity bearing interest at the same
interest rate. Unless the District shall otherwise direct, the Refunding Bonds shall be lettered and
numbered separately from 1 upward preceded by the letter R prefixed to the number.
5.
The principal, Redemption Price of, and final interest payment on
the Refunding Bonds, or the interest represented by Registered Coupons, shall be payable to the
registered owner thereof as shown on the registration records kept by the Bond Registrar, upon
maturity thereof or prior redemption, or upon the due date of the Registered Coupons, and upon
presentation and surrender at the designated offices of The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A., as Paying Agent for the Refunding Bonds, as designated by the Paying Agent.
Payment of interest on any Refunding Bond, other than the payment on the Registered Coupons
or the final interest payment thereon, shall be made by wire, or by check or draft mailed by the
Paying Agent, on or before each interest payment date (or, if such interest payment date is not a
business day, on or before the next succeeding business day), to the registered owner thereof at
the address shown on the registration records kept by the Bond Registrar on the Record Date; but
any such interest not so timely paid or duly provided for shall cease to be payable to the person
who is the registered owner thereof at the close of business on the Record Date and shall be
payable to the person who is the registered owner of such Refunding Bond at the close of
business on a Special Record Date (the “Special Record Date”) for the payment of such

become available for payment of defaulted interest, and notice of the Special Record Date shall
be given to the registered owners of the Refunding Bonds not less than 10 days prior thereto by
mail to each such registered owner as shown on the Bond Registrar’s registration records on a
date selected by the Trustee, stating the date of the Special Record Date and the date fixed for the
payment of defaulted interest. The principal and Redemption Price of, and interest on, all
Refunding Bonds shall also be payable at any other place which may be provided for such
payment by the appointment of any other Paying Agent or Paying Agents as permitted by the
Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution.
6.
The Refunding Bonds shall be subject to optional redemption prior
to their respective maturity dates and mandatory sinking fund redemption if so provided in the
Sale Certificate.
7.
The Refunding Bonds shall be issued in fully registered form as to
principal and interest and shall be exchangeable and transferable only for fully registered
Refunding Bonds of the same maturity of any authorized denominations and, except as set forth
in this section, upon the terms and conditions otherwise provided in Article III and Article IV of
the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, as amended.
8.
At the time of initial delivery of the Refunding Bonds to the
Underwriters, if so provided in a Sale Certificate, the Refunding Bonds may be accompanied by
Registered Coupons evidencing additional interest on all or any portion of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be in fully registered form (i.e., registered as to payment of the
supplemental interest) provided that no Registered Coupon shall be issued for more than one due
date. The Registered Coupons shall be dated as of the date of delivery of the Refunding Bonds.
The Registered Coupons shall be numbered in such a manner as the District shall determine.
Each Registered Coupon shall entitle the registered owner thereof to receive payment of a
portion of the interest payable with respect to the Refunding Bonds as described herein. The
Registered Coupons may be owned, transferred and presented for payment separately from the
Refunding Bonds. References in this Resolution to the Refunding Bonds shall be deemed to
include the Registered Coupons where the context so requires. Except as specifically provided
herein or in the Registered Coupons, no provision of this Resolution relating to the Refunding
Bonds shall be deemed to affect the rights of the owners of Registered Coupons to receive
payments as provided herein.
9.
The net proceeds of the Refunding Bonds shall be applied as set
forth in the Sale Certificate.
10.
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Refunding Bonds
and the Registered Coupons shall initially be registered in the name of the Securities Depository
or a nominee therefor, and this subsection 10 shall apply so long as the Refunding Bonds are
registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. Purchases by
Beneficial Owners of the Refunding Bonds shall be made in book-entry form in the principal
amount of $5,000 or any integral multiple thereof. The Beneficial Owners shall not receive

maturity date and bearing interest at the same interest rate. So long as any Refunding Bond or
Registered Coupon is registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor,
the Securities Depository shall disburse any payments received, through Participants or
otherwise, to the Beneficial Owners. None of the District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar or the
Paying Agent shall have any responsibility or obligation for the payment to any Participant, any
Beneficial Owner or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons are registered) of the principal of, interest on or any
premium due in connection with the redemption of the Refunding Bonds. The Refunding Bonds
shall be initially issued so that a single Refunding Bond shall evidence the obligation of the
District to pay all principal due on each of the maturity dates for which the Refunding Bonds
bear the same interest rate, and the Registered Coupons initially shall be evidenced by one
Registered Coupon for each payment date for which a Registered Coupon becomes due, as set
forth in the Sale Certificate. Each such Refunding Bond or Registered Coupon shall be
registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. Except as hereinafter
provided, all of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons shall continue to be registered in
the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor. To the extent typewritten
Refunding Bonds, rather than printed Refunding Bonds, are to be issued, such modifications to
the form of the Refunding Bond as may be necessary or desirable in such case are hereby
authorized and approved. There shall be no substantive change to the terms and conditions set
forth in the form of Refunding Bond, except as otherwise authorized by the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution.
The District, the Trustee, the Bond Registrar and the Paying Agent shall have no
responsibility or obligation with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Securities
Depository or a nominee therefor or any Participant with respect to any ownership interest in the
Refunding Bonds or the Registered Coupons or the delivery to any Participant, Beneficial Owner
or any other person (except the registered owner in whose name any Refunding Bonds are
registered) of any notice with respect to the Refunding Bonds, including any notice of
redemption.
The District may remove the Securities Depository and the Securities Depository
may resign by giving sixty (60) days’ written notice to the other of such removal or resignation.
Additionally, the Securities Depository shall be removed sixty (60) days after receipt by the
District of written notice from the Securities Depository to the effect that the Securities
Depository has received written notice from Participants having interests, as shown in the
records of the Securities Depository, in an aggregate principal amount of not less than 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Refunding Bonds to the effect that the
Securities Depository is unable or unwilling to discharge its responsibilities or a continuation of
the requirement that all of the outstanding Refunding Bonds be registered in the name of the
Securities Depository or a nominee therefor is not in the best interests of the Beneficial Owners.
Upon the removal or resignation of the Securities Depository, the Securities Depository shall
take such action as may be necessary to assure the orderly transfer of the computerized bookentry system with respect to the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons to a successor
securities depository or if no successor securities depository is appointed as herein provided, the
transfer of the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons in certificate form to the Beneficial
Owners or their designees. Upon the giving of notice by the District of the removal of the
Securities Depository, the giving of notice by the Securities Depository of its resignation or the

receipt by the District of notice with respect to the written notice of Participants referred to
herein, the District may, within sixty (60) days after the giving of such notice, appoint a
successor securities depository upon such terms and conditions as the District shall impose. Any
such successor securities depository shall at all times be a registered clearing agency under the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or other applicable statute or regulation, and
in good standing thereunder. If the District fails to appoint a successor securities depository
within such time period, the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons shall no longer be
restricted to being registered in the name of the Securities Depository or a nominee therefor, but
may be registered in whatever name or names registered owners transferring or exchanging
Refunding Bonds or Registered Coupons shall designate.
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution
to the contrary, so long as any Refunding Bond is registered in the name of Cede & Co., as
nominee for the Securities Depository, all payments with respect to principal of, interest on and
any premium due in connection with the redemption of such Refunding Bond and all notices
with respect to such Refunding Bond shall be made and given, respectively, in the manner
provided in the Letter of Representations.
11.
The creation, perfection, enforcement, and priority of the pledge of
revenues to secure or pay the Refunding Bonds and the Registered Coupons as provided herein
shall be governed by Section 11-57-208 of the Supplemental Act and the Sales Tax Revenue
Bond Resolution. The revenues pledged for the payment of the Refunding Bonds and the
Registered Coupons, as received by or otherwise credited to the District, shall immediately be
subject to the lien of such pledge without any physical delivery, filing, or further act. The lien of
such pledge on the revenues pledged for payment of the Refunding Bonds and the Registered
Coupons and the obligation to perform the contractual provisions made herein and in the Sales
Tax Revenue Bond Resolution shall have priority over any or all other obligations and liabilities
of the District, except for the Senior Bonds, which shall have a lien on such revenues on a parity
with the Refunding Bonds and Registered Coupons, and except as otherwise provided herein.
The lien of such pledge shall be valid, binding, and enforceable as against all persons having
claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the District irrespective of whether such
persons have notice of such liens.
203. Requirements of a Surety Bond or Reserve Fund Insurance Policy. If it is
determined pursuant to Section 201 hereof that a surety bond or reserve fund insurance policy will
be deposited in the Reserve Fund for all or any portion of the Reserve Fund Requirement relating to
the Bonds and the Prior Parity Bonds, the General Manager or Chief Financial Officer may
independently determine the terms of any agreement with the provider of such surety bond or
reserve fund insurance policy as necessary to satisfy such provider’s commitment requirements
to issue its surety bond or policy.

As provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, the bonds are direct and

and redemption price thereof, and interest thereon, in accordance with their terms and the
provisions of the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution solely by (i) the Pledged Income (which,

the written consent of the holders of at least two-thirds in principal amount of the bonds then
outstanding under the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, and, in case less than all of the series
of bonds would be affected thereby, with such consent of at least two-thirds in principal amount
of the bonds of each series so affected then outstanding under the Sales Tax Revenue Bond
Resolution, and, in case such modification or amendment would change the terms of any sinking
fund installment, with such consent of at least two-thirds in principal amount of the bonds of the
particular series and maturity entitled to such sinking fund installment then outstanding;
provided, however, that, if such modification or amendment will, by its terms, not take effect so
long as any bonds of any specified like series and maturity remain outstanding under the Sales
Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, the consent of the holders of such bonds shall not be required
and such bonds shall not be deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of the calculation of
outstanding bonds. No such modification or amendment shall permit a change in the terms of
redemption or maturity of the principal of any outstanding bond or of any installment of interest
thereon or a reduction in the principal amount or redemption price thereof or in the rate of
interest thereon without the consent of the holder of such bond, or shall reduce the percentages or
otherwise affect the classes of bonds the consent of the holders of which is required to effect any
such modification or amendment, or shall change or modify any of the rights or obligations of
the Trustee or of any Paying Agent without its written assent thereto. The Registered Owner of
this bond irrevocably waives the right to exchange this bond for a coupon bond or bonds.
The bonds are issuable in the form of fully registered bonds without coupons in
denominations of $5,000 or any integral multiples of $5,000. This bond is transferable as
provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, only upon the books of the District kept for
that purpose at the above-mentioned office of the Trustee, by the Registered Owner hereof in
person, or by his duly authorized attorney, upon surrender of this bond together with a written
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by the Registered Owner or his
duly authorized attorney, and thereupon a new registered bond or bonds, and in the same
aggregate principal amount bearing the same interest rate, shall be issued to the transferee in
exchange therefor as provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution, and upon payment of
the charges therein prescribed. The Registered Owner of any bond or bonds may surrender the
same (together with a written instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee duly executed by
the Registered Owner or his or her duly authorized attorney), at the above-mentioned office of
the Trustee, in exchange for an equal aggregate principal amount of registered bonds bearing the
same interest rate, of any of the authorized denominations, in the manner, subject to the
conditions and upon the payment of the charges provided in the Sales Tax Revenue Bond
Resolution. The District, the Trustee and any Paying Agent may deem and treat the person in

payment of, or on account of, the principal or redemption price hereof and interest due hereon
and for all other purposes.
The bonds of the issue of which this bond is one are payable upon redemption at
the above-mentioned office of the Paying Agent. The Trustee shall mail, by registered or first
class, postage prepaid mail, a copy of any notice of redemption, postage prepaid, not less than
25 days before the redemption date, to the Registered Owners of any bonds or portions of bonds
which are to be redeemed, at their last addresses, appearing upon the registry books, but failure
to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other
bonds. If notice of redemption shall have been mailed as aforesaid, the bonds or portions thereof

if, on the redemption date, moneys for the redemption of all the bonds and portions thereof to be
redeemed, together with interest to the redemption date, shall be available for such payment on
said date, then from and after the redemption date interest on such bonds or portions thereof so
called for redemption shall cease to accrue and be payable.
The principal, premium, if any, and interest on this bond and the issue of which
this bond is one are payable solely from the Pledged Income and other amounts pledged therefor
under the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution and neither this bond nor the issue of which it is
part shall in any way create or constitute an indebtedness, liability or obligation of the State of
Colorado or any political subdivision thereof except the District and no property of the District,
except the Pledged Income and other funds of the District provided therefor in the Sales Tax
Revenue Bond Resolution, shall be liable to be forfeited or taken in payment of this bond or the
issue of which this bond is one.
It is hereby certified and recited that all conditions, acts and things required by
law and the Sales Tax Revenue Bond Resolution to exist, to have happened and to have been
performed precedent to and in the issuance of this bond, exist, have happened and have been
performed and that the issue of bonds of which this is one, together with all other indebtedness of
the District, complies in all respects with the applicable laws of the State of Colorado, including,
particularly, the Act and the Supplemental Act (hereafter defined). This bond and the issue of
which this bond is one is issued under authority of the Act and, as provided in Section 32-9-135
of the Act, this recital shall conclusively impart full compliance with all the provisions of the
Act, and this bond and the issue of which this bond is one shall be incontestable for any cause
whatsoever after their delivery for value. This bond and the issue of which this bond is one is
also issued pursuant to Title 11, Article 57, Part 2, C.R.S. (the “Supplemental Act”), and

of the validity and the regularity of the issuance of this bond and the issue of which this bond is
one after their delivery for value.
The Act provides that neither the members of the Board of Directors of the
District nor any person executing the securities of the District shall be liable personally on such
securities by reason of the issuance thereof.

Resolution or be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until this bond shall have been

hereon.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 7, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

February 7, 2013

Board Meeting Date: February 12, 2013

Subject:

Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the
issuance of RTD Sales Tax Revenue Refunding
Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2013A

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional
Transportation District Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series
2013A.
BACKGROUND:
On January 22, 2013, staff presented the refinancing of three RTD debt issues at lower than current
interest rates to reduce payments, improve cash flow, and provide additional capacity under TABOR as a
Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) item and proposed to use the financing capacity generated by the
refundings as a step toward accelerating construction of the North Metro Rail Line from Denver Union
Station to 72nd Avenue.
This action item discusses the second of the three bond refunding opportunities that were included in
the RAM item proposed on January 22, 2013.
DISSCUSSION:
RTD issued its $600 million Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) Series 2006A (the “2006
Bonds”) in October 2006 for the purpose of financing a portion of the costs of the FasTracks projects. In
2007, interest rates were such that the District refunded $363.725 million of the 2006 Bonds to
capture $11.373 million in present value savings (3.122% of principal of refunded bonds). At present,
$235.735 million par amount of the 2006 Bonds remain outstanding.
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund the remaining
outstanding 2006 Bonds on a non-callable basis to realize, subject to market movement, a savings of
approximately $63.8 million (9.03% of principal of refunded bonds). The Bond Resolution requires a
minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between
now and the date the bonds are sold. The 2006 Bonds are callable November 1, 2016 at par. Pursuant
to U.S. Treasury regulations, an issue of tax-exempt bonds may (a) be advance refunded (refunding
bonds sold more than 90 days in advance of the redemption date of the outstanding bonds)) once, and
(b) current refunded (refunding bonds sold within 90 days of redemption date of outstanding bonds)
without limit.
While the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that, such savings are net of
a cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the refunding bonds at a return equal to the
interest rate on the new bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the refunding bonds and
optional redemption date of the 2006 Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”). Absent a change in interest rates,

1.B.3

the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a reduction in time proceeds of the
refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the 2006 Bonds. Despite the cost associated with
the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings from a refunding of the 2006 Bonds exceeds the typical
threshold for a refunding by RTD. Consequently, staff has assembled a financing team and commenced
documentation to be in a position to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD to reduce its interest
expense.
The Chief Financial Officer has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the
bonds, including assembling financial information related to the District and drafting a preliminary official
statement, bond indenture, continuing disclosure agreement, bond purchase agreement and the
Resolution for issuance of the Bonds. The Board is being requested, through the Resolution to authorize
the issuance, to establish the terms and to approve agreements required in connection with the issuance
of the Bonds.
Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution including the Bond Indenture, the Continuing
Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are
available for review in the Board Office.
RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and Sherman
& Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten by a team
including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, George K. Baum and Loop Capital.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
Costs associated with the refunding bonds are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
Bond proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of 2013,
authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2013, authorizing the issuance of the District’s Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds
(FasTracks Project), Series 2013A. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Fourth Quarter 2012 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2012 attached.
The U.S. economy contracted modestly (0.1 percent) during the fourth quarter of 2012. The
unemployment rate declined modestly over the period but still remains elevated and general inflationary
pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
fourth quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses and
train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. Phase One was recently introduced in January
2013, and concentrates on gathering usage data from ECO, Neighborhood, and College pass
programs.
The system has been built by ACS Transport Solutions, a subsidiary of Xerox. Various testing
and pilot programs were performed by RTD personnel before the system was approved for use.
AUDIT SCOPE

Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle audit approach, our examination has included a
review of the development procedures used to build the system, and testing to ensure the
system would function as desired.

CONCLUSION

Significant challenges were incurred in the installation of Smart Card readers on both RTD
buses and light rail platforms. Project Management worked diligently to ensure readers were
installed and functioning in time for the Phase One roll-out.
Meetings to identify operating risks and offsetting controls have been held in an effort to
minimize the possibility of unforeseen negative situations occurring in the live environment.
These efforts and meetings will continue with an emphasis on ‘what could go wrong’ when the
stored-value capability is rolled out in the 3rd quarter of 2013.
CURRENT STATUS

Internal Audit will continue to be involved with this project and will ensure that mutually agreed
upon corrective action is taken, as needed.

SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
2nd INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 12-12-01

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
HUMAN RESOURCES
PERSONNEL FILE DOCUMENTATION
12-11-01

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

RTD has over 2000 salaried and represented employees. The personnel department maintains
employment information on all these individuals. The District is subject to numerous laws and
regulations regarding fair employment practices. These include all areas of employment such
as hiring, management, discipline and termination. Maintenance of current and accurate
information on all employees is very important and failure, in some cases, could result in
disciplinary action being taken against the RTD.
AUDIT SCOPE

This audit evaluated the documentation of personnel files to ensure that they were complete,
current and accurate. This audit concentrated on general controls over personnel file
documentation. A sample of employee files was reviewed for general documentation controls.

CONCLUSIONS

In general, overall file maintenance was adequate. The majority of files reviewed had all
necessary and required documentations. Files were neat and well organized. Internal Audit
recommended some modifications in procedures that should be instituted to ensure files were
updated and any missing documents were obtained in a timely manner.
CURRENT STATUS

Issues have been addressed by the Human Resources department and we will follow up as a
part of our normal procedures.

1.C.4.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

RTD policy provides for the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred by its employees.
These include all standard business related expenses. These expenses are subject to
significant regulatory controls by the Federal Transit Administration as well as the Internal
Revenue Service. Our records indicated these expenses had not been reviewed internally
since the State of Colorado had performed an audit in 2009.
AUDIT SCOPE

This audit was selected by Internal Audit. We selected a representative sample of all expenses
incurred in 2012 through December 15th. We reviewed the controls around employee expense
reports and noted if they were in compliance with the applicable Management Directive(s) and,
if applicable, FTA regulations.

CONCLUSIONS

While there were occasional documentation issues, we generally found the employees to be
compliant with the RTD’s policies on expense reimbursement. The Board of Directors has
developed its own policies and we found the members to also be in compliance with those
polices. We recommended one addition which will further strengthen controls and management
is current revising the policy statements.
CURRENT STATUS

We will review the policy revision when it is completed. We consider this audit closed.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
EMPLOYEE TRAVEL AND BUSINESS EXPENSES
AUDIT REPORT 12-12-02

1.C.4.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

RTD offers two distinctly different programs which provide discounted bus and light rail tickets or
passes, and are packaged for delivery to the purchaser:


Over 200 approved Non-Profit organizations purchase discounted ticket supplies for their
clients.



Approximately 90 companies purchase discounted bus and light rail FlexPasses for their
employees on a monthly basis through 360 Media, a third party administrator.

Moving forward, the current plan is to utilize the new Smart Card technology for both Non-Profit
organizations, and companies who order monthly FlexPasses. This enhancement is expected to
be available in late 2013, although the exact processes have not yet been finalized.
AUDIT SCOPE

We reviewed the controls over Pass and Ticket ordering, fulfillment, and customer payment for
both Non-Profits and corporations that RTD contracts with. For corporate passes, we
concentrated on controls surrounding processes for orders that are received via the 360 Media
Company, as they handle all but a small number of current purchases.
CONCLUSION

Based on the results of our testing, the fulfillment processes for Non-Profit tickets, and corporate
FlexPasses, appear accurate. However, the monthly corporate FlexPass process also appears
to be somewhat labor intensive. We understand that the implementation of the Smart Card
system in late 2013 should make the FlexPass fulfillment process more efficient, without
reducing the adequacy of controls.
CURRENT STATUS

We will monitor progress as the Smart Card technology is utilized to reduce the current level of
manual effort and provides a more efficient method of order fulfillment.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2012 TOKEN AND PASS ISSUANCE CONTROLS
AUDIT REPORT # 12-12-03

1.C.4.a

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
The RTD Management Directive for “Accountability for RTD Equipment” requires that “The
responsible department will do a physical inventory of attractive equipment (exception IT
computer equipment) to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the Districts’ records at least
once a year or any time key personnel are reassigned or leave RTD. The IT division will be
responsible for a yearly physical inventory of computer equipment and related items.” RTD
Attractive Equipment is defined as “…. tangible, nonexpendable, non-capitalized equipment that
is considered relatively portable and easily converted to personal use or benefit that had an
original purchase price over $500 …”
AUDIT SCOPE
Our review compared the physical existence of “attractive items” within the Communications
Department to listings maintained in our work paper files, and updated on an annual basis. We
did not examine ‘IT Computer Equipment’ as these lists are tested annually by the IT Division.

CONCLUSION
We noted several listed ‘attractive assets’ which appear quite old and may be obsolete
equipment. Per management, some of these items are no longer used in the day-to-day
operations of RTD. We have suggested that such listed items be identified and disposed of, as
feasible.

CURRENT STATUS

Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2012 ATTRACTIVE ITEMS INVENTORY
AUDIT REPORT # 12-12-04

1.C.4.a

BACKGROUND

This audit was selected by Internal Audit. RTD has numerous projects being performed by
external individuals as a result of contracting specific services. These include IT experts,
individuals in the Small Business areas, as well as contractors associated with the numerous
construction projects associated with FasTracks. These individuals are reporting to various RTD
personnel throughout the District. As RTD continues the FasTracks construction, the number of
contracted or consulting individuals will increase.

AUDIT SCOPE

We reviewed the procedures and records for maintaining lists of contractor personnel who were
currently authorized to have access to RTD locations. We reviewed the procedures for
electronically identifying and controlling the actual access to RTD facilities. We also
endeavored to obtain or develop a current listing of all appropriate individuals.

CONCLUSIONS

Our inquiries identified several areas within the District which were primarily associated with
utilizing or identifying contract or consulting employees.
These included Information
Technology, Human Resources, Safety and Security, and the FasTracks construction
operations. While many areas maintain lists of the individuals associated with specific projects,
all actual physical access is controlled by the Transit Security Area. We did recommend the
access system be reviewed to identify additional system features to further strengthen access
controls.

CURRENT STATUS

System enhancements are being reviewed. We will follow up in the first quarter of 2013.

(4) The variance is primarily due to transit improvements not yet being incurred as well as funds budgeted for the Southeast extension and US36 projects not yet incurred
(5) The variance is primarily due to the timing of projects associated with facilities engineering
(6) The variance consists of lower data processing services, computer hardware purchases, recruitment, training, medical exams and the timing of fare media purchases
(7) The variance is due to lower costs for route promotions, SmartCard, general ridership campaign and graphics
(8) The variance is primarily due to the timing of WIN program expenses
