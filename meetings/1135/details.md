#### 1. Proposed 2013 and 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors accept the modifications to the 2013 Fiscal Policy Statement as well as accept these modifications for 2014.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter explained that the proposed modifications to the fiscal policy are brought to the Board throughout the year.  In addition each year staff presents the proposed policy statement for review by the Board.  Terry also explained that staff uses this as the first step in developing our Strategic Budget Plan.  He said at this point staff has brought forward minor modifications that are highlighted in red on the document that was provided to the Board.

Director Sisk asked for an explanation as to the basis for reducing the fund balance from 3 months to 2 months on the fund balance policies.  Terry Howerter stated that this will be for the FasTracks fund balance only.  He explained that we wanted to take the additional month and move those funds into our savings account for future projects on the FasTracks side.

Director Bagley added that the reason it was changed from 3 months to 2 is that staff and the Board felt there was adequate fund balance for 2 months due to our progress on the Eagle P3 project and the I-225 line.  Terry Howerter said that was correct.  He also said that the new services and infrastructure we have in place further supports the reduction.

General Manager Washington stated that this item was part of a larger item, the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM) and the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) was brought to the Board in December of 2012 and the Board approved the action.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. FINAL 2014 Fiscal Policy Statement

#### 2. 2013-2 : Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the issuance of RTD Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2013A.

Motion:              Director James made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter said that as the Board may recall, staff presented refinancing of three RTD debt issues in order to lower interest rates and reduce payments to provide additional debt capacity under TABOR.  He indicated that Dee Wisor from Sherman & Howard L.L.C., our Bond Counsel, and the team from First Southwest Company, our independent financial advisors, are present to answer any questions.

Brenden Morgan stated that this is the first of three refinancing opportunities that will be presented to the Board.  These refinancing opportunities include Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2004A and 2005A.  The Sales Tax Revenue Bonds from 2004 have $5.750 million outstanding and 2005 have $98.865 outstanding.  Brenden explained that the refinancing would result in a savings of approximately $24.2 million or 3.06% of the principal of refunded bonds.  He explained that the Bond Resolution requires a minimum savings of 2% which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in interest rates between now and the date the bonds are sold.

Brenden highlighted three key items that were important to note: (1) this transaction will reduce interest expense to RTD over the life of these Bonds; (2) this transaction will not extend the maturity of these bonds; (3) this transaction will reduce the outstanding debt.

Brenden Morgan explained that the debt will be reduced by a function of a common debt service reserve that the 2004 and 2005 Bonds share.  This reserve is approximately $17 million.   He stated that when we issued Bonds in 2012 we did so successfully and proved that we no longer need a debt service reserve for these Revenue Bonds.  The $17 million will be used to pay down the current outstanding debt.

Brenden Morgan stated that Terry Howerter has taken the preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the refunding bonds by preparing documents that are available for review in the Board Office in substantially final form.

Brenden shared that RTD has been receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, and Sherman & Howard L.L.C., as Bond Council.  The Bonds will be underwritten by a team including Goldman Sachs, Loop Capital, Piper Jaffray and Wells Fargo.

Director Lubow noted that one of the underwriters was Goldman Sachs and she knows that they were under Federal investigation.  She asked what due diligence is completed when we are dealing with investment companies.  Marla Lien stated that in terms of financial due diligence a company being under investigation would not necessarily effect the due diligence.  She explained that in terms of legal due diligence, on any federal project we have to look to see if someone is debarred or suspended and Goldman Sachs is not.  Marla Lien explained that the Board has never adopted any policy that says an accused company not found guilty should be precluded from doing business with RTD.  An entity as large and diverse as Goldman Sachs the Board certainly never said that allegations made against one arm of the company would preclude us from doing business with another.   She said that the Board would need to approve a policy not required by state or federal law stating that if charges are brought against an entity that would prevent them from doing business with RTD.

Terry Howerter stated that Goldman Sachs is part of the underwriting pool.  He said that they have been involved with several of our deals in the past and are a great asset when it comes to working through our Preliminary Official Statement (POS) and our offering documents.  He believes that Goldman Sachs is very knowledgeable of RTD as well as bringing together this kind of an underwriting deal.

Director Lubow stated that she understands Goldman Sachs was accused and not convicted but she believes it is important to keep this in mind maybe not in an official capacity but in our common sense due diligence.

Director Sisk expressed that initially he would say he totally supports this action but he wanted Dee Wisor from Sherman & Howard L.L.C. to explain the Negative Arbitrage and how it is calculated.  He also asked for the amount of the Negative Arbitrage.  Dee Wisor explained that the Negative Arbitrage is really the fact that this is an advance refunding; that means that we will be issuing these refunding bonds before the redemption date of the refunded bonds.  The refunding bond proceeds will be invested in an escrow account of federal securities until the redemption date.  The investment rates today are lower than the bond rates so there is a negative spread until the redemption date.  Brenden Morgan said the amount will be approximately $3.6 million.  He stated that the savings outlined in the Board Report is the net amount.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. 17th Supplemental Resolution (2006A)- 2013

#### 3. 2013-3 : Resolution No.__, Series of 2013 related to the issuance of RTD Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2013A

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District Tax-Exempt Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2013A.

Motion:              Director James made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 19th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Hoy seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter explained that this is another RTD debt issue to be refinanced. This item was presented to the Board on January 22, 2013.  He stated that this refinancing is going to be very beneficial in reducing the interest rates and that will free up TABOR capacity.

Brenden Morgan stated that this is a very similar transaction to the previous Recommended Action.  He explained that Terry Howerter has taken preliminary actions to arrange for the issuance and sale of the bonds.  Drafts of documents referenced in the Bond Resolution are available for review in the Board Office.

Brenden Morgan shared that RTD has been receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, and Sherman & Howard L.L.C., as Bond Council.  The Bonds will be underwritten by a team including Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, George K. Baum and Loop Capital.

There were no questions on this item.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. RTD Resolution - 2013A FasTrack Refunding Bonds

#### 1. General Manager Contract Review Summary –No Backup

Terry Howerter informed the Board that this is the third and final review of the contract that was put in place for the years 2010, 2011 and 2011.  He introduced Cheryl Wallace and Kathy Maher from RubinBrown.  RubinBrown was hired to conduct an Independent Accountant’s Report on the Cost of the General Manager’s Contract that was reviewed with the Board.  They passed out a report on this review.

Director Menten requested that in the future all reports and information be provided to the Board prior to the meeting.  Terry Howerter explained that it has always been the practice to have the documents presented at the meeting and delivered by the auditors when they presented their report.  He stated that staff could have them included in the Board packet as long as staff had audit sign off, etc.

Director Solano concurred with Director Menten that it would be helpful to have this information in advance.  He asked how the General Manager’s contract compares to other General Managers in major metropolitan areas.  Director Solano requested copies of any analysis that was done to arrive at the contract figures.  Terry Howerter explained that we have attempted to do those comparisons in the past but it is difficult to do due to size of the organizations and other responsibilities.

Director Bagley thanked RubinBrown for their audit.  He believes it demonstrates what the Board thought the maximum amounts to be paid were.  It was determined by the Board and through negotiations and discussions with the General Manager that the 5% salary increases were not going to be made; that is why there is a significant difference in the maximum versus paid compensation.

Director Bagley explained that in late 2009 into 2010 there was a significant benchmarking analysis completed by the Board office with the assistance of the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) figures throughout the nation.  He stated that we looked at approximately 25 to 30 different agencies and we tried to calculate what would be the most appropriate benchmarking agencies; there were 6 to 8 that we utilized to benchmark against.  Director Bagley said that based on the work we did our compensation figures were mid range.  Director Bagley also pointed out that RTD is very different from the other agencies we compared to because of the significant capital programs we are undergoing.  He believes that in moving forward the salaries for 2013, 2014 and 2015 are relatively similar to the past years.

Director Malpiede thanked Director Bagley for the overview.  She expressed that she was happy Director Solano would be part of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee.  She stated that the Committee will be discussing the process in the upcoming meetings.

#### 2. Bus, Ticket Vending Machine, and Other 2013 Financing Update - No Backup

Terry Howerter explained that staff just wanted to prepare the Board for what to expect for the current year plans.

Brenden Morgan stated that this evening the Board was presented with two of the three Bond Refunding opportunities that were discussed in the Risk Allocation Matrix item presented on January 22, 2013.  He said that over the next 6-9 months, staff intends to make proposals for the following financing transactions which are anticipated in the Strategic Budget Plan:

In March the Board will be presented with the third Bond Refunding opportunity, 2005A FasTracks COP refunding which will result in a savings of approximately $5.2 million.  Staff will also bring forward a recommendation on Bus and Ticket Vending Machine financing using possibly Certificates of Participation or a Capital Lease.

In Quarter 3 staff will present a short term bridge financing in anticipation of federal funds for approximately $280 million.

In the 4th Quarter provided that interest rates remain stable staff will bring forward new FasTracks revenue bonds for the North Metro Rail Line of approximately $100 million.

Terry Howerter added that all of these items are included in our financial plans for the FasTracks and Base systems.  The bus refinancing was discussed at the last FA&A meeting.  He explained that we have an aging bus fleet; based on the guidance for replacement of the fleet we will be looking at replacement of 40 vehicles, articulated busses, MCI Open Road Coaches and our Mall shuttles.  He stated that these vehicles have reached the end of their useful life based on FTA guidelines and our policies.

Director Sisk asked for further information on the Ticket Vending Machines (TVMs).  Terry Howerter stated that the TVMs are being replaced on the Southwest corridor.  He explained that the TVMs on this corridor have far exceeded their useful life; these machines do not process debit or credit cards, have old software, and are not networked into our system.  Terry Howerter said on the Southeast line the machines will be upgraded to allow payment with a debit or credit card.  This is timed to come into service when RTD activates the West Line so that all of our TVMs are compliant and have the same look and feel for our customers.

#### 3. Fourth Quarter 2012 Investment Report

Terry Howerter stated that staff would take questions.  He said there is not much to add as this is a pretty standard report.

There were no questions on this item.

##### a. ROI 2011 2012

##### b. QT DEC 2012

##### c. ROI DEC 2012

#### 4. Fourth Quarter 2012 Internal Audit Report

Bill Holmes, Manager of Internal Audit, thanked the Board for allowing him to answer any questions they might have.

Director Lubow noted that the problems experienced in Boulder with the new Smart Card launch were not addressed in the audit.  She asked if the audit looked at those issues.  Kevin Parker explained that the audit is a multi-phased audit.  The audit looks at the design requirements, the software development, and the actual installation of the Smart Card system.  Kevin Parker said that Bruce Abel could provide further information about the issues Director Lubow was referencing in Boulder.

General Manager Washington said that the Operations and Customer Service Committee would discuss some of the challenges that we experienced with the Smart Card roll-out.  He said the scope of the audit did not include the operational issues that will be covered by the operations staff.

Director Lasater noted that some of the exceptions still open date back quite a while.  He asked why these exceptions were still open.  Bill Holmes explained that most of these exceptions are primarily related to our new R12 Oracle system update.  These exceptions will be resolved when the system comes up this month.  He stated that he and Kevin Parker would follow-up to make sure the issues have been addressed; if not they will conduct another audit.  Scott Reed said that it is also important to look at what is past due.  It is possible to have exceptions that are still open but are on schedule.  There is really only an issue if something is listed as past due.  Bill Holmes shared that the Internal Audit department works very closely with management on their resolutions to any items.

Director Hoy asked if we audit Capital Equipment that may have been retired but not sold and still has a value.  Bill Holmes said that a Field Asset Audit was conducted in 2010 or 2011.  At that time they evaluated our Capital Equipment and our procedures for handling that equipment.  He said this is part of what the Internal Audit department does on a periodic basis but not every year.

Director Menten noted that under the Employee Expenses Audit there was a recommendation to close a problem area.  She asked what the recommendation was.  Bill Holmes stated that the recommendation dealt with the expense policy of RTD.  He explained that during their review they noticed an instance of an expense being incurred when several staff members were present.  This expense was not paid by the most senior staff member, which is typically a standard practice.  Our policy did not address this so it was updated.

Director Menten asked what compensation 360 Media receives for being the middle man with regards to our corporate passes.  Kevin Parker said that he did not have that information immediately available but staff could get it from the signed contract.  He explained that this relationship helps us reduce the staffing the RTD needs.

##### a. FINAL Status Report for FAAC 12-12 (4th Quarter) Revised

#### 5. December 2012 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod reviewed the report that was included in the Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet for February 12, 2013.

Director Lasater noted that he finds it odd that we are 131% upside down in advertising revenue.  He believes that December is traditionally a high advertising month.  Director Lasater also asked for the overall net result of the contract.  Doug MacLeod explained that we renegotiated our advertising contract at the end of 2012 because the Light Rail advertising activity was not as significant as the original contract called for.  Scott Reed explained that RTD did not lose money on the contract.  The advertising contract did bring in several million dollars of revenue.  He said that he did not know the exact number but could get that for the Board.  Scott Reed stated that the amount of display time was diluted due to the number of Light Rail vehicles in service and the reserved fleet in anticipation of the opening of the West Line.

Director Solano noted that there is baseline budgeting and zero based budgeting that can lead to significantly different budgets.  He asked if we had looked into zero based budgeting to see if there was a benefit.  Jannette Scarpino stated that currently RTD budgets on an incremental basis.  She said that RTD has used zero based budgeting in the past when the agency was smaller and less complex.  Jannette Scarpino explained that the downside with zero based budgeting is that it is very time intensive; it consumes a great deal of resources which the agency does not have.  Jannette Scarpino said that if she was to improve our budgeting methodology she would move to more of a priority based budgeting.  She said that she would be able to discuss further our budgeting and other budgeting methodologies offline.

Director Sisk asked if the Sales and Use Tax figures are subject to an audit by the State of RTD.  Doug MacLeod explained that on a regular basis the Department of Revenue has an audit function.  He stated that from our perspective as the customer our auditors test on a receipts basis but we do not get very much information from the Department of Revenue.  He said that is one of the initiatives that staff is working on.

Director Sisk noted that if the Department of Revenue numbers are incorrect we are basing our assumptions on figures that may be erroneous.  He said that from personal experience in Boulder, they did find the Department of Revenue numbers to be askew so he believes there needs to be a checks and balances process in place.  General Manager Washington stated that staff fully agrees, which is why they included the reconciliation item in the Risk Allocation Matrix.  He said initially staff thought it would take some legislative action to get this reconciliation but it now appears that it will not be necessary.  This is something that staff is actively working on with the Department of Revenue.
