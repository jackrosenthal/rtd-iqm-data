Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
A.

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of
2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of
1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the
Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget
for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense,
2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System
only are detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the BoardAppropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.

5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is
projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting
the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated
investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project
only are detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.
This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in
error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these
funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use
of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0
million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.
