Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
A.

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of
2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of
1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the
Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget
for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense,
2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System
only are detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the BoardAppropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.

5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is
projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting
the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated
investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project
only are detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.
This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in
error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these
funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use
of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0
million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

Others Present:

2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) and Financial Plan
Heather Copp, CFO and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration,
indicated that she and Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, would
answer any Board questions after reviewing the Power Point Presentation that was
included in the July 26, 2016 Study Session Agenda Packet.
Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance and ECM, stated that Revenue and Cost
Assumptions will cover both Base and FasTracks systems. She explained that the Base
system figures come out of RTD’s Strategic Budget Plan (SBP). Passenger fare revenue
for the base system is estimated to increase every three years based on a cumulative
three-year rate of inflation, and Sales and Use taxes are forecasted from CU Leeds School
of Business. The FasTracks system will have a 10% fare increase in 2019 and 2022;
after 2025 fare increases will occur every three years based on the cumulative three-year
rate of inflation. She also stated that staff does not expect to have any discretionary
grants past the year 2022.
Susan Cohen explained that as of now, staff is anticipating and assuming that there will
be close-up costs associated with the projects that opened or will open this year, such as
the Flat Iron Flyer (FF), University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line. She
stated that RTD must operate and maintain our completed projects; however, compared to
last year’s Annual Performance Evaluation (APE), RTD’s revenue forecasts are down. Staff
does not anticipate hitting the cumulative revenue forecasts until 2034. As mentioned
previously, staff is assessing how to balance the APE and the SBP. She noted that the
FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) is going to be depleted for operating costs, not
capital costs as originally intended.
Director Lubow asked how much of the Base revenue is used to balance the FasTracks
budget. Susan Cohen noted that staff will have an exact amount available at the Financial
Administration and Audit Committee Meeting on August 9, 2016. Heather Copp remarked
that the specific dollar amount is quite large.
Director Lubow wondered what led to the misunderstanding that resulted in the
expectation that FasTracks funding could cover operations and maintenance. Heather
Copp remarked that it depended on one’s perspective. She noted it has been known for
quite a while that Base system funds would be needed to support FasTracks operating

Director Folska commented that what Heather explained sounded clear, but her
understanding of the information is still foggy. She asked since the CU Leeds forecast
was off so much this year, how does the Board or staff know that the forecasts for years
ahead are correct. She added that the Board needs better clarity to understand how the
agency got to this position. She further commented that her understanding was that the
Base system and FasTracks system were two separate financial pots and they were not
supposed to meet.
Director Solano asked how staff is planning to replenish the FISA given that the FasTracks
funds are depleted and FasTracks is not complete. Heather Copp remarked that RTD has
no ability or intent to replace the FISA as those funds are needed to pay for operating and
maintenance costs.
Director Anderson commented that in 2012 the Board made conscientious decisions about
RTD’s future. She noted RTD would not be opening 5 lines this year without the
unsolicited proposals that had been received. She stated that the Board used those funds
then to make sure that RTD was building as much of FasTracks as possible. The Board
was under a lot of pressure to finish FasTracks so RTD built as much as it could as fast as
it could.
Director Hoy added that there was a recommended action for FISA a few years ago but
the intent of FISA was to get something built, not to operate the system.
Director Francone thanked staff for the Board Budget Workshop and noted that it was
extremely helpful. She added that when she was attending the B Line grand opening
festivities she was approached by a Westminster City Council member and he was very
negative with his evaluation of the FasTracks program. She said it was his opinion that
FasTracks cannot be maintained but staff has demonstrated through the APE that
operations and maintenance are a priority.
Director Walker noted that he remembered the conversations that Director Anderson
brought up and he remembered that the B Line could have gone up to 104th, but that is all
that would have happened. He stated that the Board made a conscious decision to build
the various lines, knowing that it would take money to operate them. He added that using
other accounts to build it outweighed the risks of not building it. The current price of Real
Estate is expensive, but acquiring property, along with expensive material costs are
difficult to lower without an economic downturn, which no one at RTD wants to happen.

costs. She added that RTD is allowed to use Base dollars to support FasTracks, but staff
wanted to make sure this was made very clear to the Board.

6.A

Director Francone commented that her previous comment was not meant to be a criticism.
She stated that when Councilor Baker approached her she was happy to inform him that
RTD is taking steps to increase its operations and maintenance funds. She added that
people are beginning to take notice of that and she thanked staff for realizing and
implementing that need.
Chair Tobiassen added that he too had been approached by Councilor Baker and they
discussed transit costs. He added that since he is a member of the E470 Board he knows
the true costs of transportation. He commented that even driving on highways is not
really free.
Chair Tobiassen asked staff for the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR) cap amount for
FasTracks. Susan Cohen stated that the TABOR cap has three pieces to it: RTD can issue
a total of $3.477 billion in principal, RTD can incur total repayment over time of $7.129
billion and the maximum repayment of principal and interest is $309 million in any single
year. Chair Tobiassen inquired as to where RTD stands in that debt max. Heather Copp
explained that RTD is close to the principal amount.
Chair Tobiassen inquired about the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) commitments and
asked what they entail. Susan Cohen explained that there is a requirement for additional
parking for Eagle and the Southeast Rail Extension that RTD will need to build or provide.
Chair Tobiassen commented that staff used FasTracks funds to supplement Access-a-Ride
a few years ago and inquired as to those amounts. Susan Cohen stated that the Board
capped those amounts in 2013.

III.

Parking Management Briefing
General Manager Genova indicated that staff has a comprehensive report on parking this
evening. He asked that the Board refrain from asking any questions until the presentation
is completed. He stated that Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services,
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, and Errol Stevens, Manager of
Parking Management will be presenting this topic tonight along with himself.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 26, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk stated that he cannot let Director Francone’s comment go without retort. He
pointed out that the council member she referred to was Councilor Baker and he has never
supported FasTracks. He added that FasTracks was promised to the voters and RTD made
it happen. The B Line is a fabulous addition to the entire metropolitan area and he thought
Director Hoy and Chair Tobiassen did a fantastic job at the opening.

6.A

General Manager Genova noted that there were three parts to the parking briefing:
 Universal Pay for Parking modeled potential impacts if RTD patrons were changed
for parking each day
 Current Parking Management Program describes the current program and uses
results to predict impacts of daily paid for parking.
 Partnering Projects compares the differences and similarities of the first two
programs, where an outside partner manages the program.
He stated that the information presented tonight is for information only, as staff wanted to
discuss this item with the Board before a recommended action item was presented.
Brian Welch, Senior Manager of Planning Technical Services, reminded the Board that staff
briefed the Board in March on the scope of the parking management study. The scope
focused on a technical assessment and is summarized in the following phases:
 Phase 1: Summarization of the Existing RTD Parking System
 Phase 2: Peer Agency Review/Determination of Elasticity
 Phase 3: Estimation of Costs and Feasibility
 Phase 4: Demand Variables/Spill over Analysis
 Phase 5: Contract and Risk Assessment/Items for Additional Study
 Phase 6: Calculations of Adjusted Net Operating Incomes
He explained that the study only reviewed the managed facilities where there is a total of
18,691 existing spaces. The remaining facilities were deemed too small, too remote,
managed by others or RTD was prohibited from charging. In addition, staff included the
total future spaces of around 24,000 in the analysis. He noted that both Dallas Area
Rapid Transit (DART) and Utah Transit Authority (UTA), our peer agencies, strongly
advised staff to be consistent with parking. DART curtailed their pilot program at select
facilities after demand shifted to lots without parking charges. UTA terminated their pilot
program at select facilities due to poor performance.
Staff reviewed parking fees across the country and there is a wide range of fees. The
typical patron response to parking charges depends on free or paid parking at destination,
EcoPass, parking lot utilization rates and station accessibility. He noted that RTD would

General Manager Genova noted the discussion surrounding parking has been going on for
some time. He explained that the originally RTD could charge for parking but legislation in
2006 changed that. The State eventually relaxed in constraints its 2007 and amended
them in 2013, which lead to the parking management program RTD has today. He stated
that RTD’s limited authority allows for cars registered in district to park for free for the
first 24 hours, then $2.00 a day after that; out of district cars are charged $4.00 per day,
and reserved parking can only be 15% of the capacity of the parking facility.

6.A

Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking Management, explained that in 2008, the Board
approved a guideline for RTD’s parking management program. The program was
estimated to recover the cost of parking from those that use the parking. It also had no
general fund subsidy and was supposed to be financially sustaining. Higher fees were
adopted for Out-of-District patrons and demand at busy facilities was managed to shift use
to underutilized facilities. There is a 30-day maximum stay at each facility because
patrons were using them as storage for their vehicles.
Errol Stevens explained that staff developed a friendly patron flow of park-pay-board and a
variety of payment options to ease the process for RTD’s riders. Each facility has a smart
pay station that accepts credit cards and exact cash. There is a pay by phone option
where patrons can use an authorized expense account and also a web based automated
payment platform. He remarked that the legislature established penalties for non-payment:
first offense is a no cost warning, second offense is $20, third offense is $50 and fourth+
offenses are $100. He noted that the program revenue in 2015 was $1.25 million, which
covered operating costs and amortized equipment costs.
General Manager Genova indicated that the next section covers collaboration in parking.
He explained that differences in projects lead to unique considerations. He stated that
RTD must consider funding, ownership, federal interests, other parking demands and prior
agreements. He noted that RTD will continue to negotiate and recommend parking plans
appropriate for each individual location. Factors to consider when evaluating each plan
include capital contributions, federal funding, ownership of land, facility and spaces,
operations and maintenance responsibilities and funding. The parking facilities currently
outside the RTD parking management program are Boulder Junction, Westminster Station,
Olde Town Transit Hub, and Iliff Station.
General Manager Genova reminded the Board that the recommended action to include
parking facilities along the new corridors in the existing parking management program was
tabled to the August 9, 2016 Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting. He
hoped this presentation provided the Board with further information to consider the
recommended action.

most likely lose some riders while others found alternative transportation to the stations.
The three scenarios examined were: A – low rate with an initial annual revenue of $10
million per year, B – variable rate with an initial annual revenue of $11.9 million per year,
and C – high rate with an initial annual revenue of $14.6 million per year. He added the
consultant’s scenario numbers were similar to the numbers that RTD staff had estimated.
He said the overall conclusion of the consultant is that daily parking charges can be
feasibly implemented at RTD facilities, and multiple scenarios would be revenue positive.

6.A

Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation and indicated that he looks forward to
reading the parking report. He added that if RTD tries to change the legislation that
occurred in 2013 there could be problems. He noted that RTD made certain promises that
need to be kept. He also added that RTD should not turn over parking management to a
third party as that seems like a bait and switch.
Director Lubow asked if some of RTD’s parking lots are free. Errol Stevens indicated that
half are free and half are in the managed program.
General Manager Genova stated that under a universal program, everyone would be
charged every day for parking. He said that the revenue potential would expand in a huge
way.
Director Lubow inquired as to the benefits to RTD if under the current statues a third party
receives the revenue General Manager Genova indicated that if RTD partnered with a third
party, they would be responsible for the operations and maintenance costs of the facilities
and that financial burden would be removed from RTD.
Director Lubow noted that RTD will have to watch out for public backlash as people are
used to and feel entitled to free parking.
Director Anderson stated she is interested in the partnered projects. She commented that
each one of them is uniquely different and it is important for RTD to work closely with
those partners so that everyone benefits. She asked for more details about those projects
to see how they differed from each other.
Jessica Prosser, City of Arvada, shared that she has been working on the agreement for
the Olde Town station with RTD. She indicated that it really is a transit oriented
development as rail is going through the Olde Town hub. She said that the City of Arvada
has a significant investment in the parking facility and the City wants those spaces
available for people going to Olde Town as well as using transit. She noted that a daily
rate is important to the City, but they would like to wait six months to evaluate the
demand. She added that while the City would like the first 24 hours to be free, they also
do not want people to use the Olde Town Park-n-Ride lot if they are going to the airport
and parking for an extended amount of time.

Director Folska indicated that a concern of hers during the fare study process was that
parking was not integrated. She noted that when ridership is examined, staff must review
the fare and the cost of parking. She added that it may not be appropriate to have
consistent fees throughout the District.

6.A

Robin Ferrin, City of Aurora, stated that one of the differences the City of Aurora is
proposing is a daily rate of $3 and a monthly rate of $50. He said that the City of Aurora
is taking a comprehensive approach to address street parking as well. Aurora wants to
give its residents more options to get around.

Director Menten inquired if the 15% cap on reserved parking was by statute or Board
policy. General Manager Genova indicated that the cap was limited by statute.
Director Menten further inquired if the monthly reserved parking fee had been evaluated
anytime recently. General Manager Genova said that the monthly reserved fee had not
been evaluated, but he noted that at the Mineral and Downtown Littleton stations, there is
a waiting list for the reserved spots and Nine Mile is almost sold out. He said perhaps it is
time to re-evaluate the fee.
Director Deadwyler noted that RTD’s contribution to the Illif station is $100,000 a year
and RTD is leasing the property to the City of Aurora for free. She stated that she does
not see how this benefits RTD and asked if all of the operating and maintenance costs will
be maintained by the City of Aurora. She feels this is a lot of money and asked what RTD
is getting in return for the Iliff Station to be rent free.
Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Counsel, stated that RTD is paying $100,000 because the
original surface lot plan would have cost $2.7 million and then RTD would have had to pay
for the operating and maintenance costs as well. He explained that instead, RTD provided
the $2.7 million to the City of Aurora and they contributed the rest to build the multi-level
structure. He noted that all of the 600 spaces belong to RTD and the $100,000
represents the money that RTD would have had to pay anyway for maintenance costs if a
surface lot was built. Director Deadwyler indicated that she understands the concept, but
she does not like it since the City of Aurora will be charging the parking fees and keeping
the money.
Director Hoy commented that it is fair to have the people using the service pay for the
service. He stated that the people who opt out will pay nothing. RTD has to subsidize
parking and if we charge for a parking space, those who want to pay that charge will pay
and park.

Director Anderson thanked the city representatives and stated that the Board can see the
differences in each community. She stated that it is very important that RTD work with
its partners and the individual uniqueness of each area. She noted that she also wants to
provide continuity for our passengers.

6.A

Chair Tobiassen indicated that at Anschutz they are charging what it actually costs to
maintain their lots, which is about $100 a month. He added that 60% of RTD’s ridership
is transit dependent and they are not going to pay these fees. He estimated that the
demographic for those that use the Park-n-Rides are affluent, upscale, non-minority and
high income. He stated that people choose covered parking because they want their
vehicles protected from the sun and hail. He added that RTD takes a lot of political heat
from a small group of entitled people who use these facilities.
Director Walker stated that he agrees with Director Hoy. He thinks that there are benefits
that come along with fewer cars. He also stated that the 300,000 estimated boardings
per day should be cut in half to determine ridership since most people make two trips each
day. He stated that he is not opposed to charging for parking spots, but stated that there
are benefits to having it be free.
Brian Welch explained that staff’s intention tonight was to explain the economics of RTD’s
parking management program. He said that across the United States, transit agencies are
all over the place with their fees. He reiterated that given all of the factors, it would be
revenue positive.
Director Folska asked Errol Stevens to provide the Board the exact operating and
maintenance costs for the parking structures prior to the next Operations and Customer
Service Committee Meeting. She added that she would also like a map of the current
system including the future stations and what the revenue would be at each.
Brian Welch indicated that RTD has 30,000 existing spaces, but only 24,600 are currently
managed.
Director Lubow asked if it was necessary to go to the legislature if the decision was made
to increase parking rates. Errol Stevens explained that RTD’s parking fees are established
by the Board, but the penalty amounts are established by statute.
Director Hoy sated that the $10 million estimate to maintain the parking facilities is based
on the total 30,000 spaces, not just the spaces in the parking management program.

Chair Tobiassen inquired as to how many riders RTD has each day. Brian Welch indicated
that RTD has about 300,000 boardings each day. Chair Tobiassen noted that staff is only
discussing the single riders who come in cars. Brian Welch explained that 1/5 of RTD’s
ridership utilizes parking and that while a ridership loss associated with a parking charge
would be measureable, in the overall context of RTD’s ridership, it would be a small
number.

• Refunding of 2007A FasTracks Bonds
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the refinancing of the Series 2007A FasTracks
Refunding Bonds.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the August
16, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and
Investments, explained that these bonds were originally
issued in 2007 to partially refinance the Series 2006A
FasTracks Bonds for a savings in interest expense. He
added that recent changes in interest rates have
created an opportunity to reduce the interest expense
by $11.1 million dollars. He noted that RTD Fiscal
Policies require a minimum of 3% savings, and the
current amount is well in excess of that.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk added that Derrick is an amazing person
and RTD is fortunate to have him as an employee.

6.B

Director Folska asked if there was a specific timeframe
for the refunding of the bonds. Brenden Morgan noted
that the timeframe is not outlined, but it should occur
this year. He added that RTD will save $15.5 million
between today and 2036.

• Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No.
____, Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base
System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of
estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4)
use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated
unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended
Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of
budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated
Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end
fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the
Base System only are detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned
debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use
of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place of
new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated
Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases
in 2016.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to
preserve on-going debt service coverage. Net of a previously

Committee Chair Menten remarked that this action item
does not extend the debt, it only refinances it.

6.B

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the
actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In place of
new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement
Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases
in 2016 in combination with #3 above. Use of fund balances
instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service
coverage. Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million
to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a result
of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to
decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended
Budget affecting the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to
estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest
rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect
FasTracks Project only are detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs. This revision is necessary to correct a request made in
the Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of
budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund,
and unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to
each of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating
expense and is not a use of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide
appropriation of $45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized
below from the attached Exhibit I.

Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and
Financial Analysis, explained that staff is asking the
Board to amend the 2016 Amended budget for
necessary actions and correction. She commented that
on the Base System, staff has appropriated $50 million
in new financing. Staff determined that RTD has
limited capacity for additional debt and the agency
must maintain our debt service coverage.
She
indicated that this will result in a reduction to interest
expense of $450,000. She commented that in place of
debt issuance, staff plans to use $11.8 million of the
Board-Appropriated Fund, $15 million of the Capital
Replacement Fund and then pay-go for the remainder
by reducing expenses. She added that staff is also
proposing an increase to other income of $9 million
from the release of TABOR reserves by pledging the
Blake building as collateral. She explained that this is a
fairly common practice among municipalities and legal
has approved the transaction. This is a portion of
RTD’s TABOR reserve and the end result of these
actions will be an estimated reduction of the
unrestricted fund balance of $2.1 million at year end.
Jannette Scarpino stated that for the FasTracks side,
staff will need to reduce budgeted operating expenses
in Capital Programs by $8.8 million due to a budget
submission error. She stated that the true increase to
Capital Programs is $700,000 which includes third

party betterments that will be reimbursed by the City of
Aurora.

Director Folska asked for further explanation as to
where the other income of $9 million was coming from.
Jannette Scarpino stated that the $9 million that is
proposed in the amendment is coming from the release
of TABOR reserves by pledging the Blake building as
collateral.
Heather Copp remarked that staff is planning to take $9
million out of the $20 million in reserve and then
collateralizing the Blake building which is estimated at
$13.4 million. That amount will be added to the other
income line item.
Director Lubow indicated that she is worried about
using the Blake building as collateral. She asked what
would be the risk in collateralizing RTD’s home office.
Heather Copp stated that there would not be any risk.
She added that the TABOR reserve will always be
sitting in the bank.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the TABOR
reserve is only to be used for declared emergencies.
He noted that the term declared emergencies is not
defined, but it does not include things that one might
consider to be an emergency such as an economic
shortfall or economic conditions. He commented that
what constitutes reserves could be cash, property
interests or a mixture. He added that many
organizations have a blend of readily called upon cash,
which is what staff is proposing.
Director Sisk commented that he spoke with Heather
last week about his concerns and the issue for him is
that taking money from the Board-Appropriated fund
raises a few red flags. He added that while it is a
savings account, it illustrates the difficult financial
position that RTD is in.
Packet Pg. 28

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Jannette Scarpino added that the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) recaps the effect of the proposed amendment
and staff’s best estimates at this time. She
commented that this will set the model for the next six
years.

6.B

Director Francone thanked staff for their work. She
added that staff heard the Board’s concerns about
RTD’s debt ratio and they have found a creative
solution to balance the books. She noted that today’s
Wall Street Journal has an article which summarizes the
current financial market and the efforts that RTD is
making is in line with what is happening in the general
financial community.
Committee Chair Menten stated that she is happy with
this resolution but she does not like that the Blake
office was added as collateral. She asked how many
times TABOR had been challenged. Rolf Asphaug
noted that it was only challenged once by Douglas
Bruce. He stated that in the court decision, it is
permissible to put property interests in the TABOR
reserve.

C. Updates

• Presentation and Discussion of 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan
Heather Copp stated that originally the SBP and the APE were up for
approval this month, but staff wanted to give the Board additional time to
review these items since there was a quick overview at the Study Session in
July. She added that the SBP and the APE are intertwined, especially in
regards to debt service coverage. She noted that staff did not want to
approve one without the other because next year the two will be presented
as one complete package. She noted that Jannette Scarpino will discuss the
SBP and Susan Cohen will review the APE.
Jannette Scarpino explained that staff has discussed the SPB development
and assumptions since April of this year. She noted that the SBP has been
Packet Pg. 29

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director James reiterated that this action item is
reclassifying assets and liabilities without changing the
risks associated with them.

developed in concert with the APE and staff has sharpened its assumptions.
She commented that no new debt will be issued throughout the term of the
SBP in order to maintain RTD’s debt service coverage. She added that the
fleet will be financed by the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund in 2016. The fleet will also be financed by previously
issued bond proceeds, use of the Capital Replacement Fund in 2022 and
grant revenue. She noted that the fleet replacement has been reduced in
magnitude from the original request by $40 million. She commented that
the Board-Appropriated Fund will be replenished in 2017 and staff will also
be establishing an operating reserve fund. She added that staff has also
incorporated a minimum/must have projects list for both Capital and Expense
projects.
Jannette Scarpino remarked that staff is not asking for approval of the SBP
tonight. She noted that the final version will be brought to the Board for
approval on September 20, 2016. She stated that no service reductions are
proposed, sales and use tax forecasts return to the CU Leeds baseline
forecast in 2017, diesel is estimated at $2.00 per gallon, gas is estimated at
$2.65 per gallon, there is no new financing, debts are reduced, and the
Board-Appropriated Fund and the Capital Replacement Funds are
replenished.
Jannette Scarpino noted that factors outside of RTD’s control such as sales
tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, supplies as well as economic conditions
will continue to have an impact on the SBP. She stated that there may be
additional expenses or reductions that are not anticipated, but the SBP will
be used as a guide for the 2017 budget. She added that staff will continue
to be challenged by changing economic conditions and the unpredictability
of consumer spending behaviors.
Director Bagley referred to Exhibit 4 and asked for more information about
the Burnham Yard Property Acquisition and the Burnham Yard Site
Development since they were both deferred. He stated that this location is
the choke point and has significant impacts to the Southeast and Southwest
light rail corridors and asked if RTD defers this acquisition, would the current
price point be jeopardized.
General Manager Genova stated that these two items are on the deferred
list, but staff does not have a timeframe for when it will be brought back.
He noted that in terms of jeopardizing the price, it remains to be seen. He
added that it is a large area and a huge facility, but under RTD’s capability to
obtain parcels for transit needs, that site is reserved for us.
Director Bagley added that he would be more comfortable if RTD had the
expenditure to purchase the property from Union Pacific. He stated that it is
important to acquire and it should not be allowed to languish.

Director Hoy asked about the impact that all of this will have on the FISA
account. Heather Copp stated that the SBP has no impact on the FISA
account.

• Presentation and Discussion of 2017-2040 APE/Financial Plan

Susan Cohen explained that the proposed changes to the 2016 Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) are primarily for the US 36 BRT. She commented
that funding for incremental costs of specialized BRT vehicles were deferred
until 2030 and the Church Ranch Road relocation was removed. Other
project budget savings include the completed environmental and planning
work under budget, miscellaneous projects completed under budget and
program wide capital cost reductions.
Susan Cohen added that the financial plan overview shows revenue changes
from the 2015 APE forecasts and highlights tight debt coverage. She noted
that once RTD issues the bonds for FasTracks this year, RTD will not be able
to issue debt until 2023. She commented that while the FasTracks plan is
in balance, there are limited opportunities for long term completion of
corridors on FasTracks and the Base System.
Heather Copp mentioned that the key here is it takes longer to reach the
revenue that staff wants. She noted that after 2035, staff will see a
significant jump in revenues. She added that this is a snapshot in time that
will change next year and noted that RTD’s significant challenges are
between now and 2025.
Director Lubow inquired about the US 36 costs that were deferred while the
Broomfield project is proceeding and asked how these changes occurred.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that Church
Ranch was relocated in 2006-2007. He noted that the Church Ranch
relocation project being referenced is not a complete removal of the project,
it is just being removed from now through 2019. He commented that staff
encountered unanticipated physical challenges trying to relocate the
platforms 1300 feet to the west. He remarked that this project will remain
on the books, but when staff ran through the design build project with
CDOT, it was determined that it will be much easier to accomplish once the
highway is built out to its ultimate configuration. He stated that the

Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance and ECM, stated that through
2019, RTD has a committed capital cost of approximately $5.6 billion
dollars. She remarked that most of the ongoing projects will be open for
revenue service by the end of this year with some closeout work remaining
in 2017. The projects with remaining scope through 2019 are: North Metro,
Southeast Rail Extension, Flat Iron Flyer and the Northwest Rail.

6.B

Broomfield project is a lower cost project that will deliver immediate
improvements to RTD’s passengers.
General Manager Genova stated that staff is following up with our
stakeholders to discuss the details of these items.

Director Anderson stated that the FISA account was set up so that if RTD
found money it did not need; it would be placed into reserves. She added
that it would be irresponsible to have a vast reserve and cut operations.
Director Bagley stated that the FISA account was meant for all of the
FasTracks corridors and extensions. He remarked that the funds in the
account were never specified to a specific corridor.
Director Lubow indicated that she thought the FISA funds were to be used
for US 36 and North Metro. She added that this is another example of the
corridors in the north being the last to be served and stated that it is
concerning and a problem.

• Quarterly Investment Report
Brenden Morgan explained that RTD’s investment policy is conservative in
nature and the policy’s three primary objectives are: safety, liquidity and
yield. He stated that the two line graphs show a performance comparison of
RTD funds relative to the benchmarks laid out in RTD’s investment policy.
He added that the large increase in return is in relation to the short term
interest rate hike in 2015.

• June 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, stated that staff had estimated the sales and use
taxes for June because staff received the actual figures late last week. The
sales and use taxes were estimated to be down 1.2% for a total of $49.6
million, but the actual numbers came in at $52 million putting RTD over
budget for the month. Heather Copp noted that this is the first time RTD
has exceeded the estimates in over a year. Doug MacLeod added that even
though RTD is 1.4% below budget, ridership continues to be lower than
what was estimated which continues to drive lower fare revenues.

• Smart Media Technology Update
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations stated that the
smart media technology updated was included in the August 9, 2016 Board
Packet. She added that staff should receive the cyber security assessment
Packet Pg. 32

B. Recommended Actions

• Parking Management Extended to New Facilities
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking
facilities in the Parking Management Program.
Prior to the Board having the opportunity to move the recommended action
made by staff, Committee Chair Anderson asked for a motion to amend the
Recommended Action in the May 9, 2016 Board Report to substitute the
language to read:
“It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee
that the Board of Directors approve adding to the RTD Parking Management
Program all of RTD’s parking facilities along the University of Colorado A
Line, B Line, G Line and R Line, except for Iliff Station and Olde Town
Arvada Station; and to authorize the General Manager to amend RTD’s
parking management Contract #13D0002 as necessary to include and
manage the added facilities.”
Motion
to Approve
Substitute
Main Motion: Chair Tobiassen made the motion to
move approve a Substitute Main Motion
as Committee Chair Anderson had read.
Director Walker seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking Management
reiterated that staff is trying to get the new parking
facilities in the FasTracks program added to RTD’s
parking management program. He added that this
Packet Pg. 35

Director Lasater was absent. Director Deadwyler left the meeting early.

6.C

action item would only apply to the facilities that do
not have any outside agreements such as the Illif
Station or Olde Town Arvada.

Director Hoy asked why the Westminster facility wasn’t
excluded from this program. Errol Stevens stated that
the City of Westminster wants the facility to be
managed by RTD until they decide what they would like
to do. He added that the 90-day parking notice signs
were installed and until or unless the City of
Westminster decides that they would like to use the
facility differently, it will be managed like the other
facilities. Director Hoy stated that he would vote no on
this item until he could speak to representatives from
the City of Westminster.
Director Bagley commented that when this action item
was tabled previsously, there were qustions about
uniformity. He asked the Chair if he was comfortable
with the new action language.
Chair Tobiassen stated that the reason he wanted to
table this item was due to the ambiguous language and
he wanted to ensure that the language was clear. He
added that the new substitute main motion language
answers those questions and he is comfortable with
moving forward.
Director Sisk commented that he appreciates the
substitute main motion, but he thinks it is still
confusing.
Director Francone remarked that her understanding of
this proposal to consolidate parking was designed to
simplify things and set a precedent fur future parking
lots. Errol Stevens stated that this action only applies
to the four lines opening this year.
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler asked what would RTD gain. Errol
Stevens stated that the new facilities will be managed
like the others. He added that RTD’s contractor will
implement the program and collect the funds. He
stated that the contractor buys the equipment and pays
for all of the costs, but they submit the net costs to
RTD.

6.C

Director Francone noted her interpretation was that
staff wanted to standardize the parking policy. She
stated if other entities want to approach RTD for a
different agreement, that is not standardizing the
policy. She added that she will need additional time to
review this time, so she will be voting no tonight.
Director Folska said this conversation is interesting and
it has evolved over the past few months. She added
that this is part of many iterations in order to get to the
comprehensive plan.
Director Solano stated this is confusing, so he will be a
no vote tonight. He noted that he may change his mind
by the Board meeting.
Committee Chair Anderson explained that there needs
to be flexibility for the communities that spent their
own money to build parking structures.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and
execute an agreement with the City of Aurora for the utilization of the Iliff
Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms outlined under
Discussion in this Action.
Motion:

Director Deadwyler made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Francone asked if RTD has a special event, is
staff required to give a 60-day notice to the City of
Aurora. Errol Stevens, Manager of Parking
Management, stated that the 400 parking spaces are
reserved for RTD use. He added that RTD and the City
of Aurora want to ensure there is efficient use of this
facility. He explained that the City of Aurora can
submit an event permit request to RTD if there is not a
certain or typical use for it.
Director Sisk stated that he anticipates a lot of push
back from our ridership for the inconsistency in parking
fees. He hopes that there is ample signage at the
facility which informs patrons that the City of Aurora is
managing that facility.
General Manager Genova indicated that there are
currently two rates at the existing parking facilities. He
stated that there are a lot of different variables, but this
agreement is only for three years and staff can revise
this pilot program after the agreement expires.

• IGA with Aurora concerning Iliff Station Parking Structure

6.C

Director Deadwyler noted that she would like to see the
entire agreement before she votes on this item. She
inquired if RTD is responsible for all of the Operations
and Maintenance costs. Errol Stevens stated that RTD
will pay $100,000 annually for operations and
maintenance costs. He added that the City of Aurora
will pay $135,000 on top of what RTD will be
contributing to cover all of the operations and
maintenance expenses.
Chair Tobiassen commented that this garage is in his
district. He noted that it is a three-year agreement, and
the City of Aurora is planning to be flexible with pricing
to follow demand. He added that not all Aurora
residents get the discount at RTD park-n-rides because
they do not live in the district. He stated that this is a
good deal for a number of Aurora residents considering
that they have already contributed to this parking
facility. He asked the Board to be flexible and let the
pilot program show the Board how parking can work.
Director Solano stated that he likes the idea of a pilot
study, however, this is going away from a standard
parking policy and he would be voting no on this item
until he has more information.
Director James commented that this appears to be a
great opportunity for RTD and is also advantageous.
Errol Stevens remarked that this multi-level facility is
more attractive to our patrons than a surface lot.
Director James added the enhanced facility was done
at no additional cost to RTD.
Director Bagley indicated he would support this motion.
He added that out of the three pilot programs, RTD can
determine which parking program is best for current
and future corridors.

Director Deadwyler commented that she was aware of
the $3.00 fee but she did not know what the fee range
was. General Manager Genova indicated that the fee
range is $3.00-$5.00. The agreement that staff is
proposing will have parameters for the minimum and
maximum rates.

Committee Chair Anderson stated she has been in
public service for over 30 years and she has always
heard that government isn’t run like a business or
entrepreneurial. She stated she would be voting for
this item and expects that RTD will learn a lot about its
ridership.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that

revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $785,800 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the RTD Board approve revisions to the RTD Fare enforcement policy to
issue citations to patrons that fail to comply with the tapping requirement
regarding smart media technology, to include Business EcoPass,
Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass effective January 1, 2017.
Motion:

Chair Tobiassen made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Steve Martingano, Transit Police Commander of Fare
Enforcement, indicated that the current Business
EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass and CollegePass fare
enforcement policy was
implemented in January of 2013. The
existing policy states that failure to tap or to select the
correct service level may result in the following:
First Offense: Rider is issued a warning.
Second Offense: Seven-day suspension of card.
Third Offense: Thirty-day suspension of card.
Fourth Offense: Pass is confiscated and
suspended for the remainder of the calendar
year.
Steve Martingano commented that Even though the
fare media is pre-paid through contractual agreements,
if the patron does not adhere to the contractual
instructions, the patron has violated Colorado Statute
42-4-1416 Failure to Present a Valid Transit Pass,
because the fare media was not activated from being
tapped to show that the fare media is in fact valid.
Director Solano stated that in the last six weeks he has
taken the E and F line and has never been asked to
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Citations For Failure To Tap Smart Media Technology

6.C

Director Francone indicated she has seen more fare
checks on the C and D lines out of Mineral Station.
She asked what staff anticipates for the violation fee
collection.
Steve Martingano commented that the actual citation
fees go to the counties within the district as they
provide the court rooms and other legal capabilities. He
stated that staff hopes the ridership will be incentivized
to tap their cards.
Director Folska commented that she appreciates the
work Security does for RTD, but she stated that this
recommended action is turning people who are paying
customer into criminals. She added that Business,
EcoPass and College Pass holders have paid their fare
and it is a very different thing than someone that is a
fare evader. She stated that for people to be penalized
and criminalized because our smart technology isn’t
smart enough to determine when they are coming or
going is offensive.
Chair Tobiassen remarked that this is not fare evasion,
but a behavioral issue. He stated that for RTD to
confiscate a pass after it has been paid for is terrible.
He suggested RTD look into behavioral modification
techniques as he cannot see denying someone who has
paid access to the system.
Director Sisk stated this is not the way to manage the
system. He added that RTD needs a better counting
process, but this is punitive and offensive.
Director Hoy explained that while he is conflicted, he is
in support of this. He noted that he receives comments
from people stating that they see people get on and off
Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 9, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

show proof that he paid his fare, but the University of
Colorado A line always has a fare inspector. Steve
Martingano stated that the University of Colorado A line
has a federal requirement which requires two
employees on the train at all times. He noted that one
of the employees is the RTD Security Officer. He
added that there is more light rail vehicles than
commuter rail and it is difficult to get an inspector on
all light rail trains.

the train all the time without tapping or validating a
ticket and it appears to others as those people are
riding the system for free.

Committee Chair Anderson stated that she agrees with
the other Director’s arguments, but asked how does
someone modify the behavior of a college student
when they will not tap their cards. She stated that if a
few got a warning they would start to tap their cards.
She indicated she would be voting yes on this item.
Director James asked if RTD requires a tap off when
riders exit the system. Steve Martingano stated that
RTD does not. Director James added that he realizes
why staff is recommending the change to the policy,
but inquired if there was enough data to warrant the
change.
General Manager Genova explained that if there is prepaid media, staff wanted to change the policy to be
consistent across the board. He commented that there
is a perception that people are not paying for their fare.
He added that the intent of this action is to have one
policy to enforce and comply with.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus
Operations, stated that RTD has benchmarks for what
is expected for ecopass and college pass taps. He
commented that on the bus side the taps were close to
the benchmark, but on the rail side the taps were
drastically less which indicated that people were not
taping their cards as they boarded the trains. He added
that for a variety of reasons there were challenges with
the cards and the smart readers, but that has been
addressed.
Director Folska commented that staff is discussing prepaid cards. She said that RTD has paid $28 million to
Xerox and the burden should be on them. She added
that RTD is opening five new corridors this year and
this action item is not how we make friends or get
people to use RTD’s system.

• Amend Contract 25FK006 - Cutaway Buses to add enhanced ADA features
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to amend contract 25FK006 in an amount not to exceed $340,000 with
Master’s Transportation, a dealer for Goshen Coach, for the addition of
ADA-related items to better accommodate passengers with disabilities.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of
$340,000 from the Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, the cutaway transit bus
and the in-plant vehicles & equipment projects to cover the cost of the
requested additional items.
Motion:

Chair Folska made the motion to move
this item to the full Board at the August
16, 2016 Board Meeting.
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Solano asked for clarification of the ADA
related items. Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager
of Bus Operations, indicated that representatives from
both the ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
and the Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC)
asked for modifications to the Cutaway Buses to add
more handrails, hand straps, and tie downs to better
accommodate disabled passengers.
Director Solano asked how the amendment price was
determined. Bruce Abel explained that staff
approached the manufacturer and they provided a
quote. Staff was able to negotiate that quote down to
the current amount shown.

Director Francone asked to speak about the Parking Management Extended to New
Facilities Board action. Director Francone asked if RTD was trying to standardize
parking why there were independent agreements for Aurora and Arvada. She said
that to her, it appeared that there was special treatment for these 2 locations.
General Manager Genova explained that Aurora and Arvada were (TOD) Transit
Oriented Development projects within their respective communities. General
Manager Genova went on to say that shared parking was also in effect in Boulder
and that shared parking contracts in general were very complex, and the Board
would not see any additional contracts of this type coming from him.
Director Solano said he was at a meeting earlier in the day and parking in
Commerce City was a topic of conversation. At that meeting, they agreed that
partnering with communities to standardize across the district is the best solution.
General Manager Genova said he was not familiar with any parking plans in
Commerce City other than RTD parking. Chair Tobiassen added that Aurora, as
well as Arvada had made a substantial contribution to enhance parking at those
stations.
Director Deadwyler mentioned she was still not happy that RTD will be paying the
City of Aurora for maintenance of the parking facility since Aurora will not sharing
in the revenue. Director Deadwyler is also concerned with the parking fees to the
constituents in a shared parking scenario.
First Chair Larry Hoy said he might be voting this down and that he will meet with
Westminster in the following days to make sure they are on board with this
arrangement. Chair Tobiassen asked that the Executive Committee move forward
in the review of the agenda.
The discussion moved forward to the recommended actions being brought forward
with no additional questions. Chair Tobiassen ask for a motion to move the agenda
forward to the Board meeting and called for a vote.

Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
A.

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____,
Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for
the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest
expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital
Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund
balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the
inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the
Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated
unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base
System only are detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the BoardAppropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is

Packet Pg. 48

6.D

projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget
affecting the Base System include:

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to
estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest
rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks
Project only are detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs. This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the
Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted
operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each
of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense
and is not a use of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of
$45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit
I.

Bylaws/Procedures Discussion
Chair Tobiassen introduced Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel and Jenifer Ross-Amato,
Acting Deputy General Counsel, to the committee and noted that they will be
speaking to the review and update of the current Board of Directors Bylaws.
Rolf Asphaug stated that he and Barbara McManus have been reviewing the Bylaws
for changes and presented a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation outlining the 5 factors
that have been identified as needing changes, as follows:
 Housekeeping
 Committee meetings/study sessions
 Legal Compliance
 Bylaws amendments and
 Board office staff management
Rolf reviewed the 5 factors, giving specific relevant and recent examples of the
type of changes that were identified. Rolf indicated the Executive Committee
would be given a copy of the draft document for review and comments.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve adding to the RTD Parking Management Program all of
RTD’s parking facilities along the University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and
R Line, except for Iliff Station and Olde Town Arvada Station; and to authorize the
General Manager to amend RTD’s parking management Contract #13D0002 as
necessary to include and manage the added facilities.

6.D

Under the subtitle bylaw amendments, Chair Tobiassen asked for clarity around a
majority and supermajority and asked if Rolf could clarify if it was a majority or
supermajority of the whole or of the body that was present. Rolf verified it was the
body that was present that would carry the vote.
The last item outlined was the Board Office staff management. Rolf reviewed that
there has been quite a bit of debate regarding the management of the Board Office
Staff. Rolf went on to say that the current structure does not follow the same
guidelines as the agency as a whole and commented that there is an opportunity to
make changes to protect the Directors and the staff and unify the Board Office to
the agency guidelines.
Jenifer Ross-Amato spoke to the employment guidelines and outlined some specific
actions that she felt were critical to protect both the Director and staff. Jenifer
further clarified what the legal department would defend against and in what
scenarios they would not. Making the change would insulate the Directors from
any employment related claims or litigated issues.
Director Deadwyler explained a few scenarios over the last 6 years that she has
heard about of in terms of how HR handled some issues within the Board Office.
She also spoke of difficulties in getting changes through HR that have been
requested by the previous Executive Director, Paula Perdue. Director Deadwyler
said there needs to be consistency in how the Board Office is managed. General
Manager Genova reviewed the process that is used for recruiting and for reevaluating employee job descriptions. Director Deadwyler said there are some
scenarios that need to be reviewed and that she would like to see a 360
performance appraisal presented to the full Board since the Board Office staff report
to them directly.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 11, 2016 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler asked if the Directors had the opportunity to determine the
amount of materials that were moved forward in the committee meeting and the
Study Sessions. Chair Tobiassen reviewed that what was brought forward in
Committee meeting was relevant information and sometimes the volume cannot be
avoided and still meet the needs of the business. General Manager Genova
mentioned that last Tuesday’s meeting had quite a lot of information and that a
number of items were pushed off because of the length of the meeting and that he
had requested his team to be cognoscente of the volume at the meetings.

6.D

The process of managing the Executive Manager and Board staff was discussed at
length and how this can be changed to be more inclusive and consistent with the
rest of the agency.

Chair Tobiassen gave an update on where RTD is in the process of recruiting for the
Executive Manager position. No exact timing has been developed for moving
forward at this moment but he asked the Executive Committee to be flexible, as
once the process is in motion it will move swiftly. Chair Tobiassen outlined the
time commitment that would be required in the interview process and that once the
candidates were determined, he would like the interview process to happen
marathon style so only one of 2 days were needed to complete the process.
Barbara McManus gave a review of changes that she has been working on with
Rolf Asphaug and Heather Copp regarding the Director’s Expense policy. Barbara
gave an outline of some of the discrepancies that were missing from the policy,
updates to statutes, and IRS guidelines. She indicated there were some challenges
for the Chair as he reviewed travel and local expenses throughout the year and
asked for the policy to be more clearly defined.
Chair Tobiassen noted that each of the redlined documents will be given to each
Executive Committee member at the end of the meeting for their review. Chair
Tobiassen said any questions or comments should be sent to Rolf Asphaug, Barbara
McManus or him and open for discussion in next month’s Committee Meeting.
Seeing no other questions, Chair Tobiassen asked to move onto other matters.
III.

Other Matters
Director Deadwyler spoke about the Brick City Event that happened on Saturday,
August 6th. RTD’s WIN program, Director Deadwyler and Terry Emmons were in
attendance as well as Mayor Hancock, Police Chief White and the Director of
Denver recreation department. Director Deadwyler thought the event went well
and that RTD should attend every year.
Director Francone mentioned the anonymous e-mail that all the Directors received
yesterday regarding an unfair hiring practice and the opinion that the process was
not objective and favoritism was involved. General Manager Genova explained the
process was done through a panel so no one individual makes the decision.

Chair Tobiassen spoke about some of the challenges he has had as Chair in not
knowing the ins and outs of the RTD Culture, especially in regards to how all
processes outside the Board office work.

6.D

Barbara McManus outlined the continuous improvement process for GMR’s that
staff is working on. She mentioned that Directors Deadwyler and Francone were
part of the Executive Review Team and that the process was an eye opener as to
how extensive it was. Barbara said she will be bringing a draft process to
Executive Committee in the fall with some recommended changes to be
implemented by end of year.
Barbara McManus gave some background information on the (ECM) Enterprise
Content Management and because of the nature of that project, she would be
preparing and bringing forward a sole source for approval of 5 one year options for
Accela, MinuteTraq and E-board room. She added that it did not make sense to
convert our data to another piece of software if it was not compatible with the
agency wide software.
Barbara McManus informed the Executive Committee that she would be on
vacation from September 6th – 19th.

Director Hoy mentioned that he has been contacted 4 times over the past number

bottom of the issue. Director Francone said there may or may not be something
going, but it is the perception of what is happening and the Board may need to take
a look at the inquiries.

Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen noted there were three retirees this month with two in attendance. He

attend this evening. He asked General Manager Genova to introduce the other two
retirees.
General Manager Genova stated that between the three retirees tonight there is 107 years
in service to RTD. He added that RTD is honored and privileged to have had them work
for the agency for such a long time.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that it gave him great
pleasure to introduce Gerald Owens. Gerald has been with RTD for 39 years and has
worked as a bus operator and station starter. He added that Gerald is not only a veteran
or RTD, but of the Air Force as well. Gerald and his wife will be relocating to move closer
to their daughter. Bruce Abel wished them both the best in retirement.
Gerald Owens stated that he enjoyed his great career at RTD. He explained that he has

time here. Given the chance, he stated that he would do it all over again.

short. He said that his 37 years at RTD were wonderful. He appreciates RTD’s

General Manager Genova said that to be 4th and 2nd overall is incredible and it
demonstrates the talent of the employees at RTD.
Bruce Abel stated that every year RTD holds our own bus roadeo, which is an opportunity
for our bus operators and maintenance groups to compete against one another. RTD’s
internal and contractor award participants are then sent off to compete in the APTA
competitions. This year, John Johnson was the winner of the RTD Bus Roadeo. He
represented RTD in Charlotte and he placed 7th nationally. On the contractor side, Abniger

Transfer Center
Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Walker recused himself from this action item as he
works for one of the parties involved in the transaction.
Director Francone asked Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant
General Manager of Capital Programs, to clarify the purpose of
this resolution. Henry Stopplecamp explained that staff is
asking the Board to approve beginning the process of acquiring
two easements though the eminent domain process. He noted
this is RTD’s standard process for acquiring property and
easements and added that the easements are needed for
power and sanitation as part of the new transfer center.
Director Francone noted that there were also traffic concerns
warranting the movement of the current facility. Henry
Stopplecamp said that was correct but these easements are
primarily to service the driver relief kiosk and the lighting of
the new facility. There are also two to three buses at any one
time parked at the current facility and staff’s goal is to have all
three buses in a safe location away from the traffic at
Southwest Plaza.
Director Francone inquired if construction of the transfer
center would also cover a complete reconstruction of the road.
Henry Stopplecamp indicated that it would only be for 1200
feet of roadway.
Director James explained that this action item is only coming
to the Board because of the easement acquisition. He thanked
staff for the extensive background for this action item and
reiterated that this real estate transaction is necessary for
operations. He reminded the Board that there are many other
operational projects that do not require Board approval but this

it is part of RTD’s capital priority program. He added that this

done.

Director Francone recognized Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and
Information, and Nadia Garas of DDP for their assistance giving KLZ AM Radio a tour of
the University of Colorado A Line. She explained the radio hosts were not exactly fans of
RTD but Nate and Nadia were spectacular. They were patient, informative, full of facts,
fun and professional. She thanked General Manager Genova and Scott Reed, Assistant
General Manager of Communications, for allowing them to come on the tour with her.
She said that as a result of staff’s work, there are three new converts.
Director Menten inquired about the B Line handout that the Board received. She indicated
that on the first page under General Information it notes that Westminster Station will
provide 650 parking spots, but page 3 says 600. She asked for further clarification as to

Director Menten further inquired about the parking fee at Westminster Station. She noted
that the first 90 days would be free and then the regular parking fee would apply, but she
asked for clarification as to what is considered RTD’s regular fee. General Manager
Genova stated that after the preliminary 90-day period, the RTD parking management
program will be implemented at the Westminster facility and the fees would be similar to
those facilities in the managed program. If someone lives inside the District, the first 24
hours are free and then it is $2.00 per day. If someone is out of District it is $4.00 per
day. He added that staff is planning to have additional information from our stakeholders
before next week’s Study Session that will focus on parking.

Subject:

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: August 4, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of 2016 to amend
the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2)
reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the
Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and
amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of
budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement
Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System only are
detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million. Originally
appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned debt issuance for fleet
purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund
and Capital Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a result of #1
above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in 2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place of new
financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated Fund be reduced
by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund
balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service
coverage. Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In place of new
financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement Fund be
reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016 in
combination with #3 above. Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary
to preserve on-going debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is
$15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a result of the
above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decline $1.4
million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.

Packet Pg. 70

11.A

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base
System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the
amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as
collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated investment
income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are
detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs. This revision
is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in
overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and unrestricted fund
balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these funds is a direct result of the
reduction to operating expense and is not a use of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0 million to
$2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

DISCUSSION
Base System
RTD staff has completed its development of the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan for the Base
System and determined that certain revisions were necessary to the 2016 Amended Budget as
previously approved. It was determined that the planned 2016 $50 million COP (Certificates of
Participation) debt issuance for fleet acquisition would negatively impact RTD’s ability to meet
projected debt service coverage requirements, which is already being challenged by overall lower
revenue estimates. In order to support the planned fleet purchase, it is proposed that both the
Board-appropriated reserve fund and capital replacement reserve fund be utilized in lieu of the COPs
to complete the fleet purchase obligation. In the 2017-2022 SBP, restoration of both reserve funds
to their previous levels is projected to occur as quickly as possible, no later than 2020.
The result of these revisions will be to lower the Base System unrestricted year-end fund balance by
$1.4 million to $2.1 million. Also, non-issuance of the COPs is estimated to lower interest expense
on the Base System by $0.45 million.
Revenue revisions for the Base System include an increase to other income of $9.0 million from
release of TABOR reserves in exchange for collateral of the Blake building. Replacing TABOR
reserves with real property or other assets will allow RTD to access $9.0 million in cash in those

Packet Pg. 74

11.A

accounts (we will revise the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2017 to allow both cash and other
assets to be pledged for this reserve). This is an approach used by several other municipalities.
The $9.0 million will be used towards fleet acquisition in 2016 as well as overall balancing of the
2016 Amended Budget. Investment income is also revised upward by $0.39 million based on
higher interest rate forecasts. Revenue is estimated and not appropriated by the Board in the RTD
budget.
FasTracks
A reduction of $8.8 million to operating expense in FasTracks Project is proposed to correct an
overstatement that resulted from a request made in error for I-225 operating expense in the
previously approved Amended Budget. The reduction affects the Capital Programs department.
The result of this revision will be to lower the FasTracks Project Board-appropriated fund, capital
replacement fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance by $0.5 million each because
these funds are calculated at two months of operating expense which is being reduced by $8.8
million. This does not represent a use of fund balances, but rather a reduction based on calculation
of required amounts.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to be $11.4 million,
down from $13.4 million in the previously approved Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System to reflect: 1) de-appropriation of $50.0
million in new financing proceeds, 2) reduction of $0.45 million in estimated interest expense, 3)
reduction of $14.8 million to the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) reduction of $18.0 million to the
Capital Replacement Fund, and 5) reduction of $1.4 million to the year-end unrestricted fund
balance. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project to reflect: 1) reduction of
$8.8 million in operating expense, and 2) reduction of $0.5 million each to the BoardAppropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund and year-end unrestricted fund balance. This is
the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2016 Amended Budget and amend
with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2016 Amended Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2016
Amended Budget would not reflect other adjustments necessary to balance the 2016 Budget
and the 2017-2022 SBP, preserve debt service coverage, and correct previously budgeted
operating expense.

Salaried Pension Trustee Appointment

CFO/AGM,

Date: August 4, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Derrick Black to a term expiring 12/31/2017 as
a trustee for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On May 31, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution
further provided that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans were to remain as trustees
with revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms, and that after acceptance of
applications and screening in accordance with the Plans, an employee who is a participant in the Defined
Contribution Plan be appointed to replace retired trustee Marla Lien.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and employee Derrick Black is
recommended for appointment as a trustee to the Plans.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve Derrick Black to serve as a trustee on the Plans in
accordance with the attached resolution. This is recommended because the employee has applied
and been screened for the position, and will replace the retired trustee assuring continued
representation going forward.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

Refunding of 2007A FasTracks Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: August 4, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the refinancing of the
Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds.
BACKGROUND
RTD issued the Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds to partially refinance the Series2006A
FasTracks Bonds to realize a savings in interest expense.
Recent changes in interest rates and the approaching 2017 call date on certain of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds have created an opportunity to again realize a reduction in interest
expense.
DISSCUSSION
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund a portion of
the remaining outstanding Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds (“Series 2007A Bonds”),
subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $11.1 million (8.06% of principal). RTD
policy requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in
interest rates between now and the date the new refunding bonds are sold. The Series 2007A
Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
Staff has recommended the adoption of this resolution to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD
to reduce its overall interest expense related to the Series 2007A Bonds in the coming years. While
the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of a
cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest expense of the Series 2007A Bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the
new refunding bonds and call date of the Series 2007A Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”).
Absent a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a
reduction in time proceeds of the new refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the
Series 2007A Bonds. Despite the cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings
from a refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the inclusion of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds in the current refunding project authorized by the Board in May 2016.
Drafts of documents including the Indenture, the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary
Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.

Packet Pg. 92

12.C

RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Sherman & Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten
by a team including Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Piper Jaffray, and Harvestons Securities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees. The length of the refunded bonds will not exceed the length of existing Series 2007A Bonds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the refinancing of the Series 2007A FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is
the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2016, authorizing the issuance of the District’s refinancing of the Series 2007A
FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

Subject:

Amend Contract 25FK006 - Cutaway Buses to
add enhanced ADA features

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to amend contract 25FK006 in an amount not to exceed
$340,000 with Master’s Transportation, a dealer for Goshen Coach, for the addition of ADA-related
items to better accommodate passengers with disabilities.
It is also recommended that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $340,000 from the Flatiron
Flyer bus procurement, the cutaway transit bus and the in-plant vehicles & equipment projects to cover
the cost of the requested additional items.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Bus Operations has begun the process of replacing
the aging and high maintenance cutaway buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of up to 241 cutaway
buses. This procurement was the result of RTD Invitation for Bids (IFB 25FK006) on October 19, 2015.
Bids were received on December 8, 2015. Master’s Transportation was the responsive and responsible
low bidder.
In June this year, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, built a pilot bus and sent it to Denver for RTD
review and approval. RTD invited members of ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC) and the
Colorado Cross Disability Coalition (CCDC) to review the ADA features of the bus. As a result of this
review, five changes were requested by the group, to include the addition of more handrails and hand
straps to assist ambulatory passengers in standing up from a seating position and moving about the bus,
and the reconfiguration of the wheelchair tiedowns to better accommodate various sizes of wheelchair
devices.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA features to better accommodate passengers with disabilities, and to transfer funds from
three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus and in-plant vehicles & equipment
projects to cover for the additional cost.
DISCUSSION
The new Goshen cutaway buses will be 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an extended
sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, eight foldable seats for ambulatory
passengers, and three wheelchair tiedown areas.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 96

12.D

Additional funds in the amount of $340,000 are needed to fund the contract amendment. Capital funds
from three projects, Flatiron Flyer bus procurement, cutaway transit bus procurement and in-plant
vehicles and equipment procurement, are available for transfer to this project. These projects have been
completed or are in process of being completed. We are recommending the transfer of existing excess
capital funds from three closing-out projects into this contract. No additional funds are required so the
capital budget impact is zero.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, the bus manufacturer, Goshen Coach, has submitted a certificate
attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Master’s Transportation for the
addition of ADA bus features, and to transfer the capital funds to fund the amendment. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment. This is not desirable as it would result in the production
and delivery of Access-a-Ride buses that do not fully accommodate the expressed needs of the disabled
community.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve adding to the RTD Parking Management Program all of RTD’s parking facilities along the
University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line, except for Iliff Station and Olde Town Arvada
Station; and to authorize the General Manager to amend RTD’s parking management Contract #13D0002
as necessary to include and manage the added facilities.
BACKGROUND
The Board-approved 2008 Parking Management Program was implemented in 2009 under constraints
imposed by the Colorado State legislature that limited which patrons can be charged for parking to, (1)
out-of-District patrons every day, (2) in-District patrons after the first 24 hours, and (3) reserved parking
in exchange for a flat monthly fee. Patrons may pay for parking at pay stations with exact cash or
credit, with pay-by-phone or with an “automated” account (pre-arranged, declining balance, 15%
discounted), or in-District patrons may subscribe to the Reserved parking program which reserves them
the right to access parking in a designated pool between 5am and 10am each weekday. After 10am
unused spaces may be used by any patron (at facilities where Reserved demand exceeds the legislated
maximum of 15% of each facility’s capacity, a waiting list is created). Approximately 18% of RTD
boardings result from patrons who park at RTD facilities and about 15% of those who park actually pay
for parking in one form or another.
At the time the Program was adopted approximately forty (40) parking facilities were included in the
Program, referred to as “designated facilities”. In November of 2012, when parking management
contract amendments were being considered by the Board, the new West Corridor parking facilities were
“designated” for inclusion in the Parking Management Program. That was the first major addition to
“designated facilities” since adoption in 2008. Prior to that time minor deletions, based upon unique
circumstances, had occurred as provided in the original Program. With various deletions, closings and
the addition of West Corridor, the Program currently is implemented at 36 RTD operated facilities.
DISCUSSION
In 2016, consistent with our practice of implementing the Program in all parking facilities in a corridor,
we plan to add the parking facilities in University of Colorado A Line, B Line, G Line and R Line that will
add 14 new parking facilities, 3 of which may be operated by others depending upon the outcome of
negotiations. In accordance with the existing contract, SP+ (formerly Central Parking) will purchase the
pay stations and other necessary equipment to manage these facilities and will recover the cost from
parking revenues.
After review of how facilities are included in the Program, the General Manager, as an alternative to
seeking Board approval on a case by case basis, believes the Board may agree that it is more efficient to
grant the General Manager broader authority to include new parking facilities in the Parking Management

Packet Pg. 98

13.E

Program as deemed appropriate consistent with size, location, ownership, stakeholder participation and
shared use considerations. This would align inclusion of parking facilities into the Parking Management
Program with the timing of planning and design of parking facilities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Addition of these 2016 facilities will increase annual parking revenues and will capture a greater portion
of extended parking beyond the first day by DIA travelers. Operating expenses are recovered from
revenues.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to include new parking facilities in the Parking
Management Program.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action. Authorize the General Manager to include only new
parking facilities in the Parking Management Program that are planned to open in 2016, as
mentioned above.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City of Aurora for the
utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms outlined under Discussion in
this Action.
BACKGROUND
The Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA was negotiated to fulfill Aurora’s desire to have a parking
structure instead of two surface lots that were in the FasTracks plan. This was conceived as a mutually
beneficial partnership that would accelerate development and enhance ridership long term at no
additional cost to RTD with the same 600 parking spaces available for RTD patrons.
The following table depicts capital, in-kind and estimated operation and maintenance costs and
responsibilities pertinent to each party according to the IGA:

Aurora seeks to, in part, offset its significant investment in the garage by implementing charges for
parking at this facility. Since the 600 spaces were reserved for RTD, the IGA requires that any such
parking plan receive approval in advance by the RTD Board of Directors in the Board’s sole discretion.
The IGA also specifies that a contingency financial plan should be developed by Aurora in the event a
proposed parking plan is not approved by the RTD Board. In the same spirit, the Iliff Garage Land lease
provided that the land upon which the parking structure is located will be leased to Aurora at no cost,

except that the parties shall address revenue generation issues as a part of a parking management plan
proposal.
In May 2016, the City of Aurora proposed terms for an Iliff Garage Parking Management Plan to RTD.
Aurora’s pro-forma analysis indicates that it is not likely that the City will break even before the third
year even in light of RTD’s O&M contribution and rent subsidy. During negotiations with RTD, Aurora
preferred to postpone discussion of revenue generation issues, effectively explaining that ridership
originating from Iliff Station needs a period of time to mature before any reliable revenue projections can
be made.
DISCUSSION
After consideration and negotiation, RTD staff agreed that the following principles for a parking
management plan with the City of Aurora (COA) for the Iliff Garage be submitted to the RTD Board of
Directors for consideration to cover this initial three year evaluation period as follows:


Term of Original Agreement: 3 years



Parking rates:
o COA shall implement an opening daily rate $3.00, with a not to exceed daily rate of $5.00
o COA shall implement a Monthly Reserved program, as defined below, with an opening rate
$50.00 not to exceed $85.00
o In order to achieve a utilization rate of at least 75% “average occupancy”, following an 18
month stabilization period, COA shall reduce first day parking rates below $3, including
reducing first day daily parking rates to $0 on an incremental basis. Monthly reserved parking
fees shall also be reduced to achieve 75% average occupancy if necessary. COA may choose
to reduce parking rates during the “stabilization period” if it deems conditions warrant. If first
day daily rates are reduced to $0.00 a second and subsequent day rate of at least $2.00 will
be retained, not to exceed 30 continuous days. Average occupancy is defined as occupancy
data collected over a one month period for weekday, working days only (holidays, weekends
excluded). Occupancy data will be collected during the midday timeframe to most accurately
reflect facility utilization. “Stabilization period” is defined as a timeframe not to exceed 18
months where parking rates would not be required to reduce in order to reach 75% average
occupancy in order for transit users to adjust travel habits and take advantage of the new
light rail transit service at Iliff Station.
o Rate changes: 60 day notice to RTD, Manager, Parking Management
o Overnight parking not to exceed 30 consecutive days.



Non-Transit Use of Transit Parking Spaces: Unless otherwise agreed by RTD in written form, 600
parking spaces shall be reserved for transit patron use at all times. On a case by case basis, RTD
agrees that the City of Aurora may plan to make use of unused transit parking space on evenings,
weekends and holidays to the extent that RTD does not anticipate RTD patron use of the Iliff
structure to access transit service during the proposed re-occurring periods or for scheduled events
and attractions at other transit served locations. The City of Aurora shall require a City Special Event
permit to be processed through the City Manager’s Office for each such proposed function at the Iliff
Garage 60 days prior to the proposed ongoing use or event. Each such City Special Event Permit
shall be subject to written approval by RTD. Approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, and an
RTD approval decision shall be provided to the City of Aurora within 7 working days of receipt by
RTD from the City of Aurora.

Packet Pg. 101

13.F



Replacement Agreement: Six months prior to the parking management plan’s full term, COA and
RTD will begin good faith negotiations to negotiate a replacement agreement to be submitted to RTD
Board of Directors for consideration.



Payment Options: Iliff Garage will be equipped with pay stations that accept all forms of payment,
along with a pay by phone and online payment platforms for customers through Aurora’s contractor.



Monthly Reserved Parking: Commuters shall be able to purchase monthly permits for spaces that are
reserved within the parking structure garage for parking on weekdays starting at 5am. If not filled by
10am by subscribers, these spaces become open to the public in an effort to maximize utilization of
the facility. Overnight parking is not allowed in spaces reserved for monthly commuter parking. The
number of such spaces sold shall not exceed 50% of the capacity of the parking structure.



Customer Care: Aurora shall provide patrons of the Iliff parking facility with industry standard
customer care for inquiries, dissemination of public information, conduct of necessary business and
resolution of disputes.



Enforcement Procedures: Iliff Garage shall be enforced for non-payment and other prohibited
activities. Parkers issued citations shall have a dispute process available to them that is transparent
and accessible. Enforcement shall be overseen by Aurora Parking Enforcement and Aurora City
citations shall be issued to offenders. Parkers issued parking citations shall have the opportunity to
dispute their citation if they so choose with the Aurora Parking Bureau, as part of the Aurora
Municipal Court.



Garage Access: Iliff Garage shall employ a gateless, pay by plate system that is similar to RTD
managed parking facilities.



Reporting: On a Quarterly basis, the City shall provide RTD with all pertinent parking usage figures
for the Iliff Garage, including parking revenue and expense details fully disclosing the purposes for
which parking revenue and the annual RTD subsidy have been expended. These summaries shall be
due to RTD no later than the mid-point of each subsequent quarter.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This agreement will not alter RTD’s obligations under the Iliff Station Parking Structure IGA with Aurora
that requires an annual payment to Aurora of $94,500 in the first year escalated annually thereafter at
the rate of 2% compounded.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the recommendation by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board
of Directors authorize the General Manager to negotiate and execute an agreement with the City
of Aurora for the utilization of the Iliff Station Parking Structure consistent with the terms
outlined under Discussion in this Action.
2. Do not adopt the recommended action; rather, direct the General Manager to renegotiate the
terms and execute an IGA with Aurora with direction from the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the recommended action.

Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the Fall 2016 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $785,800 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and service reductions. Also included in this report is a
grant funded proposal anticipated to be implemented with the completion of North Central Park
Boulevard roadway construction. Funded through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate
between the Central Park Boulevard Station and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two hearings were held in Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details
from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment C of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. Due to the relatively small number of proposals in the
Fall 2016 proposals, no significant changes are listed.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 15 – East Colfax: adjust PM peak westbound frequency
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service
Route 122X-Wagon Road/Civic Center: add a.m. peak trip
C Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
E Line: add earlier northbound weekday trip
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue: running time analysis
Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited: running time analysis
Route 88 – Thornton/Commerce City/Stapleton: running time analysis
Route AB – Boulder/DIA: schedule adjustments
BOLT _ Boulder/Longmont: conversion of selected peak trips to limited stop service
Federal Boulevard Routes: running time analysis
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $785,800 annualized, with
$442,000 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $343,800.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Fall 2016 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

Attachment A - Fall 2016 Service Change

Bus
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue
Running time analysis, no cost impacts anticipated.

Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Running time analysis, no cost impacts anticipated.
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton
In coordination with the grant approval from City of Commerce City, this proposal creates
a new route service between Central Park Boulevard Station to 60th/Dahila, via Central
Park Boulevard, Prairie Parkway, Trenton Street and 60th Avenue. This service would offer
half-hourly headways on weekdays and hourly service on Saturdays and Sunday between
the hours of 6:00am to 6:00pm. This service would begin upon the completion of
construction of North Central Park Boulevard and modifications to curb line on Trenton
Street at 60th Avenue. Anticipated cost impacts are fully grant funded and estimated to be
$442,800 annualized.
Route 88 – Thorton/Commerce City/Stapleton
Running time analysis, resulting in minor schedule adjustments is proposed. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 122X – Wagon Road/ Civic Center
Add one southbound 7:50am trip, from Wagon Rd, to address overload issues. Anticipated
cost impacts are estimated to be $12,000 annualized.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA
Adjust schedule to hourly trip times/frequency weekday, Sat/Sun/Holiday to match
schedule to former service frequency (prior to routing via E-470). No cost impacts are
anticipated.

Attachment: Attachment A Fall 2016 (2865 : Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change)

Route 15 – East Colfax
Running time analysis, and adjust PM peak westbound frequency from every 7.5/15
minutes to every 10 minutes. Cost impacts estimated to be $31,000

Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
Convert 4AM peak and last southbound trip as well as 3PM peak and last northbound trips
to LIMITED (Ltd) trips between 8th/Coffman and Downtown Boulder Station. Routing
adjustment within Boulder via Foothills, Pearl Pkwy to Pearl, then regular routing; stop
adjustment coordination included. No cost impacts are anticipated.

13.G.a

Attachment A - Fall 2016 Service Change

Flatiron Flyer – US36 BRT
It is proposed to add one FF6 trip, eastbound, at 4pm from Boulder Junction to Union
Station to replace former Route S trip. Additionally, it is proposed to add 2 FF2 trips in
both the morning and evening peak period to address passenger overloads currently being
accommodated using Loop Extras, which are vehicles set aside to support operation of the
corridor. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $70,000 annualized. Running time
adjustments for FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5 and FF6 are also proposed with no additional
cost impacts anticipated.

Rail
C Line – Mineral Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in August 2015 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. A morning pullout from the north end of Elati can be changed to pullout from
the south and still cover this trip. This trip would depart Mineral Station at 4:42 AM and
arrive Denver Union Station at 5:10 AM. It is also proposed to add an earlier C Line
pullout trip by utilizing an existing out of service train that interlines to a W Line train.
This trip would depart Evans Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:40
AM.
E Line – Lincoln Station/Union Station
It is proposed to add an earlier northbound weekday morning trip. The trip that was added
in January 2016 is meeting the 10% boardings per hour service standard for light rail and
multiple customers have written requesting an earlier trip for University of Colorado A Line
connections. The existing trip that departs Southmoor Station at 4:54 AM would be
extended to depart Lincoln Station at 4:49 AM and a new trip would be added to depart
Southmoor Station at 4:24 AM and arrive Denver Union Station at 4:49 AM.

Attachment: Attachment A Fall 2016 (2865 : Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change)

Federal Blvd Routes – 30, 30L, 31, 36L
It is proposed to add an additional vehicle (on top of proposed G Line changes) to improve
on-time performance. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $124,000 annualized.

Anticipated cost impacts of the C and E Line proposals is estimated to be $106,000
