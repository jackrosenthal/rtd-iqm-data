for management and staff. He noted every division had two visits and there will be third
shift visits in the next few months. He added that there will be additional bbq’s at the
various divisions on Friday, October 14th.
General Manager Genova commented that in relation to Denver Transit Partners, Aaron
Epstein will be phasing out of DTP and John Thompson will be taking over.
General Manager Genova informed the Board that the Rail Rodeo is coming up on
Saturday, August 27th, and the Bus Roadeo will be Saturday, September 10th.

Director Folska thanked General Manager Genova for his report. She added that the Board
needs a frank conversation with staff regarding the University of Colorado A Line’s
challenges and how RTD is going to rescue its public relations.
General Manager Genova stated he reviewed a report earlier in the day that showed daily
on-time performance is at 88%. He commented that there have been incidences in the
last week involving the overhead system which has caused delays, and DTP has taken
corrective action and is proactively reviewing the entire overhead system. He added that
there is a draft report that will summarize the significant delays DTP has had.
Director Folska explained that the University of Colorado A Line is concerning because it is
something that the District has been promoting in the state and the country as an example
of a successful public-private partnership (P3). She stated the risk of bad public relations,
whether or not on-time performance is 88%, is bad for RTD and the entire notion of P3
projects. She asserted that RTD needs to have emergency communications with
constituents.
Director Anderson stated she was very concerned as she is constantly receiving emails
about the unreliability of the University of Colorado A Line. She said that an 88% on-time
rate is good, unless you are on the 89th train that cannot make it to the airport on time.
She reiterated that it is incumbent on the Board and staff to make sure that people get to
their destinations on time. She thinks that RTD needs to address the public to do
something to change the entire paradigm.
Director Solano commented that he was on the University of Colorado A Line that got
stuck at the 38th and Blake station. He stated that another train was brought in and the
entire delay took 15 minutes or less. He noted that RTD and DTP need to have a
contingency plan in place for these issues.
Director Deadwyler stated that 88% sounds good, but it does not feel good. She added
that Security needs additional training, and commented that people flying in from other
places need to have a good experience on the train. She agreed with the other Directors
and said that there seems to be more and more down time with each delay.
Director Archuleta said a project of this magnitude is going to have problems. He brought
up the issues with DIA’s baggage carousel and noted it took time and money and it still
does not work. He stated that people are going to complain and he understands, but this
project will move forward and the issues will be fixed.

Director Lasater asked staff for a comparative analysis of the University of Colorado A Line
and B Line against the W Line so that the Board can get a better assessment of the current
failures.
General Manager Genova noted he has been with RTD for every line that has opened. He
stated that each line has had its own start up issues, such as the Southeast line’s weather
issues which required a few adjustments. He stated that he is not satisfied with the
current performance of the University of Colorado A Line, but it is a good project that
needs to be fine-tuned. He said that as issues are resolved, performance will improve.
Director Solano commented that in an election year, an issue as big as this can affect the
outcome. He said that RTD needs to be proactive and explain to the constituents what
the General Manager just stated. He remarked that the Board does not want the Directors
that have been doing a good job here to fall through the cracks in November.

XI.

Public Hearing for Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget
Chair Tobiassen called to order the Public Hearing for RTD’s Proposed Amendment to
Amended Budget for the year 2016. He indicated that in accordance with RTD's
requirements, notice of the public hearing was duly posted by the office of the Executive
Director to the Board of Directors at the Board approved notice location of 1600 Blake
Street. He added that a copy of the Proposed Amendment to Amended Budget for the
year 2016 is available for the public on request from the Board Office.
Chair Tobiassen noted that there were no speakers or questions relating to the Proposed
Amendment to Amended Budget for the year 2016 and asked for a motion to approve the
action item.
A.

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of
2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of
1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the
Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget
for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense,
2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System
only are detailed as follows:

1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.
Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the
planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be
replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital
Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a
result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in
2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place
of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the BoardAppropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund balances instead
of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.
Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In
place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital
Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support
planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.
Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve ongoing debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual
fund usage is $15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a
result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is
projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end
2016.
Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting
the Base System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR
reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for
providing the Blake building as collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated
investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project
only are detailed as follows:

1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.
This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in
error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital
Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and
unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these
funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use
of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0
million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

Director Hoy noted that he had questions last week about the
City of Westminster’s involvement or non-involvement in
RTD’s parking management program. He remarked that the
City of Westminster is comfortable with the present plan, but
they would like to start a dialogue with RTD about where they
are going in the future. He commented that he is not sure if
that means an IGA, but Westminster is interested in exploring
their options.
Director Solano stated that he met with representatives from
Commerce City this morning and they do not have a plan in
place for parking. He added that the 2018 opening of the
North Metro Line is coming up quickly and this is an ongoing
topic that needs to be addressed.

Director Sisk complimented Director Lubow and former RTD Chair Lee Kemp for their
behavior at a forum last week where they and another individual spoke as candidates of
District I. He stated that Director Lubow and Mr. Kemp presented themselves in an
exemplary way and did not take the bait for vicious and personal comments that were
made to them by the third individual. He added that he is proud to know both Director
Lubow and Mr. Kemp.

Director Anderson seconded Director Sisk’s comments. She added that she was appalled
at the manner of the third individual and felt that both Director Lubow and Mr. Kemp were
polite and did a great job in keeping the discussion on point.

that they can watch it when it airs.
Director Deadwyler indicated that she too would like to see the forum when it airs. She
noted that while she did not attend the forum, she heard about the third individual and of
their behavior at the forum. She added that she received a phone call from that individual
and they tried to intimidate her, unsuccessfully.

there is a current Denver Post Poll and encouraged the Board to check the poll and vote
yes.
Chair Tobiassen stated that he ran into one of his friends in Boulder who remarked how
happy she was with the Flatiron Flyer (FF). She praised the FF and added that her
coworkers love it as well.
