RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve modifications to the supplemental, premium Access-on-Demand
(AoD) service for RTD’s paratransit customers as amended and described herein effective January 1,

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 27, 2024, the General Manager and CEO, commissioned a peer review of RTD’s paratransit
service delivery, to be conducted by subject-matter experts selected by the American Public
Transportation Association (APTA). APTA convened the peer review panel, which included a
geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the months-long review, the
panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride
(AaR) service, the agency’s complementary American with Disabilities Act (ADA) paratransit service,
and RTD’s AoD premium supplemental paratransit service.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
The on-site portion of the review was conducted between May 20 and 24, 2024. In advance of the onsite visit, RTD provided the panelists with documentation for their edification. While on-site at RTD
facilities, the panelists assessed RTD’s paratransit operations through further documentation review,
field observations, and a series of briefings and interviews with agency staff, contractors, paratransit
customers, and community stakeholders. The final report formalized the panelists’ observations and
recommendations.

Packet Pg. 5

9.1

Staff provided the Board with a summary of program modifications that were developed as a result of
recommendations from the APTA peer review in November 2024, and after extensive public feedback,
data analysis, industry research, and a survey of other transit agencies, as well as input provided from
the Board, several iterations of recommendations have been explored.
DISCUSSION
Based on Board guidance, public outreach, and community feedback, staff recommended the following
modifications to the AoD program during the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting held
on July 16, 2025:
•
•
•
•
•

$6.50 upfront base fare/$3.25 for LiVE eligible customers
$20/trip subsidy
60 trips/month cap
Service area that mirrors AaR*
Service hours that mirror AaR

*During the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee meeting on July 16, 2025, the committee
amended the proposed modification to the AoD Service Area as follows:
The AoD service area shall also include all origins and destinations that lie within three-quarters
(¾) of a mile of any RTD fixed-route bus service, including commuter and regional bus routes.
During the monthly Board meeting held on July 29, 2025, the Board made amendments to the
proposed AoD program modifications and then committed the program modifications as amended
back to the Operations, Safety, and Security Committee. This was done to allow staff time to analyze
the proposed modifications and provide the Board additional estimated cost projections for the AoD
program. As of July 29, 2025, the proposed program modifications as amended are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Standard fare: $2.50 upfront base fare/$1.25 for LiVE eligible customers
Trip cap: 60/month
Trip subsidy: $20/trip
Service area: All locations within current RTD service area
Service window: Current AaR service hours
Waiting Period: No waiting period to begin using AoD once appropriately certified as paratransit
eligible
Multi-stop trips: Explicitly allow multi-stop trips and leave it up to individual transportation
network company (TNC) to decide whether to provide this functionality

At the September 10, 2025 Operations, Safety, and Security Committee, the following amendments
were made to the program modifications:
•
•

Base Fare: $6.50
LiVE Fare: $3.25

Packet Pg. 6

9.1

•

•

Multi-stop Trips: Customers may schedule multi-stop trips with a maximum of two destinations
per origin (e.g., from home to daycare location to work location), utilizing providers that allow
multi-stop functionality, with the initial destination not counting toward the monthly trip cap or
requiring an associated base fare
Effective date of modifications: January 1, 2026**

As of September 10, 2025, the proposed program modifications as amended are:
•
•
•

Re:

Access-on-Demand: Cost Updates – CORRECTED

This memorandum serves to update the Board of Directors (Board) regarding staff’s cost projections for
various Access-on-Demand (AoD) program scenarios. These scenarios were brought forth during the
monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025. Additionally, this memorandum provides
important FY 2026 budget information that will aid the Board in determining the optimal path forward
for the program.
As illustrated herein, the AoD program has grown considerably since its inception less than five years
ago, more so than could have been anticipated. Along with that precipitous growth has come precipitous
program cost increases. In order to ensure the program remains sustainable in the long term, cost
controls must be established.
I recognize the real-world implications of the decisions the Board will need to make regarding this
program. I myself do not take lightly the responsibility of ensuring equitable transit access for people
with disabilities. I and members of my leadership team are empathetic to the diverse needs of RTD’s
customers and take great pride in providing transit services to the greater Denver region. RTD’s
functional mission as memorialized in the RTD Act is “to develop, maintain, and operate a mass
transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.” To meet the region’s transit
needs, the agency must make sound business decisions to ensure its long-term sustainability while
simultaneously delivering excellence and value to customers and community.
History
AoD was launched as a limited pilot program available within four ZIP codes in November 2020 as part
of an expanded supplemental, premium service available to registered, eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR)
customers. The program’s goal was to provide a responsive, on-demand platform for paratransit
customers, which was similar to the agency’s Access-a-Cab program as it existed at that time. While
AaR remains an accessible paratransit option for individuals who cannot use AoD for a variety of reasons
(e.g., certain individuals require door-to-door service while others are unbanked or unable to use apps
to book ride share trips, etc.), AoD provides a viable, convenient transit option for a significant number
of individuals with disabilities who have come to rely on RTD as their mobility provider of choice.

9.1.a

Following a successful pilot, the Access-a-Cab and AoD programs were merged, and the Board approved
an initial not-to-exceed (NTE) amount of $9.3 million for three years commencing January 2023. Since
that time, the Board has approved increases to the total program not-to-exceed (NTE) amount, which
now stands at $37.8 million through December 31, 2025, a four-fold increase from the original projection
due largely to the popularity of the AoD program.

2026 AoD Scenarios
In an effort to maintain consistency, assumptions regarding project costs and parameters have been
presented in a similar manner since the start of discussions in November 2024; however, this has created
the possible misconception that the cost controls under consideration would yield either cost savings or
increased revenue for the agency in 2025, when in fact the program costs will eclipse the amount
budgeted. To better illustrate the impacts of each scenario, this memorandum highlights projected costs
for each of the scenarios as contemplated in the 2026 Budget. Projections have been developed based
on a variety of historical data and assumptions relative to customer behavior based on the associated
fare. Following are further details for each scenario.
Information previously presented to the Board has illustrated the actual trip subsidy paid by RTD to the
four service providers and has not, prior to the dissemination of this memorandum, included the
Wheelchair Accessible Vehicle (WAV) costs that should also be considered as part of the overall program
costs. These costs have been included in the scenarios as described.

WAV Cost

(Note: For comparison, factoring in WAV costs, staff anticipates a total annual AoD program cost of

$24,826,448 in 2025. This total assumes a sustained average monthly increase of 3.8% in customer
demand, with the average customer taking 22 trips per month within existing program parameters.)
2026 Budget
While the 2026 Budget is still being developed, staff anticipates that significant reductions in budgeted
operating expenses will be required to ensure fiscal sustainability and prudent stewardship of taxpayer
dollars, given RTD’s change in net position from +$19M in 2023 to -$282M in 2024.
Should sufficient operating expense savings not be realized in the 2026 Budget, fixed-route service
modifications would be necessary beginning in 2026. For purposes of the 2026 Budget, each 1%
reduction in annualized fixed-route bus service delivery would yield a budgetary offset of approximately
$4 million in operating costs.
Simply put, an increase in program costs of approximately $13.1 million, i.e., the difference in program
costs between staff’s recommended scenario presented in July 2025 and Scenario 6 as described, would
necessitate an equivalent reduction of approximately 3.3% in fixed-route bus service. For comparison,
the relative costs to operate the following highly utilized bus routes in 2024, the costs for which are
comparable to the cost variance among the above scenarios:

For further context, the anticipated AaR budget for the provision of services in 2026 is $53,419,030.
This cost is in addition to any AoD costs outlined above.
Impacts to AaR
As discussed during the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, WAV vehicles used for
AoD service are provided by RTD through the agency’s existing AaR service contracts. As demand for
AoD, and subsequently WAV service, increases, the service capacity of RTD’s federally mandated
complimentary paratransit service decreases correspondingly. Additionally, the demand for WAV trips
provided through both AaR and AoD services continues to increase; for AoD specifically, demand has
risen from a daily average of 79 trips in January 2025 to 116 in July 2025, a 47% increase. During this
same period in 2025, monthly AaR on-time performance has decreased, from over 90% in January-April
2025, down to 86% by the end of July 2025. Staff attributes this performance decline at least partially
to the impact of AoD WAV trip demands on AaR service.
I along with staff look forward to continued discussion regarding this matter during the Operations,
Safety, and Security Meeting scheduled for Wednesday, September 10, 2025, and, if approved, the
monthly Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, September 30, 2025.
Thank you.

During the monthly Board meeting held on Tuesday, July 29, 2025, the Board further amended the proposed AoD
program modifications and later referred the program modifications agenda item, as amended, to the Operations,
Safety, and Security Committee to be considered in September 2025. This was done to allow staff time to analyze
the revised modifications and provide to the Board estimated cost projections for the AoD program given the
amended modifications.
Given the increased program costs associated with all other scenarios contemplated by the Board, staff’s
recommendation is for the Board to adopt the program parameters highlighted above, not to include the change
to the service area boundaries adopted by the committee on July 16, 2025. If approved, these program
modifications would go into effect January 1, 2026, to allow staff sufficient time to coordinate with third-party
AoD service providers prior to implementation, as well as leverage a communications campaign to educate and
inform customers of the forthcoming modifications.
Thank you.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Access-on-Demand Contract Extensions

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into sixmonth contract extension amendments with existing providers for the Access-on-Demand (AoD)
program effective January 1, 2026, through June 30, 2026, raising the not-to-exceed (NTE) amount from
$37.8 million to $47.2 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In January 2023, RTD’s AoD program, a premium, supplemental paratransit service available via four
contracted private providers, was expanded to all eligible Access-a-Ride (AaR) customers. These
contracts were for a three-year contract term that is set to expire December 31, 2025. When these
contracts were approved by the Board of Directors in November 2022, the original NTE for the full
three-year period was $9.3 million.
To ensure customers continue to have equitable and sustainable access to the agency’s services, RTD
commissioned a peer review of the agency’s paratransit service delivery in February 2024. The on-site
review was conducted by industry subject-matter experts (SMEs) in May 2024. These SMEs engaged in
a holistic review of the paratransit program, including both the AoD program and the AaR program. As
part of the review, changes to the AoD program were suggested.
Staff has developed a draft solicitation for new AoD contracts to replace the existing contracts set to
expire, but finalization of the terms of that solicitation is dependent upon Board approval of AoD
program modifications being recommended by staff concurrently with this action. Staff will incorporate
the Board approved modifications into the solicitation and intends to advertise no later than November
7, 2025. This will allow sufficient time for proposers to develop proposals, for the Board of Directors to
consider recommended actions to effectuate the contract extensions, and for the execution of contracts
prior to the term date of the extensions. Program modifications approved by the Board will be
incorporated into these amendments if this recommended action is adopted.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 22

9.2

In adopting this recommended action, RTD seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priority of
Customer Excellence. This recommendation allows registered, eligible customers to continue using
AoD while new contracts are solicited.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the provision of AoD services effective January 1 through June 30, 2026, will be included in
the 2026 Proposed Budget as presented to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Draft Finishing FasTracks Report

September 30, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager, Transit Oriented Communities, Planning
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Senate Bill 24-230, titled “Concerning Support for Statewide Remediation Services that Positively
Impact the Environment,” required, among other things, RTD to prioritize the completion of the
Northwest Rail (B Line) and the North Metro (N Line) corridors of the 2004 voter-approved FasTracks
Plan. Additionally, the legislation required RTD to submit a report to the Governor and the General
Assembly by July 1, 2025, demonstrating how RTD will complete the Plan’s unfinished corridors by
2034. That legislation was amended by Senate Bill 25-161, titled “Transit Reform” to require RTD to
include additional financial information in the report to the Governor and General Assembly while
extending the report’s submittal deadline to December 1, 2025. The draft Finishing FasTracks report is
responsive to these legislative requirements.
The 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report serves as the primary basis for this draft report to the General
Assembly and the Governor. The 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report was completed in response to the
April 2019 RTD Board Resolution No. 007, Series of 2019 which demonstrated the Board’s commitment
to finish the FasTracks Plan. In addition to providing background and updated cost estimates for each of
the four remaining rail corridors, this draft 2025 report also provides an update and discussion of the
other unfinished components of the FasTracks Plan.
DISCUSSION
Staff has completed a draft Finishing FasTracks report for Board and public review and comment. As
noted in the August 27, 2025, General Manager and CEO’s memorandum to the Board entitled
“Updated Finishing FasTracks Report Schedule,” RTD will post the draft report on the agency’s website
and open the public comment period on September 26 and close the comment period on November 14.
Public engagement activities include the following:
• News release
• Interviews, as requested
• Joint Subregional Service Council meeting focused on the report
• Presentation to the Transportation Legislative Review Committee (TLRC)
• Public forum on Finishing FasTracks report as part of the October 28 Board meeting

Packet Pg. 24

10.1

Following the closure of the public comment period on November 14, staff will finalize the report,
which will include documentation of public and stakeholder comments. The final report will be sent to
the Governor and the General Assembly on November 25, 2025
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Minimal cost is associated with the creation of the report and the associated public engagement-related
activities. However, it should be noted that the report identifies the total estimated cost to complete the
unfinished corridors to be approximately $1.6 billion, not inclusive of costs associated with operations,
maintenance, and asset renewals.

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created in
1969 by the Colorado General Assembly to develop, operate, and
maintain a mass transportation system that now benefits more
than 3.1 million people in the Denver metro area. With a service
area of 2,345 square miles, RTD provides bus, rail, paratransit
and microtransit services in all or part of eight counties and more
than 40 municipalities.

The agency's services are delivered via 126 bus routes, six light
rail lines, four commuter rail lines, paratransit mobility services
and microtransit services. RTD, Colorado’s only intermodal transit
agency, is headquartered in Denver and governed by a publicly
elected Board of Directors. Each of the 15 Directors represent a
geographic district of approximately 200,000 constituents and
serve four-year terms.

Agency Overview

10.1.b

Executive Summary
Senate Bill 24-230, titled “Concerning Support for Statewide
Remediation Services that Positively Impact the Environment,”
required, among other things, RTD to prioritize the completion of
the Northwest Rail (B Line) and the North Metro (N Line)
corridors of the 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan.
Additionally, the legislation required RTD to submit a report to
the Governor and the General Assembly by July 1, 2025,
demonstrating how RTD will complete the Plan’s unfinished
corridors by 2034. That legislation was amended by Senate Bill
25-161, titled “Transit Reform” to require RTD to include
additional financial information in the report to the Governor and
General Assembly while extending the report’s submittal deadline
to December 1, 2025. This draft Finishing FasTracks Report is
responsive to these legislative requirements.

Four rail corridors remain incomplete:
• Northwest Rail
• North Metro Corridor
• Southwest Corridor Extension
• Central Corridor Extension
The original FasTracks budget was $4.7 billion in year of
expenditure dollars. To date, RTD has expended significantly
more than that amount – $5.5 billion – on the program. As
illustrated in the table below, the cost to complete the remaining
rail corridors is estimated to be $1.6 billion. The table also
provides the annual operating costs and the projected daily
ridership for each corridor.

T
F

Financial Constraints

An examination of RTD’s financial condition indicates that,
between now and 2034, RTD expects to have only FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) funds available for new
construction, which would be insufficient to cover any of the
remaining corridors. Furthermore, RTD’s 2026-2030 Five-Year
Financial Forecast (FYFF) has not identified sufficient cash flow
available for debt service if new borrowings for incremental
service were to be considered.

A
R

RTD’s 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report serves as the primary
basis for compiling this report to the General Assembly and the
governor. The 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report was completed
in response to the April 2019 RTD Board Resolution No. 004,
Series of 2019, which demonstrated the Board’s commitment to
finish the FasTracks Plan.
This 2025 report includes the following:
• Updated capital and operating costs to reflect inflation
• Revenue projections and fiscal capacity for the program
completion
• A discussion of new challenges impacting project
implementation

D

Since 2004, RTD has achieved approximately 75% program
completion. However, the program has faced significant
challenges, including a reduction in anticipated sales and use tax
revenues beginning in the 2008 Great Recession, and
construction cost escalation, including spikes in raw materials
costs, supply chain challenges and disruption to labor markets.

State funding from programs authorized by SB-260, SB-230, and
SB-184 could potentially contribute toward limited plan
completion. An optimistic scenario would have these programs
providing up to $296 million in funding between 2026 and 2034.
Depending on the funding secured for capital investments, RTD
will also need funding for the operations and maintenance of the
corridors, which would require a significant additional stream of
ongoing funding.

Overview

10.1.b

Summary
Completing the remaining FasTracks corridors requires $1.6
billion for construction. As the table shows, RTD has identified
only $441 million in potential funding for the period from 2026 to
2034, leaving a significant gap of $1.2 billion.
However, the financial challenge is even greater than these
numbers suggest:
• The $1.6 billion construction cost is in 2024 dollars and does
not account for future inflation. The actual cost to build the
corridors will be much higher.
• The $441 million in available funding is an optimistic estimate.
It assumes a larger share of statewide funds will be allocated
to FasTracks than is likely.
Even if the project were scaled back to only complete the
Northwest Rail Peak Service and the North Metro corridor, the
total construction cost would be approximately $1 billion. This
reduced cost still far exceeds the $441 million in projected
funding. Furthermore, all these figures reflect capital construction
costs only. They do not include the additional millions of dollars
that would be required over this period to operate and maintain
the new services once they are built.

Additionally, the legislation required RTD to submit a report to
the Governor and the General Assembly by July 1, 2025,
demonstrating how RTD will complete the Plan’s unfinished
corridors by 2034. That legislation was amended by Senate Bill
25-161, titled “Transit Reform” (SB-161), to require RTD to
include additional financial information in the report to the
Governor and General Assembly while extending the report’s
submittal deadline to December 1, 2025. This Finishing
FasTracks Report is responsive to that requirement.

The 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report (see Appendix A) serves as
the primary basis for this report to the General Assembly and the
Governor. The 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report was completed
in response to the April 2019 RTD Board Resolution that
demonstrated the Board’s commitment to complete the regional
transit expansion detailed in the 2004 voter-approved FasTracks
Plan. This 2025 report, in addition to providing background and
updated cost estimates for each of the four remaining corridor
projects, will also provide an update and discussion of the other
unfinished components of the FasTracks Plan.

Background

The FasTracks Plan, including the financial elements, was subject
to a rigorous review from the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) per the state-required Senate Bill 90-208
(SB-208) process, which states that “the [RTD] Board shall take
no action relating to the construction of a regional fixed
guideway mass transit system until such system has been
approved by the designated Metropolitan Planning Organization.
Each component part or corridor of such system shall be
separately approved by the Metropolitan Planning Organization
(MPO). Such action shall include approval of the method of
financing and the technology selected for such projects.”
The following is a summary of the criteria DRCOG, as the
MPO, employs in assessing fixed guideway mass transit
system proposals.

As a condition of approval, the DRCOG Board included a
requirement for RTD to submit an annual report to DRCOG. Since
2004, RTD has prepared and submitted annual reports
documenting work progress, issues facing the program, and the
current financial plan. From 2004 to 2011, RTD submitted a
comprehensive report with detailed updates on each FasTracks
corridor, including schedule, costs, operations, issues, facilities,
parking and a full, independently reviewed, financial plan.

DRCOG engaged an external consultancy to assist with the SB208 review, with a particular focus on the plan’s capital and
operating cost estimates and revenue assumptions. DRCOG held
public hearings on the draft report and released a final report in
April 2004. The DRCOG Board adopted the report findings via
resolution on April 21, 2004, thereby providing the required SB208 approval of the plan. Among the report’s many conclusions,
it found that the estimated costs per mile for the light rail
corridors were within the expected range of costs to be
anticipated both nationally, when comparing similar properties
and alignments, and locally, when comparing the costs to RTD’s
previous projects.

Since 2013, the DRCOG Board has requested that in lieu of a
traditional SB-208 report RTD submit a FasTracks Status Report.
Those have been filed annually from 2014 to the present and
include a brief update and costs spent on FasTracks projects,
FasTracks Financial Plan information, and the FasTracks Map.

The original FasTracks budget was $4.7 billion. To date, RTD has expended significantly
more than that amount on the program as illustrated in the table below.

10.1.b

Background

Since the passage of FasTracks in 2004, RTD has faced two
primary challenges in completing the plan: the 2008 Great
Recession’s effect on sales tax collections and construction cost
escalation.

However, the Great Recession severely reduced RTD’s sales and
use tax collections. The FasTracks Financial Plan assumed an
annual sales tax growth rate of approximately 6.3%. The actual
growth rate between 2008 and 2024 was 4.9%.

The sales tax growth rates used by RTD to project revenue
growth in the FasTracks Financial plan were based on two
sources. Sales tax growth projections from 2004 through 2009
were based on the Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) forecasts.
Sales tax growth rates for the years 2010 through 2025 were
provided by AECOM, a global infrastructure consultancy firm,
which based their forecasts on data from the Center for Business
and Economic Forecasting (CBEF). CLC growth forecasts, while
for the entire state, were used in the report because the Denver
region constitutes over half the population of the state.

During the same period, worldwide commodity and raw material
prices spiked, thereby reducing revenues and increasing
construction costs. In 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic affected the
supply chain of materials while at the same time disrupting labor
markets, creating a worker shortage, thereby further increasing
construction costs. As the following graph illustrates, key
commodity pricing trends have increased significantly faster than
the FasTracks projections. The graph below illustrates the
changes in key commodity costs since the passage of the plan.

In March 2020, RTD immediately reduced transit service levels to
reflect demand brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing
on routes used by essential workers and transit-dependent
populations. Since the pandemic, travel patterns have shifted
from a need for peak period commuter service to traditional
primary activity centers (such as Downtown Denver, the US 36
Corridor, and the Denver Tech Center), to more crosstown travel,
spread somewhat more evenly throughout the day. Downtown
Denver, RTD’s primary activity center, has seen dramatic impacts
from the pandemic, including a monumental shift to remote
work, which has yielded a correspondingly significant decline in
transit utilization.

14

Finishing FasTracks
202 5 REPORT

In 2024, downtown Denver’s annual visits by employees were at
49% of 2018 levels having dropped from 28.9 million annual
visits to 14.9 million (Downtown Area Plan; Community Advisory
Committee Presentation; March 6, 2025). While RTD transit
utilization is trending up, it is still only 62% of 2020 levels. RTD
expects boardings to continue to increase as transit service is
added based on resource availability.

RTD Board Resolution
The RTD Board of Directors is committed to completing the
FasTracks Plan. On April 16, 2019, the Board approved the
Finishing FasTracks Resolution (No. 2019-004), see
Appendix C, which directed staff to:
• Investigate and research all reasonable cost-saving measures
for construction and operation of the unfinished FasTracks
corridors, including creative funding mechanisms
•

Outline proposed steps to move forward on the unfinished
corridors

•

Outline proposed steps to move forward on the Northwest
Rail Peak Service Plan

•

Report back to the Board within 60 days with a draft report

On June 14, 2019, staff provided a draft initial report, titled
FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors, which represented the
beginning of an iterative process with the Board regarding
possibilities for the advancement of the unfinished corridors. The
report provided potential funding scenarios that would be
required to fill the Plan’s funding gap. That report is the
foundation upon which this report is structured. Additionally, in
2022 the Board authorized the Northwest Rail Peak Service
Feasibility Study to respond to stakeholder input on how RTD
might complete the Northwest Rail Corridor by assessing an initial
commuter rail service in the corridor. The study, which was
completed in summer 2024, examined the peak service concept
brought forward by local stakeholders and RTD staff with a
specific focus on developing a common set of facts to inform the
RTD Board of possible next steps.

FRPRD is currently in the process of developing a service plan for
the passenger rail system based on an Alternatives Analysis (AA)
that CDOT and the Southwest Chief and Front Range Passenger
Rail Commission (the predecessor to FRPRD) conducted in 2020.
The AA recommended a system whereby passenger rail service
would operate on shared tracks with freight operations to
minimize the initial capital investment needed to implement
service. The service proposed for the North Front Range area of
the state would operate along Burlington Northern Santa Fe
(BNSF) right-of-way from Fort Collins to Denver, overlapping the
Northwest Rail Corridor from Longmont to Denver, though it is
expected that the FRPRD service would not stop at all the
stations associated with the Northwest Rail. This is due to the
federal definitions of commuter rail, which is defined as shorthaul passenger transportation in metropolitan or suburban areas,
and passenger rail, which refers to longer-distance, intercity
corridors. Throughout the Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility
Study, RTD worked closely with FRPRD and CDOT staffs to
identify shared infrastructure and operational opportunities.

Front Range Passenger Rail Collaboration

The Colorado General Assembly created the Front Range
Passenger Rail District (FRPRD) in 2021 through Senate Bill 21238. FRPRD is an independent political subdivision of the State
with the mission to plan, design, finance, construct, operate, and
maintain a new passenger rail system along the Front Range.
FRPRD is governed by a board of directors with 17 voting and
seven non-voting members.

The RTD General Manager and Chief Executive Officer is a nonvoting member of the FRPRD Board. FRPRD has coordinated
closely with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT),
RTD, the freight railroads, regional planning organizations, and
local Front Range communities. FRPRD’s geographic boundaries
extend from the Wyoming border to the New Mexico border,
spanning portions or the entirety of the 13 counties near the I -25
corridor along the Front Range. This includes the area in which
the Northwest Rail service would operate.

Joint Service Agreement

Senate Bill 24-184 (SB-184) authorized RTD, FRPRD, CDOT, and
the Colorado Transportation Investment Office (CTIO) to develop
an implementation plan for using their respective authorities to
deliver, construct, and operate passenger rail service from Denver
Union Station to Fort Collins, as the first phase of front range
passenger rail service (Joint Service). The goal of Joint Service is
to optimize operational efficiencies by combining the resources,
expertise, and funding from these agencies to address challenges
with the Northwest Rail project, such as rising costs and funding
constraints. By working together, the partners aim to deliver a
more efficient and cost-effective solution, which includes
integrating different types of rail services to meet the region’s
transportation needs.
On June 24, 2025, the RTD Board authorized the General
Manager and CEO to execute an intergovernmental agreement for
the Joint Service Executive Oversight Committee (JSEOC)
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). The IGA authorizes the
agencies to jointly pursue an access agreement with BNSF for
passenger rail service from Denver to Fort Collins. On September
9, 2025, during the inaugural meeting of the JSEOC, RTD’s
General Manager and CEO was elected as chair of the committee,
and the Deputy Executive Director of CDOT was elected as vice
chair.

Finishing FasTracks Commitment

10.1.b

Finishing FasTracks Commitment

RTD has tracked and periodically reported on changing capital
and operations cost estimates for the unfinished corridors since
voters approved the FasTracks Plan in 2004. In 2024, RTD
completed the Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study,
which estimates capital and operating costs for a limited level of
commuter service on the corridor. For this report, RTD engaged
an external consultant to update costs for the Central Corridor
Extension, the Southwest Extension, and the North Metro
Completion. These latest estimates build on design and cost
estimate work completed in 2010 for the North Metro Completion
(30% design), and 2015 for the Central Corridor Extension (15%
design) and Southwest Extension (15% design). The estimates
use the quantities estimated in 2010 and 2015 multiplied by
current unit costs. Forecasted boardings projections were based
on outputs from the DRCOG regional travel model. The model
considers numerous factors for determining ridership, including
future development patterns and the expected transportation
network along with growth in population and employment
throughout the Denver region.

The updated 2024 corridor capital costs were prepared consistent
with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) capital cost estimates
for transit capital projects; however, additional costs associated
with design changes that may be required to accommodate new
development projects along the rights-of-way or regulatory
changes related to operational safety are not included. Likewise,
assumptions about expanded fleet required to operate each
corridor assume an escalation in price over current fleet costs,
but existing fleet types are no longer in production. In addition,
changes in right-of-way costs were not fully researched due to
time limitations in preparing this report and may be undervalued.
For each corridor, costs are broken down by the FTA’s Standard
Cost Category classification for both 2015 and today.

Northwest Rail Peak Service
The Northwest Rail is unique among RTD’s commuter rail
corridors in that with completion it will not operate in an
exclusive right-of-way. RTD obtained ownership of the right-ofway for the existing six-mile B Line from Denver Union Station to
Westminster, which operates on a single-track configuration on
land purchased from the BNSF Railway. With the corridor’s
completion to Longmont, BNSF will continue to operate freight
trains on the 39-mile corridor.
Feasibility Study
In 2024, RTD completed the Northwest Rail Peak Service
Feasibility Study (Study) to assess the potential for providing
limited, commuter rail service in the corridor, a concept brought
forward by local stakeholders and RTD staff. The Study is
premised on a Peak Service Concept (PSC), as defined by
stakeholders and the Board. The PSC provides rail service
between Longmont and Denver, serving six new stations and all
existing B Line stations. The PSC proposes three trains in the
morning from Longmont to Denver Union Station and three trains
in the afternoon from Denver Union Station to Longmont.
Developing a common set of facts to inform the RTD Board of
possible next steps was a specific focus of the Study. Given the
recent completion of the Study, substantially more information is
available for this corridor than the other corridors discussed in
this report.

Senate Bill 24-184 (SB-184) authorized RTD, the Front Range
Passenger Rail District (FRPRD), CDOT, and the Colorado
Transportation Investment Office (CTIO) to develop an
implementation plan for using their respective authorities to
deliver, construct, and operate passenger rail service from
Denver Union Station to Fort Collins, as the first phase of front

Service is to combine the resources, expertise, and funding from
these agencies to address past challenges with the Northwest

working together, the partners aim to deliver a more efficient
and cost-effective solution, which includes integrating different
types of rail services to meet the region’s transportation needs.

The proposed service would use existing freight tracks, which is a
unique situation for RTD; however, many commuter rail services
throughout the country operate on freight tracks. Another unique
aspect to RTD is that this proposal would extend existing
passenger rail service on an electrified rail line (the current B
Line) to a non-electrified rail line where passenger service is not
currently offered. This scenario adds mechanical safety,
operational, and regulatory challenges in assessing the feasibility
of Northwest Rail passenger service.

Front Range Passenger Rail Coordination
In addition to the public and representatives from local
jurisdictions, RTD engaged extensively with two additional
stakeholders: BNSF and FRPRD. Working closely with BNSF
allowed the Study to address costs and regulatory requirements.
CDOT and FRPRD are concurrently developing an intercity rail
plan for service between Fort Collins and Pueblo that would share
the Northwest Corridor tracks between Denver and Longmont.
The Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study focused on the
Peak Service Concept, while the intercity rail plan has other
objectives for a more intercity-type service.

18

The intercity rail would have five stations between Longmont and
Denver, whereas the Northwest Rail Corridor has six stations. As
noted, the RTD service would provide three one-way trains
Denver-bound in the morning and three one-way trains
Longmont-bound in the afternoon.

On June 24, 2025, the RTD Board authorized the General
Manager and CEO to execute an intergovernmental agreement
for the Joint Service Executive Committee Oversight
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). The IGA authorizes the
agencies to jointly pursue an access agreement with BNSF for
passenger rail service from Denver to Fort Collins.

Completed Level of Design and
Environmental Review
The Northwest Rail Peak Service Feasibility Study built upon and
updated the review of environmental resources previously
documented in the 2010 Northwest Rail Corridor Final
Environmental Evaluation. The reviewed resources were those
that are most often included in National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) compliance and documentation. RTD contracted with
BNSF to complete 30% track design and an external consultant
to complete 10% station design to serve as the cost basis for
Northwest Rail peak service.

Other Considerations
As noted, this proposal would extend existing passenger service
on an electrified rail line (B Line) to a non-electrified rail line
where passenger service is not currently offered. Rail sidings
would be constructed for the freight trains to allow travel for the
passenger trains. A new commuter rail maintenance and storage
facility would be required near the northern end of the line.
Additionally, a layover yard for storage and light maintenance of
trains during the midday period would be required when the
trains are not in service. RTD and FRPRD have had high-level
discussions regarding the potential for a shared maintenance
facility.

Design and Environmental Review

The full North Metro corridor is an 18-mile line from Denver
Union Station to SH 7/162nd Avenue in Thornton. Most of the
completed corridor is a single-track configuration with passing
locations in five areas. The initial operating line, from Denver
Union Station to 124th•Eastlake, began revenue service in
September 2020. The corridor trains are serviced at the
Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) at 48th Ave and Fox
Street, which also services the B Line (Northwest Rail Initial
Segment), the G Line (Gold Line) and the A Line (East Corridor)
trains. Denver Transit Partners maintains the vehicles, and RTD
is responsible for operations, right-of-way maintenance and
associated operational functions for the corridor.

Right-of-Way

D

The N Line operates in the Union Pacific (UP) Boulder Branch
right-of-way, which RTD purchased from UP in 2006. As noted
above, the first phase of the current N Line service terminates at
the 124th•Eastlake Station in Thornton. The remainder of the
corridor would continue to operate within the RTD-owned UP
Boulder Branch right-of-way with additional stations at 144th and
State Highway 7 (CO 7)/162nd. While no additional right-of-way
acquisitions would be needed for the track alignment, additional
right-of-way acquisitions would be required to accommodate the
two new stations and Park-n-Rides.

Finishing FasTracks
202 5 REPORT

Design work for this future segment has been completed up to
the 30% level. Moving this project forward will require final
design and additional environmental review.

Other Considerations
RTD staff has met with City of Thornton and Adams County staff
to discuss relevant changes that could affect the corridor
completion. Staff members noted new multi-family developments
planned or under construction in the 144th Ave. Station area –
one of which could impact right-of-way needed station parking.
For the 162nd Ave. Station, staff members noted that the area
has been zoned for transit-oriented development and discussed
the potential synergy between this station and the adjacent
future CO 7 BRT station. Also, there may be opportunities to
partner with CDOT and the local communities to address
drainage issues in the CO 7 general area.

Design and Environmental Review

The Southwest Extension is a 2.5-mile double-track light rail
project that would extend the D Line from the Littleton•Mineral
Station to a new station in Highlands Ranch with a 1,000-space
Park-n-Ride. The additional station will be located near the
intersection of C-470 and Kendrick Castillo Way (formerly Lucent
Blvd).

Right-of-Way

D

RTD completed an Environmental Evaluation (EE) for the
Southwest Extension in March 2010. The EE assumed that RTD
would use the Consolidated Main Line (CML) right-of-way to
extend the corridor from its current terminus at Mineral Ave. to
C-470. RTD has a 2007 agreement with CDOT allowing for the
use of C-470 right-of-way from the CML to the corridor’s end-ofline station at Kendrick Castillo Way. RTD acquired the property
for the end-of-line station and Park-n-Ride in 2008.

Finishing FasTracks
202 5 REPORT

The RTD Board adopted the mitigation measures from the EE in
March 2010. Environmental review is largely complete for the
project, and engineering design reached approximately 30%.
Since the completion of the EE in 2010, CDOT has constructed a
flyover at the intersection of Santa Fe Drive (US 85) and C-470.
It is unclear whether the flyover configuration would affect the
2010 design developed for the EE. Further study would be
needed to determine any impacts to the corridor’s assumed
design.

Other Considerations
RTD staff has met with City of Littleton, Arapahoe and Douglas
county staffs to discuss relevant changes that could affect the
corridor completion. Primary changes identified were new
developments in the existing Littleton•Mineral Station area and
the completion of the C-470/Santa Fe interchange.

Operational Considerations

The design concept for the Central Corridor Extension, as
currently proposed, consists of an in-street running LRT
connecting the existing L Line light rail service at 30th•Downing
Station with the 38th•Blake Station on the A Line (approximately
0.8 miles). Two new stations would be constructed at
33rd•Downing and 35th•Downing.

The 2014 study found that the extension, as currently proposed,
with in-street LRT sharing the travelway with vehicular traffic,
would not operate reliably. In fact, staff was unable to write a
schedule for the proposed service due to significantly variable
travel times between 30th•Downing and 38th•Blake. Additional
study would be required to determine the final alignment and a
functional operating plan before moving this project forward.

Completed Level of Design and
Environmental Review

Other Considerations

D

RTD completed a detailed mobility study for the project in 2014,
examining several alignment and operational options for the
extension.

RTD staff has met with City and County of Denver (City) staff to
discuss relevant changes that could affect the corridor
completion. Staff noted the extensive new development on the
north end of the corridor, which could further impact operations.
Staff indicated that the City as well as residents and the area
business community still strongly support having a transit
connection between the Central Corridor’s 30th•Downing Station
terminus and the A Line 38th•Blake Station.
Denver’s Mayor Mike Johnston sent a letter, dated April 11, 2025,
to RTD General Manager and CEO Debra A. Johnson requesting
that RTD delay the portion of the Downtown Rail Replacement
Project (DRRP) to allow stakeholders an opportunity to “discuss
and evaluate options that help meet community, economic, and
mobility needs, while also fulfilling FasTracks commitments.”

US 36 Remaining Commitments

FastConnects: Increased Bus Service

The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan provided $204.1 million
for BRT in the US 36 Corridor. The original budget assumed RTD
would contribute an additional $66 million for the RTD
contribution to the high-occupancy vehicle/bus lanes (this was
prior to the decision to pursue managed lanes) along with
various upgrades to the corridor’s stations. The remainder of the
scope was left undefined. RTD did not define a specific scope for
the corridor for the following reasons:
• The joint CDOT/RTD Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
was not completed when the FasTracks Plan was under
development

The FasTracks Plan included not only the construction of rail and
bus rapid transit corridors but also increased bus service and
increased parking. Specifically, regarding the use of the sales and
use tax increase and the bond proceeds, the ballot language
states: “…to be used and spent for the construction and
operation of a fixed guide way mass transit system, the
construction of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and
improvement of existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus
service.”

• It was unknown at the time of the FasTracks Plan
development how BRT would integrate with CDOT expansion
of the highway

T
F

To implement the increased bus service component, the adopted
FasTracks Plan included “Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit”
and “Suburb to Suburb Service.” Funding for these Base System
service increases was included in the 2004 FasTracks financial
plan. Consistent with that financial plan, in January 2006, RTD
began a financial contribution from FasTracks to the Base System
bus services equivalent to 1% of total bus service hours each
year through 2020 and 1.5% per year from 2021 through 2025.
The 2004 Plan indicated that “by 2025, RTD will provide an
additional 700,000 hours of bus service annually.”

A
R

• It was assumed that construction would likely be led by
CDOT since many of the anticipated BRT elements would
share the CDOT facility

Through the 2013 Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)
process, RTD worked with stakeholders to determine the
remaining capital elements that should be included in the scope.
The RTD Board approved the final scope elements on August 28,
2013. RTD has completed a majority of the NAMS scope items;
however, several items have not been completed. They are as
follows:
• Relocation of the Church Ranch Station boarding platforms
closer to RTD-designated parking

D

• Improvements for vertical circulation (additional stairs and
elevators) on each side of the bridge at US 36/Sheridan
Station

• Construct a Park-n-Ride with structured parking on the north
(east) side of US 36 at the Broomfield Station for better
access to the station for residents north and east of US 36 in
Broomfield

Fiscal Capacity

Borrowing Capacity

RTD annually prepares updated Five-Year Financial Forecasts
(FYFF) and periodically prepares long-range financial forecasts
for the Base System and FasTracks. These comprehensive
forecasts utilize the latest cost information for ongoing operations
and maintenance, capital requirements, state-of-good-repair
funding needs, and all known related costs needed to maintain
service and keep the transit system operational while meeting
the Board’s priorities. The forecasts utilize updated projections
regarding revenue sources, including sales and use tax, farebox,
and other sources. The sales and use tax revenue forecasts use
the latest information provided by the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business.

The 1992 voter-approved Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR)
amendment to the Colorado State Constitution established a
requirement that all Colorado governments must receive voter
approval to increase taxes or issue new debt. The TABOR
requirement for voter approval applies to the issuance of bonds,
which, in RTD’s case, are issued with a pledge of repayment from
future sales and use taxes collected. The 2004 voter-approved
FasTracks initiative authorized RTD to collect an additional 0.4%
sales and use tax and authorized RTD to issue a fixed amount of
bond debt to implement the FasTracks Plan. When the
FasTracks debt fully matures in 2050, the sales and use tax rate
will decrease to the amount necessary for the continued operation
of the system but not less than 0.6%.

Additionally, other key capital, operations, and maintenance costs
illustrated herein are estimates and subject to change. Similar to
the analysis performed in the 2019 Unfinished Corridors Report,
RTD’s proposed FYFF for 2026-2030 shows no capacity for any
major capital expenditures beyond necessary state-of-goodrepair activities. Further, RTD has other constraints limiting its
ability to raise revenue as discussed herein.

202 5 REPORT

The 2004 ballot language fixed the amount of bond debt at
$3.477 billion of principal and $7.129 billion of total debt
repayment (principal plus interest). The maximum annual debt
service was capped at $309.7 million. It should be emphasized
that virtually all debt authorization for both the Base System and
FasTracks has now been exhausted, leaving no additional bond
borrowing capacity for RTD without voter approval. Based on
RTD’s current debt obligations, RTD’s remaining voter-authorized
debt issuance authority is limited to an additional $1.34 million
with a total repayment (principal and interest) limit of $2.47
million.
RTD can issue Certificates of Participation (COPs), which are a
form of a lease-purchase agreement requiring annual debt
service appropriation by the Board. While COPs are not subject to
TABOR limitations, the underlying asset being financed must be
essential to RTD's operations and free of any encumbrances,
such as federal funding. While COPs provide a potential source of
funding, this financing mechanism incurs additional costs due to
interest expense. Furthermore, the 2026-2030 FYFF has not
identified sufficient cash flow available for debt service if new
borrowings for incremental service were to be considered.

FasTracks Internal Savings Account

Denver Transit Partners Debt

In 2012, the Board created the FasTracks Internal Savings
Account (FISA) with the intent to establish a savings account for
the unfinished corridors in part by capping future enhanced bus
service to 2013 levels plus inflation using the Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for the Denver-Lakewood-Aurora area. The voterapproved FasTracks Plan does not permit FasTracks funds to be
used for Base System expenditures, except for paying for fixedroute bus or ADA service (“rubber tire” service) that would be
necessary to support the FasTracks buildout, including both new
rail and new Flatiron Flyer bus service on the US-36 BRT corridor.

The Northwest Line (B Line) to Westminster along with the East
(A Line) and Gold (G Line) lines were completed through a
Public-Private Partnership (P3) agreement with Denver Transit
Partners (DTP). To raise the necessary funding for construction,
DTP issued $398 million in Private Activity Bonds (PABs), and
RTD agreed in its CA with DTP that the monthly payment DTP
receives would include two parts: a TABOR portion, which is a
fixed monthly payment for DTP to pay debt service on the PABs,
and a monthly service payment for providing operations and
maintenance, which can change with Memorandums of Relief
(MORs) for changes in service and also has CPI factors applied
each year.

The FasTracks financing plan assumed annual growth in bus
service within RTD service area. Between 2006 and 2013, prior to
the FISA action, RTD contributed $73.5 million in FasTracks sales
and use tax revenue to rubber tire service supporting the
FasTracks buildout. However, by approximately 2013, it became
apparent that revenue service hours were not in fact growing at
the anticipated rate, and the Board opted to cap the revenue
hour growth and divert funding into the FISA. This change
created a reduction in the annual amount planned to be paid
from FasTracks to the Base System with the excess being
recorded in the FISA. The current FISA balance is approximately
$192 million, and the current balance may change based on the
proposed 2026-2030 FYFF.

T
F

The debt service portion is sometimes referred to as the TABOR
portion of the service payment, because it is a multi-year
obligation for RTD that falls under TABOR in that it used some of
the FasTracks voter-authorized debt limits. It is classified as an
Other Long-Term Liability on RTD’s balance sheet.

A
R

D

It was estimated that between 2014 and 2025, $342.3 million in
total would have been available for enhanced bus service without
the FISA action. The $342 million equates to approximately 1
million revenue service hours. For comparison, this is not quite
half of the 2025 total service hours.

RTD Reserve Funds

Although RTD’s proposed 2026-2030 FYFF shows that RTD
projects to end 2030 with an estimated $795 million in available
reserves, most of these reserves are encumbered for specific
items not captured within the FYFF horizon. RTD has several
types of reserve funds, including:
• The Capital Replacement Fund is expected to be fully
utilized by 2031.

•

The Operating Reserve reflects three months of operating
expense (anticipated to be $266M in 2030), is required per
the Board-approved fiscal policy to establish an operating
stabilization reserve to ensure services can be delivered
during unforeseen circumstances, particularly due to the
volatility of sales and use tax collections comprising more
than 70% of RTD’s revenue sources.

•

The Unrestricted Reserve, is planned to be largely depleted
by 2030 for repayment of agency debt and for expanding
service as outlined in the current the System Optimization
Plan, which identifies service enhancements through 2027.

Corridor Costs and Funding Strategies

10.1.b

Potential Sources of Additional Revenue
In addition to requiring RTD to prioritize the completion of the
Northwest Rail and North Metro corridors, SB-230 imposes new
oil and gas production fees to be used to expand transit service,
frequency, ridership, and fund passenger rail projects. The
Colorado Energy Office (CEO) Clean Transit Enterprise will
disburse the funds into the following three categories:
1. Local Transit Operations Formula Program (70%)
2. Rail Funding Program for passenger rail projects (20%)
3. Local Transit Competitive Grant Program (10%)
The Clean Transit Enterprise funds are estimated to reach
approximately $116.3 million by fiscal year 2026-2027, with that
amount decreasing to approximately $90 million per year in FY
2028 through FY 2030. RTD recognizes that there will be
competing statewide needs for this funding and understands that
revenue amounts may vary depending on production. RTD
expects to benefit greatly from these programs to sustain and
expand operations of the existing system. However, only the
20% Rail Funding Program ($18 million per year after 2028)
presents a clear alignment with the Northwest Rail and North
Metro corridors, and only a portion of that program will be
available to RTD.

Federal Funding: Capital Investment
Grants Program
The New Starts program is a nationwide, competitive grant
program intended to help fund fixed guideway (rail and bus)
transit projects.

T
F

The New Starts program is a rigorous, multi-step, multi-year
process of project development and review intended to assure
the strongest transit projects nationally are selected for federal
funding. The FTA uses a variety of project justification and
financial readiness measures to rank candidate projects against
minimum criteria and tracks the progress of projects annually
through their program toward the award of a Full Funding Grant
Agreement. Over the past decade, the FTA has provided most
successful projects nationally with roughly 50% of the total
project cost through the New Starts grant program.

R

Average annual revenue (2026 to 2034): $90 million

D

Potential amount available to FasTracks: a subset of
the Rail Funding Program, which is expected to be

SB-184: Support Surface Transportation
Infrastructure Development

SB-184 authorizes the Colorado Transportation Investment Office
(CTIO) to impose a congestion impact fee on short-term vehicle
rentals at up to $3.00 per day. CTIO would allocate funding for
statewide multimodal transportation options, including rail
projects. Legislative economists estimated that approximately
$58 million in new revenues will be collected by fiscal year 20252026, increasing to $80 million by 2035-2036. Similar to SB-230,
these funds can be used for projects statewide, with an even
broader range of eligible multimodal projects. The program has
not yet established a mechanism for distributing funds. RTD will
continue to monitor the status of the program and will engage
with CTIO on potential allocations if and when the funds become
available.

RTD’s 2004 Plan assumed that three corridors, the East, West,
and Gold rail lines, would seek New Starts funding from the FTA.
This assumption was based on the assessment at the time that
these corridors were the strongest in terms of project justification
when measured against the FTA’s then-current criteria.
The 2004 FasTracks Financial Plan projected that RTD would be
successful in obtaining FTA discretionary New Starts grant
funding totaling $815 million. RTD was successful in the pursuit
of Full Funding Grant Agreements for each of those three
targeted corridors, ultimately receiving more federal funding than
expected in the FasTracks Financial Plan. In 2009, the FTA
awarded $309 million for the West Corridor (44% of project
cost), and in 2011 the FTA awarded $1.03 billion for the East and
Gold rail lines in a combined Full Funding Grant Agreement for
the Eagle P3 project (52% of project cost for the “federalized”
portion of the project).
Additionally, in 2012/2013 RTD applied to the FTA for funding for
the Southeast Rail Extension under the Capital Investment Grants
program after determining the potential eligibility of this project
under the FTA’s updated rules and criteria. In 2016, RTD
successfully completed the multi-year process with the FTA and
was awarded a Small Starts Construction Grant for the Southeast
Rail Extension for $92 million (43% of project cost). The FTA’s
Small Starts grant program is similar to the New Starts program
but is intended to assist with funding projects that fall below
certain total cost ($300 million) and federal share ($100 million)
thresholds and intended to streamline the process.

Average annual revenue (2026 to 2034): $70 million
Potential amount available to FasTracks: Unknown, but
broad eligibility limits potential allocation.

10.1.b

In total, through 2018, the FTA has awarded RTD more than
$1.4 billion in funding through these grants, exceeding the
original 2004 plan of $815 million by approximately $615 million.
RTD has continued to explore viability of the Capital Investment
Grants (CIG) program (New Starts, Small Starts, and Core
Capacity) for FasTracks projects that are not yet under
construction. Nationally, the program is more oversubscribed
than it has ever been, with over $38 billion required to fund
projects that have already qualified for the CIG program.

For this report, RTD analyzed the likelihood that the four
remaining guideway components—Central Rail Extension, North
Metro Completion, Northwest Rail Line, and Southwest Rail
Extension—would qualify for the CIG program based on current
criteria. Assuming a 2034 target date for submittal of these
projects, staff completed all necessary calculations to determine
the rating each project would likely receive and determined that
none would likely qualify for CIG funding.

The State Legislature created the Multimodal Transportation and
Mitigation Options Fund (MMOF) in 2018. The legislation provided
a one-time allocation of state funding for the program. Senate
Bill 2021-160 expanded the goals of the program and dedicated a
significant portion of the State’s American Rescue Plan Act
(ARPA) funds in addition to generating annual state revenues for
the program. MMOF provides funding for various transportation
projects, including bicycle, pedestrian, and transit initiatives, as
well as Greenhouse Gas reduction efforts. The MMOF is funded
by state dollars primarily from the state’s retail delivery fee
revenues and General Fund transfers. Eligible projects range
from capital construction and operating costs for transit to
transportation demand management programs and multimodal
mobility projects.

Other Federal, State and Local
Government Programs

In addition to the large-scale Capital Investment Grants (CIG)
program, RTD has an extensive history of pursuing a wide
variety of other federal, state, and local grant opportunities to
support its capital projects and operating needs. Since 2009,
RTD has submitted 198 applications to numerous grant
programs, requesting approximately $1.37 billion in total
funding. Of these requests, 70 applications were successful,
resulting in the award of over $218 million. These awards have
come from a diverse array of funding partners, including FTA,
CDOT, and DRCOG.

A
R

SB 2021-260

26

In the Denver region the funds are awarded through DRCOG.
The grant awards require a 50% local match. Currently, all
MMOF dollars for the Denver region are programmed through
fiscal year 2029. For the period 2030 through 2032 – when the
program is expected to end – DRCOG has estimated that
approximately $30 million total will be available for the region.
In an optimistic scenario, RTD could be awarded
approximately one-third of that funding amounting to $10
million for the unfinished corridors. RTD will continue to
monitor future Transportation Improvement Program (TIP)
cycles to pursue this funding source.

This grant history demonstrates RTD’s institutional capacity
and experience in navigating complex and competitive funding
processes. However, it also contextualizes the scale of the
funding challenge for the remaining FasTracks corridors. While
these grant programs are a vital component of a
comprehensive financial strategy, they are unlikely to provide
the magnitude of funding necessary to close the entire
financial gap for completing the system. Therefore, these
opportunities represent an important but supplementary
funding source that must be leveraged alongside other, more
substantial financial mechanisms.

However, the financial challenge is even greater than these
numbers suggest:
• The $1.6 billion construction cost is in 2024 dollars and
does not account for future inflation. The actual cost to
build the corridors will be much higher.
• The $441 million in available funding is an optimistic
estimate. It assumes a larger share of statewide funds will
be allocated to FasTracks than is likely.

Potential Sources of Additional Revenue

10.1.b

While RTD has completed a substantial portion of the FasTracks
program, outstanding commitments remain. An examination of
RTD’s financial condition indicates that unless a new funding
source can be identified, between now and 2034, RTD expects to
have only FISA funds available for new construction which would
not be enough to cover any of the remaining corridors.
RTD’s proposed 2026-2030 FYFF shows that RTD does not have
significant available reserves in the 2026-2030 timeframe, and
capital reserves will be needed to fund significant expenditures in
the early 2030s for large-scale vehicle procurements, i.e., light
rail vehicle replacements in 2032 totaling $800 million to $1
billion; bus replacements totaling $234 million; and ongoing light
rail reconstruction efforts estimated at $250 million. Also, RTD’s
Unrestricted Reserve is planned to be depleted by 2030 for
repayment of agency debt and for state of good repair efforts.

one year needed to complete final design. Depending on the
corridor, construction of each corridor would likely span two to
three years. Construction of multiple corridors simultaneously will
present challenges with labor and construction materials
availability. Should there be challenges with any of the stages of
project development or if there were a significant economic
downturn, the timeframe for full Plan completion could be
extended beyond 2034.

T
F

Depending on the funding secured for capital investments, RTD
will also need funding for the operations and maintenance of the
corridors. As the table below illustrates, annual operating costs
and capital replacement require a significant stream of ongoing
funding.
The cost estimates provided in this report are a snapshot of
current costs. Commodity and labor costs have been extremely
volatile over the last several years, and costs associated with the
corridor buildouts will change as higher levels of design are
completed. Also, depending on actions at the federal level, such
as the imposition of new tariffs, the costs of certain materials
may rise further, thereby raising construction costs beyond
current estimates.

A

Funding from the SB-260, SB-230, and SB-184 programs could
potentially contribute toward limited plan completion. RTD
recognizes that funding for these programs may be variable and
that the funds are intended to be allocated statewide, in which
case RTD would be required to compete for these funds against
other state needs. Also, RTD Board action would be required to
authorize the release of the FISA funds and the construction of
any of the corridors would require SB-208 review by DRCOG.

Should funding become available for construction, time would be

Introduction and Program Overview
This initial report has been prepared by RTD staff as the first of a proposed series of detailed

explore the construction and operation of a Peak Service Plan in the Northwest Corridor. A copy

T
F

of that Resolution is attached as Appendix A. That Resolution identifies four corridors and

extensions that have not been completed as of this date, nor have funds for their completion
been identified or committed: 1) the Northwest Corridor from Westminster to Longmont; 2) the

North Metro Corridor from 124th Avenue to State Highway 7; 3) the Central Corridor Extension
from 30th and Downing to 38th and Blake; and 4) the Southwest Corridor Extension from Mineral
to C-470 and Lucent. Collectively, these projects were identified as the “Unfinished Corridors” in
the Board Resolution.

A
R

The April 16, 2019 Board Resolution directs “RTD staff to investigate and research all
reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and operation of the Unfinished Corridors and
creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a
report to the Board . . . outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward on these
Unfinished Corridors.” Additionally, that Resolution directs RTD staff to report to the Board

“outlining proposed steps appropriately moving forward on the [Peak Service] Plan.” (Appendix

D

A, April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)

The ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and illustrative,
laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive dialogue with the
voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most promising of these can be
further refined and pursued. As indicated above, this is the initial report to the Board regarding
these matters. As directed, this report identifies proposed steps to be taken in order to
accomplish the will of the Board. Over time, following the collaborative communications that will
take place, especially with the Board, RTD staff will refine these steps in order to present
further reports addressing “reasonable cost-savings measures for construction and operation of
the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for the same as expeditiously as
reasonably possible,” and “will proceed in a commercially reasonable manner to explore,
analyze, fund and facilitate construction and operation of the Peak Service Plan.” (Appendix A,
April 16, 2019 Resolution, paragraphs 1 and 2.)
The Board should note that the sales and use tax forecasts used in preparing the financial
scenarios in this report are based on the latest CU Leeds School of Business forecasts, and will
change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to
change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD Mid-Term Financial Plan, Long-Range

responses to the RTD Board of Directors’ Resolution Number 004, Series of 2019, adopted on
April 16, 2019, addressing this agency’s continuing commitment to complete FasTracks and to

10.1.b

Financial Plan and Budget. Also, as further explained in the FasTracks Funding Scenarios section
of this report, the Base System unrestricted fund balance under all scenarios presented is
are estimates and also subject to change. Of particular note, for the purpose of the Northwest

T
F

Rail Peak Service Plan, RTD has updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost estimates using an
approach that we believe is conservative, however, as described in the Northwest Rail Peak

Service Plan section of this report, these order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided
by, nor reviewed by, the BNSF railroad.

The June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” (included as Appendix B)

provides: an overview of the Program; a brief history of progress, challenges and key decision-

A
R

points; a summary of the current status; and a financial overview. That document provides

detail on the variety of factors that impacted the FasTracks Program in the years between voter
approval in 2004 and today, including those highlighted in the Board Resolution: “(a) the

requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and new signal systems and
commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that all but one of the trains be electric-

powered rather than diesel-powered; (c) additional EIS and local government drainage and

traffic requirements; (d) an increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased

D

costs for construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009” (Appendix A, April
16, 2019 Resolution, sixth Whereas clause.)

To repeat, this will be an iterative process. This initial report is intended to provide an overview
of the issues, a background and history of the FasTracks project, an assessment of the current
situation, a series of possible funding scenarios, a discussion of creative funding options, and
supporting Appendices. With the benefit of Board consideration and further input, RTD staff will
continue in the refinement of these proposed steps and will regularly report back to the Board
for information, guidance and approval.

Background
The 2004 FasTracks Plan (Appendix C) and ballot language (Appendix D) included more than
Regarding the use of the sales and use tax increase and the bond proceeds the ballot language
states: “…to be used and spent for the construction and operation of a fixed guide way mass

T
F

transit system, the construction of additional park-n-ride lots, the expansion and improvement
of existing park-n-ride lots, and increased bus service ” (emphasis added).
To implement the increased bus service component, the adopted FasTracks Plan included the
following enhancements: “Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit”; and “Suburb to Suburb

Service”. Funding for these Base System service increases was included in the 2004 FasTracks

A
R

financial plan. Consistent with that financial plan, in January 2006, RTD began a financial
contribution from FasTracks to the Base System bus services equivalent to 1% of total bus
service hours each year, anticipated to continue through 2020. The intent was that the
contribution would increase starting in 2021 to 1½ % per year through 2025.
On December 18, 2012, the RTD Board of Director’s voted to fund the FasTracks Internal

Savings Account (FISA) in part by capping future enhanced bus service to 2013 levels plus

inflation (CPI). Between 2006 and 2013, prior to the FISA action, $73.5 million in total was
contributed for this service. It is estimated that between 2014 and 2025, $396 million in total
would have been used for enhanced bus service without the FISA action. In the absence of

D

change in the FISA policy, $230 million will have been provided for this enhanced bus service by
2025. The difference of $166 million will have instead been redirected to the FISA.
The 2019 Adopted Budget includes a FISA contribution of $13.4 million in 2019 based on this
bus service cap. This funding equates to approximately 133,000 revenue service hours. For
comparison this is approximately equivalent to the current service levels of: the routes 15 and
16; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 100, 128 and 130.
By 2025, the contribution to the FISA is estimated to increase to $21.7 million. This funding
equates to approximately 185,000 revenue service hours. For comparison, this is approximately
equivalent to the 2019 service levels of: the routes 15, 16 and 31; OR the routes 73, 76, 88, 92,
100, 120, 128, 130, and 169; OR all local service in Boulder.
The following table provides FasTracks Program costs through 2020, including those expended
through 2018 and the total capital costs committed through 2020, the year service is scheduled
to start on the North Metro line to 124th Avenue, the final corridor for which to date funding has
been identified.

Southwest Extension

The Southwest Extension is a 2.5-mile double track LRT project that would extend the C and D
lines from the existing Mineral Station to a new station with a 1,000-space Park-n-Ride lot. The
additional station will be located near the C-470 & Lucent Blvd. intersection in Highlands Ranch.
An Environmental Evaluation (EE) was completed for the Southwest Extension in March of 2010
and the RTD Board adopted the mitigation measures from the EE. Limited activity on this
project is currently underway; the District recently made a financial contribution to access

North Metro Completion

The entire North Metro project envisioned in the FasTracks Plan consists of an 18-mile Electric
Multiple Unit (EMU) corridor going from DUS to SH 7/162nd Avenue. The majority of the
corridor is single track with passing locations in five areas along the corridor. The initial

operating line, from DUS to 124th/Eastlake, is anticipated to begin revenue service in 2020. The

project will utilize the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility (CRMF) at 41st and Fox Street, which

A
R

will be shared with NWES, the Gold Line and the East Corridor with Denver Transit Partners

maintaining the vehicles and RTD responsible for operations, right-of-way maintenance and

associated operational functions. The project will also share the substations (at Argo---Gold Line
and Sandown—East Corridor) with the EAGLE project.

The first phase of the project terminates at the 124th/Eastlake Station. Completion of the
project north of 124th Avenue as envisioned in the FasTracks Plan will result in additional

stations at 144th and SH 7/162nd. Design work for this future segment was completed up to the

D

30 percent level; additional environmental review and mitigations will also be necessary. Moving
this project forward will require identification of operating and capital cost funding as shown in
the table above.

Central Rail Extension

The project, as currently proposed, consists of in-street running LRT connecting the existing L
Line light rail service at 30th and Downing with the 38th and Blake Station on the University of
Colorado A Line (approximately 0.8 mile). Two new stations would be constructed at
33rd/Downing and 35th/Downing. Now referred to as the L Line Extension, the project would
provide rail service between downtown Denver and the 38th & Blake Station, and complete the
“loop” around downtown.

RTD completed a detailed mobility study for the project in 2014, examining several options.
During the study effort, it became clear that the project as currently proposed – in-street LRT
sharing the travelway with vehicular traffic – would operate unreliably. In fact, staff was unable
to write a schedule for the proposed service due to significantly variable travel times between
30th/Downing and 38th/Blake.

Packet Pg. 83

reached approximately 30 percent. Moving the project forward will require identification of

10.1.b

Based on that analysis, RTD is now working closely with the City and County of Denver as part
of Denver’s downtown transportation planning efforts to define a project that would meet the

capital costs funding, likely in the range shown on the table above, would need to be identified.

T

Northwest Rail
In order to ready the Northwest Rail (NWR) corridor for final design and construction, RTD

completed an Environmental Evaluation (EE) in 2010. Operational analysis conducted during the
EE found that the maximum service that could be provided, given capacity constraints at

Denver Union Station, would be 30-minute frequencies. The EE recommended 30-minute peak
service and one-hour off-peak service, which would provide 55 one-way trips per day. The EE
estimated the corridor cost at approximately $1 billion in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars
depending on how many stations were included in the corridor, as identified below.

A
R

The original FasTracks plan assumed eight stations, including Denver Union Station, as follows:
•

Longmont

•

Gunbarrel, Boulder

•

Boulder Junction

•

Downtown Louisville

•

Flatiron, Broomfield

•

Church Ranch, Westminster

•

Westminster Station

•

During the EE process, local stakeholders requested four additional stations for the corridor as
follows:
•

Twin Peaks, Longmont

•

East Boulder at 63rd and Arapahoe

•

116th Avenue, Broomfield

•

BNSF Preliminary Engineering
It is informative to understand that the NWR corridor envisions passenger operations on track
through the corridor. This shared track arrangement will require the use of passenger trains
that are compliant with the Federal Railroad Administration’s crash-worthiness standards. It also

T
F

means that RTD will need to continue to closely coordinate with the BNSF and to pay the
railroad for access and improvements to their infrastructure (tracks, signals, PTC, Quiet Zones
etc.).

To this end, RTD and BNSF have been working together on this project for over 15 years.
Beginning in 2003 the parties finalized a Letter of Understanding followed by a Memorandum of

Understating (MOU) in 2009 and a Contract Agreement in 2010. Through the Contract
Agreement RTD paid BNSF $86 million for the right-of-way and relocations in the segment from
Union Station to Pecos Street, and $9 million for the segment from Pecos to 72ndAvenue
(Westminster Station). The Contract Agreement included NWR Segment 1 from Union Station to

A
R

the Westminster Station. The completion of this contract allowed the Eagle P3 project to
proceed, including construction of the B line from Denver Union Station to the Westminster
Station. Additionally, in 2011, RTD paid BNSF $650,000 through a Planning and Support

Agreement to prepare 30% design plans and evaluate operating assumptions for Segment 2

D

(Westminster Station to Longmont) based on two operating scenarios provided by RTD as
follows:
•

Scenario 1: Peak-Only Service, 18 trips per day, bi-directional service, 20-minute peak
period/peak direction headways, DUS to Longmont, no weekend service;

•

Scenario 2: Opening Day Service, 55 trips per day, bi-directional service, 30-minute peak
headways/60-minute off-peak headways, weekdays, DUS to Longmont, hourly service
on weekends.

Capital Costs provided by the BNSF as part of this work included upfront costs for purchasing
operating time slots in perpetuity, including double tracking the entire corridor, but not annual
Operating and Maintenance (O&M) costs.
The BNSF cost estimates were as follows:
•

Scenario 1:

$410 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

•

Scenario 2:

$535 million capital (2011 dollars, unescalated)

Northwest Area Mobility Study

In response to the financial challenges RTD faced in delivering the full FasTracks program as

documented in the June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” (Appendix
B), RTD, in collaboration with the Northwest area stakeholders, completed the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) in August 2014. The intent of NAMS was to examine several key items in
the Study area. Three of those areas of analysis were directly related to the NWR corridor and
the findings from the final report found the following:

•

D

•

Louisville

•

Boulder Transit Village

•

Downtown Longmont

1. Confirm the cost to complete the Northwest Rail:

The cost to complete the NWR corridor from Westminster to Longmont ranged from $1.2 to
$1.4 billion (2013 dollars). This estimate was consistent with previous cost estimates.
2. Evaluate feasibility and cost of constructing the Northwest Rail in segments:
The study evaluated the possibility of operational/service and construction phasing options
along the Northwest Rail Line from the current terminus of the B line at Westminster Station
to Longmont. Phasing segments that were evaluated included:
116th St/Broomfield

These segments were selected based on a careful examination of technical considerations
including an understanding of BNSF operational requirements to co-exist in this corridor.
The phases outlined were reasonable segments for building the NW Rail project at some

2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) estimated the total corridor cost to be $1.035 billion

point in the future. BNSF, while not an active participant in the study, did provide a list of
conditions for their further engagement in regard to allowing for the necessary rail

analysis assumed a 30 minute peak and 60 minute off-peak service plan.

T
F

The phasing considerations included avoiding grades greater than 1% and avoiding
impacts to BNSF, including accommodating their need to have 10,000 feet of “chambering”
or storage track at the end of the phased segment of commuter rail.

Along with the phasing considerations, RTD also conducted a funding analysis to determine
the availability of FasTracks revenue to support a phased build-out of the corridor. The
analysis indicated that while phasing could provide incremental buildout of the corridor,
any FasTracks funding would still be beyond the 2035 timeframe. The Northwest Area
stakeholders and RTD, after careful consideration of study results, determined that given

A
R

the funding challenges and accompanying near-term inability to secure a railroad
agreement, the completion of the Northwest Rail was no longer a viable near-term goal for
the corridor. The costs, ridership, annual cost per trip and travel time for each segment
from NAMS are summarized in the table below:

F

would not be served by this alignment; and, the alignment was not in the original FasTracks
plan. Furthermore, the proposed alignments contained segments outside the District
boundary.

As part of NAMS, the stakeholders developed a Consensus Statement for prioritizing future
activities in the Northwest area. One request from the stakeholders was for RTD to provide

A
R

an annual update on the status of the Northwest Rail and any activities that have occurred
to advance the rail forward. On May 22, 2014, the Board approved Resolution No. 006,
which accepted the stakeholder Consensus Statement for prioritization of future activities in
the Northwest area, subject to future Board consideration.

Peak Service Plan

In 2017, acknowledging the NAMS findings that the potential to phase service by segment is
not financially viable in the near-term, the local jurisdictional stakeholders requested that
RTD evaluate a limited, starter commuter service so as to reduce potential capital costs as
much as possible. In response, working closely with the local jurisdictional stakeholders,

D

RTD has developed a potential starter commuter service plan for the corridor – the Peak
Service Plan. The proposed service would be as follows:
•

The projected travel time from Longmont to Union Station would be approximately 66

In support of this report, RTD has also updated the order-of-magnitude capital cost

estimates for the NWR Peak Service Plan using an approach that we believe is conservative.
These updated cost estimates are based on actual commuter rail cost experience for the
Eagle and North Metro projects and on the cost information provided by BNSF through the
2011 work described in this report (which is substantially different from the current NWR

Peak Service Plan). These order-of-magnitude estimates have not been provided by, nor
reviewed by, the BNSF railroad. The NWR Peak Service Plan capital cost estimate is $708.2
million (2018 dollars).

A
R

RTD has also estimated that the incremental cost for completing the full NWR corridor (at a
date subsequent to the initiation of NWR Peak Service Plan) to provide the full level of

service identified in the 2010 Environmental Evaluation (55 trips/day) would be
approximately $871 million (2018 dollars). The total capital cost estimate for first instituting

NWR Peak Service and then subsequently instituting full NWR service, then, is $1.579 billion
(2018 dollars), which is higher than the estimated capital cost estimate for constructing the
NWR full service scenario at $1.5 billion (2018 dollars) because of the costs associated with
updating planning, environmental, and engineering work, as well as mobilization and

D

additional construction costs associated with building the corridor in two phases.
RTD’s operating and maintenance cost estimate for the Peak Service Plan scenario is $14
million per year (2018 dollars), while the cost estimate for the NWR full service scenario is
$20.6 million per year (2018 dollars).

Since 2017, RTD has continued to discuss and analyze the NWR Peak Service Plan with
stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the related opportunities and challenges. To
this end, in the summer of 2018, RTD submitted a letter to the BNSF requesting feedback
on the Peak Service Plan. Subsequently, RTD has sent periodic status requests to BNSF and
based on their most recent response, we understand that the railroad is working on a
formal response which will include their feedback on the proposal.

FasTracks Funding Scenarios
Introduction and Modeling Assumptions
System and FasTracks. These comprehensive forecasts utilize the latest cost information for
ongoing operations and maintenance, capital commitments, State of Good Repair funding needs

T
F

and all related costs needed to maintain service and keep the transit system operational while
meeting the Board of Directors’ priorities. Similarly, the forecasts utilize updated forecasts
regarding all revenue sources, including sales and use tax, farebox, grant revenues and other

sources. Specifically, the sales and use tax revenue forecasts use the latest information (March

2019) provided by the CU Leeds School of Business. These sales and use tax forecasts will
change as future updates are prepared for RTD. Similarly, the financial scenarios are subject to

A
R

change with Board adoption later this year of a new RTD mid-term Financial Plan, long range
financial plan and 2020 budget. Additionally, other key inputs such as Unfinished Corridor
capital and O&M costs are estimates and also subject to change. As documented in the
previously referenced June 2018 “FasTracks Program Overview – Executive Summary” and in

various financial updates to the RTD Board of Directors and to stakeholders and the public, RTD
does not forecast the capacity to proceed with any FasTracks capital investments in the near to
mid-term horizon. Nothing in the intervening time has changed to improve these forecasts.

D

Recognizing these financial constraints, RTD staff has prepared ten FasTracks funding scenarios
with differing assumptions regarding the timing of delivery of Unfinished Corridor projects and
regarding the construct of potential future TABOR elections in support of the preparation of this
report. These scenarios extend the financial planning horizon to the year 2050, consistent with
the horizons for the Transportation Transformation (T2) Comprehensive Plan and DRCOG’s
upcoming Regional Transportation Plan.
The forecasts and conclusions presented in this section focus on the FasTracks financial plan.
The related financial forecasts for the RTD Base System for these scenarios have not been
optimized; however, the Base System unrestricted fund balances under these scenarios is
negative between 2021 and 2049. This means that: 1) no Base System Funds are available to
support funding of FasTracks projects; 2) no Base System Funds are available to loan to
FasTracks projects, even if it where permissible to make such loans; and 3) during this
extended period, there will be no capacity to support Base System bus or rail service increases.
In fact, if the negative balances cannot be resolved, there may be the need to cut levels of Base
System bus and light rail service throughout the District. All scenarios are based on the capital
and annual operating and maintenance costs described previously in this report. All revenue,
cost, bonding and associated projections are stated in inflated (year of expenditure) dollars. All

scenarios also assume ongoing operations and maintenance, including vehicle replacements and
capital maintenance, consistent with expected useful life, of all currently open and committed

Scenarios 1a and 1b: No New Bonding Authority or Funding

T
F

These Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and use tax authorization (0.4%)

and bonding authority with no new or additional FasTracks bonding authority nor any additional
sales and use tax funds. They do assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required
replacement of previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when
each of the Unfinished Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M

cost estimates contained in this report. Neither scenario allows for completion of the Unfinished
Corridors by the year 2050.

A
R

Scenario 1a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2039, the Southwest Extension in 2040 and the North Metro
Completion in 2041. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding to finish either the NWR
Peak Service Plan or the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

D

Scenario 1b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042. No other corridors can be completed within the 2050
horizon under this scenario.

Scenarios 2a, 2b and 2c: TABOR election for Additional Bonding
Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios assume the existing 2004 FasTracks sales and
use tax authorization (0.4%), but they also assume that a TABOR election is held prior to 2032
authorizing additional bonding authority. Similar to Scenarios 1a and 1b, these Scenarios also
assume Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of previously
purchased FasTracks vehicles. These scenarios identify if and when each of the Unfinished
Corridors can be opened for operation based on the capital and O&M cost estimates contained
in this report.

Scenario 2a sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first in
order to accelerate as many of the projects as possible. This scenario results in completion of
the Central Extension in 2037, the Southwest Extension in 2038, the North Metro Completion in
2039 and the NWR Peak Service Plan in 2048. Under this scenario there is not sufficient funding
to finish the NWR Full Service plan by 2050.

FasTracks projects.

10.1.b

Scenario 2b sequences the NWR Peak Service Plan first. The earliest that this project could be
opened for service is in the year 2042 in this scenario. Under Scenario 2b, the Central Extension

to finish the NWR Full Service Plan by 2050.

T
F

Scenario 2c tests the capacity to finish the NWR Full Service plan given the assumptions
identified. In this case, the NWR Full Service plan corridor could be completed by 2046. Under
this set of assumptions, no other Unfinished Corridor could be completed by the year 2050.

Scenarios 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e: TABOR election with Bonding and Sales Tax

A
R

Increase
These Scenarios assume that a TABOR election is held in 2021 authorizing both additional sales
and use tax rates and revenue and additional bonding authority starting in 2022. None of these
Scenarios require Certificate of Participation (COP) funding for required replacement of
previously purchased FasTracks vehicles. All of these scenarios provide for the completion of all
of the Unfinished Corridors prior to the year 2040.
Scenario 3a assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (one-tenth of a penny). It sequences
the NWR Peak Service Plan first, followed by the remaining Unfinished Corridors starting with

D

the least expensive corridor next. It is designed to strike a balance between delivering the
Unfinished Corridors quickly while also minimizing the number and size of debt issuances to
support project delivery. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service Plan in
2026, followed by the Central Extension in 2027, the Southwest Extension in 2032, and the
North Metro Completion in 2035. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service
plan by 2039.

Scenario 3b assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase (again, one-tenth of a penny). It
sequences the Unfinished Corridors starting with the least expensive corridor first, finishing with
construction of the NWR Full Service plan. Under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not
funded with the objective of completing the all Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an
expeditious manner. This scenario allows completion of the Central Extension in 2026, the
Southwest Extension in 2027, the North Metro Completion in 2028 and the NWR Full Service
Plan in 2032.
Scenario 3c assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase. Scenario 3c is a variation on Scenario
3a where the key distinction is an acceleration of the projects accomplished by issuing more
bonds and assuming more debt. This scenario results in completion of the NWR Peak Service

increase at 0.15% (less than one-seventh of a penny). This scenario results in completion the

Central Extension in 2026, the Southwest Extension in 2027, and the North Metro Completion in
2028. It also provides for the completion of the NWR Full Service plan by 2032. Similar to
Scenario 3b, under this scenario the NWR Peak Service Plan is not funded with the objective of

completing all the Unfinished Corridors in their entirety in an expeditious manner. This scenario
would also allow funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to support Base System
priorities and needs.

A
R

Scenario 3e assumes a 0.1% sales and use tax increase and is another variation of Scenario 3b.
It tests a three year delay in the delivery of each of the Unfinished Corridors, allowing both for
larger FasTracks fund balances and for funds from the sales and use tax increase to be used to
support Base System priorities and needs. It would allow for the opening of the Central
Extension in 2029, the Southwest Extension in 2030, the North Metro Completion in 2031 and
the NWR Full Service plan in 2035.

The core assumptions and results of each scenario are presented in the table below. More
detailed financial information and associated cash-flow charts are provided as Appendix E. Also,

In addition to the FasTracks funding scenarios described in the previous section, other
options are also worth considering. This section presents a wide array of these potential

T
F

options. For many, either legislative action or an election under the auspices of TABOR
would be required. RTD staff (with contributions from consultants, stakeholders, and
lobbyists) present these to demonstrate the wide variety of tools available, without
attempting to consider the political viability nor the pros and cons.

1. Federal New Starts and Small Starts grants (Capital Investment Grant Program):

For a detailed description of the eligibility of the Unfinished Corridors, please see
the section immediately following entitled “Summary of Federal New Starts or

A
R

Small Starts Grant Analysis for Unfinished FasTracks Corridors”.

2. Federal loan/finance options: similar to the scenarios described in the previous
sections, all of these would require repayment and TABOR election authorization.
These options include:
•

TIFIA (Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act): RTD
previously utilized this funding source for the US 36 BRT project.

D
•

RRIF (Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing): This funding
source was among those utilized for Denver Union Station.

•

Private activity bonds (originally authorized with the SAFETEA-LU
authorization): These would require a private partner arrangement.

•

Transit GARVEEs (Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicles). These are bonds
secured by future transit apportionments, and have been considered by
RTD on previous occasions.

3. Stakeholder Cash Contributions or Loans/Private Equity Contributions or Loans:
with the exception of stakeholder cash contributions, all of these would require
repayment and TABOR election authorization. These options include:
•

Stakeholder Cash Contributions: RTD has previously used this funding
mechanism. Most recently, RTD received a $25 million stakeholder
contribution on the SERE project. RTD has received cash contributions on
other projects but most of the time the contribution is associated with
stakeholder betterments.

•

T
F

Private Equity Contributions: The private entity will require repayment

and RTD will need to have borrowing authority and would be subject to a
TABOR election. If RTD had borrowing authority, it is likely that RTD
could issue tax-exempt debt at a lower cost than accepting private equity
contributions. RTD utilized this financing mechanism in the Eagle project.
4. Tolled roadway facilities:
•

A
R

There is precedent to direct toll revenues from a highway corridor that is

parallel to a rail project. One recent example is the Metropolitan
Washington Airports Authority (MWAA), which is funding the construction
of the Silver Line to Dulles Airport in northern Virginia (for WMATA).
•

Tolls not predicated on a parallel facility can be directed to fund transit.
One example is the Pennsylvania Turnpike Authority, which issues $400
million in toll-backed bonds each year for transit including SEPTA in
Philadelphia and the Port Authority in Pittsburgh.

D
•

Congestion pricing in the urban core could potentially be directed to
transit purposes. For example, tolled access to lower Manhattan is slated
to begin in 2021 with funding directed to MTA. London, Singapore and
Stockholm already have congestion pricing in place with funding directed
to transit purposes.

5. VMT (Vehicle Miles Travelled) tax on vehicular travel: this option has been
discussed (typically as an alternative to sales tax) on a statewide level during
previous Colorado transportation funding initiatives, but never placed before
voters for consideration.
6. Parking charges: these would be governed by state legislative restrictions and
RTD policies. Potential locations include:
•

RTD park-and-ride lots. The District completed and presented to the
Board an initial examination of daily parking charges for all users in 2016.
The Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan will provide an
opportunity to revisit this option.

8. Fees for access to anonymized RTD trip data. The District could explore
monetization of data desired by private entities, while simultaneously providing
user privacy and cybersecurity.

R

9. Property tax (one form of value capture): A special assessment district for value
capture purposes could be established to include commercial properties along a
project corridor. One example is the Dulles corridor, where commercial
properties along the, where commercial properties will generate $750 million to
fund the construction of the Silver Line project.
10. Development impact fees: after establishing boundaries adjacent to a transit

corridor, one-time impact fees could be collected on new development to help
find a nearby transit project.

D

11. Marijuana tax: RTD could explore an increased share of revenues collected
within RTD boundaries.
12. State-level transit and rail funds:
•

A potential future physical tie-in between the RTD rail system and a
future statewide passenger rail network could result in funding to
improve or enhance the District’s existing and planned rail infrastructure.

•

CDOT funding: a new statewide funding source, such as a State-wide
ballot measure, could include RTD projects.

13. RTD could explore the sale or lease of air rights over RTD stations. For example,
sale of air rights is a significant revenue source for Union Station in DC.
14. RTD could investigate opportunities to lease rights-of-way to private entities.

2021 (not 2020) appropriations bills could include earmarks. While there is no
law against earmarks, the Senate Republican caucus recently adopted a ban on

earmarks.

In conclusion, this section has presented an array of creative funding, finance and
revenue mechanisms – some of which have been successfully utilized by RTD in the

past, and many of which have been explored previously, at least preliminarily. While
some of these present challenging levels of complexity and applicability, RTD staff will
actively continue to seek out and evaluate potential regional funding opportunities. This

effort will include continuing communication, collaboration and cooperation with the
Metro Mayor’s Caucus, DRCOG, city and county stakeholders and others – all with a view
toward a constructive and productive dialogue designed to implement the Board’s
wishes as stated in the April 16, 2019 Resolution.

T

RTD was successful in receiving New Starts funding for all three projects. In addition,

RTD applied for and received a Small Starts Construction Grant for the Southeast Rail
Extension (SERE) in 2016. Federal funding for SERE was made possible based on (1) the
project’s ability to meet Small Starts financial and project justification criteria; and (2) an

A
R

unprecedented local agency contribution.

At the Board’s request, staff conducted a thorough review of the unfinished FasTracks
corridors to assess the likelihood that these corridors would qualify for Federal New

Starts or Small Starts funding. This exercise, completed in 2016, included a thorough
analysis of FTA project justification criteria (50 percent of overall rating) and local
financial commitment criteria (50 percent of overall rating).

D

FTA rates projects on a five-point scale, from Low to High. You must have at least a
Medium rating for project justification and local financial commitment to qualify for Small
Starts or New Starts. The only project that appeared to meet project justification criteria
was the Central Rail Extension, which received a Medium rating for project justification.
North Metro and Northwest Rail received Low ratings for project justification, and the
Southwest Extension received a Medium-Low project justification rating.
In addition, these four projects would not achieve a Medium financial commitment rating
based on current and anticipated RTD financial projections and forecasts. Significant
RTD and non-RTD sources would need to be committed and budgeted to raise the
financial commitment rating above Low. (Note that SERE received an overall financial
rating of High due to significant non-FTA overmatch by RTD and stakeholders).
At this time, only one remaining FasTracks project, the Central Rail Extension, appears a
possible candidate for FTA funding. The other three would be disqualified under project
justification criteria. At this time, all four would be disqualified based on the local
financial commitment criteria. That said, Directors may engage in dialogue with local

Conclusion
In this initial report (the first of an anticipated series of reports), RTD staff has proposed
the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors and implementing the Peak Service Plan as
expeditiously as reasonably possible in a commercially reasonable manner. It remains

clear that, given RTD’s current limited resources, the path forward will require continued
discussions regarding the trade-offs among alternatives. As noted in the Introduction,

the ideas, opportunities and approaches presented in this report are draft and
illustrative, laying out options for the RTD Board to consider and to facilitate constructive
dialogue with the voters, taxpayers and stakeholders throughout the region. The most
promising of these can be further refined and pursued.

A
R

The scope of work for the Transportation Transformation Comprehensive Plan (T2 Comp
Plan), authorized by the RTD Board of Directors in May 2019, includes opportunities for
further in-depth analysis and dialogue regarding many of these topics. Between now
and the adoption of the T2 Comp Plan, we will have laid the groundwork and provided
the Board opportunities to address how to:
•

Balance various existing and anticipated mobility options to meet the District’s
transportation needs; and

•

Proceed forward with completing the FasTracks Unfinished Corridors within a
comprehensive, sustainable framework for the future.

FasTracks Program Overview

A
R

The FasTracks Program was created through extensive stakeholder partnerships to provide
much-needed transit improvements to the Denver Metro area. The 2004 FasTracks Plan
(included as Appendix A) envisioned the program as a 12-year, $4.7 billion series of transit
improvements and additions. The plan’s goals included:
•
•

Provide improved transportation choices and options to the citizens of the district;
Increase transit mode share during peak travel times; and

•

Establish a proactive plan that balances transit needs with future regional growth.
DRAFT as of 5/2 9/ 18

D

The following map identifies the key elements included in the 2004 FasTracks Plan, including:
•

119 miles of light rail and commuter rail: construction of new rapid transit in six
corridors and existing rapid transit enhancements and extensions in three corridors;

•
•

57 new rail/BRT stations;
18 miles of bus rapid transit (BRT);

•

Enhanced bus network and transit hubs (FastConnects);

•

31 new Park-n-Rides and expansions to nine Park-n-Rides (adding more than 21,000
parking spaces);

•

The renovation of Denver Union Station into a major multimodal center providing access
to nearly every rapid transit line and regional buses, local circulators and intercity
rail/bus service;

•

Transit facilities and amenities to improve safety, convenience and use of the transit
system; and

•

History
Following passage of FasTracks, RTD initiated work on preliminary engineering and
environmental clearances for the FasTracks Corridors. In 2006, as a result of safety concerns
mandated that only Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) compliant passenger rail vehicles
would be allowed to operate in their rights-of-way. This eventually led to a change in scope and

T
F

technology for the Gold Line from light rail to commuter rail. Concurrently, in 2006 – 2007 RTD

undertook capital and operating cost analyses of commuter rail technologies for the East, North
Metro, Northwest Rail and Gold Line Corridors. Capital cost estimation for these corridors in the
original FasTracks Plan assumed diesel technologies, which have lower up-front construction
costs. However, RTD determined, based on multiple factors including lower forecasted

operating costs, that Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) technology would have lower life-cycle costs
than diesel for the East, North Metro and Gold Line Corridors. The choice of EMU technology

A
R

was also influenced by the desires of local governments and citizens, expressed during the
course of the environmental clearances, for electric-powered rather than diesel-powered
commuter rail. This decision resulted in higher capital costs for these corridors based on

infrastructure (such as overhead catenary), vehicle and right-of-way requirements. In 2008, the
federal government’s requirement that FRA compliant passenger railroads install Positive Train
Control systems to enhance safety added an additional capital cost requirement for these
projects that was not included in the 2004 cost estimates for FasTracks.
DRAFT as of 5/2 9/ 18

D

In 2007, the FasTracks Program was negatively impacted by decreased sales and use tax
revenues and increased costs of construction materials and was forecast at the time to need an
additional $1.5 billion to deliver the remaining projects in less than a decade. This perfect storm
caused the agency to explore strategic and creative ways to complete FasTracks. The problem
was exacerbated by the country’s slow dive into the 2008 recession. As Denver recovered from
the Great Recession, then Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, and other political and business
leaders supported RTD in using innovative thinking to complete the program. They viewed mass
transit as essential to making Denver a metropolitan force that could compete with cities not
just in the United States, but throughout the world.
RTD began extensive stakeholder outreach and coordination to identify innovative ideas to
complete more of the FasTracks Plan sooner, including determining whether there was support
for an additional tax increase. This outreach included establishing the FasTracks Metro Mayor’s

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

(and partially in response to a deadly 2005 rail accident in California) the freight railroads

Task Force to increase the technical understanding of regional stakeholders and elected officials
concerning the FasTracks Program and the agency’s financial plan. This outreach approach
engaged a broad group of elected officials in a multiyear educational/partnering process that
allowed them direct and informal access to a variety of technical and financial resources.

RTD’s outreach also included extensive interaction with the private sector. RTD immediately
began evaluating whether there were opportunities to implement a Public Private Partnership
(P3) for any of the FasTracks projects. In 2011, RTD held an industry forum, Transformation
as possible, enhance customer experience and reduce operational costs. This call for
innovations enticed more than 200 high-level executives from a cross-section of large and small

T
F

firms to attend, including engineering, construction and financial firms as well as major
companies not typically involved in transportation projects.

After much research, RTD realized that voters were likely not willing to vote for a tax increase
and decided it was too risky to move forward with an additional ballot initiative given the

economic situation. Therefore, RTD turned its focus to closely collaborating with the private
sector and the public to continue building towards the ultimate FasTracks vision. The
collaborative environment established with regional stakeholders, elected officials and the

A
R

private sector resulted in the following major accomplishments for the program:
•

RTD gained support to move forward with the P3 for the commuter rail line to the
airport (i.e., the Eagle Project), making RTD the first U.S. transit agency to successfully
leverage private-sector investment and federal funding to build a commuter rail system.

•

RTD received and accepted unsolicited proposals from the private sector that ultimately
resulted in construction of the I-225 corridor and a substantial section of the North
DRAFT as of 5/2 9/ 18

D

Metro corridor.
•

RTD analyzed the remaining FasTracks projects and determined that the Southeast Rail
Line was a strong candidate for additional federal grant funding. The federal funds,
combined with an unprecedented local contribution provided by the local stakeholders in
the project area, allowed RTD to begin construction on that rail line.

•

RTD established the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) to capture and track any
excess revenues available in a given year so that they could be leveraged in the future
to build the remaining FasTracks projects.

Status
RTD has made significant progress in completing the FasTracks Program to date. Since its
inception, RTD has expended over $5.6 billion on improvements in the region, has stimulated
$2 billion of development around Denver Union Station alone, has provided $1.032 billion of
revenue to small and disadvantaged businesses and has created over 15,000 full-time jobs.

To proactively address the funding gap for the FasTracks Program, RTD:
•

Instituted a more detailed annual FasTracks budget analysis and forecast named the
Annual Program Evaluation (APE).

•

Conducted extensive public outreach, presenting options for program delivery given
funding constraints.

•

Applied to the FTA seeking entry into the Public Private Partnership Pilot Program
(Penta-P) for the Gold Line and East corridors, which ultimately led to the successful
award of $1.03 billion in federal funding. The Eagle P3 award resulted in a cost savings
to RTD of $305 million compared with internal estimates, with the savings used to
complete more of the program.

•

Convened a Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) FasTracks Task Force with representation of
one mayor from each of the FasTracks corridors. This MMC FasTracks Task Force met
regularly, with RTD staff support, over the next several years, asking key questions,
assuring local government understanding of RTD decision-making, and providing RTD

•

Several times, over multiple years, RTD considered pursuing an additional election to
increase sales and use tax. RTD finally determined that the economic conditions were
not suitable for an election.

Federal Funding
The 2004 FasTracks financial plan projected that RTD would be successful in obtaining
competitive federal grant funding in the sum total of $815 million for the East, West and Gold
RTD was awarded additional competitive grant funding for the Southeast Rail Extension after
determining the potential eligibility of this project under the FTA’s updated rules and criteria.

T
F

Through 2018, the FTA has awarded RTD with over $1.4 billion in federal funding for these
projects, exceeding the original 2004 plan of $815 million by approximately $615 million.

RTD has continued to explore viability for additional federal grant funding for FasTracks projects
that are not yet under construction. Based on current federal criteria, only one project – the

Central Rail Extension – would possibly meet the project justification criteria to receive a federal
grant. However, it does not meet the project financial justification criteria primarily because

A
R

applying for federal funding would require a substantial local share that is not currently
identified in RTD’s financial plan. Should RTD’s financial position or federal eligibility criteria
change significantly, the Central Rail Extension or other unfunded corridors could be considered
as possible additional candidates for federal funds.

Potential Next Steps
RTD is committed to completing the full FasTracks Program over time and will continue seeking

innovative ideas and working with partners to move the program forward. However, RTD is
facing significant financial challenges. As the following chart depicts, RTD does not anticipate
having any capacity to issue additional debt until 2026.

Currently, RTD does not meet the required 1.2x net debt service coverage until 2026.
Additionally, the original FasTracks Plan included a voter-approved Taxpayer Bill of Rights
authorization limiting total debt for the program to $3.477 billion in principal and $7.129 billion
in total debt service. Given current outstanding sales tax and appropriation obligations and the
debt limits identified in the voter-approved authorization, RTD will not be in a position to issue
additional debt to fund additional FasTracks projects until 2026 at the earliest. As of RTD’s last
debt issuance, there is a remaining authorization of $381.95M in total repayment outstanding.
That would allow RTD to issue approximately $195M in bonds sometime after 2026
In the meantime, RTD continues to seek opportunities to identify scope refinements and budget
containment with on-going projects and continues to track excess revenues through the FISA,
which as of year-end 2017 has a total balance of $49.4 million. The following table identifies
actual expenditures by project through 2017 as well as total project budgets (total expenditures

On behalf of the Regional Transportation
District Board of Directors and staff, we
welcome this opportunity to present to
you the FasTracks Plan, our
comprehensive plan for high quality
transit service and facilities in the Denver
metropolitan region. It is the culmination
of an extensive planning and
development process involving the
general public and all the local cities and
counties over the last five years. It
represents our vision for a better
transportation system by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.

based transit systems and call-n-Ride
service. This has been accompanied
by an aggressive bus fleet
modernization program that will
reduce the average age of our bus
fleet from 12 years in 1999 to 5
years in 2004. RTD’s access-a-Ride
paratransit system continues to grow
and is responsive to the disabled
community.

•

An enhanced accident prevention
program that has resulted in a 54
percent reduction in accident rates
between 2001 and 2002. To date, in
2003, accident numbers have been
reduced an additional 32 percent
below last year’s levels. This
reduction was achieved through
comprehensive management and ongoing driver training.

•

Overall prudent financial management
of RTD activities. Between 2000 and
2002 Worker’s Compensation claim
amounts were reduced by 55 percent
by tightly controlling this process
thereby saving millions of dollars.
Enforcement of existing attendance
polices has reduced absenteeism
among bus operators by 5% saving
personnel costs. Beginning in 2001,
RTD reacted early and effectively to
slumping economic conditions
thereby minimizing the impact of
reduced revenues for our customers
and our employees.

We at RTD are dedicated to deliver to
the citizens of the metro region the
highest quality and most cost effective
transit services today and in the future.
Over the last four years, from 20002003, RTD has continued to improve the
services that it offers to the public by

the current bus system including
suburban-to-suburban bus service, over
thirty new and expanded park-n-Rides,
and other transit facility improvements

Executive Summary
Overview of FasTracks

FasTracks is RTD’s twelve-year
comprehensive plan for high quality transit
service and facilities in the region. FasTracks
is a proactive plan that responds to the
growing transportation needs of the Denver
metropolitan region by providing an
enhanced region-wide, reliable and safe
transit system.

construction only” and that “peak period
public transportation service during
congested hours can improve the
transportation capacity.” The report
indicates that “Public transportation lines
that do not intersect roads can be particularly
reliable as they are not affected by weather,
road work, and other unreliability producing
events.”

T

R

According to the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Denver
metropolitan region is expected to add more
than 900,000 people and 600,000 jobs by
2025. This growth will place a tremendous
strain on the region’s already congested
transportation system. Weekday vehicle
miles of travel are expected to increase from
58 million in the year 2001 to 95 million by
the year 2025, a 64 percent increase. As
part of its Fiscally Constrained 2025 Interim
Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), DRCOG
has noted that this combination of
population growth and vehicle miles
traveled will increase severe congestion by
89 percent even with the transportation
improvements that are scheduled for
implementation. Person hours of delay are
predicted to increase by two times the
current amount. By 2025, we will have
more traffic than our existing transportation
system can handle.

D

In its 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report,
the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) rated
Denver as the third most congested city in
the United States. The report also states that
“it would be almost impossible to maintain a
constant congestion level with road

ES-1

FasTracks also responds to Metro Vision, the
Denver region’s plan for future growth and
development. The second of the six core
elements of Metro Vision states that the
region must create “a balanced multimodal
transportation system” which includes “an
extensive fixed guideway transit system and
bus transit.”

Finally, FasTracks responds to current
sentiment on transportation needs within the
metropolitan area. In a recent survey
entitled 2003 Statewide Customer Survey –
Results on Transportation Issues in Colorado
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT), the lack of
public/mass transportation was identified as
one of the top transportation issues. The
CDOT survey also states that if transportation
funds became available, in the metro area,
the highest priority for spending that money
should be on light rail. FasTracks provides
the opportunity to implement rapid transit by
funding a region-wide system of light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit in the
next twelve years.

Provide Improved Transportation Choices
and Options to the Citizens of the District.

Key Components of FasTracks

2.

Significant planning efforts and public
involvement have gone into development of
the FasTracks Plan. It anticipates building a
number of major components described
below. Costs are estimated based on the best
data currently available. Transit elements
shown are based on completed planning and
engineering work and environmental studies,
or work that is ongoing at the time of
publication. While specific details of the
plan may change based on unanticipated
economic circumstances over the next
twelve years, and the results of the
environmental, planning, and engineering
work that is still ongoing, RTD expects to
deliver the major transit corridors and related
improvements within the overall budgetary
framework and timeframes set out in the
plan.

T

A
R

Increase transit mode share during peak
travel times.

Existing congestion during peak travel
times of the day is frustrating for many
drivers and is only expected to get worse
as the region continues to grow.
Providing viable transit options during
the peak travel times will help provide
relief for frustrated drivers. FasTracks is
projected to increase the percentage of
people taking transit during the peak
hours from 11 to 22 percent in the
region’s major transportation corridors
where congestion is worst.

•

Rapid Transit - FasTracks will
provide new and expanded rapid
transit in nine major travel corridors
by funding over 119 miles of light
rail and commuter rail and
contributing to the construction of 18
miles of bus rapid transit. The rapid
transit component includes
expansions and extensions to
existing light rail lines, construction
of new light rail and commuter rail
lines, and construction of the stations
and other improvements for bus
rapid transit. (Figure ES-1)

•

park-n-Rides - One of the most
successful elements of the RTD
system is the extensive park-n-Ride
system throughout the District. RTD
has 65 park-n-Rides today with over
21,000 spaces that are served by
both buses and rail. (When

Establish a proactive plan that balances
transit needs with future regional growth.

The Denver metropolitan region is
expected to grow from 2.46 million
(2001) people to 3.39 million in 2025.
This growth requires an enhanced transit
system to help meet the future
transportation needs of the region.
FasTracks responds to this need and
provides opportunities to focus
development near transit to take
advantage of the increased capacity and
convenience of the enhanced system.
ES-2

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Additional transportation choices add to
the region’s quality of life. Reduced
reliance on a single mode of
transportation by providing additional,
convenient transit options gives
individuals choices on how to travel and
where to live, work and play. FasTracks
provides over 119 miles of new rail
transit, contributes to the construction of
18 miles of bus rapid transit and greatly
enhances the bus network to support
investments in rail, serve suburb-tosuburb trips, and provide local and
regional service.

access to all parts of the Denver
metro region. As the central
intermodal hub for the region, DUS
will provide access to nearly every
rapid transit corridor included in
FasTracks as well as Regional,
Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski
Train, Greyhound, and the new
Downtown Circulator. Elements of
DUS that are part of FasTracks
include: construction of below
grade light rail access into DUS, atgrade commuter rail access into
DUS, and construction of
components to facilitate transfers
such as underground passenger
waiting areas, concessions, and
restrooms. (Figure ES-4)

completed in 2006, T-REX will add 9
more park-n-Rides, and over 5,000
new spaces.) FasTracks will provide
funding to increase the number of
parking spaces by over 21,000.
These spaces will be added to
existing park-n-Rides as well as 31
new park-n-Rides to serve growing
areas of the metro region. (Figure ES2).
Enhanced Bus Network and Transit
Hubs - FasTracks offers a family of
bus services tailored to individual
markets and linked together to create
a comprehensive and seamless
network. RTD will continue to
operate the full array of bus service it
offers today, and will offer two new
services. Recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the region,
FasTracks includes a comprehensive
network of suburb-to-suburb bus
service linked together with
“FastConnects” or timed transfers at
transit hubs throughout the region.
The FastConnects concept schedules
buses and trains to arrive at transit
stations, stops and park-n-Rides at the
same time, minimizing the time a
passenger has to wait to transfer to
another vehicle. (Figure ES-3). The
second new service offered by
FasTracks is an extensive system of
bus feeder service to rapid transit
stations. This service will provide
neighborhoods near rapid transit
stations a convenient option for
accessing rail or bus rapid transit
lines.

congested highways. Ridership
trends on the RTD’s current light rail
system support the forecasts. Nearly
60 percent of new riders on the
Southwest Corridor use light rail at
least three days a week. Moreover,
78 percent of light rail riders had a
vehicle to use for this trip. More
trips on transit means fewer cars on
the road. One full bus can remove
60 cars, one full light rail vehicle can
remove 125 cars from the road.

The 2003 Annual Urban Mobility Report
prepared by the Texas Transportation
Institute reported 36 annual hours of delay
per person in the Denver area in 2001. The
same report also indicated that 60 percent of
the freeway lane miles in the Denver area
were congested during the peak period in
2001. Delay and congestion are projected
to increase significantly in the future.
FasTracks provides a fast alternative to
driving in the major highway corridors.
Travel Times/Speeds - With the FasTracks
Plan, it will be faster to travel by transit than
by auto to key destinations during the peak
times. As shown in Figure ES-5, most transit
travel times are significantly less for rapid
transit than for autos in 2025. With
FasTracks, about 474,000 fewer vehicle
miles would be driven each weekday in the
region in the year 2025. Because of the
reduction in vehicle miles driven, highways
adjacent to the rapid transit corridors will
generally operate slightly faster during rush
hours and through traffic on nearby roads
will also decline.

T
F

Economic Growth and Development
There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continues to be a concern to
most metro area residents. FasTracks
promotes smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and supported
by local cities and counties and their
citizens.

Safety/Reliability - Transit,
particularly rail and bus guideway, is
much more dependable and reliable
in inclement weather and is not
subject to highway incident related
traffic. Additionally, compared to
road systems, transit systems are
significantly safer. Generally, trips
with similar destinations result in
200,000 fewer deaths, injuries and
accidents when made by public
transit than by car, adding up to
between $2 billion and $5 billion
per year in safety benefits.

•

Peak Hour Mode Split – The
FasTracks Plan will increase the
percentage of people taking transit
during the peak hours from 11
percent today to over 22 percent on

ES-8

•

Transit Oriented Development Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus
stations have been shown to increase
property values. This has occurred
locally at Englewood City Center
Station on the Southwest Corridor.
The Alexan City Center apartments, a
transit oriented development along
the Southwest light rail line recently
sold for $5,000 to $10,000 more per
unit due to their location next to
light rail. In the Southeast Corridor/
T-REX project, which is currently
under construction, approximately
50 acres directly adjacent to the
Belleview Station have been rezoned
from open space to transit mixed
use.

Increased Economic Activity FasTracks in the short term will
provide increases in employment

Carbon Monoxide, small particulates
(called PM10), and Volatile Organic
Compounds emitted into the region’s
air. DRCOG also projects a slight
increase in Nitrogen Oxide
emissions, but the overall impact of
the FasTracks plan on the region’s air
quality is positive and will increase
over time as transit ridership
increases.

In the long term, the implementation
of FasTracks will provide the needed
infrastructure to sustain our economy
by creating a livable environment
that will be attractive to business and
development. In Dallas, Texas, the
light rail starter line generated over
$922 million in development,
surpassing the $860 million cost of
the project. Additionally, the DART
system in downtown Dallas
contributed to a 30 percent jump in
retail sales between mid-1997 and
1998, compared to a 3 percent rise
citywide.

F

Energy Conservation –
Implementation of the FasTracks Plan
will also contribute to energy
conservation. A bus with as few as
seven passengers is more fuel
efficient than the average car with
one occupant used for commuting.
The fuel efficiency of a fully
occupied rail car is 15 times greater
than the typical automobile. For
every passenger mile traveled, public
transportation is twice as fuelefficient as autos and trucks.
Nationally, if 1 in 10 Americans used
public transportation regularly, the
U.S. reliance on foreign oil could be
cut by more than 40 percent.

Economic Benefits to Individuals and
Businesses – Transit can save
commuters money in transportation
expenditures by reducing the travel
commute times and the cost of
commuting. Studies have shown
that public transportation-intensive
metropolitan areas save $22 billion
annually in transportation costs.
According to DRCOG, by 2025,
548,000 jobs, or 26% of all jobs in
the region, will be within a one-half
mile walk of a rapid transit station
with FasTracks. With a short bus
ride, this job accessibility grows to
46%. Additionally, 12% of all
households will be within walking
distance of a rapid transit station, and
86% will be within a 5 mile drive of
a rapid transit park-n-Ride. Many
cities are finding that businesses are
considering transit service a key
factor in location decisions.

Development/Refinement of Plan
Concept

Since 1994, RTD has conducted a number of
planning and environmental studies for
major transportation corridors, designed and
built three new rapid transit lines (Central
Corridor, Southwest Corridor and Central
Platte Valley), and initiated construction with
CDOT on the T-REX (Southeast Corridor)
light rail and highway program which will
open in 2006. Additionally, RTD partnered
with CDOT to develop capital cost estimates
for regional transportation improvements,
conducted public outreach, and worked with
financial consultants to examine long term
funding options. A brief summary of these
key inputs is described below.

and surveys were distributed to members of
the general public. A number of changes
were incorporated into the plan based on
this input.
In December of 2002, the RTD Board
adopted the FasTracks Plan as the vision for
transit in the metro area. By the Spring of
2003, financial forecasts indicated that
lagging sales tax revenues would not allow
RTD to build the FasTracks Plan as originally
proposed (i.e., full build-out of the rapid
transit system within 10 years based on a 0.4
percent sales tax increase). A revised plan
was proposed which scaled back the rapid
transit build-out into two phases. Sixteen
open houses were held in August and
September 2003 to gather public input on
the proposed changes to the plan. To date,
over 347 public meetings and presentations
have occurred.

Community Outreach/Public Input and
Progress of the FasTracks Plan
A survey to gauge interest in transit-related
improvements for the metro area was also
conducted by the Colorado Department of
Transportation, RTD and the Transit Alliance
(a group of metro area local municipalities
and other business interests) in July of 2001.
The results of this survey indicated a 78%
approval rating for improving transit in the
metro area. Twenty-one open houses were
conducted throughout the RTD District
during September and October 2001 to
gather public input on the plan concept. In
addition, individual meetings were held with
elected officials, Chambers of Commerce
and civic groups in each corridor. In order
to gain additional comments about the
FasTracks Plan, a web site was established

ES-12

In general, the public and elected officials
preferred that RTD modify other plan
features in order to build the entire rapid
transit system. As a result, the FasTracks
Plan was revised to include a build-out of the
rapid transit system within a 12-year period
with modifications in rail and bus operations
in the opening years.
Capital Cost Estimates (Methodology, Unit
Costs, Risk Assessment)
The capital cost estimates for the FasTracks
Plan were prepared in conjunction with the
extensive study work that lead to the
definition of the FasTracks Plan elements.
They were also reviewed and revised using
unit prices consistent with past and current
construction costs in the metro area. In
2002, RTD hired an engineering consulting
firm to independently review the FasTracks
Plan rapid transit cost estimates. This
consultant previously validated the
CDOT/RTD T-REX project cost estimates.
The result of their analysis validated the
corridor-adjusted costs within 1.78 percent

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Corridor Planning and Environmental
Studies
RTD conducted extensive studies for all six
new and three enhanced transit corridors
that are included in the FasTracks rapid
transit component. These included Major
Investment Studies for the East, West, Gold
Line, US 36, I-225 and North Metro
Corridors, an Environmental Impact
Statement for the Southeast and West
Corridors, Feasibility Studies for the
Southeast (Lone Tree) and Southwest
Corridor Extensions, and operational
analyses for the Central Corridor. From
1998-2001, RTD also conducted a Twenty
Year Transit Needs Assessment and System
Plan to insure that financial investments are
being made to maintain RTD’s existing assets
and to insure that individual corridor
recommendations coordinate with future
region-wide service level requirements. The
draft FasTracks Plan adopted by the RTD
Board in the summer of 2001 was built upon
the foundation of the long-term transit needs
assessment and plan that included the
detailed work of the planning and
environmental studies.

RTD has included in each corridor cost
estimate funds to mitigate impacts to the
local street networks. The construction of
the FasTracks Plan will have an impact on
the local roadway networks wherever a
corridor is built. RTD recognizes that
corridor-specific impacts will be identified as
the preliminary and final design progresses.
At this time, RTD has identified specific
locations in each corridor that will need to
be mitigated for bridges, grade crossings, and
street restoration. In addition, RTD has
allocated 7 to 8 percent of construction costs
in each corridor to cover noise, urban
design, and traffic control/signing and
striping. These additive costs account for
approximately 15 to 20 percent of the cost of
the construction items.

cost estimates, are within the risk tolerance
for the plan.
RTD and CDOT staff also collaborated on an
analysis that was released in June of 2003
that explored the construction coordination
that would be needed between the FasTracks
Plan and the state highway system. This
analysis was used to develop a Master
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT that was signed by both
agencies on April 12, 2004. The Master IGA
establishes a coordinated process which
facilitates the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan and preserves the ability to
pursue planned highway and transit
improvements in corridors where both
highway and transit improvements are likely
to occur.

A formal risk assessment was prepared for
FasTracks that evaluated the potential
financial risk associated with the proposed
alignments and facilities and assigned a
monetary value to the costs and the
associated risk. The risk assessment
developed contingencies for the FasTracks
Plan in major categories (i.e., hazardous
materials, schedule delays, quantity
adjustments). The cost assigned to each
category was established based on the cost
estimate for the project and the estimated
cost for each individual component that
might be affected. A percentage risk
adjustment was determined based on past
history. Both a minimum risk dollar value
and a high-risk dollar value were established.
A probability was assigned to each item and
a statistical analysis was performed to
establish the dollar amount of probable risk.
The result of that analysis has shown that the
contingency amounts, provided in the plan

Rail and Bus Operating and Maintenance
Cost Methodologies
The LRT operating and maintenance costs
were based on FY 2002 National Transit
Database (NTDB) cost and statistical data
provided by RTD. Unit costs were developed
for specific costs categories within cost
centers. The cost centers are based on NTDB
categories within the following areas:
vehicle operations and vehicle maintenance,
non-vehicle maintenance and general
administration. The model was validated to
prior years. Specifically, prior year service
statistics were entered into the cost model
and cost results were deflated based on
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rates.
The model was found to generate costs
within a few percentage points of actual
costs.
Bus operating and maintenance costs for
FasTracks were developed using the RTD
bus operating and maintenance cost model.
The RTD bus cost model is an incremental
cost model which uses unit costs based on
actual RTD financial data and scheduled

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

of the estimate provided by RTD. Since that
time, RTD has updated the estimates to
reflect current conditions and costs in
coordination with local governments and the
operating freight railroads.

Incremental operating and maintenance
costs for service to FasTracks bus routes were
estimated at a systemwide average
incremental cost of $54.00 per hour. In
addition to the incremental operating costs
described above, the FasTracks Plan includes
the opening of an additional bus
maintenance facility. The bus cost model
also was used to develop an annual
operating cost for that facility, based on the
2002 operating costs for RTD’s major
facilities.

of FasTracks

•

Prioritization of Facility/Corridor

Schedule and Implementation Plan and
Building on Past Successes

RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. Starting with the
CDOT, City and County of Denver and RTD
partnership on the Downtown Express/Bus
HOV lane project in 1994 and continuing
with the three RTD operating light rail lines,
the Central Corridor in 1994, the Southwest
Corridor in 2000 and the Central Platte
Valley in 2002, RTD has completed each
corridor on time and within budget. The TREX project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule to open in 2006 and is within
budget.

D

Similarly, for the FasTracks Plan, RTD is
confident that its capital project cost
estimates and its schedule and
implementation plan are realistic. RTD has
developed a schedule for implementation
that places each of the corridors into revenue
service within twelve years. In order to
achieve this goal, the logical and sequential
scheduling of all FasTracks elements is

ES-14

Sequencing of corridor construction will be
established to coordinate with forecasted
revenues so that RTD remains fiscally solvent
throughout the implementation of the
FasTracks Plan. There are other factors that
could positively impact design and
construction schedules for FasTracks. These
include:
•

Revenue receipts higher than
forecasts.

•

Additional federal funds (beyond
current assumptions).

•

Receipt of Senate Bill 1/revenues
(state of Colorado).

•

Lower corridor construction costs.

•

Third party financial partnering to
accelerate the construction schedule.

On the conservative side, RTD has estimated
construction costs and timeframes on a
design-bid-build basis but intends to evaluate
every corridor and project for the possibility
of design-build in order to implement the
most cost effective and efficient means of
construction. The management and
implementation of the Plan will be the
responsibility of RTD.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

units of service. The bus cost model
develops unit costs based on the class of
service operated, and allocates these costs to
the service variable (or variables) most
closely associated with the specific type of
cost.

4/22/2004

10.1.b

In addition, RTD has incorporated an
estimated $110 million in other federal grant
revenues as part of the financing plan. An
estimated $50 million is expected from FTA
in the form of bus discretionary funds for
Denver Union Station or other bus projects
such as vehicles and facilities. An estimated
$60 million is for federal flexible dollars
through the DRCOG planning process
between the years 2010 and 2015,
consistent with the District’s past receipts,
allowing RTD to meet the implementation
schedule requirements requested by local
governments and adopted by the RTD Board
of Directors.

Financial Plan
The FasTracks Plan is a comprehensive $4.7
billion plan for addressing mobility needs in
the Denver metro area over the next twelve
years. In order to finance the plan, the
District will seek voter approval for a 0.4
percent increase in the regional sales and use
tax – this equates to 4 pennies on a $10
purchase. This will bring the total tax in the
District to 1 percent, comparable to other
urban areas in the Western United States
including Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and
San Francisco.

D

The Plan leverages local funding to support
an estimated $815 million in federal New
Starts funding for various plan
improvements. This is approximately 17
percent of the total cost of the plan and is
reasonable compared to federal funds
received over time by RTD for similar
projects and at other transit properties
throughout the United States. It also utilizes
contributions from local jurisdictions
benefiting from transit in an amount equal to
2.5% of project corridor costs or an
estimated $95 million. Local contributions
could consist of right-of-way dedications,

RTD’s schedule was reviewed by a
consulting firm with expertise in this area.
The consultant prepared a schedule
independent of the one prepared by RTD
staff. The sequencing of the projects
remained consistent with that of RTD. In the
independent analysis, the consultants
established their own logic to develop a
schedule based on the experience of their
personnel and from previous projects
throughout the country. Durations varied
slightly, but completion of each corridor was
within the 12-year period established as the
goal for the FasTracks Plan. This

other direct corridor contributions.

In order to accomplish the Plan within the
twelve-year schedule, a voter–approved

contributions that are reasonable and
consistent with RTD’s past funding history.

Conclusion
FasTracks is a comprehensive twelve-year
plan designed to implement high quality
transit service and facilities in the region. It
responds to the growing transportation needs
of the Denver metropolitan region by
providing alternatives to traffic congestion.
The Plan has been in development for over
five years with major study activities taking
place to define rapid transit corridor
improvements, bus service and other
elements. In conjunction with those study
activities, RTD has solicited and
incorporated local government and public
input as part of each corridor
recommendation. For the FasTracks Plan,
alone, RTD has conducted 37 public
meetings and 310 individual presentations
on the plan. The final FasTracks Plan
responds to local governments and the
public to build a transit system that serves
the needs of the community.

The FasTracks Plan will provide a number of
direct benefits for citizens in the metro
region. Travel times will be reduced for
those using the transit alternatives outlined in
the FasTracks Plan. Transit, particularly rail
and bus guideway, is much more
dependable and reliable in inclement
weather and is not subject to highway
incident related traffic. Riding a bus or train
is much safer than auto travel.

T
F

Implementation of the FasTracks Plan will
have a positive effect on the region wide
environment. For every passenger mile
traveled, public transportation is twice as
fuel efficient as autos and trucks. The
FasTracks Plan will lead to an annual
reduction in metro area pollutants such as
carbon monoxide, particulates and ozone.

RTD has been successful in its capital
construction program. RTD has completed
each major corridor construction project
(Downtown Express, Central Corridor,
Southwest Corridor and Central Platte Valley
Spur) on time and within budget. The T-REX
project, a combined RTD and CDOT
construction project, also remains on
schedule and within budget. Similarly, for
the FasTracks Plan, RTD is confident that its
capital project cost estimates and its
schedule and implementation plan are
realistic.

The FasTracks financial plan will allow
implementation over twelve years with voter
approval for a 0.4 percent increase in the
regional sales and use tax. This will bring the
total tax in the District to 1 percent,
comparable to other urban areas in the
Western United States. Other sources of
funding for the plan include federal and local

ES-16

There are a number of positive impacts to
the regional economy with FasTracks. Sprawl
and growth continue to be a concern to most
metro area residents. FasTracks promotes
smart growth and higher density
development along transit corridors where it
is consistent and appropriate and where it is
supported by local cities and counties and its
citizens. Opportunities for transit oriented
development around rail and bus stations
have been shown to increase property
values.
FasTracks in the short term will provide
increases in employment and disposable
income through the creation of many direct
construction jobs and other indirect jobs
during the construction period. This is
consistent with the T-REX project where
1,400 local jobs have been added to the
economy. In the long term, the
implementation of FasTracks will provide the
needed infrastructure to sustain our economy

by creating a livable environment that will
be attractive to business and development.
RTD has taken a number of actions to: 1)
assure the success of the FasTracks plan; 2)
assure accountability to the residents of the
region; and 3) provide for continued
coordination and communication with local
governments, citizens, CDOT and DRCOG.
Key examples of these actions follow:
RTD FasTracks Adoption and Election
Resolution
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution adopting the
FasTracks plan and declaring the
commitment to hold an election on the
FasTracks plan in the November 2, 2004
general election if sufficient signatures are
obtained on a petition, in accordance with
state law. In their resolution, the RTD Board
committed to ensuring “that the residents
and taxpayers of the region are provided
information about the progress of FasTracks
implementation in the event an election is
successful and have an ongoing opportunity
to review progress and provide input in the
numerous decisions that will be required for
construction of each corridor.” To
accomplish this, the resolution directs the
creation of “a citizen’s advisory committee to
monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in
the Plan.”

Master Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA)
between CDOT and RTD
On April 12, 2004, CDOT and RTD
executed the Master IGA that establishes a
coordinated process which facilitates the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and
preserves the ability to pursue planned
highway and transit improvements in
corridors where both highway and transit
improvements are likely to occur.

T
F

RTD Hold Harmless Resolution
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of
Directors approved a resolution entitled
“Regarding Board Commitments for
FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action
confirmed RTD’s commitment to build each
corridor’s specific list of corridor
improvements consistent with and as
described in the FasTracks Plan and within
the fiscal constraints and schedule of the
plan subject to the completion of the
environmental process and conformity with
any federal Record of Decision for a
corridor. It further formalized the
commitment to analyze the Plan annually to
determine current revenue projections from
both local and federal sources. The
resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better
or worse than expected then all the corridors
will be adjusted accordingly.”

A
R

D

DRCOG Senate Bill 208
On April 21, 2004, the DRCOG Board of
Directors approved the FasTracks plan and
the individual corridors, the technologies,
and the method of financing, pursuant to
C.R.S. 32-9-107.7 (the “Senate Bill 208”
process), mandated by the state legislature.
In support of this action, DRCOG performed
a comprehensive technical review of the
individual FasTracks corridors and the
FasTracks financial plan.

ES-17

Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution
commits "that prior to construction, a
corridor cost risk assessment and value
engineering (will) be conducted to minimize
the potential for cost overruns and schedule
delays. Based on the results of both, project
and financial analyses, modifications to
individual corridor project elements, service
plans, and schedules may be necessary for
all FasTracks corridors. This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled
construction and operation of the remaining
FasTracks corridors, thereby "holding
harmless" those corridors. This information
shall be reported annually to the general

Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved
resolution reads as follows: “Construction of
FasTracks committed improvements within a
corridor will not start until there is a firm
commitment of all required funding sources,
be they private, local-match or federal
monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments
concerning permits, design and plan review
proves for timely implementation.”

process, and will be reported to local
governments and the public.

FasTracks is an integrated program of transit
improvements which includes:
•

•

•

Construction of rapid transit in six new
corridors, and enhancements and
extensions to existing rapid transit
lines in three corridors. The rapid
transit element includes light rail,
commuter rail and bus rapid transit.
Enhancements to bus service,
including an extensive feeder bus to
rail and bus rapid transit stations and
new suburb-to-suburb bus service
along major corridors.

Transit facilities and amenities
designed to improve passenger, safety,
convenience and use of the transit
system.

T

The FasTracks Program includes 119
miles of rail and 18 miles of bus rapid
transit.

The major components of the FasTracks Plan
are described in greater detail in the
following sections.

A
R
1.1

Rapid Transit Corridors

The FasTracks Plan includes 119 miles of rail
rapid transit in nine corridors and contributes
to the construction of 18 miles of bus rapid
transit. An overview of the rapid transit
elements of the FasTracks Plan is shown in
Figure 1, FasTracks Rapid Transit Corridors.
The recommendations for transit technology,
alignment and operating plans in each of the
corridors were developed through a
combination of Major Investment Studies,
(MISs), Environmental Impact Statements
(EISs) and Corridor Studies conducted since
1997.

A system of “FastConnects” timed
transfer points to enhance passenger
convenience and minimize wait times
for transfers between modes.

D

A brief history of the process and studies is
summarized for each of the corridors,
followed by a map depicting the major
corridor elements that will be funded as part
of the FasTracks Plan.

•

Thirty-one new park-n-Rides and
expansions to nine park-n-Rides –
more than an 80% increase over
existing and new T-REX spaces.

•

A major downtown multimodal Center
– Denver Union Station – which will
provide access to nearly every rapid
transit line as well as regional buses,
local circulators and inter-city rail and
bus service.

The Central Corridor light rail line opened in
October 1994 and was the first segment of
light rail in Denver. This light rail line is 5.3
miles in length, and extends from I-25 and
Broadway to the Denver downtown area,
and along Welton Street through Five Points
to 30th and Downing. The
Central Corridor has
fourteen stations and three
park-n-Rides.
The Central Corridor was
connected to the Southwest
Corridor light rail line in
July 2000, and to the
Central Platte Valley (CPV)
light rail spur in April
2002.

A number of rail infrastructure improvements
will be made along the Central Corridor to
improve service efficiency. Improvements
include a partial grade separation at 13th
Avenue and the construction of two
additional tracks between Broadway and
Alameda and between 10th
Avenue and Osage and the CPV
Junction.

T
F

FasTracks will also fund a new
circulator system to serve
commuters arriving at Denver
Union Station and needing to
travel to the Civic Center area of
downtown Denver and other
downtown destinations. The
specific route and characteristics
of the downtown circulator are
currently being defined as part
of the Downtown Multimodal
Access Plan (DMAP), currently
underway. Once the study is
complete, RTD will incorporate the final
alternative(s) into the FasTracks Plan. The
performance standards and characteristics
that have been defined for the circulator
include:

A
R

The CPV spur is a 1.8-mile
light rail line that serves
four stations and numerous
venues including the
Auraria Campus, Invesco Field at Mile High,
the Pepsi Center, Six Flags/Elitch Gardens
and Union Station.

D

The Central Corridor and Central
Platte Valley LRT lines will be
enhanced to serve as the spine of the
regional rail network.

•

To handle the forecasted ridership for build
out of the overall rapid transit system, the
FasTracks Plan will modify the existing light
rail stations in the Central Corridor and CPV
to accommodate four-car trains and extend
the light rail north from the 30th/Downing
station to the 40th/40th station where it
connects to the East Corridor. All
improvements will be subject to the results
of the final environmental process.

Service frequency that minimizes
dwell times

•

Quick service from one end of
Downtown to the other, with travel
times that are comparable to the 16th

for dedicated lanes on the
Circulator’s alignment).

•

Uniform, bi-directional service
throughout Downtown that is visible
and user-friendly

•

Free fare service for RTD patrons

•

Service to office and residential areas

•

Technology that is reliable, provides
adequate capacity, and is
environmentally friendly.

In 2003, RTD finished a Light Rail (LRT) and
Traffic Simulation Study to increase LRT
operating capacity through Downtown
Denver. The consultant study concluded
that it would be reasonable to operate 16
trains per hour in the downtown area. This
study also indicated that with signal timing
or physical modifications at two locations
RTD could operate four-car trains through
downtown Denver. FasTracks includes this
provision to increase operating capacity.

northeast along the railroad right-of-way to
Blake and East 40th Avenue. From there, the
alignment follows an easterly course along the
railroad right-of-way that parallels Smith Road
to Airport Boulevard, where the alignment
curves north. The alignment then roughly
follows Peña Boulevard north and
east to the airport terminal.

The East Corridor is 23.6 miles in length, and
connects downtown Denver and the eastern
portion of the metro area to Denver
International Airport (DIA) with five stations.
The East Corridor provides a number of
important transportation functions including
interstate/intrastate
travel along I-70;
regional access from
downtown Denver and
the eastern metro area
to DIA, linkage as an
“inner beltway”
between I-225 and I270, and access to
adjacent employment
areas and intermodal
freight facilities.

The MIS recommended a singletrack commuter rail line from
Denver Union Station to Denver
International Airport, including five
stations and reconstruction of I-70
and widening of I-70 between I-270
and Peña Boulevard. In 2003, RTD
and CDOT initiated an
Environmental Impact Statement for
the East Corridor, which is currently
on-going.

Development trends
indicate that the
corridor will be a major
regional destination for
future employment.
Several areas in the vicinity of this corridor
have a relatively high proportion of transitdependent residents who would benefit from
improved access to expanding employment

opportunities. Additionally, this corridor will
serve the substantial residential and business
growth in the former Stapleton Airport area and
the Gateway Area at 40th Avenue and Airport
Boulevard. Congestion along I-70 is forecasted
to be severe by the year 2025, resulting in slow
travel speeds, increased number of accidents,
and incident-related congestion.

The recommendations for the North Metro
Corridor were developed through an MIS
conducted by RTD between 1998 and 2001.
The MIS recommended an integrated plan of
transit, roadway, bus/high occupancy vehicle
(HOV) lane and corridor preservation to
improve mobility, reduce congestion and
improve access to all parts of the study area.

The North Metro Corridor includes the area
bounded by Pecos Street on the west, I-76
The North Metro Corridor will bring
rail to the northern metropolitan area
as well as preserve additional
opportunities to serve future needs.
on the east, 168th Avenue on the north, and
downtown Denver on the south. The North
Metro Corridor commuter rail line is 18
miles long and connects Thornton,
Northglenn and Commerce City to the
Denver metro area with eight stations and
provides connections to DIA through a rail
transfer at Denver Union Station. The City of
Thornton is planning transit oriented
development (TOD) at many of the proposed
rail stations.

T
F

The MIS recommended light rail or diesel
multiple unit (self-propelled commuter rail)
transit along the railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station to 124th Avenue,
preservation of right-of-way for future rapid
transit or rail service to Brighton, additional
park-n-Rides along the rail line and along
I-25, extension of Bus/HOV lanes on I-25
from US 36 to SH 7, addition of Bus/HOV
lanes on I-76 and SH 224, widening of I-25
and I-76, and implementation of grade
separations on US 85.

The Southeast Corridor (T-REX multi-modal
project) is currently under construction by
RTD and CDOT, and remains on-budget and
on-time to open in 2006. The Southeast
Southeast Corridor LRT will be
enhanced to serve growing demand
and extended to serve additional
communities.
Corridor includes 19.1 miles of light rail
transit with 13 stations along I-25 from
Broadway to Lincoln Avenue and along
I-225 from I-25 to Parker Road, as well as
reconstruction and widening of I-25.

Health One Hospital Complex on the west
side of I-25, a cross-over of light rail to the
east side of I-25 to a new station at the
planned Lone Tree Town Center, and an
extension south to an end-of-line station at
RidgeGate. The City and RTD worked
cooperatively to develop a supporting bus
plan. In July 2003, the RTD Board of
Directors accepted voter petitions from the
City of Lone Tree to hold an election in
November 2003 for the purposes of joining
the RTD District. On November 4, 2003,
Lone Tree voters approved annexation into
the District with support from 73 percent of
voters. The Lone Tree extension
improvements are subject to the results of
the final environmental process.

In 2002, the
City of Lone
Tree
approached
RTD with a
formal request
to evaluate the
feasibility of
joining the
RTD district.
(At that time,
the entire City
was not within
the legal
boundaries of
the District).
The request
was made to better serve the current and
future transit needs of the residents and
developing commercial areas. The City of
Lone Tree and RTD partnered to conduct a
study to evaluate the feasibility of extending
the current Southeast Corridor light rail line
south and east to serve the City’s current and
future developments. The study
recommended the extension of light rail
south along I-25 to a new station at the

US 36 Corridor and Longmont
Extension
The US 36 Corridor consists of two elements,
Bus Rapid Transit and Commuter Rail. The
Bus Rapid Transit highway portion would
extend 18 miles along US 36 from I-25 to
Table Mesa park-n-Ride in the City of Boulder
and includes 6 stations located in the center of
US 36 for easy loading and unloading of
passengers. BRT service would extend past
Table Mesa along Broadway to CU-Boulder
and north along 28th Street to 30th & Pearl.
The commuter rail portion of this corridor
would extend along railroad right-of-way from
Denver Union Station in downtown Denver to
the City of Boulder and then on to the City of
Longmont. This 38.1-mile commuter rail
corridor will have seven stations.

lanes along US 36 and implementation of Bus
Rapid Transit service with on-line stations,
widening portions of US 36, a single track
commuter rail line along the railroad right-ofway, and a bikeway along US 36. Subsequent
planning by RTD and the communities resulted
in a recommendation to extend the commuter
rail line to the City of Longmont along the
railroad right-of-way. In 2003, RTD and CDOT
initiated an Environmental Impact Statement
for the US 36 Corridor. This study is currently
on-going.

US 36 is the major artery connecting the
northwestern communities of
Boulder, Superior, Louisville,
•
.
,U?}6Ml,S
Lafayette, Broomfield,
Westminster and Arvada.
Final Report
The corridor provides access
to numerous employment
concentrations, including the
City of Boulder, the
University of Colorado, the
Interlocken Business Park,
the Flatiron Crossing regional
mall and downtown Denver.

D

Travel patterns along US 36
have changed significantly
over the years with the
expansion of urbanized development along the
corridor. Commuter trips are now destined to
multiple locations along the corridor, which
has resulted in significant increases in bidirectional congestion along US 36. Transit
usage is high, with many park-n-Rides and
buses at or over capacity.

The FasTracks Plan would fund the transit
recommendations from the MIS, including
funds to upgrade the existing railroad tracks
and build a new adjacent track for the
commuter rail line to Boulder, extend the
commuter rail line to Longmont in
a single track configuration, and
add six commuter rail stations.
Parking will be added in Niwot and
Longmont. FasTracks will also
include a commuter rail station in
Westminster at 71st Avenue and
Lowell Boulevard, and new and
expanded park-n-Rides for both rail
and bus service. For Bus Rapid
Transit, RTD will provide slip
ramps and access improvements to
park-n-Rides from Boulder to
Denver and funding for centerline
Bus Rapid Transit stations,
platforms and a proportional share
of HOV lanes ($66 million in 2002 dollars)
with coordination from CDOT. Also included
is funding ($8 million in 2002 dollars) for the
commuter bikeway. The final transportation
improvements in this corridor are subject to
the results of the on-going EIS.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

US 36 Commuter Rail and BRT will
improve and extend service for one of
the largest transit markets in the
region.

RTD conducted an MIS between 1998 and
2001 for the corridor which recommended a
set of multi-modal transportation
improvements including extension of HOV

The West Corridor is a 12.1-mile light rail
transit line that extends west from Denver
Union Station in downtown Denver through
west Denver, Lakewood and Jefferson
County and is served by 11 light rail stations.
The line follows the former Associated
Railroad right-of-way (approximately 12th and
13th Avenues), and parallels West 6th Avenue
and I-70, two of the most congested
highways in the region. Significant
population and employment growth is
West Corridor LRT will provide a
connection between Golden, the
Federal Center, and Downtown
Denver.

2003. RTD submitted the Final EIS to
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
in October 2003 and held a Final EIS
Public Meeting to review the
document. The FTA issued the Record
of Decision (ROD) on April 19, 2004.

T
F

The West Corridor begins at Denver
Union Station and follows the CPV
Spur to the Auraria West Station. It
then proceeds south to approximately
14th Avenue. From this point, it is
grade-separated from the Consolidated
Mainline by a structure over the freight
rail tracks and the South Platte River.
The alignment then follows the former
Associated Railroad right-of-way
alignment westerly. The alignment
remains on the Associated Railroad
from the South Platte River through the
park along
Lakewood Gulch
westerly to Quail
Street. At Quail,
the alignment turns
south still
remaining on the
existing Associated
Railroad trackbed
then across 6th
Avenue on a
structure into the
Federal Center.
From the Federal
Center the alignment continues in a
westerly direction under 6th Avenue
and Union Street and parallels 6th
Avenue on the north side of the
highway to its final end-of-line station
on the west side of the Jefferson County
Government Center. The FasTracks
Plan would fund all recommendations
from the EIS.

A
R

forecast for the corridor, creating significant
burdens on both the highways and arterials
in the corridor. The West Corridor would
serve a significant number of
low-income, minority and nonvehicle households that are
transit-dependent and provide
access to employment
opportunities in downtown
Denver and the City of
Lakewood. The West Corridor
has been the subject of
transportation improvement
studies for more than 25 years,
and state and local agencies are
in agreement of the need for
additional transportation
capacity improvements.

D

RTD initiated an MIS for the West
Corridor in 1997 which recommended
light rail transit in the corridor, as well
as bicycle, pedestrian and roadway
improvements. In 2001, RTD initiated
an EIS and preliminary engineering
efforts for the West Corridor. The RTD
Board adopted the recommendations
from the Draft EIS in August 2003 and
RTD published a Final EIS in September
1-20

Enhanced bus services in the FasTracks Plan
include:

Bus Service Enhancements

1.2.A Enhanced Bus Services
Bus service will continue to be a major
component of RTD’s transit services.
FasTracks offers a family of bus services
tailored to individual markets and linked
together to create a comprehensive network.
RTD recognizes that basic bus services are
critical to our transit-dependent customers, not
only non-driving elderly and disabled patrons,
but also those in lower income communities
who depend upon transit accessibility for
economic and quality of life factors. RTD will
continue to operate Local, Limited, Express,
and Regional fixed route service, call-n-Ride,
access-a-Ride, seniorRide and Special Event
services. FasTracks adds several new bus
service elements such as an extensive bus

• Bus Feeder Service to Rapid Transit
Every rapid transit corridor will have a
reconfigured local bus network to take
advantage of connectivity to rapid transit
lines and serve new destinations as a
result of growth through 2025. Enhanced
feeder service to rapid transit lines is
proposed throughout the region, as
illustrated in Figure 1-12, further
enhancing connections at travel origins
and destinations.

T
F

• Suburb-to-Suburb Service
The FasTracks Plan incorporates suburbto-suburb bus service, recognizing that
employment, residential, commercial
and educational opportunities are
dispersed throughout the metro area.
New suburb-to-suburb service includes
transit connections between major
employment centers and park-n-Rides in
the outlying areas. The suburb-to-suburb
service is designed around a network of
timed FastConnects, or transfer points.

A
R

Bus Service Enhancements will serve
growing needs and optimize the
efficiency of services provided.

D

feeder service to the rail and BRT stations,
suburb-to-suburb bus service along major
corridors, and timed transfer points to improve
bus connections and make it more convenient
for passengers to travel throughout the region.
Following RTD policy, all bus service in
FasTracks will take into account community
input, RTD service standards and the results of
the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
process. Communities also have the option of
choosing other RTD services, such as call-nRides instead of fixed route bus service, to
meet their local service needs.

By 2025, RTD will provide an additional
700,000 hours of bus service annually, an
increase of 36 percent over 2003 bus service
levels. Figure 1-11 illustrates RTD’s bus
service enhancements, with new and improved
service highlighted. Figure 1-12 provides an
overview of future transit service frequencies
for the enhanced FasTracks bus plan.

• FastConnects
FastConnects provides efficient
connections for those transferring from
one transit vehicle to another. This
applies to bus-to-bus, bus-to-rail, bus-toBRT, and rail-to-bus transfers. Service is
designed so that buses and trains
traveling to multiple destinations are
timed to arrived at a major destination or
transfer facility at the same time,
minimizing the time a passenger has to
wait. FastConnects improves the overall
efficiency of the transit network and
reduces travel times for patrons.

Transit Facilities

The FasTracks Plan will include investments
in transit facilities to complement the
proposed rapid transit lines and enhanced
bus service. Facilities include park-n-Rides,
transit centers and FastConnects.
1.3.A park-n-Rides
Park-n-Rides are the backbone of the RTD
transit system. Currently there are 65 park-nRides with
over 21,000
spaces. These
facilities
provide
flexibility for
those who
want to use
transit, but
want the convenience of having direct
access to their own vehicle. FasTracks will
provide funding to increase the number of
parking spaces at existing park-n-Ride
facilities and construct new park-n-Rides to
serve growing areas of the metro region.

Transit centers have amenities such as
restrooms, passenger seating, and
concessions. These facilities serve as
collection and distribution points for buses
and rail within central business districts
(CBDs). RTD transit centers include Market
Street Station, Civic Center Station, and the
Boulder Transit Center at 14th/Walnut Street.
Denver Union Station (DUS), described in
the next section, will serve as the major
transit center hub for the region.

T
F

FastConnects are designated points where
extensive transit transfers can occur outside
the CBD. These points may be park-n-Rides,
rail stations, designated shopping centers or
employment centers where bus routes
connect.

A
R

D

FasTracks has identified nine park-n-Rides to
be expanded and 31 new park-n-Rides to be
built along major transportation corridors for
a total of over 21,000 new parking spaces.
FasTracks will increase the number of
parking spaces (both existing and under
construction) throughout the district by over
80%. Figure 1-14 shows the park-n-Ride
improvements provided by the FasTracks
Plan.
1.3.B

At these designated points, transfers between
buses and/or rail are coordinated to
minimize wait times between transfers. The
primary purpose of this concept is to
improve transit service for suburb-to-suburb
travel. The FastConnects concept allows for
seamless transit connections between
suburbs and minimizes the wait time
between connections, dramatically
enhancing transit services. At major
FastConnects such as the Federal Center and
Stapleton, additional passenger amenities
will be provided.

Transit Hubs

Transit hubs are facilities where extensive
transfers between transit can occur (i.e., busto-bus transfers, bus-to-rail transfers, bus-toBRT transfers, and rail-to-rail transfers). In
the FasTracks Plan, transit hubs have been
assigned to two categories: transit centers
and FastConnects.

Denver Union Station is the proposed
location for a Downtown Multimodal
Center, a centralized intermodal facility that
provides access to all parts of the Denver
metro region. As the central intermodal hub
for the region, the DUS Vision Plan will
provide access to nearly every rapid transit
corridor included in FasTracks as well as
Regional, Express and Local bus service, the
16th Street Mall, Amtrak, the Ski Train,
Greyhound, and the new Downtown
Circulator.
DUS is located on a 19.5-acre parcel in the
Central Platte Valley. The DUS Master Plan,
currently under development, has identified
a recommended vision for the facility. The
recommended vision locates all rail access to
DUS underground allowing for the extension
of 18th Street between Wynkoop and
Wewatta Streets. The recommended vision
represents the ultimate buildout of DUS
beyond
FasTracks.

In addition to providing enhanced
connections, Denver Union Station also
provides an opportunity to create a dense,
mixed-use transit oriented development
adjacent to the transit facility. The Denver
Union Station Master Plan identifies an
opportunity for nearly two million square
feet of development on the DUS site.

DUS will be the “Grand Central

Transit Amenities

The FasTracks Plan incorporates
improvements to increase passenger security,
convenience and access to the system.
Major elements include the following:
1.4.A Passenger Security and
Information
FasTracks will provide an expansion of
RTD’s passenger security system. Emergency
phones and security cameras will be
installed at all stations and major park-nRides. In addition to cameras on RTD buses
and rail vehicles, security provisions include
remote monitoring of rail and bus stations
through RTD’s Security Command Center at
the Mariposa light rail facility. Using state-ofthe-art
equipment,
RTD is able
to transmit
live camera
pictures to a
viewing
center
located
inside the
RTD Security Command Center. This room
is monitored by trained technicians who
review the live pictures for signs of activity
requiring either a law enforcement response
or the rendering of other aid. All cameras
record continuously and these recordings are
kept for periods of up to one month to allow
after-the-fact review of incidents. RTD
places cameras on train platforms and in
parking lots that service light rail stations.
Upon completion of the T-REX project, 256
cameras will be monitored. In addition,
RTD employs a private security firm to
provide on-site monitoring of RTD transit
facilities.

Real time passenger information will be in
place for major rail stations along the
Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte
Valley rail lines (including Denver Union
Station). With FasTracks, the
communications infrastructure will be put in
place as part of the construction of the rapid

Bicycle Facilities

FasTracks will provide bike racks at all
stations, bike lockers at major stations and
park-n-Rides, and will accommodate bike
access to rail stations and park-n-Rides from
existing bike paths and bike routes.
FasTracks will also contribute half the cost of
the proposed bike path along the US 36

The Regional Transportation District (the “District” or “RTD”), has developed a comprehensive $4.7
billion Plan, known as “FasTracks” for addressing mobility needs in the metropolitan Denver region
over the next twelve years. The ability to implement the FasTracks plan depends on a variety of
financial assumptions and projections that have been developed using the best available current
estimates of costs, reasonably anticipated federal funding based on current federal law and
regulations, and revenues from other sources including RTD sales tax and fare collections. Over the
anticipated build-out of twelve years specific cost items, federal and other contributions, and RTD
revenues may vary. Based on the extensive analysis behind the financial assumptions used, RTD
expects to deliver the major transit corridors and related improvements within the time frames set forth
previously. RTD cannot guarantee that each separate assumption will be met, and expects that over a
twelve year time-frame, certain adjustments and modifications will be required. This section details the
assumptions used and provides further explanation as to how RTD expects to pay for the FasTracks
Plan.

T
F

Unlike typical transit development strategies, which are pursued one corridor at a time and can take
decades to accomplish, the Plan offers a comprehensive, region-wide approach to transit
development.

A
R

Under the Plan, 40 miles of Light Rail, 79 miles of Commuter Rail and 18 miles of Bus rapid transit
improvements will be developed between 2005 and 2017.
Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006 and 2020, and by 1.5%
per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase by 30% over
2003 service levels.
In order to finance the Plan, the District will seek voter approval for a 0.4% increase in the regional
sales and use tax. This will bring the total transit tax rate in the District to 1%, comparable to other
areas in the Western United States with urban rail systems.

D

The Plan also anticipates $815.4 million in Federal discretionary new start grant funding in conjunction
with $110.0 million in other Federal grant funding, and contributions from local jurisdictions benefiting
from transit in an amount equal to 2.01% of total project costs or $95.03 million system-wide.
In addition to Federal grants, the Plan assumes a loan from the US DOT under the Transportation
Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (“TIFIA”) program in the amount of $142.7 million.
Table 2-1 summarizes the sources of funds expected to pay for the Plan’s $4.7 billion of project
expenditures:

The Plan – Projected Capital Costs

Integral to the Plan is the ability to simultaneously improve mobility throughout the region. This
approach will not only address congestion needs, but will also provide an unprecedented economic
stimulus to the region, providing a measure of protection against recession through 2017.

T
F

The Plan includes six new multi-modal corridors involving light rail, commuter rail and bus rapid transit
improvements. Base bus service levels will increase by 1% per year between the years 2006-2020,
and by 1.5% per year between 2021 and 2025. Overall, 2025 bus revenue service hours will increase
by 30% over 2003 service levels. Significant expansions to the existing Southwest, Southeast, Central
Platte Valley and Central corridors, parking enhancements and additional buses and LRVs for the
current system are also funded.

The District has proposed a $4.7 billion Plan designed to transform urban mobility opportunity in the
metropolitan Denver region within a twelve-year period. Unlike the traditional corridor-by-corridor
approach, usually highly dependent on external funding from the Federal government, the District’s
Plan allows local policy makers and voters to direct the agenda in terms of project delivery and funding
options. The Plan responds to the projected increase in District population to 3.39 million in 2025.

Packet Pg. 175

10.1.b

Revenues
Since inception, the primary funding source for the District has been a sales and use tax imposed on
transactions within the District boundaries. Effective January 1, 1974, the District imposed a tax
equal to 0.5%. On May 1, 1983, the tax was increased to 0.6% or six-tenths of one percent and the
tax base was adjusted. The current tax generates revenues of $210.447 million annually (2003).

T
F

As seen in Table 2-3, although revenues are down in 2002-2003, the District has experienced sales
tax growth over the past decade up to 12.4% per annum.

In November, 2003, voters in the City of Lone Tree approved annexation into the RTD District. In
February, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors annexed the Park Meadows Mall into the District. The
sales and use tax forecasts assume that RTD will begin collecting sales and use tax from Lone Tree
as of January 1, 2004, and from Park Meadows as of July 1, 2004. This results in an increase of
$4.758 million to RTD's base collections in 2004, and an additional increase of $1.257 million to
RTD's base collections in 2005.
Fundamental to the Plan, is the assumption of a voter-approved increase in the sales and use tax
during the November, 2004 election of an additional 0.4%. This would bring the total sales tax rate to
1%, equal to that imposed for transit in Dallas, Houston, and Los Angeles, Santa Clara, San Mateo
Counties in California, and the total sales taxes for transportation in the San Francisco Bay Area
Counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, and San Francisco.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Sales and Use Tax

The 0.4% tax is assumed to be effective on January 1, 2005, and would initially generate an
additional $158.2 million in sales and use tax revenues annually. Both the new incremental tax and
revenue from the existing tax are used to fund the Plan.

New Tax

The sales tax growth rates used by RTD to project revenue growth in the plan are based on two
sources. Sales tax growth projections from 2004 through 2009 were based on the Colorado
Legislative Council (CLC) forecasts. The sales tax growth rates for the years 2010 through 2025 were
provided by AECOM which based their forecasts on data from the Center for Business and Economic
Forecasting (CBEF). CLC growth forecasts, while for the entire state, are used in the report because
the Denver region constitutes over half the population of the state.

Local Contributions

This Plan assumes that this policy will continue and that impacted jurisdictions will contribute an
amount in aggregate equal to 2.5% of the eligible corridor costs, which equates to 2.01% of total
project costs. On a plan wide basis, the amount of this contribution is estimated to total $95.03
million.

T
F

The source of funding for the local contribution is at the discretion of each local jurisdiction. Local
contributions could consist of right-of-way dedications, permit fee waivers, cash contributions,
corridor utility relocations as well as any other direct, project-related corridor contributions. Generally
throughout the system, the financial benefits from transit development in terms of assessed
valuations, enhanced development potential, reduced travel times and improved congestion accrue
to the local communities.
On February 17, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors approved a resolution entitled “Regarding Board
Commitments for FasTracks (Hold Harmless)”. This action confirmed RTD’s commitment to build
each corridor’s specific list of corridor improvements consistent with and as described in the
FasTracks Plan and within the fiscal constraints and schedule of the plan subject to the completion of
the environmental process and conformity with any federal Record of Decision for a corridor. It further
formalized the commitment to analyze the Plan annually to determine current revenue projections
from both local and federal sources. The resolution states, “If RTD revenues are better or worse than
expected then all the corridors will be adjusted accordingly.”

A
R

Additionally, the Hold Harmless resolution commits "that prior to construction, a corridor cost risk
assessment and value engineering (will) be conducted to minimize the potential for cost overruns and
schedule delays. Based on the results of both analyses, modifications to individual corridor project
elements, service plans, and schedules may be necessary for all FasTracks corridors.This may be
necessary so as to not impact the scheduled construction and operation of the remaining FasTracks
corridors, thereby "holding harmless" those corridors. This information shall be reported annually to
the general public.

D

Furthermore, the sixth point in the approved resolution reads as follows: “Construction of FasTracks
committed improvements within a corridor will not start until there is a firm commitment of all required
funding sources, be they private, local-match or federal monies and intergovernmental agreements
are in place with local governments concerning permits, design and plan review proves for timely
implementation.”

Federal Funding

Both the Southwest and the Southeast corridor projects were undertaken with assistance from the
Federal Transit Administration in the form of New Start Grant funds. Under Federal procedures, once
a project is qualified for funding, the FTA enters into a “Full Funding Grant Agreement” or FFGA. The
Agreement sets forth the maximum amount of the Federal contribution, and the percentage of federal
funding. In the case of the Southwest Corridor, the federal New Start percentage was 68% and in the
case of Southeast the Federal percentage was 60% of the project costs.
The Plan assumes that only three corridors, the East, West and Gold Line, will seek federal
discretionary funding through an FFGA. The total amount of Federal funding is assumed to be
$815.4 million in Federal New Start Grant funds and $110.0 million of other Federal grant revenues.
Of the $110.0 million, the Plan includes $50 million in federal assistance from FTA in the form of bus
discretionary funds for Denver Union Station or for other bus projects such as vehicles and facilities.
In addition, the Plan assumes $60 million in federal flexible dollars through the DRCOG planning
process between years 2010 and 2015 consistent with the District's past receipts. The New Start
funding is assumed to equal to 49% of the project costs for each of the corridors.

2-7

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Beginning with the Central Platte Valley and the Southeast Corridor project, the District has
established a policy of requiring a portion of major project costs to be paid by local jurisdictions.

Packet Pg. 178

The District has the option to focus Federal participation in other corridors, or to seek Federal funding
for multiple corridors in response to Federal policy initiatives or funding availability in the future. The
Federal transit program is currently subject to reauthorization. As with prior reauthorizations, the
level of federal match is subject to change by the Congress. Although the statutory local match has
been at 20% for some time, the practical match for competitive projects has been historically near the
40% level. Congress may change the statutory match in subsequent reauthorizations. Federal
receipts are assumed to be capped at a reasonable appropriation level based on past RTD receipts
of New Start Grant Funding and current Federal funding practices. Therefore the financial plan has
accounted for instances when the Federal funding is received after the year in which the costs are
incurred.

T
F

Interest Earnings

During the construction period, the District will accumulate balances of both sales tax revenues as
well as bond proceeds awaiting expenditures. In developing the Plan, debt issuances were
scheduled every two years to allow the District to take advantage of federal arbitrage rules generally
allowing local issuers to keep positive interest earnings if all bond proceeds are expended within a
designated two-year test.

A
R

The Plan assumes investment revenues will be earned at a rate equal to 4.0%. Thus, with the
exception of the variable rate debt, we have not assumed any net positive arbitrage on bond
proceeds. Any such earnings would act as either additional revenues or as an offset against higher
borrowing costs.
Sales tax cash balances have been managed to ensure a projected minimum of $25 million in the
Transit Development Reserve at the end of each year.
Between 2005 and 2017, investment earnings are projected to total $234.34 million.

D

Farebox Revenue Forecasts

Base System
Base system farebox revenues were based on the forecast contained in RTD’s 2004 Adopted
Budget. This forecast was based on the 2003 Amended Budget forecast of farebox revenues,
adjusted for the fare increase that occurred on January 1, 2004, and the additional service provided
as of January 1, 2004 with the annexation of the city of Lone Tree into the RTD District.
Farebox revenue forecasts for the base system for the years 2005-2025 assumed growth based on
population growth and service growth. Farebox revenues were assumed to increase with the rate of
population growth each year, due to ridership increases associated with population growth.
Additional increases were tied to increases in service, with farebox revenue assumed to increase at
75% of the systemwide average revenue per service hour with each increased hour of bus service
provided. These adjustments were initially applied in constant 2004 dollars.
FasTracks Corridors
For the FasTracks corridors, RTD prepared travel forecasts for the horizon years of 2015 and 2025.
Both forecasts assumed the full build-out of the FasTracks rapid transit system. Although some lines
open later than 2015, these forecasts allowed RTD to understand ridership growth as a result of
population and employment growth between those horizon years.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

10.1.b

Second, RTD combined the construction schedule with the forecasts. Passenger fare revenues were
assumed to start six months after operating costs are incurred. This reflects the fact that each
corridor will incur operating costs for six months of testing and start-up, before passenger fares are
collected.

The travel forecasting model produces daily ridership estimates. The fare recovery rates are applied,
then the daily fare totals are annualized. The annualization factor was adjusted to ensure that it did
not overestimate fare revenues for existing years of 2001 and 2002, and also cross-checked for
reasonableness. The Federal Transit Administration allows annualization factors of up to 300x daily
ridership in the Federal New Starts process. FasTracks was calibrated at 288x daily ridership from
the model, well under the allowable standard.
Fare Increases
The initial farebox revenue projections were developed in constant year dollars, and adjusted to
incorporate fare increases to keep pace with inflation. RTD fiscal policies state that RTD’s six-year
Transit Development Program (TDP) will include periodic fare increases to permit fare revenues to
keep pace with cost increases, as measured by the Denver-Boulder Consumer Price Index (CPI-U).
Over the past 15 years, the timing of these increases has ranged from annually, as in the years 20022004, to an eight-year period between the 1989 and 1997 fare increases.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Third, existing average fares paid by class of service were applied to the ridership forecasts for each
corridor in constant 2001 dollars. Based upon the forecast boardings by station, RTD estimated the
percentages of riders on each corridor expected to be paying local, express, regional, and skyRide
fares. Table 2-4 shows the 2001 average fare paid by class of service.

The 2004-2009 TDP, as adopted by the Board of Directors in August 2003, assumed fare increases
in 2006 and 2009 to keep pace with inflation. These fare increases were assumed to yield an 8%

increase in fare revenue after any ridership loss caused by the fare increases. The FasTracks
farebox revenue forecasts assume that these fare increases will be implemented, and that similar
fare increases will be implemented every third year after 2009. Therefore, the constant dollar
revenue forecasts were adjusted to nominal dollars by assuming an 8% revenue increase every third
year, beginning in 2006.

Debt Financing Requirements

Historically, the District has utilized two primary debt-financing techniques: Sales Tax Revenue
Bonds and Certificates of Participation (COPs). This section describes a possible scenario for
utilizing these methods of financing, along with other borrowing methods including commercial paper
and federal loans. Provided RTD keeps within voter approved ballot authorizations for debt and
repayment, RTD may use any combination of legally available financing methods and the amounts
set forth in the discussion below are subject to change.

T
F

The District currently has $273,415,000 in sales tax bonds outstanding. In August 2001, a
commercial paper program, secured by sales tax revenues on a junior lien to the fixed rate sales tax
bonds was implemented in the amount of $118.5 million. Of this amount, $92.5 million has been
issued.

The District has used COPs, which are a form of lease purchase debt for financing buses and rail

Bond issues are staggered in two-year increments in order to reduce costs associated with issuance
and to provide the opportunity for the District to take advantage of arbitrage earnings opportunities.
Bonds are assumed to be issued on a fixed rate basis, but this is not required. An assumed TIC
(True Interest Cost) of 6.354% representing current rates plus a margin in excess of 100 basis points
was used in the Plan. For Plan purposes, all bonds were assumed to be issued on January 1 of their
respective years of issuance and have a thirty year maturity.

In the Southeast Corridor Plan, the District addressed the problem of lagging Federal grant receipts
through the creation of a commercial paper program. Commercial paper allows the District to provide
short term, interim financing of the Federal cash flow and thus keep the project on schedule.
While it is currently impossible to predict the ability of the FTA to meet its cash flow requirements in
the 2007-2017 timeframe, it is highly probable that some form of interim financing will be required.

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

Sales tax revenue bond issues totaling $2.52 billion have been projected in accordance with the
schedule in Table 2-8:

As with the Southeast Corridor Plan of Finance, a Tax Exempt Commercial Paper Program (CP) is
recommended as an interim funding vehicle to ensure delays in the receipt of Federal Funds do not
delay the construction of the corridors.
Commercial paper is a commonly used financing tool that allows issuers to “ramp-up” their debt for a
term ranging from one day to 270 days. This flexibility makes it possible for issuers to keep the debt
2-13

Packet Pg. 184

10.1.b

In the case of the FasTracks Plan, $815.4 million of commercial paper is assumed. This will fund
expected Federal commitments with the funding schedule varying for each corridor. In other words,
the Plan allows federal support to lag the project cash flow requirements without delaying the
construction schedule.

TIFIA Loan

TIFIA, or the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 provides a new source
of project financing to eligible projects. Under the provisions of TIFIA, the US DOT can provide direct
loans, credit enhancement or lines of credit.
To date, TIFIA has approved financing instruments totaling $3.59 billion for 11 projects. Transit
projects that have utilized TIFIA include Washington Metro, the Tren Urbano project in Puerto Rico,
the Staten Island Ferries, Miami Intermodal Center and the New York Penn Station renovations.

A
R

Eligible projects must meet some specific federal criteria. These include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Project must be at least $100 million
TIFIA support limited to 33% of project costs
Project adheres to federal project requirements (labor, civil rights,etc.)
Repayment must be from project revenues or non-federal tax sources
Project sponsors senior debt must be investment grade

In the case of the Plan, we have recommended a loan in the amount of $142.95 representing 33% of
the North Metro project costs. (The District may choose to program a different corridor for federal
participation depending on project delivery strategy at the time of implementation).

D

The advantage of the TIFIA program is it allows the District to borrow on a subordinate basis to its
other debt. The financing rate is based on the 30-year Treasury bond rate, which is currently 5.07%.
(The basis of the rate will be related to a spread over the SLGS rate as Treasury phases out the 30year bond but will be comparable). For purposes of this plan a 6.00% TIFIA rate was assumed.
Repayment of the loan may be deferred to accommodate senior debt requirements and amortized
over 35 years. Loans may also be repaid early without penalty. While the interest rate is higher than
traditional tax-exempt debt, it is low compared to other deeply subordinate debt options and it
provides excellent flexibility.
The current federally adopted selection criteria for TIFIA projects include the following eight elements:
(1) The extent to which the project is nationally or regionally significant, in terms of generating
economic benefits, supporting international commerce, or otherwise enhancing the national
transportation system (20 percent);
(2) The creditworthiness of the project, including a determination by the Secretary that any
financing for the project has appropriate security features, such as a rate covenant, to ensure
repayment (12.5 percent);
(3) The extent to which such assistance would foster innovative public-private partnerships and
attract private debt or equity investment (20 percent);
(4) The likelihood that such assistance would enable the project to proceed at an earlier date
than the project would otherwise be able to proceed (12.5 percent);
(5) The extent to which the project uses new technologies, including Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) that enhance the efficiency of the project (5 percent);

outstanding for only the time it is needed, until permanent funds are received. In recent years, nearly
every transit agency undertaking a new start project with federal funding as identified the need for an
interim funding vehicle such as commercial paper. Commercial paper may be issued using any
legally available technique for rate determination.

TABOR Requirements

The Plan is premised on voters approving a ballot issue in the November 2004 election the wording
of which was established by the Colorado legislature. It would give the District the necessary
authority to issue debt, increase the current tax rate by 0.4% and keep the revenue to build the
system. A portion of the tax increase may remain after the system is built, as operating costs for the
expanded system may be higher than for the current system.

T
F

While the increase in the authorized tax rate is fairly straight forward, the authorization for debt must
estimate both the principal amount of debt issued and the expected interest rate for transactions
extending through 2013. COPs have not been treated as debt subject to TABOR approval by the
Colorado courts and they are not included in the voter authorization.

A
R

There are three elements of the financial plan subject to the TABOR requirements: fixed rate bonds,
commercial paper and the proposed TIFIA loan. All of the estimated principal and interest for these
items are included in the amounts the voters will be asked to approve. How the principal and interest
is allocated among these different financing mechanisms is subject to change. The total amount of
principal and debt service the voters will be asked to approve is shown in Table 2-10.

As with any long range capital improvement plan, the actual implementation of the Plan is dependent
on project costs, inflation factors, revenue trends, and interest rate environment in the future. These
factors can never be predicted over a thirteen year horizon with exact precision.
For this reason, the Plan reflects significant contingencies. For example, the project cost estimates
contain a price contingency. Interest rates have been assumed to be over 150 basis points higher
than the Colorado municipal market data tax exempt current market rate of 4.81%. Variable interest
rates have been assumed to be more than 200 basis points over the current Bond Market
Association (BMA) index rate of 1.02%.
The FasTracks cost estimates also include contingency factors to account for unforeseen changes in
project scope or unit cost increases beyond general rates of inflation. The contingency was applied
to the items with the greatest risk factors for unforeseen cost changes, with factors varying by the
assessment of potential risk. Table 2-11 shows the overall contingency factors by cost element.

2-16

Attachment: Finishing-FasTracks-Report_2025_Appendix (5192 : Draft Finishing FasTracks Report)

The Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), or Article X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution,
approved by Colorado voters in November 1992, restricts the ability of the District to enter into a
multi-year fiscal obligation without voter approval unless there are adequate present cash reserves.
TABOR also requires voter approval in advance for: (i) any increase in the District’s revenues and
spending from one year to the next in excess of a specified growth rate, (CPI plus a growth factor
based on net increase in the value of new taxable property) (ii) any new tax or tax increase.

Thus, the FasTracks cost estimates used in the cash flow already include a total of $573 million in
uninflated dollars for contingency.
The Plan also automatically assumes that Federal grants will be received two years after initial
eligibility. To the extent Federal funding is provided on a more-timely basis, some of the debt
assumed in the Plan will be unnecessary.
Should the District be faced with a significant economic recession, or find project costs are
substantially higher than are currently estimated, and that such costs exceed the contingency budget,
the District has several options to address this situation. These include delaying projects, modifying
the scope of certain projects, seeking additional Federal or local funding or seeking additional voter
approved funding options. Prior to taking any of these actions, the Board will hold full and complete
public hearings and provide sufficient notice to the stakeholders in the region.

RESOLUTION NO. ()0'-{
, SERIES OF 2019
REGARDING RTD BOARD
COMMITMENT FOR FINISHING FASTRACKS
AND SUPPORTING THE PEAK SERVICE PLAN FOR
NORTHWEST RAIL

T
F

WHEREAS, the citizens of the Regional Transportation District
("RTD") passed a ballot initiative in 2004 to tax themselves to create a
comprehensive train and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its
suburbs ("FasTracks Pro2ram"), with an intended completion date of 2017
for the full project; and
WHEREAS, the full FasTracks Program was not completed in 2017,
with the current expectation being that approximately 70% of the project
mileage will be completed by 2020; and

A
R

WHEREAS, several corridors and extensions included in the
FasTracks Program have not been completed by the date of this Resolution,
nor have funds for their completion been identified or committed, namely, the
Northwest and the North Metro corridors, and the Central and the Southwest
Extensions (collectively, the "Unfinished Corridors"); and

D

WHEREAS, it remains the uncompromising intention of the RTD
Board to comply fully with and to fulfill the obligations created in the
FasTracks Program passed by the District voters in 2004 in as expeditious a
manner as possible; and
WHEREAS, the RTD Board has always acknowledged that these
FasTracks obligations are the expressed will of the electorate and that RTD is
required to comply therewith, which acknowledgement was previously
expressed, inter alia, in RTD Board Resolution No. 004, Series of 2011
("Concerning a 2011 FasTracks Election"); and
WHEREAS, a variety of factors created substantial changes and
challenges and increased capital costs in the FasTracks Program following the
2004 voter approval of said Program, which factors included, inter alia, (a)
the requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and
new signal systems and commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that

all but one of the trains be electric-powered rather than diesel-powered; (c)
additional EIS and local government drainage and traffic requirements; (d) an
increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased costs for
construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009; and
WHEREAS, while acknowledging the financial challenges, RTD will
not abdicate its responsibility to complete the Unfinished Corridors as
expeditiously as possible in a commercially reasonable manner, and to that
end, the RTD Board expresses its unqualified commitment to and promotion
of fiscally responsible actions intended to facilitate and effectuate the
construction of all the Unfinished Corridors; and

T
F

WHEREAS, in regard to one of the unfinished Corridors, staff from
jurisdictions along the Northwest Rail Corridor and from RTD have been
investigating the construction and operation of an interim commuter startup
service (the "Peak Service Plan or "Plan") along the unfinished portion of
the Northwest Corridor as a means of providing service to the Corridor in the
quickest manner possible; and

A
R

WHEREAS, the Peak Service Plan would provide rush hour service to
the presently unfinished portion of the Northwest Corridor, including three
trains from Longmont to Denver (and stations in between) in the morning
rush hour period, and three trains going from Denver to Longmont (and
stations in between) in the evening rush hour.

D

NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

1. The RTD Board expresses its continued commitment to the
completion of all the Unfinished Corridors, directing RTD staff to investigate
and research all reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and
operation of the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for
the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a report to the Board
within two months following adoption of this Resolution outlining proposed
steps to appropriately move forward on these Unfinished Corridors.
2. In regard to the Unfinished Corridors, the RTD Board acknowledges
and appreciates the value and potential of phased approaches and partnerships
such as the Peak Service Plan to bring interim service to the remaining
portion of the Northwest Rail corridor in the most rapid time frame
reasonably possible, expressing its expectation that RTD staff will proceed in

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Successor Strategic Plan Consultancy Solicitation

September 8, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the scope of work summary for a solicitation for a consultancy to
assist with the development of the successor five-year strategic plan for the 2026-2031 planning
horizon.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-26 Strategic Plan is an ambitious but actionable roadmap adopted by the Board of
Directors on August 10, 2021, that established the agency’s vision, mission, values, strategic
priorities, success outcomes, and key performance metrics. The Board subsequently adopted
revisions to the Strategic Plan in June and October 2024 and approved the current official version of
the plan that incorporates those revisions in April 2025.
Staff has successfully leveraged the 2021-26 Strategic Plan over its duration to gauge progress
toward measurable success outcomes and to make incremental enhancements in terms of
opportunity areas with respect to the four Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success. As a result, nearly every community,
customer, employee, and financial performance metric has seen substantial improvement from
2022, the first full year of the plan’s lifespan, to present.
DISCUSSION
As the sunset of the 2021-26 Strategic Plan approaches, RTD is seeking the services of a qualified
consultancy with ample transit agency experience related to strategic plan development and
maintenance; workshop and retreat facilitation; board, agency leadership, and stakeholder
engagement; and the development of measures, methodologies, and data systems used to manage
agency performance. The key deliverable for the project will be the successor five-year strategic
plan for the 2026-2031 planning horizon.
The strategic planning process led by the consultancy will include discovery of key aspects of the
agency, including but not limited to the vision, mission, organizational structure, transit service

Packet Pg. 249

18.A

delivery, and local, state, and federally required programs. The selected consultancy will lead and
facilitate a series of meetings and workshops with Board members, staff, and external stakeholders
to assess desired strategic outcomes and identify strategies, reflective of industry trends and transit
agency best practices, to achieve those outcomes.
In issuing this solicitation, RTD seeks the service of a qualified consultancy with ample and
demonstrable transportation/transit consulting experience to assist in planning and implementing.
Scope Summary
The selected consultancy will complete the following tasks:
• Task 1: Initial Discovery: Review of relevant agency documents, including but not limited to
prior strategic planning development documentation, relevant board materials and audits,
budgets, agency performance
• Task 2: Engagement with Key Groups: Virtual meetings to garner views and feedback on
current agency performance and desired outcomes
o Board Engagement
o Leadership Team Engagement
o Stakeholder Engagement
o Public Engagement
• Task 3: Success Outcomes and Long-term Goals Alignment; Tactics Development: Synthesis
of feedback garnered and insights from initial discovery; alignment regarding success
outcomes, long-term goals, and related tactics designed to achieve success over the life of
the strategic plan
• Task 4: Agency Performance Scorecard Development: Integration of tactics identified in
consultation with staff to populate an agency-wide performance scorecard designed to
deliver RTD’s definition of success
• Task 5: Agency Retreat: Full-day retreat to garner organizational alignment regarding
strategic planning elements
• Task 6: Strategic Plan Document Development and Presentation: Preparation of final iteration
of successor strategic plan and presentations during committee and monthly Board meetings

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
District Shops Hoists Replacement Contract Award

September 9, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a
contract with Rhinotrax Construction for the renovation of nine in-ground hydraulic bus hoists at the
RTD District Shops Division building. This includes replacement of eight hoists and the removal of one
hoist at the District Shops Bus Maintenance Facility. The base bid award amount of the contract is
$4,003,792.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jyotsna Vishwakarma, Acting Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the agency’s standard asset management renewal process, staff identified 11 original bus
hoists for replacement, repair and removal as part of RTD’s asset management protocols. The existing
hoists were installed during the original building construction in 1989 and have been repaired and had
parts replaced for over 35 years. Repair costs and efforts become increasingly challenging as the hoists
age. RTD will replace eight of the 11 hoists and remove one. The remaining two hoists will be
addressed in the future.
The new lifts are to be scissor and platform lifts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan Priorities
of Community Value, Employee Ownership and Financial Success.
On April 18, 2025, RTD issued Request for Proposal (RFP) 125FJ003 via RTD’s online solicitation
platform, OpenGov, for a contractor to complete the Hoist Replacement project at District Shops based
on RTD’s prepared plans and specifications. This project included a 15% Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise goal. Proposals were due on June 4, 2025. RTD’s evaluation committee met to review,
evaluate and score responsive proposals based upon the published evaluative criteria for this RFP. As a
result, the evaluation committee voted to recommend Rhinotrax Construction for award as providing
the best value to RTD.

Packet Pg. 263

18.B

Should the Board approve this recommendation, the contractor will phase installation of the lifts to
accommodate maintenance operations. The project is expected to be completed within 13 months
following contract award.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Up to 80% of the cost of this project will be paid through a federal grant. The remaining cost will be
funded from existing capital improvement dollars allocated in the 2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Tap-to-pay and Cash Digitization Retail Network Title VI
Fare Equity Analysis

September 9, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the introduction of tap-to-pay fare
payments to comply with federal laws, regulations and guidelines related to Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director of the Civil Rights Division
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Jake Bruemmer, Electronic Fare Collection Manager, Finance Department
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD
to evaluate fare changes, prior to implementation, to determine whether those changes will have a
disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The FTA defines a fare
change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media, creation of new
fare media, or the discontinuance of current fare media.
On May 28, 2025, the Board adopted the 2025-2028 Title VI Program Update, which included updates to
this definition. RTD defines a fare change as any increase or decrease in the price of fare media; the
introduction or discontinuation of fare media (e.g., cash, paper passes, mobile tickets); and changes to
fare products (e.g., Day Pass, Monthly Pass), fare levels (e.g., Standard, Airport), or customer categories
(e.g., full-fare, seniors, individuals with disabilities, Medicare recipients, LiVE participants and youth
under 20). Additionally, fare changes encompass modifications to Ticket Vending Machine (TVM)
access, including changes in the number of machines, fees, or payment options. The introduction of
contactless tap-to-pay fare payments allowing credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile
wallets to be accepted as valid fare payment media on RTD bus and rail validators meets this definition.
Thus, an analysis is required to be brought before the Board for approval. The complete Title VI Fare
Equity Analysis report is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Fare Equity Analysis Policies

Packet Pg. 265

18.C

Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. The Board-adopted policies
and their applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect Black, Indigenous and People
of Color (BIPOC) populations 5% more than the overall population’s ridership; this level of
impact is considered a disparate impact. “BIPOC” is defined as all persons who identify as being
part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A fare change should not adversely affect low-income
populations 5% more than the overall population’s ridership; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
200% of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
The purpose of this analysis is to assess whether the proposed fare change would result in disparate
impacts on BIPOC populations or disproportionate burdens on low-income populations. When a
proposed fare change results in a disparate impact, RTD must consider alternatives to avoid, minimize,
or mitigate the impact, demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the change and ensure that
no less-discriminatory alternatives exist that would achieve the same program goals. In cases where a
fare change results in a disproportionate burden on low-income populations, RTD will consider
practicable modifications to mitigate the impact as necessary.
DISCUSSION
Staff recommends the introduction of contactless tap-to-pay fare payments allowing credit cards, debit
cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets (including Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay) to
be accepted as valid fare payment media on existing RTD bus and rail validators. This is often referred
to as acceptance of “Open Payments” in the transit industry. The recommendation includes the
addition of new fare payment methods but proposes no elimination of existing fare media and no other
changes to fare policies. Tap-to-pay fare payments will be available to customers using RTD’s fixedroute services.
Currently, RTD offers a significant fare policy benefit in the form of daily and monthly fare capping to
customers, but only to those customers paying with their MyRide account, either via mobile phone or
smartcard. Customers paying with cash or using paper fare products do not benefit from fare capping.
With the acceptance of tap-to-pay fare payments, fare capping benefits will be extended to customers
paying with contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets. This
recommended fare change aims to provide RTD customers with additional electronic fare payment
options that enable them to receive benefits from fare capping.
Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated

Packet Pg. 266

18.C

from customer surveys and other relevant data sources. Customer survey analysis indicates whether
BIPOC and/or low-income customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service,
payment type, or payment media subject to the fare change.
The assessment included data from its 2024 systemwide onboard survey (2024 Onboard Survey), which
included 18,285 weekday responses (66% bus, 33% rail), weighted to reflect 170,000 average weekday
trips. Systemwide, BIPOC customers made up 55% of boardings and low-income customers 63%. As
part of the 2024 Onboard Survey, respondents were asked, “Do you have a credit or debit card,
including prepaid debit?” This question formed the basis for much of the fare equity analysis (i.e.,
assessing the accessibility of fare media across different respondent populations) and the
determination of adverse effects.
Additionally, RTD utilized the results of the demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash digitization”
retail network to discern fare media implications for survey respondents that do not currently have a
credit, debit, or prepaid debit card. Specifically, this analysis seeks to understand how this subset of
customers may participate in tap-to-pay payments and take advantage of fare policy benefits such as
fare capping. The Geographic Information System (GIS)-based analysis used demographic data from
the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 at the
census block group geographic level.
Summary of Findings
According to the 2024 Onboard Survey, approximately 90% of respondents across all customer
populations indicated that they have a credit or debit card, including a prepaid debit card, or were
observed using a credit or debit card. Across different respondent populations, the percentage having a
credit or debit card or were observed using a credit or debit card is consistent; 90% of all respondents,
89% of BIPOC respondents and 89% of low-Income respondents indicated that they have a credit, debit,
or prepaid debit card. This finding in isolation suggests that a substantial majority of customers, across
customer type, have access to the types of cards that would enable participation in tap-to-pay fare
payment media.
However, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents do not currently have a credit, debit, or prepaid debit
card, depending on the type of respondent. The percentage that do not have a credit or debit card but
do require fare payment media is relatively consistent; 5.6% of all respondents, 6.5% of BIPOC
respondents and 7.8% of low-income respondents. Among this subset of respondents, the most
popular product and fare media choices are 3-Hour Passes and Day Passes purchased with cash
onboard the bus, indicating ongoing reliance on cash.
A supplemental demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail network (i.e., adding 460
to 500 retail locations) found that the new retail locations will serve a population that is around 43%
BIPOC and 27% low-income, indicating greater proximity to these populations. Many of these retailers
sell prepaid debit cards. Therefore, if these locations are considered to be a representative sample of
retail locations that sell contactless, prepaid debit cards throughout the Denver metro area, then the

Packet Pg. 267

18.C

ability of BIPOC and low-income populations to access or participate in tap-to-pay fare payments is
favorable.
Of the remaining respondents without a credit, debit, or prepaid debit card, a sizeable share (3% to 5%
of overall respondents) are exempt from paying an RTD fare (e.g., Zero Fare for Youth program
participants) where fare media is not required, or were participants in an RTD Pass Program where
customers use their own smartphone or use a MyRide card provided to them.
Conclusions:
Based on the responses from the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash
digitization” retail network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests
that there would be no Disparate Impact on BIPOC populations and no Disproportionate Burden on lowincome populations. Taken together, the recommended fare change will advance RTD’s goals under its
2021–2026 Strategic Plan, particularly the priorities of delivering Community Value and Customer
Excellence, while ensuring continued compliance with Title VI federal regulations.
Staff concludes that the recommended fare change does not result in an inequitable distribution of
benefits or burdens. The acceptance of contactless tap-to-pay fare payments should provide greater
convenience and fare media options to all customer populations, including BIPOC and low-income
customer populations. Moreover, the expanded cash digitization network locations are suggested to
improve access for the subset of customers that may not have a credit, debit, or prepaid debit card. As
such, the recommended fare change should proceed as proposed.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

1 Introduction
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VI”) ensures that “no person in the United States shall, on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD” or “The District”) has committed to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Title VI objectives set
forth in Circular 4702.1B, ensuring that FTA-assisted benefits and related services are made available and are
equitably distributed without regard to race, color or national origin.
This analysis of the acceptance of contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets
(“Open Payments”) was prepared in conformity with the guidelines laid out in Chapter IV and Appendix K of FTA
Circular 4702.1B, Service and Fare Equity Analysis Questionnaire Checklist.
The Fare Equity Analysis described herein assesses whether the proposed change in fare payment media
acceptance is expected to result in Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) and low-income customers
bearing a greater share of negative impacts compared to customers overall, or whether BIPOC and low-income
customers would experience a lesser share of the positive impacts compared to customers overall.
Based on an analysis of the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests that there would be no Disparate
Impact on BIPOC populations, and no Disproportionate Burden on low-income populations. The acceptance of
contactless, Open Payments should provide greater convenience and fare media options to all RTD customer
populations, including BIPOC and low-income customer populations.

2 Overview of Proposed Fare Changes
RTD has proposed the acceptance of contactless credit cards, debit cards, prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets
(including Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay) as valid fare payment media. This is often referred to as
acceptance of “Open Payments” in the transit industry. The proposal includes the addition of new fare payment
methods, but proposes no elimination of existing fare media and no other changes to fare policies. Open Payments
will be available to customers using RTD’s Fixed Route services. The proposed change is summarized in greater
detail in the following sections.
Currently, RTD offers a significant fare policy benefit in the form of daily and monthly fare capping to customers,
but only to those customers paying with their MyRide account, either via mobile phone or smartcard. Customers
paying with Cash or using Paper fare products do not benefit from fare capping. With the acceptance of Open
Payments, fare capping benefits will be extended to customers paying with contactless credit cards, debit cards,
prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets. This fare change aims to provide RTD customers with additional electronic
fare payment options that enable them to receive benefits from fare capping.

2.1 Changes to Pricing, Fare Products, Customer Category Discounts
RTD’s fare structure, including fare pricing, fare products and customer category discounts, will remain unchanged
during and after the launch of Open Payments. Fare prices for Local and Airport services will remain unchanged,
and transfer policies will remain unchanged. Customers using contactless credit, debit and prepaid debit cards
and mobile wallets will continue to receive daily and monthly fare capping benefits when using the same fare
media and will pay the same amount per trip, per day and per month as customers making identical trips while
using other fare media including paper passes, MyRide Stored Value and mobile tickets. Customers using
contactless credit, debit, prepaid debit and mobile wallets will have the opportunity to register their card to their
RTD MyRide account (or register after opening a free RTD MyRide account) and receive fare discounts (Senior,
Persons with a Disability, Medicare and LiVE income-based discounts) that they are eligible for, using their
contactless fare media. Customers eligible for Zero Fare programs, including Youth, will continue to ride RTD at
no cost. There will be no additional fees charged by RTD to pay with contactless credit, debit, prepaid debit and
mobile wallets, and MyRide cards will remain free for RTD customers. As there are no changes in fare pricing, fare
products, customer category discounts or card fees, there are no anticipated changes in the systemwide average
fare or product-specific average fares, in aggregate or across customer populations.

2.2 Changes to Fare Media & Fare Distribution
The introduction of contactless, Open Payments is an incremental form of fare media which RTD customers are
free to adopt. No existing forms of fare media are being eliminated or altered. The addition of contactless credit,
debit and prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets should increase customer opportunities to acquire fare media.
The introduction of contactless credit, debit and prepaid debit cards and mobile wallets supplements existing fare
media choices for RTD customers. Cash will continue to be accepted on-board buses, at TVMs, at ticket book and
pass vending machines at select stations, and at RTD’s four Sales Outlets. Paper fare products will still be available
from RTD Sales Outlets, at Safeway and King Soopers retailers, from ticket book and pass vending machines at
select stations, and through online purchase. MyRide fare payment via mobile phone or smartcard will continue
to be accepted. MyRide smartcards will continue to be free to RTD customers. Mobile tickets will still be available

in the MyRide, Transit, and Uber apps. While some unbanked and underbanked RTD customers are unlikely to
have ready access to contactless credit and debit cards issued through banking establishments, contactless
prepaid debit cards are widely available at retail outlets throughout the service area without the need for a formal
banking arrangement or credit history check. Although the exact number of locations within the RTD service area
that vend prepaid debit cards is unknown, the forthcoming introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network provides some sense of scale. The InComm-based VanillaDirect cash digitization network aims to add
approximately 460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores,
large retail outlets and dollar stores. These types of retailers are frequently sellers of prepaid debit cards, so it is
likely that there are approximately 460 retail outlets or more in the RTD service area and surrounding communities
that sell prepaid debit cards. The introduction of contactless, Open Payments increases fare media choice and RTD
customer convenience while retaining all other existing fare media options and distribution channels for RTD
customers.

3 Title VI Policies
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 601 states:
“No persons in the United States shall, on the grounds of race, color, or national origin, be excluded
from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any
program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”
It is RTD’s objective to avoid, minimize or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse impacts on BIPOC and lowincome populations. As a recipient of financial assistance from the FTA, RTD is required to comply with Title VI of
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its own Title VI Program adopted in accordance with same by evaluating major
service and fare changes at the planning and programming stages to determine whether those changes have
discriminatory impacts, including Disparate Impacts on BIPOC populations and/or Disproportionate Burdens on
low-income populations.
According to the Federal Department of Transportation, equity in the provision of transit service is "providing
equal levels of service to minority and non-minority residents of the urbanized area. Levels of service, in turn, are
defined in terms of capital allocation and accessibility." 1 The metrics of discrimination that could be monitored
for disparate treatment include fare structures that could consistently cause minority-group customers to bear a
higher fare burden than the overall riding public, access to specialized fare media, or methods of communication
to populations with Limited English Proficiency. However, a Title VI Equity Analysis should not replace good
program planning, which should be an ongoing process that considers equity among other factors when designing
fare changes, service changes, or discretionary policies and programs.
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate
Burden Policy for evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. As part of the 2025
Title VI Program Update, RTD maintained their 5% threshold for determining a Disparate Impact or
Disproportionate Burden of a fare modification as established in RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact or Disproportionate
Burden Policy. The RTD Board-adopted 2025 Title VI Program Update also clarifies what constitutes a Fare Change.
The detailed policies used by RTD for analysis of proposed fare changes are found in the following sections.

3.1 Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policies
The FTA requires that transit agencies assess whether a proposed fare change or major service change would have
a “Disparate Impact” on minority populations, or “Disproportionate Burden” on low-income populations, under
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title 49 C.F.R. Section 21.5(b)(2) and (b)(7), and Appendix C to Title 49 C.F.R.
part 21. Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, FTA requires public transit agencies operating 50 or more fixed route
vehicles in peak service, and located in urbanized areas of 200,000 or more people, to clearly establish, with input
through a public engagement process, threshold definitions for measuring Disparate Impacts and
Disproportionate Burdens.
RTD’s Fare Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies establish threshold standards for evaluating
the equity impacts and the distribution of adverse effects caused by any fare change or major service change.

These thresholds enable RTD to determine whether BIPOC and low-income customers would be
disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of the proposed changes and, by inference, whether the
overall ridership would disproportionately benefit from the proposed changes when compared to the protected
populations (BIPOC and low-income). These thresholds are based on the cumulative impact of the proposed
service or fare change.
The policies and their applicable analyses and thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
●

Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by BIPOC persons
as a result of any fare price change, which shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed
by the overall population ridership. “BIPOC” is defined as all persons who identify as being part of
racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.

●

Disproportionate Burden
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse effects
absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change, which shall not be greater than or
less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall population ridership. A low-income population is a group
of households who are at or below 200 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty
Guidelines.

3.1.1 Fare Changes
RTD defines a Fare Change as an increase in the price of fare media, decrease in the price of fare media,
introduction of new fare media or the discontinuance of current fare media, changes in fare types or products,
changes in fare levels, changes in customer category definitions/eligibility, and modifications to Ticket Vending
Machine access. Fare Media are defined as forms of payment for transit service (i.e., cash fare, paper pass, etc.).
Based on federal guidance, prior to adopting a fare change, RTD must conduct a Fare Equity Analysis and analyze
specific elements of the proposed structure and changes to fare media along with the recommended pricing
schema, to determine whether the changes would result in impacts that exceed the threshold established by the
policies. As referenced in C4702.1B, some fare changes are excluded from being the subject of a Fare Equity
Analysis, such as instances where all passengers ride free such as “Zero Fare for Transit Equity Day”; fare changes
undertaken during an emergency such as a natural disaster, if the change is intended to address an immediate
need; minor fare changes that do not affect the fare structure (e.g., minor fare rounding); and
temporary/promotional fare reductions, so long as the temporary fare reduction or promotional reduction does
not last longer than six months.

3.1.2 Adverse Effects
For the fare equity analysis, adverse effects include an increase in cost or a reduction in accessibility of fare media.
Benefits include a decrease in cost, increase in discounts for certain fare types or customer populations, or
increase in accessibility of fare media.

4 RTD Customer Characteristics
Several data sources were considered when evaluating the demographics and access characteristics of RTD
customers, namely the 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey and the demographic analysis of the MyRide “cash
digitization” retail network.

4.1 2024 Onboard Transit Customer Survey
As part of this equity review, RTD is committed to understanding which customers may be impacted by the
proposed introduction of contactless, Open Payments. Demographic characteristics summarized in this section
reflect results from RTD’s recently completed 2024 Onboard Transit Customer survey (2024 Onboard Survey). The
2024 Onboard Survey was an on-board, customer intercept survey undertaken between August 2024 and
December 2024, and captured 20,062 survey responses across 99 bus routes and 10 rail lines. For analysis
purposes, respondents who indicated they were visitors to the Denver metro area were excluded from the survey
results. After processing the survey results, approximately 10,092 of a total of 18,285 completed surveys (55% of
weighted survey responses) identified as BIPOC, and 8,800 of a total of 14,359 completed surveys (63% of
weighted survey responses) identified as low-income using a definition of 200 percent of the federal poverty level.
As part of the 2024 Onboard Survey, respondents were asked “Do you have a credit or debit card, including
prepaid debit?” This question formed the basis for much of the analysis in this section; however, it’s important to
acknowledge some potential shortcomings of the use of this question. First, the question does not specifically ask
whether respondents have contactless credit/debit/prepaid debit cards, which is a requirement for use as Open
Payments media. It is likely that some respondents who confirmed having a credit/debit/prepaid debit card may
not have a contactless card that would function as payment media on RTD services. It is worth noting that
contactless (cEMV) card penetration has increased rapidly since the COVID-19 pandemic and it is expected that
by 2027, virtually all credit/debit/prepaid debit cards are likely to include contactless payment technology, based
on California Air Resources Board (CARB) research 2. Second, the phrasing of the question could be interpreted as
possession of a credit/debit/prepaid debit card, or access to credit/debit/prepaid debit cards. Care should be
taken in the interpretation of survey results, given that respondents may have interpreted the question in
different ways.
According to the 2024 Onboard Survey, approximately 90% of respondents across all customer populations
indicated that they have a credit or debit card, including a prepaid debit card, or were observed using a credit or
debit card (financial data from RTD indicates that 99.4% of all MyRide Stored Value transactions and mobile ticket
purchases by value were made with a credit or debit card, so respondents indicating that they paid with MyRide
were included in the percentage possessing a credit or debit card). Across different respondent populations, the
percentage having a credit or debit card or were observed using a credit or debit card is consistent; 90% of All
Respondents, 89% of BIPOC respondents, and 89% of Low-Income respondents indicated that they have a credit,
debit or prepaid debit card.

or use a MyRide card provided to them. The remaining 6% to 8% of respondents are those who do not currently
have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card, but do require fare payment media and may be interested in using Open
Payments. Across different respondent populations, the percentage that do not have a credit or debit card, but
do require fare payment media is relatively consistent; 5.6% of All Respondents, 6.5% of BIPOC respondents, and
7.8% of Low-Income respondents. Among this subset of respondents, the most popular product and fare media
choices are 3-Hour Passes and Day Passes purchased with Cash onboard the bus, indicating ongoing reliance on
cash.

Currently, customers who would prefer to pay with electronic fare media but do not have a credit or debit card
are limited to reloading their MyRide account or card using Cash at RTD’s four Sales Outlets. The forthcoming
introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” network aims to add approximately 460 to 500 retail locations
where customers could use cash to reload their MyRide account/card, dramatically increasing electronic fare
media access and customer convenience. Many of these same retail locations are likely to sell prepaid debit cards,
providing even more electronic fare payment options to RTD customers, particularly those who remain cash
reliant.

4.2 Demographic Analysis of MyRide “cash digitization” Retail Network
RTD is planning for the introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail network. The InComm-based
VanillaDirect cash digitization network allows customers to bring cash to a variety of retail establishments and
load value to their MyRide digital account or card by exchanging cash for electronic stored value. The planned
cash digitization network aims to add approximately 460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas
stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, large retail outlets and dollar stores.
The demographic analysis of the introduction of the cash digitization network indicated that the population within
RTD’s District comprises around 38% BIPOC residents, and that the new retail locations serve a population that is
around 43% BIPOC, indicating greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC populations. Similarly, while the District’s lowincome population averages around 21%, the new locations serve a population that is around 27% low-income,
indicating that these locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s low-income populations.

5 Discussion of Equity Implications
The proposed fare change is not anticipated to result in any changes in average fare, but fare media access
implications are discussed further.

5.1 Average Fare Implications
The fare change proposal includes no changes in fare pricing, fare products, customer category discounts or card
fees. The impact is that there are no anticipated changes in the systemwide average fare or product-specific
average fares, in aggregate or across customer populations.

5.2 Fare Media Access Implications
As discussed in Section 4.1, the 2024 Onboard Survey suggests that nearly 90% of RTD customers have a credit,
debit or prepaid debit card. The share of customers indicating that they have credit/debit/prepaid debit cards is
consistent across BIPOC, low-income and all survey respondents. This finding in isolation suggests that a
substantial majority of RTD customers, across customer type, have access to the types of card that would enable
participation in Open Payments fare payment.
However, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents do not currently have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card,
depending on the type of respondent. The survey suggests that this group is cash reliant, relying heavily on cash
payment onboard RTD buses. For this subset of customers, it is not clear why they rely heavily on cash payment,
but this analysis seeks to understand how this group may participate in Open Payments fare payment and take
advantage of fare policy benefits such as fare capping.
Access to traditional credit and debit cards is often through a customer relationship with a bank or credit union.
While these groups continue to provide services that are increasingly customer friendly (e.g., elimination of service
fees, provision of overdraft protection), regulations often require that the customer have a Social Security Number
(SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) in order to open a bank account. For recent immigrants
to the country or undocumented residents, this requirement may pose a barrier to establishing a banking
relationship, and acquiring a credit card and debit card. Traditional credit cards often require additional steps,
such as a credit check, which may pose additional barriers. For this reason, the availability of prepaid debit cards
through retail establishments may be the more attractive option for this subset of customers.
Prepaid debit cards are generally widely available at retail locations, but there is no widely available source of
information that comprehensively lists every location within the Denver metro area that sells prepaid debit cards
for a GIS-based access analysis. However, the upcoming introduction of the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network can be viewed as a sample or subset of retail establishments that are likely to sell prepaid debit cards. As
discussed in Section 4.2, the InComm-based VanillaDirect cash digitization network aims to add approximately
460 to 500 retail locations including convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, large retail
outlets and dollar stores, retail locations that also typically sell contactless, prepaid debit cards. If these locations
are considered to be a representative sample of retail locations that sell contactless, prepaid debit cards
throughout the Denver metro area, then the ability of BIPOC and low-income customer groups to access these
locations is favorable. The demographic analysis of the introduction of the cash digitization network indicated that
the population within RTD’s District comprises around 38% BIPOC residents, and that the new retail locations

serve a population that is around 43% BIPOC, indicating greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC populations. Similarly,
while the District’s low-income population averages around 21%, the new locations serve a population that is
around 27% low-income, indicating that these locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s low-income populations.
Taken together, nearly 90% of RTD customers already have a credit, debit and/or prepaid debit card that enables
participation in Open Payments fare payment. The remaining 6% to 8% that do not have a credit, debit or prepaid
debit card are likely to have 460 or more locations where prepaid debit cards can be acquired, and these locations
tend to be located in parts of the RTD service area that have a higher proportion of BIPOC and low-income
residents.

6 Fare Proposal Outreach
RTD’s Communications and Engagement Department developed a comprehensive bilingual communications and
outreach strategy to ensure successful implementation of the two major initiatives. Each campaign will include a
dedicated plan, with integrated efforts from the Transit Equity Office to ensure underserved populations will be
engaged and informed. The launch of these campaigns will commence in November 2025.
Open Payments
The outreach strategy will implement a comprehensive and multifaceted communications strategy to ensure that
customers and the broader public are fully informed about the open payments option. This comprehensive
approach encompasses several key elements designed to maximize reach and effectiveness. The objectives will
emphasize education, accessibility, and equity. Customers will receive clear information on how Open Payments
work, the benefits of fare capping, and how to link cards to MyRide accounts for discounts and trip history. The
plan includes multi-channel education through RTD’s website (available in 10 languages), social media, videos,
infographics, validator signage, and email alerts. Targeted outreach will highlight benefits for reduced fare groups
such as LiVE participants, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. Customer feedback loops will be incorporated
through surveys and online forms to guide improvements.
The Transit Equity Office will supplement this effort with bilingual participation in multicultural in-person events,
and direct engagement with customers at community gatherings. RTD will also distribute bilingual news releases,
Read-n-Ride articles, and direct emails to LiVE and Transit Assistance Grant recipients. This will ensure BIPOC, lowincome, and reduced fare populations received timely and accessible information.
Retail Network Cash Digitization
In parallel, this outreach strategy will implement a comprehensive, multi-channel strategy to ensure customers
are fully informed about cash digitization. Customers will be educated on how to obtain a new MyRide card, load
cash at retail outlets, and manage balances through the MyRide app or online. Outreach for this initiative will
include multi-channel education through web and mobile platforms, instructional videos, infographics, FAQs, and
station signage. RTD will conduct targeted engagement with reduced fare groups and community organizations
serving low-income and unbanked customers.
The Transit Equity Office will support these tactics by coordinating bilingual outreach at community events,
distributing information through newsletters and direct communications to discount program participants, and
ensuring materials are accessible in both English and Spanish and additional languages as requested.
In summary, through these combined efforts, RTD will implement a consistent, equity-focused outreach strategy
across each communication and outreach campaigns. By providing multilingual materials, engaging directly with
underserved communities, and leveraging multiple communication channels, RTD will ensure that all customers
have clear, accessible, and timely information about the new fare media payment option and the expanded cash
digitization retail network.

7 Next Steps
Based on the responses from the 2024 Onboard Survey, there is strong evidence that a substantial majority of
RTD customers have a credit, debit or prepaid debit card and that the percentage having a credit/debit/prepaid
debit card is virtually identical across BIPOC, low-income and all respondents.
There are, however, approximately 6% to 8% of respondents who do not currently have a credit, debit or prepaid
debit card, depending on the type of respondent. For this subset of customers, the equity analysis considered
whether there is access to contactless fare media. The analysis assumed that the form of contactless fare media
that would be easiest to acquire would be prepaid debit cards, and considered the 460 – 500 planned MyRide
“cash digitization” retail network locations as a sample of retail locations where customers could a acquire a
prepaid debit card. The MyRide “cash digitization” retail network demographic analysis indicated that cash
digitization network locations are in greater proximity to RTD’s BIPOC and low-income populations, suggesting
improved access for those customer populations.
Based on an analysis of the 2024 Onboard Survey and the access results from the MyRide “cash digitization” retail
network demographic analysis, this Title VI Fare Equity Analysis strongly suggests that there would be no Disparate
Impact on BIPOC populations, and no Disproportionate Burden on low-income populations. RTD can proceed with
the proposed fare change without any further changes or mitigations. The acceptance of contactless, Open
Payments should provide greater convenience and fare media options to all RTD customer populations, including
BIPOC and low-income customer populations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kelly Mackey, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2026-2030 Five-Year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2026 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future years’ financial planning.
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2025-2029 FYFF, was approved by the Board in September 2024.
The 2026-2030 FYFF is prepared using currently available information to assist in planning. The FYFF is
a forecast or projection of financial results, is not an appropriation of funds, and is non-binding.
During the July 15, 2025, Finance and Planning Committee, staff presented a discussion item that
described the purpose of and assumptions used in the 2026-2030 FYFF.
DISCUSSION
The 2026-2030 FYFF has been prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes, such as new grant funding from SB24-184 Congestion
Impact Fees and SB24-230 Oil and Gas Production Fees. The FYFF only includes funding sources and
use projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal
Policy.
Other requirements of the Fiscal Policy to consider for the FYFF include the following:
• A balanced budget in which beginning reserves plus total anticipated revenues is greater than or
equal to expenditures will be prepared

Packet Pg. 304

19.1

•

Debt financing will not be issued to support operating expenditures

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2026-2030 FYFF projects continued adherence to Fiscal Policy requirements and maintenance of
adequate reserves to continue to cash-fund expenditures while providing the necessary funding to
support currently known Transit Asset Management Plan needs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Longmont and Boulder Fixed-Route Service Contract

September 10, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
September 30, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to enter into a contract with
Transdev Services, Inc., for the provision of fixed-route services as described herein. This contract is for
three years, with two one-year options for a total of five years, at a total not-to-exceed cost of
$127,095,000. Additionally, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated
to be $11,955,000 over five years. The total five-year not-to-exceed cost for services and fuel is
$139,050,000.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erin Vallejos, Acting Deputy Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to § 32-9-119.5(2)(a), C.R.S., RTD operates a system under which up to 58% of the agency’s
non-rail vehicular service may be provided by qualified private businesses, nonprofit organizations, or
local governments pursuant to competitively negotiated contracts. The agency currently contracts
approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of complementary paratransit service (Access-aRide), and 100% of FlexRide service, for a total amount of contracted transit service of approximately
56%.
DISCUSSION
The last option year of the current contract for the provision of fixed-route bus service to the Longmont
and Boulder area expires January 9, 2026. A Request for Proposals (RFP) to replace this service package
was published using the online solicitations platform on May 7, 2025, with proposals due June 17,
2025, to allow adequate time for a comprehensive procurement process.
A panel of staff subject matter experts assessed responsive proposals using pre-determined objective
evaluative criteria. Based on the overall evaluation, the panel recommends awarding the contract to
Transdev Services, Inc., as the best value for RTD in support of the agency’s Strategic Priorities of
Community Value and Financial Success.
The service package consists of 61 buses providing approximately 165,000 revenue hours in the first
year. The routes provide service to the cities of Boulder, Erie, Lafayette, Longmont, Louisville, and

Packet Pg. 318

19.2

Superior, and the City and County of Broomfield. The term for the contract will be for three years, with
two one-year options, for a total of five years.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding will be included in the 2026 Budget for the provision of Longmont and Boulder fixed-route
services effective January 10, 2026. Funding for future contract years is contemplated in the agency’s
financial forecast and will be presented for the Board’s consideration annually, as identified within each
year’s respective budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Window Covering Prohibition and System Advertising
Policy Amendment

September 30, 2025

REPRESENTATIVES
Brett Paglieri, Director - District M
Matt Larsen, Director - District E
Chris Nicholson, Board Secretary and Director - District A
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Many transit agencies, including RTD, wrap revenue service vehicles with commemorative designs in
recognition of certain major events or holidays (e.g. winter holidays, Transit Equity Day, Pride, etc.),
and these wraps cover portions of windows on the vehicles. Additionally, transit agencies, including
RTD, cover certain buses with wraps covering portions of the vehicle’s windows that correspond to the
names of the routes (e.g. BOUND, DASH, HOP, Flatiron Flyer, JUMP, 16th Street FreeRide, etc.). Within
the transit industry, there are many different types of on-vehicle commercial advertising products that
are sold which offer advertising space on revenue service vehicles to advertisers. Several of those
products offer the advertiser advertising space which covers various portions of vehicle windows.
Colloquially, these commemorative recognitions, route branded covers, and advertisements are known
as bus wraps or transit wraps. Examples of these wraps appear in the attached On-Vehicle Advertising
Ad Installation Guide (attachment A).
Official board records indicate that the Board has been debating components of advertising on vehicles
at least as far back as 1974. Over the years, the Board has grappled with whether to allow advertising
on vehicles, where to allow advertisements on vehicles, and the content of those advertisements. The
Board has at various times taken actions to prohibit certain types of advertising content and to expand
the available space on vehicles for advertising. Additionally, staff have negotiated advertising contracts
and agreements which have expanded or shrunk available advertising space. As such, the current
advertising practices of RTD are a mix of formal Board actions and contractual agreements negotiated
by staff and often approved by the Board.
The agency’s history of advertising on vehicles and wrapping vehicles is one of change in which
various practices are discontinued and then later reinstated. For example, for several years in the late
1990’s RTD allowed 40 buses to be wrapped with advertisements covering more than the bottom six
inches of certain windows on the vehicles but then phased out the practice starting in June of 1999
after receiving customer complaints (attachment B). In an effort to explore new commercial advertising
revenue streams, on September 20, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a pilot program to allow

Packet Pg. 320

20.1

certain windows of one light rail vehicle to be covered in advertising (attachment C). Subsequently,
additional light rail vehicles had their windows wrapped in advertising and the agency endeavored over
a six-month period sometime between September 2011 and October 2012 to survey customers as to
the impact of the advertisements on their experience. 185 customers responded to the survey and 85%
of respondents did not object to the windows on the light rail vehicles having advertising coverage
(attachment D). Subsequently, in 2015 the system advertising contract was amended to allow for bus
wraps to cover more than the bottom six inches of windows, effectively allowing for advertising wraps
to cover additional portions of certain windows on RTD buses (see standards below). On December 31,
2016, RTD entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with both the City of Boulder and
Boulder County to provide for the wrapping of certain local bus routes operating in Boulder City and
Boulder County (attachment E). Some of these wraps cover portions of the windows and RTD also has
other route branded wraps with designs covering portions of windows.
While RTD currently allows for the covering of windows of vehicles in revenue service, the agency sets
standards for these coverings, which define the following allowable window coverage:

▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Bus
0% coverage on operator
window - street side
0% coverage on front door –
curbside
0% coverage of first curbside
window
0% coverage on rear door

Up to, but not to exceed 50%
coverage of total remaining
square footage on all other
windows

▪

Light Rail
0% coverage on operator

0% coverage on all windows

0% coverage on first window

▪
▪

Commuter Rail
0% coverage on operator
windows
0% coverage on all windows
on doors
Up to, but not to exceed 50%
coverage of total remaining
square footage on all other
windows

In August of 2015, the Board adopted an updated System Advertising Policy, which limited certain
kinds of non-commercial advertising and asserted that RTD’s advertising spaces are a limited public
forum (attachment F). For purposes of this Discussion Item, the 2015 action is seen as creating the
current System Advertising Policy. Then in December of 2019, the Board acted to update the existing
System Advertising Policy to allow for digital advertising and to add cannabis and electronic cigarettes
to the existing list of products for which advertising is prohibited (attachment G). Additionally, the 2019
action built off the 2015 action and more clearly defined two items: the concept of RTD Advertising
Space and the three clear uses of RTD Advertising Space (Commercial Advertising, RTD Advertising,
and Government Communication).
The following table indicates the current number of RTD revenue service vehicles by type (bus, light
rail, commuter rail) with some kind of commercial advertising or RTD advertising that covers at least

Furthermore, RTD has the following route branded vehicles, for which the branded wraps cover some
portion of window space. Additionally, these vehicles may or may not also have some kind of
advertisement which covers some portion of the vehicle’s windows.

DISCUSSION
Because the application of advertising or other window coverings on the outside of windows of RTD
vehicles may obscure a customer’s outward visibility, the three Directors initiating this discussion are
concerned that the practice of covering vehicle windows may result in: a decline in the overall customer
experience, an increase in customer perceived safety and security concerns, and impacts on the overall
integrity of RTD’s brand and public image.
At least two transit entities have acted since 2023 to remove exterior advertising from their vehicles
including Albuquerque, NM (attachment H) and Bi-State Development in the St. Louis, MO area
(attachment I). Both cited the customer experience concerns and a desire to create a more distinctive
brand as reasons to discontinue the practice of wrapping vehicles with advertisements.
RTD has received two formal complaints (from one customer) over the past 12 months regarding the
presence of advertising or other vehicle wraps on a revenue service vehicle.
Given the above, the initiating Directors would like the Board to discuss the current vehicle wrapping
practices and advertising policy outlined in both the background section above as well as in the
attached documents. They would like to seek input on whether to bring forward a related action item to
effectuate specific items listed below or some combination thereof:
•
•
•
•

Prohibiting window coverings of any kind on revenue service vehicles
Prohibiting advertising on windows of revenue service vehicles
Further limiting the allowable amount of window coverage for commemorative vehicle wraps or
branded route wraps
Further limiting the allowable amount of window coverage included in RTD’s allowable
Advertising Space

Packet Pg. 322

20.1

Following the discussion, the Directors will determine whether to bring forward a related action item
for the regular October monthly board meeting, which is scheduled for Tuesday, October 28, 2025.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board acted in June of 2025 to terminate the System Advertising Contract with Lamar effective
December 1, 2025 (attachment J), and the agency has an open solicitation for on-vehicle advertising. In
anticipation of this three-Director initiated item coming before the Board, staff has issued an addendum
to the request for proposals asking proposers to submit proposals with and without window space
being included in the allowable Advertising Space. It is anticipated that proposals accounting for the
inclusion of window space for advertising will be higher than those that exclude window space.

June 16, 1999 | Rocky Mountain News (Denver, CO) | April M. Washington News Staff Writer | Page 10A

The eye-catching paintings on some RTD buses to promote products such as Kool-Aid are being tossed out
the window - potentially costing the transit agency hundreds of thousands of dollars.
``It's one of the best advertising schemes in terms of bringing revenue we've created,'' said Beth Stewart,
owner of Denver Transit Advertising, the Regional Transportation District's advertising agency. ``A lot of
people are much more interested in taking out ads if the windows are included.''
The illustrated buses are one of RTD's most profitable advertising gimmicks, but riders complain paintings
block their view, said RTD spokesman Scott Reed.
``It was especially a problem at night for people who had impaired vision,'' he said.
Starting next year, RTD will allow advertisers' murals to cover the body of the buses and only the bottom six
inches of the windows.
The painted ads have generated $531,000 in the past two years, according to RTD records.
``What could be worse than losing something that's so popular?'' Stewart said. ``It's not like you can't see
out of the windows. The paintings are similar to tinted car windows.''
RTD officials said revenue loss will likely be recouped once rates are adjusted to offset the changes.
About 40 RTD buses feature the illustrations. Current advertisers won't be affected by the changes until their
contracts expire, Reed said.
``It's not like we're getting rid of the whole program,'' Reed said. ``The ads can be painted on the back and
sides of the buses.''

and to

exercise the two year option component of the contract, consistent with the terms and
amendments outlined in this action item.

BACKGROUND

RTD' s current contract for on-vehicle advertising was awarded to Lamar Transit Advertising

Lamar) in 2009. The initial period of the contract is from January 2010 to December 2012.

The contract contains an option for an additional two years from January 201 3 to December
2014. Staff is recommending that the option component of the contract be exercised and

that the current contract and the option component of the contract be amended as outlined
below to reflect available fleet inventory.

DISCUSSION

The current contract with Lamar contains a table showing anticipated space availability for
advertising sales. Because of service and fleet reductions in RTD's bus operations, the size
of the fleet available for ad sales is

17 percent less than was anticipated

when

Lamar

submitted their original revenue guarantee proposal. While RTD's contract with Lamar does

not contain a specific trigger for revisiting revenue guarantees, such a clause is quite typical

in the industry and is usually triggered when the fleet size increases or decreases by 10
percent or more.

Lamar has requested that the minimum revenue guarantee for the current contract year be

adjusted to reflect RTD' s reduction in fleet availability. Staff concurs and recommends that
the minimum

guarantee

of the bus component

of the contract for 2012 be reduced

from

2.8 million or 70 percent of net sales ( whichever is greater) to $ 2.324 million or 70 percent

This same

revenue calculation would be included in the two option years of the contract.

Lamar has also asked for consideration
of the contract,

of a revenue adjustment on the light rail component

but for a different reason.

Because

RTD has purchased

and put in revenue

service all of the light rail vehicles to be used on the West Line, RTD now has 172 vehicles
available for service,

but has a peak requirement of only 97 vehicles.

This represents a

temporary spare ratio of 77 percent, far above the 20 percent minimum spare ratio that is
typical in transit. The result of this to advertisers is that an ad vehicle is less likely to be in
revenue service and visible to the

recommending

that the

minimum guarantee on the light rail component of the contract for 2012 be adjusted from

1.6 million or 60 percent of net sales ( whichever is greater) to $1 . 2 million or 60 percent of
net sales ( whichever is greater).

This represents

a 25 percent reduction

in the minimum

number of vehicles.

3. Do not amend the contract, do not exercise the two-year option and put the on-vehicle

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Regarding wrapping of Community Transit Network (CTN) bus fleet
Summary

Boulder County (County) and the City of Boulder (collectively the Boulder County Local
Governments) wish to partner with the Regional Transportation District (RTD) regarding
individual bus branding "wraps" on the Boulder Community Transit Network (CTN) bus
routes.

This memorandum serves to memorialize Boulder County Local Governments' and RTD's
understanding concerning the above subject.
Background
The CTN bus network was initially launched.in 1994 with the creation of the HOP bus route.

The CTN routes have branded routes in a similar naming convention that help to
differentiate each route while also implying that they are part of a comprehensive transit
network through a similar naming structure (currently SKIP, JUMP, DASH, BOUND, and
STAMPEDE). As part of this unique branding, each route has a vinyl "wrap" graphic on the
outside that helps to differentiate the CTN routes from other routes throughout the transit
system.

Boulder County Local Governments and RTD wish to balance the unique branding of the
CTN buses through bu's wraps with the need for RTD to receive ad revenue that is
expected from their bus fleet as part of a necessary element to maintain fiscal solvency.

This MOU serves to outline the terms of the CTN bus branding/wrapping/advertising
understanding among RTD and Boulder County Local Governments to continue unique
branding of the CTN routes and to help ensure their continued effectiveness.
CTN bus wrap - technical specs and logistics
Technical specifications for CTN bus wraps and logistics for their installation and removal
shall be as follows:
a

current crN bus routes (defined as the sKlP, JUMp, DASH, BouND, STAMPEDE)
and any future CTN designated routes (as may be determined in conjunction among

the Boulder County Local Governments and RTD) will be eligible to have uniquely
branded bus wraps.

The percent of the "wrapped" buses operating on a route (vs. standard RTD fleet
buses) will representTOT" of the vehicles operating on the route during peak service
["peak seryice" as determined by RTD service planning department] and not more
than the number of base operations vehicles.
o For example if a route has 10 buses operating during peak times, the route

a

would have 7 vehicles eligible to be wrapped on the route.
The decision to wrap buses on CTN bus routes will be at the prerogative of the
Boulder County Local Governments up to the maximum permitted ratio of wrapped
buses on the route noted above.

a

Production, installation, maintenance (other than RTD standard bus maintenance),
and re-wrapping due to normal wear and tear of CTN wraps (as determined by RTD
in its reasonable discretion) is the sole responsibility and exPense of Boulder County
Local Governments.

RTD or its subcontractors will continue to provide standard vehicle maintenance
levels on the CTN bus routes as part of the RTD bus fleet.
a

All exterior advertisements shall be manufactured, install and removed in
accordance with industry standards. Each direct application exterior should be free
of wrinkles, be squared to the vehicle contour lines and present a sharp and clear
appearance as determined by RTD in its reasonable discretion.

a

lf a wrapped bus is destroyed or suffers significant damage in an accident, RTD will
make good faith efforts to repair or replace the bus and re-wrap it as soon as
practicable as determined by RTD in its reasonable discretion, and the parties will
consult to determine responsibility for re-wrapping exPense (based on such factors
as depreciation of the bus or wrap).

a

RTD and the Boulder County Local Governments will collaborate to determine the
material specifications for any CTN graphic specifications (i.e. vinyl and laminates)'

To ensure compatibility with RTD standard vehicle maintenance, materials are to be
of equal or greater quality than other RTD system bus wraps, as determined by RTD
in its reasonable discretion.
a

window coverage of graphics on cTN wrapped buses is defined as follows:
o 07" coverage on front and operators side windows
o oo/o on entry door and first window on curbside of vehicle
o up to but not to exceed 50% coverage on all remaining windows
o All materials applied to windows must be of an RTD-approved visibility ratio
' of not more than ó0:40 visible to printable material
o To the extent any of the above Percentages are subject to different
interpretations, RTD shall make such determination in its reasonable
discretion

No paid audio advertisements will be utilized in the interior of the CTN route
vehicles. This provision does not apply to audio for RTD safety related and stop
specific announcements. This provision applies to wrapped and unwrapped buses
operating on the CTN routes.

a

The Boulder County Local Governments will be the lead agency in designing the
CTN bus wrap graphics. RTD will have opportunity to review and approve the
graphic design for any new/ modified bus wraps and designs.
o Approved exterior designs for the current CTN routes have been agreed
upon and attached to this memorandum of understanding as Exhibit A.
Subsequent agreed design changes will be memorialized in writing and
attached to this MOU as additional amendments/exhibits.
Wrapped CTN buses will maintain the following ad space openings for purposes of
RTD.determined advertising on each wrapped vehicle: one(l) driver-side "King"
size ad (size 30"x144"), one(1) passenger-side "Oueen" size ad (size 30"xBB"), and
one(1) rear "tail" size ad (size 21"x72").

o Ad spaces can be smaller than these sizes, but cannot exceed these
maximum sizes.

o Exterior ads will not be installed on any other parts of the CTN wrapped
vehicles beyond these three locations.

o RTD and its vendors shall be the sole determinants of content for ads
running on the available exterior ad spaces per standard RTD advertising
policies.
a

All ads on CTN bus routes will be placed inside of a metal ad "window frame"
mounted to the exterior of the CTN buses and on no other exterior portion of the
CTN wrapped buses.

CTN bus wraps shall not contaìn advertising. There shall be no advertising on CTN
buses other than RTD-provided standard advertising as set forth in this agreement.
a

CTN bus wrap graphics will be designed by the Boulder County Local Governments

to minimize graphic conflicts with text and imagery between bus graphics and ad
space in the immediate vicinity of exterior window spaces.
o

Paid advertisements will not be placed on the interior or exterior of the CTN bus

windows (RTD service specific informational content i.e. "tranfluxes" will be
exempted for inside window space).
a

All other interior locations of RTD buses are eligible for RTD standard advertising,
including but not limited to: interior vehicle roof ads (i.e. "Michelangelo") and
headboard ads ("lnterior Card").

a

Boulder County Local Governments will be allowed the opportunity at their own
expense to inspect the bus wraps a maximum of twice per year at RTD garages

(when vehicles are not in service) to assess the condition of the bus wraps and
needed repairs (i.e. missing graphics).

o RTD shall determine the availability of buses for inspection and provide
available dates and times to the County.

o lnspections shall minimize disruption to RTD transit operations, will occur
when buses are out of service, and will fulfill RTD safety and security
requirements.

o lf a wrapped bus is weathering, peeling, fraying, or generally presenting an
unkempt appearance due to regular operations over the life of the vehicle
and wrap, the Boulder County Local Governments, as determined between
themselves, will have responsibility to repair or replace these wraps during
a

their normal lifespan and replace the wraps at the end of their lifespan.
All CTN bus wraps will include the following exterior RTD signage elements:
o The RTD logo on all sides of the buses (similar size and font to other RTD

o

standard fleet vehicles).
RTD main line phone number and/or RTD Web address on the curb side and
street side of all buses (similar size and font to other RTD standard fleet
vehicles).

o Unique four digit bus identification number on the front, rear, roof, curb side
and street side of all buses (similar size and font to other RTD standard fleet
vehicles).

o RTD "Yield to bus" stickers on the rear of RTD vehicles.
o Other standard RTD exterior signage elements as determined in conjunction
o
o

between the local CTN route communities and RTD.
Any other elements required by law.

Upon retirement of any CTN wrapped vehicles RTD may alert the Boulder County
Local Governments of the impending retirement of the vehicle.
o The Boulder County Local Governments will be responsible for having the
vehicle wraps fully removed from the vehicles in a promPt manner, prior to
and so as not to delay the vehicles' removal/sale from the RTD bus fleet.
o lf the option to remove the wrap is desired, costs to remove graphics and
coordination of graphic removals shall bc the responsibility of the Bou¡lder

o Prior to retiring CTN wrapped vehicles from the RTD fleet, RTD shall use its
good faith efforts to provide the Boulder County Local Governments with
sufficient opportunity (a minimum of two months) to coordinate removal of

Committee Meeting Date:
RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update
Board Meeting Date:
August 18, 2015
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the
attached advertising policy.
BACKGROUND
Currently, RTD operates an on-vehicle advertising program that accepts both commercial and non-commercial forms of
advertising. Under current policy, RTD’s advertising program creates a ‘limited public forum’ by which public service,
nonprofit and political advertisements are allowed within the guidelines established by the policy.
RTD’s Current Advertising Policy is as follows:
Advertising Policy and Objective:
It is the policy of the RTD to utilize space on the interior and exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles for commercial
advertising, RTD advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages. The primary objective of the
commercial advertising program is to maximize the net revenues to the District within the policy and standards of the
District.
Advertising Standards:
All advertising matter displayed on or in buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles shall be of a reputable character as
determined by the RTD. Objectionable advertisements shall, upon the request of a responsible officer of the RTD, be
removed immediately. All advertisements must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and Municipal laws,
ordinances and regulations within the District.
Political advertisements may be displayed only within six months of the election date. Said advertising must contain the
following disclaimer: "This Ad Paid for by (sponsor/advertiser)" and shall be subject to prior approval by RTD.
The following standards for advertising, as adopted by the RTD Board of Directors, shall be strictly adhered to by the
Advertising Company:
1. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is false, misleading, or deceptive;
2. The RTD will not display advertising copy which relates to any illegal activity under local, state or federal statute;
3. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is obscene;
4. Any advertisement not relating to a commercially available product or service including political advertising shall
include a clearly visible phrase "This Ad Paid for by (the identity of the sponsor/advertiser)". These ads shall be
subject to prior approval by the RTD; and
5. The RTD will not display advertising copy, which promotes the sale and/or use of tobacco products.
RTD has Non-Commercial Advertising Disclaimer Specifications under the current policy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Packet Pg. 363

DISCUSSION
The proposed RTD Advertising Policy would establish uniform, reasonable, and viewpoint-neutral standards for the
display of advertising in and on the facilities, vehicles and other property (together "Property") of the Regional
Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and restrict the use of RTD's
Property for First Amendment political speech.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on the Property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary capacity as a
provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its transportation operations.
Starting from the Effective Date of the new Policy, the RTD does not intend that the advertising permitted to be
displayed in and on the Property be created, designated, or used as a public forum for expressive activities or
general discourse or opinions.
In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary capacity would be
limiting advertisements it will accept for display in and on the Property to paid commercial advertising, certain
public service announcements that will help provide information to the public about RTD’s own and other
government activities to help build goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the Property by subjecting all proposed
advertisements to the Advertising Standards included in the proposed RTD Advertising Policy. This proposed
advertising policy is attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is currently contracted with Lamar Advertising to receive a minimum guarantee of $4,000,000.00 in 2015,
$4,100,000.00 in 2016, and $4,200,000.00 in 2017 in advertising revenues. Non-commercial advertising accounts for
approximately $1,000,000.00 annually of those revenues. Adoption of the revised Advertising Policy may result in
an initial decrease of advertising revenue, as some advertisers will no longer qualify to participate in the RTD
Advertising program. Please also note that those advertisers are currently paying a lower rate for ads than the
commercial rate, and under the proposed updated policy, we will have only one rate. Staff also observes that some
non-commercial advertisers will be able to participate in the proposed advertising program as commercial
advertisers.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the attached proposed advertising policy, effective August 18, 2015. This alternative is the staff
recommendation.
2. Retain the existing RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended due to the creation of
a ‘public forum’ on RTD property.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Revised System Advertising Policy
Board Meeting Date:
December 17, 2019
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors approve the revision to the RTD System Advertising Policy. The revisions bring the policy
up to date to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy
(attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:
1. Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s electronic
communications channels to expand the assets available for advertising.
2. Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette products on RTD
assets.
The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain proposals for digital
advertising. The second revision formally excludes cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on
RTD properties. Despite not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis
advertising to date.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In August of 2015, RTD adopted the current System Advertising Policy. At this time, with the proposed
introduction of digital advertising, the Communications and Government Relations Committee is
recommending updating the advertising policy to reflect these changes in advertising media and
locations. This recommendation maintains the current commercial advertising standards adopted in
2015 and applies them to a wider array of advertising options across RTD’s assets. Further, excluding
the advertising of cannabis on the system maintains RTD’s good standing with regard to federal
funding.
DISCUSSION
The recommended change to the RTD System Advertising Policy would maintain uniform, reasonable,
and viewpoint-neutral standards for the display of advertising in and on the vehicles, stations,
buildings, facilities and properties of the Regional Transportation District and its affiliated and
subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and maintain the property as a limited public forum by excluding
advertising of a non-commercial nature.

In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary
capacity would limit advertisements it will accept for display across the agency’s assets to paid
commercial advertising, certain public service announcements and messages that will help build
goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public, and governmental partners. The RTD would
continue to retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the system.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the change to the System Advertising Policy. This alternative is recommended to reflect
important updates to the policy to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy.
Also, the update allows RTD to add digital advertising to the advertising program and provide a
new revenue stream for the agency. This alternative is the staff recommendation.
2. Retain the existing System Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended because it
doesn’t align with the agency’s desire to add digital advertising to its advertising program and
generate additional revenues for the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is preparing a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach
would combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising
Program into one larger comprehensive program. This more comprehensive advertising program will
enhance the delivery of customer information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
Adoption of the Revised System Advertising Policy will allow this RFP to be published and RTD to
assess the value of proposals from prospective vendors. Without this change, RTD will not be able
pursue enhanced digital advertising and will have to forego the increased revenue that is expected
through digital advertising.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
System Advertising Contract Termination

June 24, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her delegate to execute all
documents necessary to terminate RTD’s System Advertising Contract with Lamar Transit for an amount
not to exceed $2,534,655.15.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
For more than 20 years, RTD has supported an advertising program that generates revenue by
strategically using the agency’s revenue vehicles and other public-facing assets. RTD’s contract with
Lamar began in January 2022, and it included on-vehicle advertising, as well as a new digital advertising
program. Under the 10-year base agreement, Lamar pays RTD a “minimum annual guarantee” (MAG) in
advance. In addition to the MAG, RTD is entitled to receive 60% of any advertising revenue that is
generated in excess of the MAG. The MAG incrementally increases throughout the duration of the
contract. For example, in 2024, Lamar paid $5.6 million to RTD, and the payment increased to $6
million in 2025.
In addition to generating revenue through on-vehicle advertising, the contract requires Lamar to install
approximately 300 digital advertising displays, 60 digital kiosks, and 30 LED wall displays, within the
first three years of the contract. RTD retains a share-of-voice (i.e., a measurement model within
advertising that measures the percentage of media spending by a company/agency compared to the total
media expenditure for the product, service or category in market) on the digital screens for customer
information and agency promotions.
DISCUSSION
RTD and Lamar have mutually agreed to terminate and unwind the 10-year contract early, contingent
upon Board approval. If the termination is authorized by the Board, it would become effective December
1, 2025.
As part of the wind-down, RTD will pay Lamar for the amortized value of all assets it will obtain upon
termination in the amount of approximately $2,010,000. RTD will then assume ownership of all digital
signs and screens that have been deployed across the system. Additionally, due to the contract ending

RTD will use the five-month wind-down period to launch a public solicitation structured for a sustainable
path to utilizing its assets to generate advertising income. If the solicitation is successful, it is currently
anticipated that a new contract will come before the Board for consideration and approval prior to the
end of 2025.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is $2,534,655.15 and will be funded from the existing Lamar revenue accounts.

prior to December 21, 2025, RTD will return to Lamar a prorated portion of the 2025 MAG for the final
month of the contract termination, which is approximately $500,000.
