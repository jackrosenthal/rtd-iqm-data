C. Updates
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, started off the meeting by introducing
John Thompson from Denver Transit Partners (DTP). Mr. Thompson presented a
check in the amount of $50,000 for the Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) program.
Ms. Silva stated that DTP and RTD have been partners for a long time and the todate contributions to the program are $200,000.
Ms. Silva advised the Board that the 2016 Civil Rights Annual Report was
completed and she would be providing a copy to each of the Directors. She gave a
brief overview of the report which included highlights of the Civil Rights division.
2016 Highlights of the Year:
 In collaboration with bus ops, facilities, capital programs, etc., an effective
checklist was created for bus stop accessibility district-wide which will bring
RTD into compliance with Federal Transit Administration (FTA) regulations.
 The American Disability Association (ADA) office received a Shalom of
Denver Hero Award for efforts and assistance coordinating efforts to grant a
1-year of Access-a-Ride services to disabled patrons.
 Brought on an additional Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Specialist to
assist with protected class investigations and EEO trainings.
 In accordance with FTA, EEO office created and implemented a process to
review Sub recipients’ EEO Program Plans

and hosted a public forum. RTD has received another successful FTA
Concurrence of the Triennial Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Goal.
Base system and FasTracks DBE/SBE goals were achieved for 2016, and
many FasTracks projects that closed during 2016 exceeded their DBE/SBE
commitments.
The WIN Program was selected to be a part of the FTA’s National Workforce
Grantee Summit “Implementing, Disseminating & Modeling Ladders of
Opportunity”. The Summit was held in Washington, D.C. in the U.S.
Department of Transportation’s (USDOT) offices
The WIN Program executed two Intergovernmental Agreements with each
founding partner of the WIN Program. This major milestone is for a primary
use of the federal grant that WIN was awarded as well as solidifying the
continuance of the WIN Programs’ vision for creating a skilled and trained
workforce to enter RTD

Ms. Silva also briefly touched base on meetings that Civil Rights’ staff members
conducted or attended in 2016. In closing Ms. Silva presented the goals of the
Civil Rights’ division moving forward.
Civil Rights Division:
 Strive for an excellent upcoming FTA Triennial Review in all of RTD’s civil
rights programs.
 Develop and implement a Diversity class at RTD which will be required for all
RTD employees.
 Partner and coordinate an inter-agency collaborative Small Business Event,
develop a WIN Peer-Agency Capacity Building program and hire a new EEO
Manager.
 Increase public outreach, initiate a plan to reach out to Denver-area high
schools to talk to students about careers in the transportation industry.
ADA:
 Attend the National ADA Symposium in Chicago May 2017
 Hire a new ADA Specialist/Investigator who will assist, support and
collaborate with internal stakeholders in an effort to effectively manage,
monitor and bring resolution to complaints.
 Conduct Service Animal Trainings for RTD’s Street Supervisors
 Propel several initiatives within Civil Rights Division to include continuous
enhancement and implementation of an effective RTD ADA complaint
procedure.
 Establish and implement a new ADA committee at RTD to promote an
inclusive, efficient and responsive organization.

Director Anderson asked if the WIN program provided outreach to Adams and
Jefferson County.
Ms. Silva replied that the WIN program has participated in several panels to reach
out to high school students about careers in transportation.
Director Anderson asked if there is a continuing issue regarding assistance animals.
Ed Neuberg, ADA Manager, said that service animals are still an on-going issue.
Director Folska asked Ms. Silva how the $200,000 contribution to the WIN
program will be utilized.
Ms. Silva explained that the WIN program was originally designed to train WIN
participants within the District to work on construction projects. Civil Rights staff
will recruit participants but anyone is eligible to apply. She informed the Board that
there are limited projects for the participants at this time; however they have hired
some personnel through the program. She stated that the Community College of
Denver along with the Urban League of Metro Denver both help the WIN program in
their recruiting efforts. The recruitment process accesses the applicants and
determines what training is needed.
Director Folska asked Ms. Silva if there are recruitment efforts for people with
disabilities.
Ms. Silva and Martell Dyles, Manager of WIN, confirmed that some classes were
offered through Atlantis Community Inc. She stated that they are shifting their

energy from construction industry jobs to bus and rail operators to assist RTD with
recruitment efforts.
Mr. Dyles explained that the WIN program helps all individuals that come through
the program regardless of race or disability. He stated that WIN has made changes
in the program to accommodate those with disabilities.

Director Williams said that she was under the impression that the reason we are
having problems with recruitment is because of the union’s commitment to a set
number of hours per week. She asked if shorter shifts could be offered to the
drivers.
General Manager Genova stated that there are part-time positions and the Union
does utilize part-time operators.
Director Williams asked if the new RTD ADA committee is a stand-alone
committee.
Ms. Silva responded that the goal is to only have two ADA committees at RTD.
She stated that it is very important to retain the ADA Paratransit Advisory
Committee (APAC) committee as a stand-alone committee. She explained how
they are going to terminate the design panel committee and absorb some of those
committee members. She said that her team has put a lot of work in creating a
protocol and setting a criteria before they go out. The second committee has a
working group, steering committee and an external advising committee to provide
input. The external advising committee will bring issues or concerns to the steering
committee and they then commute that to the working group.
Director Williams asked if the Board gets reports from those meetings every month.
Ms. Silva stated that APAC meets every other month and a meeting facilitator has
been hired. She said that there are things to report throughout the year but not
necessarily every other month. She stated that in moving forward there will be
discussions as to what is appropriate to report to the Board.
Director Williams mentioned that there were people volunteering their time from
various parts of the community that would like to know that their input is heard by
the Board.
Director Sisk thanked Ms. Silva and the Civil Rights team. He stressed his
appreciation for John Thompson with DTP, and stated that his contributions to the
WIN program are noteworthy and deserves accolades.

Director Folska asked Mr. Dyles and Ms. Silva if they could provide a list of
organizations that they partner with, that work with people with disabilities.

Director Tisdale stated that workforce development is the number one issue facing
economic development and developers, it is not just RTD it is everyone. He said
the WIN program is a great contribution to addressing workforce development. He
explained that Community College of Denver has been a great partner and they are
committed to this. He applauded DTP, RTD and CCD for their partnership efforts.
Director Francone thanked Mr. Thompson. She noted that the Annual Report
stated that Civil Rights was going to hire a new EEO Manager. She asked if that
was in addition to whom they already have or if they are replacing a position.

Director Folska asked if people with disabilities have been included in the on-board,
off-board surveys and the customer service satisfaction survey.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that commuters were
selected at random.
Director Folska asked if the surveys included paratransit services.
Mr. Van Meter responded that the surveys only included fixed-route services.
Director Folska asked if paratransit services encompass 10% of RTD’s operating
budget.
General Manager Genova said he would research and provide exact numbers later
to the Board.
Director Menten asked what part of the annual budget goes towards the WIN
program.
Ms. Silva explained that with every grant that RTD receives there has to be a
match component. She stated that there is a memorandum of understanding with
the Community College of Denver and Urban League of Denver stating that some of
the funds are in-kind and participants hired will specifically perform WIN program
work. She agreed that it is a bit cumbersome and stated that her team will be
happy to sit down and explain more in detail to Director Menten.
Director Menten asked if the WIN program employs 50 participants a year.
Ms. Silva stated that the number fluctuates depending on the projects WIN is
involved with, as people are hired based on project goals. Mr. Dyles noted that
hiring can vary from 20-180 people a year depending on the construction projects.

C. Updates

• Parking Management Program
Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
introduced Robin McIntosh, Senior Facilities Manager, Errol Stevens, Parking
Manager, who presented information on the RTD parking program.
Mr. Stevens said his presentation was to provide additional information to
the Board on the parking program that was created in 2008 rather than to
offer recommended actions at the time.
Mr. McIntosh said that the Board was briefed on the parking program in the
fall of 2016, at which time the Board requested that additional facilities be
brought into the program.
Mr. Stevens said that the presentation would cover recommendations for
both increasing parking rates and adding additional facilities into the
program. He said that, per state law, 15% of RTD parking is required to be
sold as reserved and when the maximum capacity is reached any additional
requests are placed on a waiting list. He noted that Mineral Station holds a
capacity of 1,227 vehicles and the 15% reserved space allocation is 184
vehicles. He said that the reserved spaces have been sold out for several
years, with 242 people currently on the waiting list. He said it could take as
long as 18 months for a requestor to receive a parking space from the time
the person’s name is placed on the list and that part of the philosophy of the
potential rate increase was to reduce the length of the waiting list. He also
cited Littleton Station as another station with high parking demand. He said
Packet Pg. 13

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska informed the Board that she would be voting
no on this item. She stated that the amount of money used
for this project should be redirected to complete FasTrack
commitments RTD has already made.

6.B

Mr. Stevens said that RTD uses the Denver-Boulder Metropolitan Area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) when setting fare changes in order to keep in
harmony with the advance of that index. He said that RTD has not
established a similar policy for increasing parking rates, which have not
changed since the program began in 2008. He said that applying the
increase in the CPI to 2008 rates would yield a parking fare of $2.35 and
noted that such an amount would result in odd change to make at a pay
station. Mr. Stevens cited a study conducted in 2016, which concluded that
each station brought into the parking program would result in a reduction in
parking for that station of 6%-18% and a reduction in ridership of 3%-18%.
He said that the issue of elasticity is something to keep in mind but offered
that any reductions could be offset by site-specific conditions, such as
service alternatives, distance, traffic conditions, and latent demand for
parking. He said that RTD has 15 Park-n-Rides with over 93% usage.
Mr. Stevens recommended that the Board adopt a policy statement to allow
for the parking rates to periodically be updated in a fair, reasonable, and
unbiased manner, which would account for supply and demand for parking
spaces and potential losses of revenue and ridership. He recommended an
increase in the daily parking rate from $2.00 to $2.25 for in-district patrons
and from $4.00 to $4.50 for out-of-district patrons. He noted that the outof-district rate is higher because people living outside of the district
experience a tax advantage by not paying the RTD sales and use tax. He
stated the rate for reserved parking spaces was $42 a month, the equivalent
of 21 business days per month at $2.00 per day. Mr. Stevens suggested the
following increases:


For Park-n-Rides with no current waiting list, he recommended the
monthly reserved parking rate be increased to $47.25 per month;



For Park-n-Rides with a waiting list of less than the 15% of the
reserved parking allocation, he recommended the monthly reserved
parking rate be increased to $52.00 per month;



For Park-n-Rides with a waiting list of more than the 15% of the
reserved parking allocation, he recommended the monthly reserved
parking rate be increased to $56.75 per month.

Mr. Stevens said that RTD has established an arrangement with car share
companies to see how car shares can integrate with RTD parking facilities.
Per an assessment conducted by the City and County of Denver and through
customer surveys, Mr. Stevens stated that a significant portion of those
using car shares who park at RTD facilities end up using transit. He said that
the car share parking arrangement helps address the first-mile, last-mile
problem. He noted that certain car share companies require exclusive
signage for their vehicles at reserved parking spaces whereas other
Packet Pg. 14

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

that station has 361 total spaces, 54 reserved spaces, and a waiting list of
24 months.

6.B

Mr. Stevens then discussed which existing RTD parking facilities might be
brought into the parking program. He said that, when the program started in
2008, the foothill facilities were not included but were identified as
candidates for the next phase of the program. He recommended that those
facilities be incorporated into parking program. He stated on average 10% of
parking users come from out of district, whereas in the facilities along the
foothills the out-of-district average approaches 38%. In addition to the
foothills facilities, he recommended that the Lincoln-Jordan station also be
included and stated that marginal parking facilities could be reconsidered and
removed at a later date. In reviewing the impact on revenues, Mr. Stevens
estimated that an across-the-board 12.5% increase across all facilities in the
program would yield:
 $150,000 increased revenue for typical spaces in facilities already
included in the plan;
 $15,000 for additional car share spaces;
 $95,000 for stations along the R and G Lines;
 $100,000 for the Lincoln-Jordan and foothills facilities; and
 $15,000 from additional violation revenue.
The total amount of increased revenue projected would be $375,000, less
$235,000 in initial expenses for the purchase of pay stations and additional
maintenance costs. He said that, if the Board agreed with the rate increase
concept, the next step would be for the Board to formally adopt the rate
increases and parking expansion in April. If the recommended actions are
authorized, he said that patrons would be notified by posted signage and
website notifications.
Director Folska said that Mr. Stevens proposal was an excellent start. She
asked to see a GIS map that would show the economic and demographic
status of persons around the parking facilities proposed to be included in the
parking program. She also commented that being more efficient with the
agency’s rolling stock and available parking would require RTD to employ the
concept of using “big data” in real time. She expressed her hope that RTD
would consider big data before asking the Board to make large purchases
and imagined a scenario in which a patron with a paid reserved parking
Packet Pg. 15

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

companies are more flexible. He recommended that, for facilities where all of
the reserved spaces are sold out, car share companies would have to select
first-come, first-served spaces, for which they would pay a $100 one-time
license fee plus $2.25 per parking session. He also recommended, for
premium locations with a high-demand for parking, that car share companies
purchase exclusive signage at facilities where spaces are available and be
charged a $200 annual license permit fee per signed space, plus $2.25 per
parking session. He said that since the start of the assessment car share
companies have logged 7,886 parking sessions in 11 RTD parking facilities
around the central business district (CBD), indicating a substantial level of
use.

space could put that space up for lease for a nominal charge, thereby freeing
up additional unused space in a parking facility.

Mr. Stevens noted that information would be forthcoming. He said he was
hopeful that people would move to Iliff Station and added that the City of
Aurora set the parking rate at $3.00 to attract out-of-district drivers to park
at Iliff Station rather than Nine Mile Station. He said it is unclear whether the
$1.00 in savings would be enough to incentivize drivers to park at Iliff
Station but noted that Aurora may adjust the rate at Iliff Station if too few
drivers park there. He added that determining a trend could take a few
months.
Director Anderson asked about the parking garage at the Jefferson County
Government Center. She said she had heard anecdotal information that the
garage is not at capacity and noted that there is currently no charge for
parking.
Mr. Stevens estimated that the garage was averaging two-thirds capacity
and speculated that it would be some time before the facility reaches the
90% capacity mark, at which time it would be incorporated into the parking
program. He said that Jefferson County is concerned about pushing drivers
from the parking facility into public parking areas, as drivers may migrate to
the public parking areas to find a free parking space if the foothills facilities
are brought into the parking program.
Director Tisdale asked if there were other facilities with waiting lists.
Mr. Stevens confirmed the four mentioned in the presentation were the only
ones.
Director Tisdale also asked whether Mr. Stevens had considered using the
12.5% rate for in-district patrons and the 17.5% figure for out-of-district
patrons.
Mr. Stevens said the out-of-district parking was initially set at $4.00
because it was double the $2.00 cost for in-district parking.
Director Tisdale questioned whether RTD may be missing out on parking
revenue in the event that a car share vehicle is parked for a brief period of
time and subsequently borrowed by another driver. He said that Mr. Stevens
might want to consider raising the license fee to capture that potential lost
revenue.
Mr. Stevens said that the car share parking permits require them to report
each parking session, even if only for a short duration. He said that creating
a system that is fair for both RTD and the car share companies is difficult.
He mentioned that the City and County of Denver sells an annual parking
permit for $850, which grants a car share company access to any parking

Director Broom asked whether the opening of the parking garage at Iliff
Station would reduce the reserved parking waiting list at Nine Mile Station.

space outside of the CBD. He said that car share companies are paying
Denver $350,000 per year and that RTD’s program would collect only 5-8%
of that amount. He stated he would consider Director Tisdale’s suggestion
of higher license fees.

Henry Stopplecamp said the additional facilities were outside of the areas
serviced by Car2Go.
Director Francone noted that not all RTD parking facilities are included in the
program and asked whether Mr. Stevens’ proposal would add the remainder
of those facilities. Director Francone also noted that all of the foothills
facilities are in her district.
Mr. Stevens said that only 50 out of the 80 facilities would be included and
mentioned that those facilities would cover 90% of all district parking.
Director Williams said that one of RTD’s strategic goals is to increase
ridership and asked how adding additional parking facilities to the parking
program would affect ridership. She asked whether the financial impact of a
potential 18% drop in ridership would be less than or equal to the revenue
gained through the increase in charged parking. She said she understands
that RTD needs to charge for parking but stated that charging for parking
would not add ridership. She stated that RTD should consider the public
relations aspect of such a change.
Mr. Stevens said that the study reported to the Board in August 2016 did
identify the potential for impact but noted that the impacts could be
mitigated by offsetting considerations. He said it would be unlikely that the
high end of the range of potential lost ridership would be realized. He stated
that the southeast and southwest corridors experience the highest parking
usage and that the waiting lists for parking in those corridors has been full
for years. He noted that RTD does not know what the actual impact of a
rate increase would be.
Mr. Stopplecamp noted that the potential 18% drop in ridership is not an
across-the-board impact, but rather only affects ridership at the added
facilities.
Director Williams asked how much money the parking program collects
annually, and Mr. Stevens responded that last year RTD made $166,000 in
net revenue. He said that in 2007 the parking program was initially proposed
to encompass all RTD parking facilities. He said that at that time the
legislature dictated that RTD could not charge in-district riders for the first

Director Francone mentioned that she had met with the former general
manager of the Car2Go car share company, who indicated that the
company’s service area has shrunk dramatically and said that certain areas
of the metro area are no longer serviced by Car2Go. She asked how
incorporating the additional facilities into the parking program would affect
the car share companies.

6.B

day of parking. He speculated that the parking program may one day be
universal but stated that the current system attempts to cover most of the
costs of maintaining the parking facilities.
Director Williams asked whether RTD is making efforts to change the law
regarding parking. General Manager Genova said he would follow up with
her.

Mr. Stevens said that the $850 license gave the car share company the right
to park outside of the CBD at any curb without a neighborhood or other such
restriction. He said that the spaces inside the CBD are more highly allocated
and another permit fee applies for access to those areas.
Director Menten asked when Denver last looked at the parking fee. She said
she was concerned that a patron could purchase a reserved RTD space and
then hold on to it indefinitely. She mentioned the potential of having a
lottery for parking spaces but stated that she did not know whether doing so
would be appropriate.
Mr. Stopplecamp said that reserved spaces are tied to license plates, which
negates the possibility of reselling or sub-leasing reserved parking.
Director Broom stated that the parking system is inherently unfair in that
some facilities have adequate free parking and others charge for spaces. He
said that the term free parking is an oxymoron because there are always
operations and maintenance costs. He said that RTD should have a longterm goal of developing an enterprise system in which all parking would be
paid parking and any excess revenue could be applied to building more
parking structures.
Mr. Stopplecamp said the reason the foothills facilities have been proposed
to be included in the parking program is that RTD can charge on the first day
for out-of-district patrons.
General Manager Genova stated that one of main objectives of the parking
program was managing demand rather than driving revenue, as RTD wanted
to control who parks at its facilities. He stated that including the Wagon
Road Station into the parking program freed up parking capacity and noted
that students would use Table Mesa Park-n-Ride for long-term parking rather
than using campus parking. He said RTD had no way to enforce parking at
district facilities prior to the program. He said that prior to the parking
program’s inception RTD received an unsolicited proposal to manage
parking. He said that the RTD Act was amended to allow a third party who
owned and operated parking facilities to charge for parking as long as RTD
would receive none of that revenue. General Manger Genova said that, as a
result of proposal, RTD performed an analysis and drafted a large-scale
Packet Pg. 18

Director Menten asked for confirmation that Denver sells yearly parking
spaces at any location for $850.

6.B

parking analysis report, which he said he could make available to the
Directors.

Mr. Stopplecamp said that the parking program helps pay for inspections of
the lots and the equipment but does not pay for all maintenance. He stated
that RTD’s goal is to move patrons to areas with more capacity.
Chair Hoy said the Wagon Road parking facility was at capacity prior to the
fare structure change in 2016, which drove many complaints from his
constituents. He said that riders began to park in Thornton following the fare
change, which freed up parking at Wagon Road, indicating that patrons are
sensitive to fares. He stated that daily in-district rates are not affected by
the addition of facilities to the parking program and that patrons would not
choose another form of transportation as a result.
Director Lubow reiterated that Mr. Stevens is not proposing an increase tied
to the CPI but rather a lesser amount. She questioned whether RTD would
have justification for an arbitrary increase not tied to a specific number.
Mr. Stopplecamp said that the presentation was meant to allow the Board to
ask questions and that his team was looking to the Board for
recommendations. He said his impression was that the Board was interested
in raising parking rates and that the question was by how much. He said
there is no magic number and that most patrons would not balk at the small
proposed increase.
Director Lubow said that she has written many regulations and stated that
an increase should be tied to a set number. She said she favored an out-ofdistrict parking rate of $4.50.
Mr. Stevens said that the parking program administrators initially considered
an increase of 10% and looked to the CPI before settling on the 12.5% indistrict increase. He said that certain considerations caused them to lower
the proposed rate from 17.5% and that the lower rate increase may soften
the potential impact to ridership. He stated that the lower parking usage and
ridership would be backfilled by the latent demand.
Director Tisdale said that he found the proposed increase to be conservative.
He said that any lost ridership would relate to a small percentage of out-ofdistrict patrons and that in-district patrons do not have to pay unless they
park overnight. He said that any formal decision on the parking rate increase
may have to wait until after April and that the committee may need to meet
again before proceeding.
Packet Pg. 19

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy stated that the parking program does not net large sums of money
but noted that the costs of parking maintenance are defrayed by the parking
revenues. He said he is opposed to charging parking fees for all RTD patrons
but noted that the users of the parking facilities are not transit users. He
asked whether the pay stations accept cash or credit, and Mr. Stevens said
that the machines take both forms of payment.

6.B

Director Francone said that the Board should discuss the changes at a Study
Session prior to issuing any formal resolution. She said she is not opposed to
charging for parking and that the issue is long overdue. She asked what
happens to violation revenue.

Director Folska mentioned the concept of demand pricing and stated that
two people riding on the same airplane may pay drastically different rates.
She said that demand pricing may address the issue of who can afford
parking and who cannot and said that people actually have a choice in their
mobility.

D. Other Matters
Bill Van Meter provided an update to the Pass Program working group as requested
by the Board. He stated that the first meeting is scheduled for Monday, March 13.
He confirmed that there will also be meetings in other jurisdictions. He said they
are talked to some educational institutions and with Jefferson County. He
commented that meetings around the district will allow RTD to solicit input from
citizens and allow better access to meetings. Mr. Van Meter said that all meetings
are open to the public and there will be public comment at every meeting.
Mr. Van Meter stated the East High School Constitutional Scholars have declined to
participate because of the time commitment. He said with their decline it opened
up two spots and General Manager Genova has invited two new stakeholders to
the group; a representative from The University of Colorado, David Cook and
representative from the Independence Institute, David Polhill.
General Manager Genova stated that there was a request to have all the
information regarding the Pass Program working groups provided on RTD’s website
as well as on the two-week calendar.
Director Lubow asked if Mr. Van Meter could inform everyone of where the meeting
would be held.
Mr. Van Meter stated that the meeting is on Monday, March 13, 2017 at the
Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce located at 1445 Market Street, meeting starts
at 1 p.m.
Director Folska said that she was disappointed that there were no RTD Board
Members involved in the Pass Program working group. She also stated that she
was aware that some University of Colorado staff were upset that they were not
involved in the working group.
Packet Pg. 20

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. McIntosh stated that RTD keeps all of the parking fine revenue. Mr.
Stevens stated that violations are $20 for the first infraction and $50 for the
second and each subsequent infraction. He noted that RTD does not have
strong enforcement mechanisms and as a result many of the fines are not
paid.

6.B

Director Lubow mentioned that David Cook, a representative of University of
Colorado, was a new addition to group.
Director Francone thanked General Manager Genova for the recent additions to the
working group.

Director Lubow handed out a draft resolution from the City of Longmont. She
asked the Board to have a discussion regarding what RTD will do with the money
from the Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) refinancing and other
FasTracks funds.
Director Lubow stated that it is known that the Board has some issues with
Mobility Choice, but it is important to get funding to allow RTD to get in front of
new technology. She informed that Board that she has a meeting scheduled with
Mayor Jim Gunning in the near future that is open to other Board members to
attend.
Director Anderson stated the P3 process was being penalized. She said that she
opposes any of this money going towards anything but fixing the University of
Colorado A Line and the completion of the G Line.
Chair Hoy advised Director Lubow that the invitation to meet with Mayor Jim
Gunning must first go through the proper meeting procedures before she moves
forward. He also stated that before any of the Board makes a decision about
Mobility Choice, we will need a full update from staff. He said that staff will have
the opportunity to address everyone’s issues.
Director Francone stated that she was under the impression that there was nothing
before the Board to consider regarding Mobility Choice. She mentioned that she
didn’t know why the Board would be meeting with Mayor Gunning to discuss
Mobility Choice. She asked General Manager Genova to provide more information
regarding the relationship between RTD and Mobility Choice.
General Manager Genova said that that there will be an update on Mobility Choice
in March during the Financial Administration and Audit committee. He stated that
staff will brief the Board on some changes that have been made and try to share as
much information as can regarding Mobility Choice.
Director Francone noted that she would like to see how Mobility Choice fits in with
the 2018 RTD goals that were defined at the Board retreat.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates, Inc.
Roger Sherman, CRL Associates, said that it was unclear whether the
legislature would be submitting a referred measure to the voters. He said he
had heard that the prospects for transportation legislation had gone from poor
to better within a span of a few days during the previous week. He said that
Fix Colorado Roads, a coalition that includes Move Colorado and the Metro
Mayors Caucus, is moving in parallel to the legislature on their own ballot
issues and that the group plans to submit a number of ballot questions prior to
the upcoming title board deadline. He suggested that the group would be
submitting ballot questions regardless of what happens with the legislature.
He said that the group is looking at two or three different tax increase
proposals and that there are a number of scenarios where RTD could
potentially benefit from a ballot question and the money that would flow to
local jurisdictions. He said that the Colorado Department of Transportation
(CDOT) would be receiving a significant amount of funds for infrastructure
improvements, which would then allow local jurisdictions to have the
flexibility to band together on regional projects. Mr. Sherman said that he
would keep the Board informed of any new developments.
Mr. Sherman added that members of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)
had met with Directors earlier that day and that they would be meeting with
two additional Directors on Friday. Mr. Sherman said he would be presenting
summary of the meetings at the April meeting.
Director Folska said that she had declined to meet with CAC members the
previous year because she failed to see a tangible contribution on their part to
RTD, though she did not attribute that as a failing by the CAC or Mr.
Packet Pg. 24

Sherman. She said she does not see RTD making an effort to integrate the
CAC’s input into decision-making and would be happy to meet with the CAC
again in the future. She stated that CAC members could be integrated into the
pass program working group, because the numerical limit on current
participants was an arbitrary number.

Mr. Sherman said that the primary advocate for changing the transit agency
structure is Denver Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman. He said there is a plan
to go to the voters with a bonding issue. Mr. Sherman said he doubts whether
the city administration has the desire to get into transit business. He said the
City and County of Denver is under pressure to provide more sidewalks, bike
lanes, first/last-mile solutions, and circulators, and he speculated that any
bonding issue would fund those projects rather than forming a new transit
agency. He said he does not believe that a majority of those on the city
council would agree to a proposal that would form a new transit agency and
knows the mayor would not support it.
Director Francone said she would like to know what benefit RTD would
receive from any of the ballot proposals currently under consideration. She
said that the MPACT64 proposals and bills coming out of the legislature do
not direct funding toward RTD. She questioned why RTD is participating in
the discussions and questioned whether RTD should be using its resources in
these efforts.
Mr. Sherman said that new revenues being directed toward RTD would be
unlikely because RTD has its own funding source. He said that RTD’s
participation in the conversation is important, particularly because of the
proposed flexible funds for local jurisdictions, with which the jurisdictions
could pool their resources. He mentioned that, in the past, certain local
governments contributed a high degree of matching funding for the projects
such as the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). Mr. Sherman said that such
funding is a direct benefit to RTD and that he believes that the agency and the
Board should participate in the process regardless of the jurisdiction and
regardless of whether the given locality is interested in more bus routes, bus
miles, or infrastructure improvements.
Committee Chair Walker said he agreed with Mr. Sherman that RTD should
participate in the ballot question conversations. He said that he was recently
asked to sit on the transportation and mobility committee of a general
obligation bond issue group and sat on a similar one in 2007. He stated that
one of the projects that came out of the prior effort was the bike bridge over
I-25 that leads to Colorado station. He said that, if Denver wants to build
sidewalks and improve bus stops within the city, RTD would also benefit. He
asked whether other local cities were pursuing similar initiatives.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 7, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone asked Roger Sherman about speculation that Denver may
split off and form its own transit organization.

6.C

Mr. Sherman said that a similar ballot question failed in Arvada and that he is
not sure whether any other local government is preparing to do something
similar. He said Aurora is always looking at options.
Director Lubow said that she would be interested in securing funding for
FasTracks and that she hopes local jurisdictions would band together to
leverage their flexible funds.

Mr. Sherman said that the situation is unique in that revenues would be
coming from sales tax. He said that the additional incremental sales tax from
an initiative could push some cities toward a 9% or 10% sales tax rate.
Director Anderson asked whether there is strong support for transit being part
of a ballot initiative.
Mr. Sherman responded that the answer to Director Anderson’s question
changes depending on who is answering. He said here is not a lot of support
for levying a statewide sales tax and taking a portion of it to flow directly into
RTD, which is why the initiative proponents have come up the idea of flexible
funding. He said that, in jurisdictions where transit is important, the
discretionary money is available for that purpose.

• State Update -State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry-McKenna Public Affairs, said that there is
enormous potential for a transportation bill, sponsored by the President of the
Colorado Senate and the Speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives,
that would direct flexible funds to local jurisdictions. She said she is
encouraged that the President and the Speaker have been involved in ongoing
talks on the issue and is optimistic the bill would be introduced in April 2017.
She said it is important for RTD to be part of the conversation around the
crafting of transportation legislation because RTD acts as a statewide partner
and has reputation for creating results. Regarding the state budget, Ms.
Brandeberry said that both parties realize they need to apply some outsidethe-box thinking. She said that, as opposed to years past, legislative
leadership, not just the Joint Budget Committee (JBC), would have input on
the rollout of the budget and that budget talks have been delayed pending
House and Senate agreements on transportation funding and the hospital
provider fee.
Director Broom asked whether local jurisdictions have been encouraged to
develop lists of projects for any flexible funds identified in the forthcoming
referred measure, lest the voters say that the measures are merely a blank
check.
Ms. Brandeberry said that no bill has been introduced yet, though she stated
that discussions have indicated the referred measure would take the form of

Director Broom stated that local jurisdictions are reluctant to go forward with
their own bond issues because the legislature is working on measures of its
own.

a sales tax increase. She said that discussions will need to take place on how
to bond off of the sales tax, how to repeal certain taxes such as the gas tax,
and how state general fund money would be used to pay off bonds.
Mr. Sherman said that the campaign entity that will be formed to advocate
for the passage of the referred measure would push for local jurisdictions to
outline the projects for which the flexible funds would be used.

• Federal Update – Squire Patton Boggs
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, said that Mike Dino of
Squire Patton Boggs was in Washington, D.C., at the time of the meeting
and that she was happy to answer questions.
Director Folska asked Ms. Ellebracht to give the new Directors background
information on the Highway Transportation Trust Fund and the 80/20 federalto-state matching ratio.
Ms. Ellebracht responded that she could deliver that information offline and
that Mr. Dino could better address the issue. She also said that the Directors
had each been given information on the talking points the Directors would be
using during the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C., the
following weekend. She said that she would follow up with any information
that came out of the conference.

B. Recommended Actions

• Approval of Router Contract
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
enter into a sole source contract not to exceed $2,500,000 with Sierra
Wireless America, Inc. (Sierra Wireless) for upgrade of existing onboard
routers and purchase of new onboard wireless routers and associated
equipment (Contract Number 17DH004). This contract will include upgrading
existing routers with new integrated cellular data modems, purchase of new
onboard routers with associated equipment, documentation and training.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, stated that Eric
Farrington would provide an overview of this item.
Eric Farrington, IT Program Manager, stated that this
procurement is for multiple projects: Access-a-Ride fleet, Calln-Ride fleet, new trains, and the replacement of cellular data
cards on the fixed route fleet. He stated that the rationale for
changing the data cards for fixed route fleet is that the current
plug-in cellular data card has been failing at the rate of three to
five a week. He remarked that RTD needs an industrial grade

card instead of the consumer grade card to reduce
maintenance and provide stability. He noted that the previous
provider stopped making the cards currently in use, so RTD
had to seek a new provider.
Director Deadwyler asked how this upgrade would affect
Access-a-Ride.

Director Williams inquired if this equipment is designed for
future expansion.
Mr. Farrington remarked that RTD does not plan to offer wifi
to customers. He stated that this upgrade is for onboard
equipment to network with backup equipment.

• Budget Transfer for Increased Access-a-Ride Contract Costs
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize a budget transfer from the Board
Appropriated Reserve to the Access-a-Ride contracts for MV Transportation
(Contract 13-DH-053 in the amount of $1,700,000) and Via Mobility
Services (Contract 13-DH-055 in the amount of $810,000) to cover the
additional costs associated with increased driver wages. The total dollar
amount of the budget transfer is $2,510,000.
Motion:

Director Solano made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Mr. Farrington stated that the Access-a-Ride fleet would be

Positioning Systems (GPS) on one device.

6.D

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
stated that RTD has had very real challenges with meeting the
demands for Access-a-Ride service. He remarked that, with
the new vendor contracts, RTD’s vendors have been able to
recruit better, and their classes are full. He noted that there
has been a drop in return routes, and initial results are
promising. He commented that the budget increase is for
necessary personnel levels which will allow RTD to execute
contracts with service providers.
Ms. McKillop stated that there are funds available in the Board
Appropriated Reserve. She added that there will be ample
funds to backfill the reserve during the amended budget
process.
Director Broom asked what percentage increase this amount
represents.
Mr. Abel stated that the percentage increase is 13%. He
noted that fixed costs are unchanged, but the increase was
recognized in the variable costs.
Director Broom asked how much of a wage increase the
vendors are offering to the new operators.
Mr. Abel stated that wages have increased from $10.00 per
hour to $15.00 per hour.
Director Williams remarked that this increase has been very
effective. She noted that the Senior Resource Center has
filled their driver staffing needs and she thanked staff for
making this happen.
Director Deadwyler commended staff and stated that she has
seen a difference in Access-a-Ride. She said that the drivers
are excited and they are performing happily and timely. She
noted that this is a positive move and might provide RTD with
national news coverage.
Director Folska added that this increase is appropriate and she
would be supporting this item.

C. Updates
General Manager Genova first spoke about the RTD Board’s history with the
Mobility Choice Blueprint. He said that the concept was introduced to RTD
in 2015 when Don Hunt, principal of the Antero Company and former
Executive Director of the Colorado Department of Transportation, and Kelly
Brough, President and CEO of the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce
(DMCC), met with Chair Sisk and Director James. He said that months later
RTD staff was asked to participate in meetings between the Colorado
Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), RTD, DMCC, and representatives from the private
sector to discuss the structure and scope of the Mobility Choice Blueprint
study. He stated that those meetings resulted in the recommended action
that was presented to the Board in September 2016, which failed. He stated
that, immediately following the Board’s vote on the item, the Mobility
Choice Board (MC Board) met to decide how to proceed. He said that the
MC Board changed their proposal and have brought it back to the Board to
be presented as an informational item. He said that RTD staff has been in
discussions with the MC Board because RTD regularly participates in
collaborations regarding the district, and he cited Denver Public Schools
(DPS) as an example of a such a collaborative partner. He stated that the
Mobility Choice Blueprint coincides with several items addressed in RTD’s
strategic plan.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, presented additional
detail on the Mobility Choice Blueprint, describing it as a public/private
initiative intended to maximize investments in the transportation system,
leverage technology to plan for future workforce and employer mobility
needs, and increase economic opportunities and quality of life. He said the
main idea is to encourage joint transportation planning by RTD, DRCOG, and
CDOT in order to avoid stranded investments, create a mobility strategy for
the Denver metro region, and leverage new technological advancements. He
said that none of the results of the study would be binding on any of the
agencies and that results may be so compelling as to encourage further
collaboration.
Mr. Van Meter said that, when the recommended action was first presented
to the RTD Board, the proposed cost of the study was $500,000 for each of
the participating public agencies, RTD, CDOT, and DRCOG. He said that
following the vote of the RTD Board the MC Board altered their proposal to
take into account RTD’s concerns about the cost of the study and the use of
its allocated funds. He stated that, for the public participants, the amended
proposal outlines that:
 100% of public funds would be used for study costs rather than for
administrative staff salaries;
Packet Pg. 33

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

• Mobility Choice Blueprint: A Public/Private Initiative

6.D

The proposed funding share for each agency would be lowered to
$400,000;
 The public funding would flow through CDOT, following the drafting
of intergovernmental agreements (IGA) between the agencies;
 The technical scope of the study would be developed by agency
staff; and
 The study would include extensive public engagement and
stakeholder outreach.
He said that under the revised proposal DMCC and the Gates Family
Foundation would fund any administrative costs outside of the technical
study and that Mobility Choice would be a program of the Denver Metro
Chamber Leadership Foundation. He said that, in addition to the
organizations previously identified, the MC Board would include
representatives from two economic development organizations.
Mr. Van Meter said that the next step would be for RTD Board consideration
of the revised proposal. He said that, if that item were to pass, the program
participants would then proceed to draft a memorandum of understanding
(MOU) among the organizations, finalize public sector funding IGAs,
determine the contracting structure using CDOT as the vehicle; release
requests for proposals, and review and select the received proposals. He
said that the study could commence in the summer of 2017, with a
completion date in early 2018.
Director Broom asked whether, procedurally, a Director voting on the
prevailing side of the failed recommended action on the Mobility Choice
Blueprint would need to move for reconsideration of the action in order to
discuss the proposal again.
Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said that the item before the Board was not
an action item and that, since the proposal had changed materially, the
mover of any related action item need not move for reconsideration.
Director Lubow asked why the study included private sector input. She said
the recently completed Northwest Area Mobility Study had no private
component.
Mr. Van Meter responded that the private sector had pushed the three public
agencies forward. He said that, with the revised proposal, the public
agencies would take the lead in the study while the private sector
participants would use the results of the study and any information gained
to support pilot projects outside of the purview of the public agencies. He
invited the Mobility Choice representatives in the audience to answer
questions on their own behalf.

6.D

Director Lubow stated that each agency would be asked to contribute
$400,000 and asked how much the private contributions would be.
Mr. Hunt said that private contributions would match public contributions
and that the MC Board had received commitments for that amount. He
reminded the board the amended proposal contained provisions to keep
public and private sector funds separate.
Director Lubow said she was concerned with the impact of the study on the
unfunded FasTracks corridors. She said she would suggest that, for the
purposes of the study, the unfunded corridors could be treated as though
they had been constructed.
Mr. Van Meter said that he understood Director Lubow’s message and that,
because FasTracks was approved by the voters, RTD staff would follow the
will of the voters.
Director Solano asked why other firms or university programs were not
considered in the request for information (RFI) process.
Mr. Van Meter said that the MC Board was the entity that put out the RFI
and said that responses came from 10 private entities.
Director Solano asked what caused the public agencies contribution to drop
to $400,000.
Mr. Van Meter responded that the RTD Board felt that $500,000 was a lot
of money and the proposal was revised to a minimum funding amount of
$1.2 million.
Director Mihalik asked whether RTD staff had any involvement in the
Mobility Choice Blueprint beyond the involvement of General Manager
Genova and Mr. Van Meter.

Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Hunt stated that he saw the collaboration between CDOT, RTD, and
DRCOG as an opportunity to move transportation forward. He said having
the direct input of large private employers was a good move and that
including private participants in the study would allow funding to hire
individuals to oversee administrative matters, pursue other funding sources
without the need for additional public dollars, and seek enhanced public
involvement. He stated that the private participants intend to use private
dollars to enhance public education and leverage public monetary
contributions.

6.D

Mr. Van Meter responded that RTD staff had been involved in presentations
to the RTD Board and in meetings in 2016 in which General Counsel
Asphaug, Bruce Abel, and RTD procurement representatives participated.
Director Walker asked what was lost with the $300,000 total reduction in
funding for the study.

Director Walker asked how the Board’s concerns about geographic diversity
on the MC Board were being addressed.
Mr. Van Meter said that the representatives from two economic
development organizations were added to the MC Board.
Mr. Hunt added that the MC Board was currently seeking input on which
organizations should be included.
Director Walker asked which geographic areas those organizations would
represent.
Mr. Van Meter said that the organization would represent business interests
in the northern and southern areas of the metro area.
Director Anderson thanked the participants for reworking the proposal. She
said she had concerns initially and wanted to make sure that Mobility Choice
was the right thing to do. She said that RTD does not undertake
transportation planning by itself and that RTD, DRCOG, and CDOT are at the
table. She said that the agencies need to work together to seek the best
investments to help the Denver metro area and Colorado stay vital. She
speculated that transportation would change rapidly over the next 20 years
and said that RTD does not have 20 years to plan the next transportation
system. She closed by saying she was in favor of the proposal.
Director Deadwyler said that CDOT sought to put forth a transportationrelated ballot initiative in 2012 and asked whether the Mobility Choice
Blueprint study is another way of preparing a ballot initiative.
General Manager Genova responded that the intent of the Mobility Choice
Blueprint was to look at scope of planning around transportation services.
He said that an early iteration of the proposal did include a ballot initiative.
Director Deadwyler said she was concerned that that General Manager
Genova was answering for the other agencies and asked what would they
say.
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Van Meter said that the contingency reserve was the key piece that was
dropped and that the scope of the study remained the same.

6.D

Ms. Brough said that the private sector does not become involved with a
project to seek tax increases. She said that DMCC has partnered with RTD
for decades to determine the most critical investments and said that
FasTracks is an example of that partnership. She said companies see that
transportation is important and that a public/private approach can be a more
successful way to accomplish objectives. She said that the participants are
not saying the study will surely drive a tax increase, though a tax increase
might be one of the outcomes.

Mr. Hunt said that he had been the person to initiate the project and has
been working with the MC Board to determine potential candidates to serve
as executive director. He said that the primary candidate is Jim Gunning,
though he is not under contract, and that his contract would be worked out
by the MC Board and its executive committee.
Director Archuleta asked Mr. Gunning how much he would be paid and
whether that amount would be $10,000 per month.
Mr. Gunning said that amount was one of the figures that had been
discussed.
Director Archuleta asked whether his salary would be lower than originally
proposed because the current proposal would cost $300,000 less.
Mr. Gunning said that he would be paid through private sector funding.
Director Archuleta asked whether he would be willing to take a pay cut.
Mr. Gunning said he would probably be willing to take the position for a
slightly smaller salary.
Mr. Hunt said that it would not be appropriate to negotiate the terms of his
contract at the committee meeting. He reiterated that the current proposal
states the $400,000 from each public agency would go toward hiring the
technical consultant that would work for project management team. He
further stated that, if the MC Board decides to hire a director or staff person,
that person would be compensated by private contributions.
Director Tisdale asked whether it would be fair to say the proposal is
intended to prevent “siloing” of transportation planning.
Mr. Van Meter said that was one of the goals, as was support from the
private sector for pilot programs identified through the study.
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Archuleta asked who would direct the study.

6.D

Director Tisdale responded to Director Lubow’s concerns about
unconstructed corridors and asked for confirmation that changing a voter
mandate would require another voter mandate, rather than through the
unilateral action of an agency.
Mr. Van Meter agreed with Director Tisdale’s assessment and said that
would be the understanding of RTD staff.

Mr. Van Meter said, based on his engagement with the project to date, he
expected that the RTD Board would have a voice at the table. He further
stated that he expected the RTD Board would receive regular feedback
regarding the activities of the study and that the RTD Board would be able
to give directed input.
Director Tisdale said that DMCC has used a collaborative, broad-based
approach in the past. He said public participation and collaboration are
critical for public/private partnerships and that the Board’s place is not
negotiate private sector salaries or work conditions as long as an
organization does not use RTD funds.
Director Francone asked where the $400,000 for the study would come
from.
Heather McKillop, Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration
and Chief Financial Officer, said that $500,000 had been set aside in the
previous year’s budget. She said there would be room in the unrestricted
reserve of the current fiscal year’s budget to pay for the study.
Director Francone said that Mr. Van Meter had mentioned stranded
investments and asked who determines whether an investment is stranded.
Mr. Van Meter said that the participating agencies would determine the best
use of investments and that none of the findings of the study would be
binding on the agencies. He said that the recommendations resulting from
the study would hopefully be compelling enough to give Directors
confidence to make the investments identified. He offered a hypothetical
example of a stranded investment, such as implementation of technology
that could not be cross utilized by RTD, CDOT or DRCOG.
Director Francone asked how the region’s rail system was determined to be
a top priority.
Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Tisdale asked whether Mr. Van Meter had any doubt that the RTD
Board’s concerns would not be addressed.

6.D

Mr. Van Meter said the MC Board made that determination based on the
billions of dollars that have already been invested in the rail system.
Director Francone asked why the report is necessary if that priority has
already been established.
Mr. Van Meter said that the study seeks to look at first/last mile transit, bike
and pedestrian access, a bus feeder system, and interactions with Uber and
Lyft.

Mr. Hunt said the current representation includes eight private company
individuals, three representatives from public agencies, two at-large public
officials, and eventually the two economic development agency
representatives. He said the only limitation to the number of MC Board
members is the 21-member limit identified in charter. He said that the
project currently has a four-person management team.
Director Francone asked whether the current MC Board is a continuation of
the same organization that received $4.5 million from the Gates Family
Foundation.
Mr. Hunt said that he did not know of an entity called Mobility Choice before
his involvement in 2015.
Ms. Brough said there has never been another Mobility Choice and stated
there was previously a transit alliance.
Director Francone said the documents showing the contribution from the
Gates Family Foundation have been removed from DMCC website.
Ms. Brough said she had only been at DMCC for seven years but was
confident her organization has not received $4.5 million from the Gates
Family Foundation for a program such as Mobility Choice.
Director Francone said that Mr. Hunt had previously provided documentation
from DMCC identifying Mobility Choice as a sponsor to the DMCC
Leadership Foundation in the “$10,000 and up” category. She asked
whether that organization was the same Mobility Choice group currently
under discussion and asked where that funding came from.
Ms. Brough confirmed that the Mobility Choice identified in Mr. Hunt’s
documents is the same group as the Mobility Choice being discussed but
said she did not know about the $10,000 contribution.

Director Francone asked about the composition of the MC Board.

6.D

Director Folska asked what kind of legal entity is Mobility Choice.

Director Folska asked whether the executive director of the Mobility Choice
Blueprint is now more like a program director now that the program exists
within DMCC, and Mr. Hunt agreed that was an accurate assessment.
Director Folska asked who has ultimate responsibility and authority over the
Mobility Choice Blueprint.
Mr. Hunt said that the program board would direct the program director and
that the program would promulgate a charter or operating agreement to be
approved by the MC Board, which would give the program latitude to
operate.
Director Folska asked who sat on the oversight board.
Mr. Hunt said that the oversight board is composed of Bruce Alexander of
Vectra Bank, Ms. Brough, Becca O’Brien Kuusinen of McKinsey & Company,
Brendan McGuire of Vail Resorts, Aiden Mitchell of Arrow Electronics, Brian
Oehler of IHS Markit, Jin Alexander Tsuchiya of Kaiser Permanente, and
Jarrett Wendt of Panasonic.
Director Folska asked why the oversight board did not include a
representative from one of Colorado’s public universities.
Mr. Hunt said he recently joined the University of Colorado as senior fellow
in transportation and stated that Colorado is weak in knowledge, expertise,
and interest in the area.
Director Folska said there are plenty of people who are interested in the
issues that are part of the study. She said she has been encouraging RTD
staff to partner with local colleges. She said she loves the idea of a Mobility
Choice study and that she thinks partnerships are critical to engage in open
source conversation.
Director Menten asked whether DMCC has already spent the $400,000 they
have committed.

Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Mr. Hunt said Mobility Choice was previously a standalone 501(c)(3)
organization. He said that, when the MC Board separated the public and
private contributions following the RTD Board vote in September 2016, that
the 501(c)(3) designation was no longer applicable. He said the MC Board
then determined Mobility Choice would be a program of the Denver Metro
Chamber Leadership Foundation, which is itself a 501(c)(3) organization.

6.D

Mr. Hunt said that DMCC is committing to the $400,000 contribution in
parity with the public agencies.
Director Menten asked how much DMCC has expended to date, and Mr.
Hunt said $40,000.
Director Williams asked to see the responses to the RFI process.

Director Williams asked whether RTD staff could condense the responses.
Mr. Hunt said that he had already prepared a summary, which could be
released as long as parts were redacted.
Director Solano asked why Mr. Gunning was the candidate selected to be
the program director.
Mr. Hunt said the MC Board ranked him as their first choice but have not yet
offered him a contract.
Director Solano disagreed that Colorado’s universities are not capable of
participating in the study and said that he has spoken with graduates who
said that they could undertake the study at a significantly reduced rate.
Mr. Hunt said that they did not respond to the RFI.
Director Lubow said that she was unclear on the structure of the Mobility
Choice Blueprint because of the private funding and private control. She said
her confusion has to do with the executive director being paid by private
money but controlling the entire project.
General Manager Genova said the project itself would be managed jointly by
the public agency representatives and the executive director.
Director Lubow asked what the executive director would do.
Mr. Hunt said that individual would be part of the project management team.
He said that person would determine whether sufficient funding existed to
conduct public outreach and would look for pilot programs to initiate new
modes of transportation. He said the director would have other
responsibilities to the MC Board to enhance the overall effort of the Mobility
Choice Blueprint.

Mr. Hunt said he would supply those responses to her. He noted that RTD
staff has reviewed the confidential responses and that there are many ideas
that were incorporated into the scope of the study.

6.D

Director Lubow said that she wanted to make sure no appearance of
impropriety existed. She asked whether private backers, such as Vail
Resorts, would reap benefits from the outcome of the study and what steps
were being taken to make sure that would not happen.

Mr. Hunt said he was interested in avoiding any conflict of interest or the
appearance of any conflict. He said that the attorney of the MC Board has
made it clear that board members represent the entire board, rather than
private interests.
Director Lubow said she had concerns that the RTD Board would not be
informed of developments with the study and that the Board should be able
to have impact on scope of the work and the study’s conclusions so as not
to be surprised.
Director Francone said she does not disagree with concept of the study but
does disagree with the format. She asked what would happen in the event
that a program management team, which is composed of four people, ended
in a tie.
Mr. Van Meter said that the program management team would use CDOT’s
standard procurement process, which utilizes a scoring system, and that
there would not be a tie.
General Manager Genova said the selection process would be like RTD’s
selection process.
Director Francone asked whether any of the private MC Board members
have any financial interest in those firms.
Mr. Hunt said they do not and that the MC Board policy states that
members, and their firms, may not participate in the study.
Director Francone asked Mr. Hunt if he had responded to the RFI, and Mr.
Hunt said he had not.
Director Solano asked whether anyone was familiar with Senate Bill 17-213
regarding autonomous vehicles.

Packet Pg. 42

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 21, 2017 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said the program manager and public
representatives would drive the drive the day-to-day work of the study
rather than the private members of the oversight board. He said the program
managers would develop scope of work and that group would be equivalent
to a project management team at RTD.

6.D

Mizraim Cordero from DMCC said his organization is in support of that bill,
which defines an automated vehicle under Colorado law. He said that
companies who are developing autonomous vehicles in the state must work
with CDOT, Colorado Department of Revenue (CDOR), and law
enforcement.
Director Solano asked why the study was necessary in light of the bill.

Director Folska asked how long the study would take to complete.
Mr. Van Meter said it would be completed in approximately nine months.

• Quarterly Audit Update
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Manager of Internal Audit, stated that she and
Kevin Parker, Senior Auditor, would provide the Audit Committee update.
She commented that the Audit department performs the work and makes
recommendations, and management implements those changes. She noted
that in December the annual audit plan was changed to focus on the value
that the Audit department adds rather than the number of audits completed.
She commented that the Audit department wants to start a dialogue with
the committee to improve and add value to RTD. She highlighted that the
Audit annual calendar outlines the audit planning process and quarterly
reports will include current events, critical findings, emerging trends, and the
results of follow up activities.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop stated that the following audits are currently in progress:
 IT General Controls
 IT Access Controls
 FasTracks Staffing
 FasTracks Openings
 Smart Card Stored Value Development
 Overtime Audit
 Gifts and Promotions
Ms. Isaac-Heslop noted that follow-up audits are expected to be completed
according to the calendar provided.
Director Anderson asked if these audits were requested by the Board.

Mr. Cordero said the bill merely establishes a framework for what an

Director Anderson stated that her concern was if the Board had asked for
audits that interfered with management being able to perform their duties.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop remarked that in the 2017 audit plan there was a list of
audits requested but not able to be completed due to lack of resources.

Ms. Isaac-Heslop said it was included, but it would not be done until the end
of the year. The 2017 calendar included in the presentation only covered
audits from January through June.
Committee Chair Menten reminded the Board that Ms. Isaac-Heslop’s
request for additional resources was not approved last year.
Ms. Isaac-Heslop stated that was correct. She added that a full time
employee should be hired instead of a temporary employee because of the
confidential nature of the information included in the audits.

• Fiscal Sustainability Update
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, stated
that the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force was formed in 2010. In 2011, high
priority items were included, which RTD implemented.
Task Force recommendations that were completed were:
 Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
 Service Optimization
 Fund Balance Policy
 Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
 Technology and Energy Innovation
 Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
Recommendations that are ongoing:
 Naming Rights
 Partnerships and Privatization
Recommendations with low priority:
 Charge for Parking
 Tolling and Managed Lanes
 Home Rule Initiative
Director Williams stated that the Board just spent two hours discussing
Mobility Choice, an ongoing recommendation under Partnerships and
Privatization.

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, commented that
the King Soopers kiosk continues to operate without any technical issues.
She added that King Soopers has posted $1,000 in sales, and Safeway has
posted $800. She noted that Safeway has signed the agreement and staff
anticipates they will install all of the machines within the next month. She
added that as of this update, King Soopers is running a few weeks behind
Safeway.
Ms. McKillop noted that Safeway has two pilot stores open, and all of the
Safeway stores may be completed before King Soopers. She added that
RTD is still on track for the go live date on May 10, 2017.
Chair Hoy asked if RTD’s goal is to have all of the stores installed with
RTD’s technology.
Ms. Anderson said yes, the goal is to have machines in as many stores that
will allow it.
Director Francone asked for an explanation of the May 10th go live date.
Ms. McKillop stated that RTD will go live with the Smart Card portal on May
10th with the current smart card test participants. They will test the site for
two weeks, and then it will open to the general public on May 24, 2017.
She added that in order to get a smart card, someone must acquire it from
RTD first, but they can then reload the card from home or from one of the
stores.
Director Francone commented that she had requests for information from
the Colorado School of Mines as they try to work out their summer pass
program.
Ms. McKillop said a member of staff would contact the Colorado School of
Mines but noted that, depending on what type of information they are
looking for, it might not be available to them.

• Fourth Quarter 2016 Performance Report

Ms. McKillop added that RTD met 89% of the Key Performance Indicators
(KPI) last year.

• January 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report
Ms. McKillop stated that sales and use tax is down 4.5% and said staff set
aside funds in the operating reserve in anticipation of lower revenues. She
noted that CU Leeds School of Business should publish their forecast the
following week, and staff will present their findings through the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and the Amended Budget. She added that ridership is
down 1%, and fare revenue is down $658.

• Monthly Payment Register
Committee Chair Menten stated that this update item was for informational
purposes only. She added that CU Leeds School of Business would present

B. Recommended Actions

• Proposed May 2017 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the May 2017 Service Change package as
revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost of
approximately $221,300 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or
his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private
operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said
the first action item is the proposed May 2017 Service
Changes. He stated that draft recommendations were
socialized to the public so that staff could get input and
feedback. As a result of the input, feedback and ongoing
analyses, staff has completed the final recommendations
before the Board. He noted that included in the service
change is a recommendation to open the Fox and Pecos
stations on the B line. Staff is asking to open those stations
contingently, upon approval from the Federal Railroad
Administration (FRA).
Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling,
noted that the University of Colorado A line was added to the
service change proposal in an attempt to offer better on time

Directors Archuleta, Deadwyler, Folska, Sisk, and Solano were absent.

performance. Also, the R line was included to reduce some of
the running times due to excessive running times. He noted
that staff also reviewed the 105 and a bus had to be added to
that schedule. He commented that the 131, which is
currently operating on detour was included in order to make
that detour route a permanent change. The AT change has
been deferred until staff can complete further analysis, and the
55S was merged with the 55L.

Mr. Carter noted that the highlighted sections indicated
substantial changes from the preliminary proposal.
Director Francone inquired about the Lockheed Martin Call-nRide and asked if staff had performance numbers for that
service.
Mr. Abel stated that the numbers were included in the
quarterly report.
Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services, commented
that last month, the Call-n-Ride carried 97 people. He noted
that the service is only averaging two passengers per trip, and
previously the average was four per trip.
Director Francone noted that the TrailMark development on
Wadsworth south of Chatfield has almost 1,500 homes and is
marked as being within the City of Littleton, which appears to
be in RTD’s service district. She noted that the Call-n-Ride
goes by there, and that development might improve ridership
in that area.
Chair Hoy asked how the schedule for the University of
Colorado A Line can be adjusted if it leaves every 15 minutes.
Mr. Abel remarked that staff is reviewing redistributing the
time at the check points. He noted that every station is
considered a check point. The end-to-end running time is not
recommended to change, but the time at the individual
stations will be reallocated to improve connections at the
various stations and on-time performance.

Mr. Abel reminded the Board that the R Line numbers are

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

• Approve Contract Amendment for the Supply of 15 - 40' Transit Buses
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to exercise the contract option and amend contract 13-FH-053 with Gillig
LLC. for the purchase of 15 additional 40’ transit buses and associated
spare components in an amount not to exceed $6,598,000.
Motion:

Director Tisdale made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the March 28, 2017
Board Meeting.
Director Broom seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Mr. Abel stated that this is a housekeeping item and the
vehicle replacement plan is included in the Strategic Budget
Plan (SBP). He noted that staff typically has a multi-year
option when purchasing vehicles so that RTD can have
vehicles of similar manufacturer for spare parts and inventory
management purposes. He commented that this is part of a
procurement that was entered into with Gillig, LLC, in 2013 to
replace the Orion transit buses. The 2017 budget includes
funds for the acquisition of 15 transit buses, and this will

Mr. Carter stated that staff had preliminary numbers from the
first two weeks of operation but it was still too early to
provide final opening numbers. He commented that ridership
is currently in the 4200 per day range. In comparison, he said
the W line had 12,000 passengers per day when it opened and
currently runs at 14,000 per day.

C. Updates
Mr. Abel stated that there are a variety of detailed quarterly reports that were included in
the packet. He commented that he would be happy to provide answers to any questions
that the Board may have.
Mr. Abel noted that there were no questions, and moved to the Lost Service Review
update to give a brief update to the Board.

• Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 4th Quarter 2016
• Access-a-Ride/Cab 4th Quarter Update
• Special Services Report 4th Qtr 2016
• 2016 4th Quarter Drug & Alcohol Compliance Monitoring
• 2016 4th Quarter Customer Complaint Analysis
• Lost Service Hours Review 3 21 17
Mr. Abel stated that the lost service hours for February totaled 297 hours, in
comparison to 972 lost hours in February 2016. He noted that a snowstorm
last February had severely impacted service. He stated that trends are
moving in the right direction, but RTD is still having to mandate operators.
He remarked that, from a customer experience perspective, there has been
improvement from last year.

Director Menten thanked staff on behalf of the riders of the 20 and 38. She
said that she sees the report every morning and knows that staff is working
hard.
Director Francone commented that last week the Board attended the APTA
Conference in Washington, D.C., and two inches of snow resulted in
Washington Metro Area Transit Authority (WMATA) providing weekend
service.

Director Lubow reported on a public forum in Longmont that she attended last
week. She commented that people in Longmont are mad; they do not want
additional buses or Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), they want rail and they want it before
2040. She commented that she would be renewing her efforts for rail and asked
the Board to accept a resolution in the future that would use base funds, seek
outside funds, or utilize any other available funding source to complete the
unfunded corridors. She added that she will be examining RTD expenditures to see
where money is being spent, as that money could potentially be used for the
completion of FasTracks. She stated that people in Longmont are angry and they
want to see improvement.

General Manager Genova and Barbara McManus both responded that a Director’s
abstention on an otherwise unanimously approved item in a committee meeting did
not warrant that item’s removal from the consent agenda.
Director Menten commented that the procedural difference between committee
meetings and Board meeting is strange.

Barbara McManus said Folska, Francone, and Menten voted no.
General Manager Genova explained that the recommended action was for a
contract amendment regarding State Highway 119 bus rapid transit (BRT)
environmental clearance.
Director Menten asked what would happen if the environmental impact statement
(EIS) required changes.
General Manager Genova said that RTD would be able to address those findings
and amend the route accordingly because the route was not a part of voterapproved changes under FasTracks.
Ms. McManus noted that Director Williams had voted no on the router contract.
General Manager Genova said that he spoke with Director Williams, who explained
that she had voted no because the wi-fi routers were not available for public use.
Motion:

Director Francone made the motion to approve moving
the March 28, 2017 Board agenda to the full Board.
Director Walker seconded the motion.

The motion passed with 5 in favor (Hoy, Francone,

Other Matters
Chair Hoy spoke about Accelerate Colorado (AC). He said that AC is a subset of the
Aurora Economic Development Corporation. He said that Directors attended the AC
annual conference in Washington, D.C., in years past. He said that at least one of
attendees was required to be a member of AC and that former Chair Tobiassen

expensed the annual $5,000 membership, which cost included the trip to
Washington.
Ms. McManus said that Director Broom is asking for RTD to purchase an annual AC
membership at a cost of $1,500. She said that Director Broom would pay for the
cost of membership if the Board does not approve the request.

Ms. McManus said the annual membership cost for RTD is $1,500.
Chair Hoy asked whether the Directors electing to travel to Washington, D.C.,
would be able to book travel at a reduced rate, and Ms. McManus confirmed that
they would.
Chair Hoy clarified that the question was whether RTD should purchase an AC
membership for the purpose of reduced travel rates.
Ms. McManus said yes but noted that the terms of the membership could change.
She also stated that AC has reached out to the Directors to offer them seats on
their issue committees.
Chair Hoy asked whether RTD is a member of the Aurora Economic Development
Commission, and Ms. McManus responded that RTD does not currently have
membership.
Director Francone asked whether RTD is a member of the Jefferson County
Economic Development Corporation, and Ms. McManus confirmed that RTD is a
member and stated that she has a list of other RTD memberships.
Director Deadwyler said that Directors are asked each year which organizations
RTD should join and asked whether AC had ever been mentioned.
Ms. McManus confirmed that AC was not included in the list of organizations
because RTD gained membership by way of former Chair Tobiassen.
Director Tisdale stated that RTD is a member of the South Metro Chamber of
Commerce.

Chair Hoy asked for clarification on whether the membership cost is $5,000 or

6.F

Director Anderson said that she had not known previously which organization AC
belonged to. She said she would like to see how much RTD pays toward the
various economic development organizations.
Ms. McManus said that the Communications Department is working on that list.

Director Menten said that she would be a no vote if the item were a recommended
action.
Chair Hoy stated that RTD sold the parcel of real estate adjacent to the 1600 Blake
Street facility to the City and County of Denver in order to refinance Union Station.
He said that the sale agreement permitted RTD the use of the area as long as
Market Street Station was in use. Following the opening of Union Station and the
subsequent closure of Market Street Station, the City and County of Denver sold
the land, which would eventually become a large development. He said that RTD
would lose its surface parking lot during the 1-2 years of construction and that the
developer agreed to provide replacement parking during that time.
Ms. McManus said that the facilities management team was looking at options for
parking in the surrounding area, including lots at the Tabor Center and behind Union
Station near the Ice House building. She said construction would commence July
2017 and run 2-2.5 years for full construction. She said she wanted to inform the
Directors early so they could begin to consider how to commute to Board meetings
and stated she would relay more information as it became available.
General Manager Genova said that RTD’s parking structure would be underground
once the construction is completed and that the sale agreement specified that RTD
would be kept whole with respect to parking.
Director Francone asked what is being constructed.
General Manager Genova said a large building was being constructed all around the
1600 Blake Street facility.
Director Anderson said that the Directors could commute via bus or a train but
noted that committees may adjourn after the end of service of certain bus routes.
She said that the Board would need to recognize people’s use of buses and the
consequent schedule limitations, and Chair Hoy agreed. She further stated that the

Packet Pg. 56

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Chair Hoy said that the issue would be revisited at a later date once the costs were
known.

6.F

Board should look at how it could become more efficient in running committee
meetings.
Director Deadwyler said that she remembered hearing from the previous General
Manager that Directors could meet at a certain location and then be bused in.

Director Francone said that Directors are elected officials and are obligated to both
attend Board meetings and arrange transportation to and from those meetings.
Ms. McManus stated that Sheri Le, Cyber Security Manager, had been hired by
RTD to create agency policies to upgrade and secure RTD’s network. She noted
payment card industry (PCI) compliance for SmartCard as a component of agency
security. She said that by the end of March 2017 all employees using RTD
computer equipment would have taken cyber security training, though it was
decided that Directors would not be included in the first round of training. She said
that Directors would be assisted by Board Office staff in their security training and
that Directors would be able to train either at the office or at home. She said the
training would hopefully launch on April 1, 2017, and run through the end of the
month, though any Directors unable to complete training in that time would be
offered a workshop in late April or early May to go over the training materials. She
said the training is straightforward, taking less than an hour to complete, and would
bolster security awareness both in the office environment and on personal devices.
Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance
and Administration said she encourages everyone to take cyber security training.
She noted that RTD has been targeted for phishing schemes.
Director Francone asked whether the Directors’ training is different from the
training employees received, and Ms. McManus confirmed that the trainings are the
same. Director Francone said that she appreciates the training but wondered if the
staff was having to do extra work to accommodate the Directors.
Ms. McManus said the Directors’ training was planned to be separate from the start
in order to allow the staff to work out any bugs encountered. She also said that,
because the training can be done in segments, the concern was that staff would
have to monitor the progress of Directors who did not complete the training in one
session.

General Manager Genova said he had not heard that proposal but said that he could
look into it.

6.F

Chair Hoy asked for confirmation that the program had been in place for some time.
General Manager Genova said yes, though the amount of fare media available to
the program was increased in 2016 and some of the reporting and administrative
processes have been streamlined. He said RTD’s sale price of 50% off of the face
value of the media has been standardized across all participants and noted that
participants can resell the tickets at any price to qualified recipients.
Ms. McKillop said that the face value of fare media sold under the program was
increased to $6.8 million, which is a $3.4 million cost to RTD. She said that,
following the change in the program in 2016, new participants were monitored so
that they would not suddenly overwhelm the program with demand for new tickets.
She said the program was performing normally through November but experienced
a drastic increase in December, when participants unexpectedly purchased
$750,000 in fare media. She said that 20 new companies requested to participate
in the program in January. She noted that one company that had previously
purchased 3,000 reduced-fare tickets in a month suddenly purchased 25,000 in
February and March. She said demand from other existing companies surged as
well, necessitating an emergency meeting in her department. She said that the
concern was raised that the current level of demand would not only exceed last
year’s supply of media but also that the program may not be able to be funded
through the end of the year without additional appropriations authorized by the
Board. She said that 35 qualified participants have been added to the program since
mid-2016 and that new applicants to the program on or after April 1, 2017, would
be put on a waiting list. She stated that RTD has not advertised the program and
that its existence has spread only through Board meetings and word of mouth.
Director Menten asked what kind of means testing companies would have to
perform to be eligible to purchase media under the program.

Packet Pg. 58

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that, at the previous day’s Senior Leadership Team
(SLT) meeting, Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, and
Ms. McKillop reported on the reduced-fare media program. Ms. McKillop said that in
2016 the program saw a large increase in the amount of reduced-price fare media
sold. She said the good news is the program has become highly utilized, but this
increase has also become an unforeseen issue. She reported that the sales have
continued to increase rapidly in 2017 and that temporary measures must be put in
place to sustain the program, followed by an eventual decision from the Board
regarding the long-term policy direction for the program.

6.F

Ms. McKillop said that companies must disclose their distribution criteria and
testing methods before they can be added to the program. She said the
organizations are audited to ensure they regularly apply those means-testing
criteria.

General Manager Genova said that RTD performs random audits on the participating
organizations to ensure compliance with RTD’s standards. He said that the
recipients of the reduced-price media, rather than the participating companies
themselves, may be the ones selling the media inappropriately.
Director Deadwyler asked whether the tickets are numbered.
General Manager Genova said that some media products are and some are not and
said that he would report back to the Board.
Director Deadwyler said that she likes that more nonprofits are joining the program
but was not sure why RTD needed to put forth so much money to fund the plan.
General Manager Genova said that all funding for RTD’s charitable programs comes
from within RTD. He said that one reason the program has become so popular is
that it was made known to nonprofit organizations during the analysis leading to
the 2016 fare structure change.
Ms. McKillop said that RTD did not cap the amount of media sold to new
participants in the program because those organizations had not yet established a
historical pattern of purchasing. She said that most of the new organizations are
small but purchased unexpectedly large blocks of media.
General Manager Genova said that some of the new organizations are school
districts that are making large purchases. He said he was reporting on the issue to
inform the Executive Committee that a wait list would be implemented and that the
Board would be asked to decide whether to add more funding to the program.
Ms. McKillop stated that existing participants would be held to the level of
purchasing made in the same month of the previous year. She said participants
would be upset by this action but stated that RTD staff has not determined any
other way to control the program in order to avoid depleting available funds before

Director Deadwyler said that in the past nonprofits were found selling tickets to
ineligible individuals and asked how that issue was being addressed.

the end of the year. She said that social services organizations were among the
first participants.

Director Deadwyler agreed to proceed with the temporary measures and stated that
she would like to see more accountability if the program is to be expanded.
Ms. McKillop noted that most of the media being sold inappropriately on the
internet are forgeries.
Director Deadwyler noted that RTD operators honored those media.
Ms. McKillop said that operators have a hard time discerning forged media as they
glance quickly when passengers board. She noted that new security features are
added to fare media each year.
Director Menten said schools receive large numbers of discounted media.
Mr. Reed said that schools receive a 50% discount on fares and that they employ
their own means-testing procedures. She said that schools may offer a further 50%
discount upon resale, which has driven the drastic increase in media purchasing, as
schools have made larger purchases than they had originally indicated they would.
Chair Hoy noted that recipients of twice-reduced media would pay $.65 for a oneway ticket with a face value of $2.60, and Mr. Reed confirmed.
Ms. McKillop stated that recipients tend to be in the free lunch program.
Chair Hoy asked whether RTD sells day passes under the program as well, which
General Manager Genova confirmed. Chair Hoy further noted that a student could
ride transit all day for $1.25.
Director Francone asked whether additional sales to current program participants
would be halted.
Ms. McKillop responded that organizations would not be able to purchase more
media than they bought in the same month last year.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

General Manager Genova said that the temporary measures would be put into place
barring objection from the Executive Committee and that the Board would be
briefed on the status of the program the following month, with a recommended
action following in next month.

6.F

Mr. Reed stated that new participants would be held to their recent purchasing
levels until further notice.
Chair Hoy noted that the program experienced a large increase in sales in
December, which meant that new participants would still be able to purchase a
high volume of media.

Director Menten asked whether a strong message would be sent to program
participants, and Mr. Reed said yes.
Chair Hoy mentioned the monthly check register that appeared in the packet for the
previous Financial Administration & Audit Committee meeting. He said Director
Menten asked that the check register be included for the sake of transparency. He
stated that he had reservations about the inclusion of the check register in the
packet because it is already a publically available document and because it is a
lengthy addition to the packet.
Director Menten said the check register is available online, along with the agency’s
purchase orders, but stated that only the most recent month’s transactions are
listed. She said that the check register is not archived online and that including it in
the Board packet does archive that information. She said she would prefer to see a
searchable database online and that inserting the register in the packet is a good
compromise. She said making such documents public spurs more competition by
vendors.
Chair Hoy stated that adding more information in the packet may actually dissuade
people from reading it and that a compromise might be to archive the check register
online for a set time.
Director Deadwyler said she is concerned that small businesses that bid to supply
goods or services may be discouraged by the fact that their competitors were
selected instead.
Chair Hoy stated that a small business might also see the list of goods and services
purchased by RTD and then attempt to become a vendor.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Ms. McKillop said that a reasonable methodology would have to be devised.

6.F

Director Anderson said that the Directors should only receive actionable materials in
the packets and that the Board should not be involved with which vendors are
selected. She said the General Manager and RTD’s employees are hired to take care
of procurement. She said the information in the check register is publicly available
and said she was not concerned by any of the items listed in the register. She
stated that vendors can find the check register if they are interested in bidding. She
said she finds publishing the check register to be demeaning for the Board.
Director Walker said that he was curious about the inclusion of the check register
when he read his packet and asked how much server space and staff time is
required to publish it online.
Ms. McKillop said that the check register is one of a number of documents posted
on the website at the end of each month and that publishing those documents does
not take much staff time. She said she would be open to looking at publishing a
year’s worth of archived check registers online.
Director Francone said that archiving the check register online would forgo the need
to include it in the packet. She said that people may want access to that
information and should not have to submit an open records request to receive it.
Director Menten stated that the electronic file for the month’s check register was
600kb in size.
Director Walker noted that requests for proposals (RFPs) are submitted for nearly
everything purchased for RTD. He stated he was concerned about the staff’s time
and that including the check register gave the impression that the Directors were
not acting as a Board. He said it would have been nice to discuss the matter prior
to including the check register in the packet.
Director Menten noted that state statute requires certain jurisdictions to publish an
account of their “warrants” in a newspaper. She said that RTD has made progress
toward transparency even by publishing a single month’s check register.
Chair Hoy said that his plan was to meet with Director Menten and Ms. McKillop
and work out a compromise.

Packet Pg. 62

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Menten said that Brian Iacono, Senior Manager of Materials Management,
was at first concerned with publishing the check register but has since changed his
mind now after seeing an influx of new contractors bidding for jobs.

6.F

Director Deadwyler said that she would have been a no vote if the item were voted
on in Executive Committee.

Director Deadwyler said she would like to find out what the other Directors are
thinking.
Director Menten asked whether the retreat would require a facilitator.
Director Francone said that having a facilitator would be helpful to direct the
questions and move things along.
Director Menten said that she is not in favor of icebreaker exercises and that she
did not see a need for a facilitator.
Director Deadwyler said that she wanted someone other than Gary Suiter if a
facilitator is hired.
Chair Hoy asked whether her concern was that using the same facilitator for both
the Board retreat and joint retreat could lead to conflicts, and Director Deadwyler
said that was one of her concerns, along with the fact that she was disappointed
with Mr. Suiter because she felt he did not properly summarize the responses of the
Board
Ms. McManus noted that the RFP process limits the Board’s choice of vendors.
Director Walker asked whether it would be feasible to have a Board retreat not
open to the public, and Chair Hoy said no. Director Walker said he did not see the
benefit of a Board-only retreat. He said the Directors talk to one another during
committees and study sessions.
Director Francone said that a study session would be a suitable vehicle for
discussion.

Packet Pg. 63

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Mar 23, 2017 12:00 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Francone mentioned that the concept of a Board-only retreat was
mentioned at the recent strategic planning session and said that she found that to
be a good idea. She said Board members seldom see each other or have opportunity
to discuss matters outside of Board meeting. She stated the Board probably has a
lot of items to discuss and questioned whether a Board-only retreat would be
possible under the current year’s budget.

6.F

Ms. McManus said that an agenda would be necessary and that the Board has
conducted its own workshops and retreats in the past, including a PEST workshop
and a training session on protocol and etiquette, meeting management, and
streamlining.
Chair Hoy noted that the PEST workshop was very expensive.

Director Menten asked when the next available study session would be.
Ms. McManus said that the next open session is August 2017.
Director Menten said that the meeting should be two hours long and open to the
public and that the retreat’s main topic should be future progress.
Ms. McManus said that each of the 15 Directors may have their own idea for
agenda topics. She said that Director Lubow is an advocate for a Board-only
retreat. She said she would discuss with Chair Hoy how to proceed.
Chair Hoy suggested the retreat could be held on a Saturday.
General Manager Genova said that the transportation funding bill passed through
the House Transportation Committee with 15 amendments and that the bill has
been referred to the House Finance Committee. He said that one amendment to the
bill proposed funding transportation options and reduced fare programs that would
allow a basic level of service to low-income individuals. He noted that the Board
may want to take a position on the bill as other jurisdictions have and said he
would keep Board apprised of changes as it proceeds through the legislative
process.
Chair Hoy said that the Board would be monitoring the bill and that any position
statement would depend on how the bill changes as it progresses.
General Manager Genova said that Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs is also
monitoring the bill.
Chair Hoy commented that the Board had been discourteous to members of the
audience during the last committee meeting.

Director Walker said that the Board could have a retreat easily if the intent is for the

Director Menten asked whether the discussion had been taken too far.
Chair Hoy said he did not know how else the meeting could have been run.

Retiree Awards
Chair Hoy noted there were three retirees this month with two in attendance. Gina
Callahan, Deputy Assistant General Manager, of Bus Operations, introduced Steve Gieske,
Assistant General Superintendent, to recognize the retirees.
Mr. Gieske introduced David Ayala, who worked in the Maintenance Division servicing and
cleaning busses for 24 years. He stated that he had the privilege of working with Mr.
Ayala for as long as he has been at RTD. Ms. Callahan added the importance of keeping
our buses clean and appreciated Mr. Ayala’s dedication to his job. Lastly, Mr. Gieske
expressed Mr. Ayala’s desire to always be busy and help others when needed. They both
wished him best of luck in his retirement.
Steve Gieske also introduced Marshall Weeden, Senior Quality Control Inspector, and
congratulated him on 32 years of service. He stated that Mr. Weeden spent a lot of time
away from RTD because he was always visiting manufacturers to make sure RTD received
quality parts; with that he thanked his wife of 38 years for allowing him to be gone so
much.
Mr. Gieske said that Mr. Weeden will ski a lot now that he is retired and will
continue his passion of crafting micro-brews. He wished him well in his future endeavors.
Chair Hoy acknowledged Doug Stanton’s 33 years of service as a Manager.

Public Participation
Chair Hoy stated that public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, informed the Board that he took advantage of the free
ride on the R Line and thought that the train was very slow in travel. He
expressed his heartfelt sympathy for fallen Officer Scott Von Lanken. He

revealed to the Board that he had gotten close with Officer Von Lanken
when he was transferred to Boulder and he admired his great customer
service skills and his ability to talk to everyone. He stated that Officer Von
Lanken will be greatly missed.
Véronique Bellamy, Longmont, stated that she was the Director of Research
and Development at Elysium Studios. She remarked that the studio is
having difficulty attracting new scientists to the labs in Colorado due to the
new presidential administration and added that her efforts are not helped
when there are people who dilute linguistic abilities to serve people. She
accused RTD staff of treating the local Francophone population poorly and
remarked that English is a difficult language to learn.
Patty Munoz, Denver, introduced herself as a tenth grade student at the
Denver School of Science and Technology (DSST), Cole High School, a
Denver Public School (DPS). She stated that she believes that RTD should
provide bus passes to students because the youth today are the leaders of
tomorrow. She voiced her concern that some students have to make a
decision on whether or not they will eat or have transportation. She added
that a bus pass is not just necessary for transportation to and from school,
but it is also helpful to get to the library to do homework.
Rogelio Munoz, Denver, stated that he also attends DSST Cole High School
and he was representing Together Colorado. He indicated to the Board that
their committee currently has 1500 signatures to support RTD providing bus
passes to students. He stated that he has been taking the bus since he was
a small child. He spoke of taking the bus his entire life; from going to the
hospital when he was five with a tumor, to more recent trips to his
internship. He stated that he is committed to this this project because the
recent increase of $0.20 adds up and can be an economic hardship to some
families. He explained that he and his friends did not grow up with a lot of
money, and receiving a free bus pass would alleviate some of the financial
burden from families. He asked the Board to consider working with DPS and
the City and County of Denver to provide Eco Passes to high school
students for the school year. Mr. Munoz did not provide a copy of the
petition.
Hadyn Roberts, Denver, DSST Cole High School explained the importance of
the bus to all economic levels and backgrounds. He referenced a Fox 31
report by Kevin Torres, which stated that, according to RTD sources, an
increase to our bus and rail fares is necessary to keep up with inflation and
rail expansion projects. He agreed that the increase made sense but
highlighted RTD’s mission statement, to provide safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible and cost-effective service. He emphasized to the
Board that bus fares are not cost effective to students. He stated that a

student’s bus fare increased by $0.20 and with approximately 180 school
days a year times two trips a day, a student is paying out of pocket
approximately $2.60 day or $468 a year, whereas an Eco Pass is $600 a
year. He explained that in order for a person to break even using the Eco
Pass, the person would have to ride the bus 102 times. He asked the Board
if they would commit to working with DPS and the City of Denver to expand
transportation options for students.
Camille DeValle, Denver, stated that he was speaking on behalf of Together
Colorado on an issue that is very important to himself and his classmates.
He explained how important transportation is to all of them and that most of
them use the bus every day, as it is a necessity. He asked the Board to
consider working with DPS and the City and County of Denver to give
students Eco Passes to expand the of transportation services. Lastly,
remarked that a child should not have to choose whether to save money for
transportation or to use that money to eat.

Director Menten asked if General Manager Genova’s meeting with DPS included the school
that presented public comments at that night’s Board meeting.
General Manager Genova said that he was not familiar with Together Colorado but he
stated that he has met with a variety of organizations regarding the topic. He mentioned
that RTD is being asked to consider a pilot Eco Pass program for 10,000 DPS high school
students. He commented that he has met with DPS and several divisions within the City
and County of Denver, such as the Division of Child Affairs. He mentioned that Michael
Washington, Manager of Transit Equity, will be attending a working group with all the
entities involved in the project. He explained that Eco Passes are typically agreements
made with an employer for their employees, so the pilot program would be outside the Eco
Pass policy. He also stressed the cost and revenue impacts to RTD. He stated that an
analysis must be completed to see how this will impact RTD’s fare revenue. He explained
that the agreement needs to be fiscally sustainable for the entire district and what RTD
does for one stakeholder; it has to do for all.
Director Broom offered thanks to all the RTD employees that worked the opening day
event for the R Line.
Director Solano recapped an email that the Board received from Matt Samelson from the
Darnell K. Foundation. He stated that the letter discussed a mill levy, which was voted on
last November for a similar bus program for kids.
General Manager Genova said that the mill levy did pass; although, he was not sure the
exact dollar amount it entailed. He also mentioned that DPS currently purchases a lot of
passes from RTD though the 50% discount program.

XI.

Unanimous Consent
Chair Hoy suggested that if there were any questions or need for discussion of an item a
Director should request it be removed from the unanimous consent agenda. Seeing no
discussion, he asked for a motion to approve items A and B.

Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to approve items
A and B on the unanimous consent agenda.

New Business
Director Francone asked for Chair Hoy to provide a brief overview of the format and
expectations of Saturday’s Board and Staff retreat for the new Board members.
Chair Hoy advised Board and staff that this is an annual retreat and only 2018 items will
be discussed. He stated that the purpose of the meeting is to defined three goals for
2018.
Director Sisk suggested his fellow Board members meet annually with their district’s
Citizen’s Advisory Council (CAC). He then recommended that the Board gather their
comments and create a compilation of their concerns. He stressed that it is the Board’s
responsibility to meet with the CAC and any Board member that does not is doing a
disservice to their district.
Chair Hoy agreed with Director Sisk. He stated that he is working on an aggregation of
those luncheons and he reminded the Board that it is their obligation to represent the
district well.
Director Menten stated that she does not think the CAC is effective. She asked staff how
many times CAC members have attended an RTD Board meeting.
Chair Hoy said that, when he was the Committee Chair of FasTracks, they were very
active. He stated that in the future Director Lubow would be providing quarterly reports to
make sure that they are effective. Chair Hoy mentioned that Karen Stewart attends often
and said that depending on the topic in question that some CAC members attend.
Director Menten mentioned that there was a good discussion regarding the retreat during
the Executive Committee regarding changes in the processes. She then asked if the Board
wanted to makes changes and what is the best way to discuss those changes.
Chair Hoy stated that if there are changes in the process, they will be discussed for next
year. He followed up by saying everything for this year is already in place and will move
forward as usual.

General Manager Genova confirmed that an update would be provided at the next set of
committee meetings.

Director Anderson stated that she attended her neighborhood service change meeting and
discussed the 55S, the special route that the Board recently approved. She shared that
her constituents are not happy that the G Line is still not open and stressed that RTD’s
public relations and communication with that community have not been good. She stated
that information regarding the G Line should be relayed to neighborhood newspaper outlets
to communicate any changes or updates.
Chair Hoy affirmed that Arvada City officials have been very gracious and understanding.
Director Tisdale stated that he went to a CAC meeting and was introduced to some very
engaging people. He believes that they can provide useful information to the Board. He
also shared that he had a conversation with one of RTD’s fare enforcement officer
regarding Officer Scott Von Lanken. The fare enforcement officer suggested the
placement of a memorial plaque somewhere at Union Station in honor of Officer Scott Von
Lanken. Director Tisdale stated that he had promised the fare enforcement officer he
would share the idea with the Board for consideration.
Director Lubow agreed with Director Tisdale and said she was in support the idea of a
plaque. She then stated that she is looking forward to the Board Retreat. She said she
believes that RTD is going through a transition with the completion of FasTracks, the Eagle
P3 project, the W Line, and the R Line. She commented that she believes RTD is moving
into a transition period with Mobility Choice and analyzing how to deal with new
technology. She stressed that it is very important for the Board to assume its
responsibility to make informed decisions on policy. She suggested that there be a
discussion at the retreat about voting and the process of voting for policy goals.
Director Menten handed out a memo with ideas and some proposed goals for future
review. She indicated that she had conversations with many people regarding the memo

Budget Transfer for Increased Access-a-Ride
Contract Costs

CFO/AGM,

&

GM
Board Meeting Date: March 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Access-a-Ride contracts for
MV Transportation (Contract 13-DH-053 in the amount of $1,700,000) and Via Mobility Services
(Contract 13-DH-055 in the amount of $810,000) to cover the additional costs associated with
increased driver wages. The total dollar amount of the budget transfer is $2,510,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with four (4) service providers, All Aboard Transit, MV Transportation, Via
Mobility Services, and Transdev-On-Demand, to provide Access-a-Ride paratransit services under four
(4) service contracts. Three of the service providers (All Aboard Transit, MV Transportation, and Via
Mobility Services) use RTD-owned vehicles to provide the service. The fourth provider (Transdev-OnDemand) uses Transdev-owned vehicles (taxi cabs) to provide the service. As the Board of Directors
is aware, the Access-a-Ride contracts were rebid in 2016 so that service providers could make
adjustments to their driver wage scales to address the challenges they were all experiencing with
hiring and retaining drivers.
DISCUSSION:
Throughout the term of the current Access-a-Ride contracts, the three dedicated-vehicle service
providers (All Aboard Transit, MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services) have experienced hiring
and retention difficulties for vehicle operators. The robust Colorado economy, the legalization of
medical and recreational marijuana, and the historically low wages paid to paratransit vehicle
operators severely impacted the ability of the Access-a-Ride service providers to hire and retain
drivers. This, in turn, had a negative impact on the quality of the Access-a-Ride service because of
the high number of un-manned or “open” runs each day. The bids received for the new Access-aRide contracts all proposed a starting wage of $15.00 per hour for new drivers. The driver wage
scales were also proposed to be adjusted for existing drivers. In order to fund the costs associated
with the increased driver wages in 2017, it is necessary to transfer additional dollars into the
Access-a-Ride budget.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
When preparing the 2017 budget for Access-a-Ride services, an assumption was made regarding the
pending re-bid of the existing contracts and the potential increase in contract costs associated with
increased driver wages. The estimated increase was less than the actual market-survey-based
increase proposed by the bidders. Consequently, additional funding is needed for 2017. The funds
needed to address the Access-a-Ride contract increases will be taken from Board Appropriated
Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES:

Packet Pg. 79

11.A

1. Approve the recommended action item so that funds will be available to pay the increased
contract costs associated with improved driver wages for All Aboard Transit, MV Transportation,
and Via Mobility Service through the end of 2017.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will not allow
All Aboard Transit, MV Transportation, and Via Mobility Services to increase driver wages and
improve their hiring and retention capabilities.

Increased

Call-n-Ride

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance, Administration, and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer from the Board Appropriated Reserve to the Call-n-Ride contracts to
cover the additional costs associated with increased driver wages. The total dollar amount of the
budget transfer is $176,000.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two (2) service providers, MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services,
to provide Call-n-Ride general public demand-response transit services under two (2) service
contracts (MV contract #13-DH-053 and Via contract #13-DH-055). The Call-n-Ride service was
included as amendments to the Access-a-Ride contracts for these two providers. As the Board of
Directors is aware, the Access-a-Ride contracts were rebid in 2016 so that service providers could
make adjustments to their driver wage scales to address the challenges they were all experiencing
with hiring and retaining drivers. Accordingly, the Call-n-Ride service contracts associated with the
Access-a-Ride contracts were also rebid.
DISCUSSION:
As discussed previously with regard to the Access-a-Ride contracts, the Call-n-Ride service providers
(MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services) have experienced hiring and retention difficulties for
vehicle operators. The robust Colorado economy, the legalization of medical and recreational
marijuana, and the historically low wages paid to paratransit vehicle operators severely impacted the
ability of the Call-n-Ride service providers to hire and retain drivers. This, in turn, had a negative
impact on the quality of the Call-n-Ride service and resulted in days when the level of Call-n-Ride
service had to be reduced due to a lack of available operators. The bids received for the new
Access-a-Ride/Call-n-Ride contracts all proposed a starting wage of $15.00 per hour for new drivers.
The driver wage scales were also proposed to be adjusted for existing drivers. In order to fund the
costs associated with the increased driver wages in 2017, it is necessary to transfer additional
dollars into the Call-n-Ride budget.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
When preparing the 2017 budget for Call-n-Ride services, an assumption was made regarding the
pending re-bid of the existing contracts and the potential increase in contract costs associated with
increased driver wages. The estimated increase was less than the actual market-survey-based
increase proposed by the bidders. Consequently, additional funding is needed for 2017. The total
dollar amount of the budget transfer is $176,000.00. The funds needed to address the Call-n-Ride
contract increases will be taken from the Board Appropriated Reserve.
ALTERNATIVES:

contract costs associated with improved driver wages for MV Transportation and Via Mobility
Service through the end of 2017.
2)

Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will not allow
MV Transportation and Via Mobility Services to increase driver wages and improve their hiring and

Proposed May 2017 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost of approximately $221,300 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his
designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted
by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
improvements, adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance a
number of services will have minor service reductions. The Route 40-Colorado Boulevard will see the
largest reduction during the peak period. The 41st-Fox and Pecos Junction Stations are proposed to open
to provide access to the B-Line and consequentially, Routes 8 and 19 are proposed to be realigned to
serve the new stations. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service
changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change
recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were conducted in Arvada, Denver (3) and Westminster between February 14th and
February 27th. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are
summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

Packet Pg. 83

11.C

outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
A Line: schedule adjustment to improve on-time performance and transit connections
R Line: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance and reduce service delay
Route 105 - Havana Crosstown: schedule adjustments requiring additional resources to be added to the
evening peak schedule
Route 131- Iliff: extends current detour to 9 Mile Station to become regular route
Route AT – Arapahoe County/DIA: Schedule adjustments are proposed to improve service reliability.
Deferred to August.

trips.

Routes proposed for service reductions:
Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: reduce peak frequency from 10 to 15 minutes
Route 55S – Olde Town/DUS: recommend pm peak schedule adjustments to combine with 55L.
Consolidate with and rename as 55L.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: discontinue the 3:07am northbound operating from Peoria/Albrook and
12:45am southbound trip operating from 40th & Airport
Route 153 – Chambers Road: discontinue 3:35am northbound trip from Sable/Colfax
Route 157 – CCA/Buckley AFB: discontinue service after 7:00pm due to low ridership
BroncosRide: (contingent on the G-Line opening) prior to the start of Broncos season, service to the
OldeTown Arvada and Ward Road Park-n-Rides will be discontinued

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 21 - Evans Avenue: move the 7:15pm trip leaving Federal Center 6 minutes later

208/208F and Y.
Route L – Longmont/Denver: schedule adjustments due to interline changes with route BOLT/BOLT Ltd
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a net base system cost increase of
$221,300.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed May 2017 service changes does not
reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.
A Look Ahead – August 2017
L – Line
As previously discussed with the Board, a proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and
consequentially, overall light rail system performance, this concept introduces a modification to current
D Line operations. The L Line adds a new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement,
replacing the D Line service between 30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive
information regarding this proposal will be made available in a future update to the Board of Directors.

Atch A - May 2017 Service Change

Route 3 – Alameda Avenue
With this proposal the current eastbound trip terminating at Lincoln/Alameda at 5:38pm, would
be extended to Centrepoint & Sable, arriving at 6:48pm, which extends 30 minute eastbound
peak frequency on East Alameda through the PM peak period. Current 2:42pm westbound trip
from Lincoln/Alameda, will instead originate at Centrepoint & Sable Transfer Center at 1:49pm.,
which extends 30 minute westbound peak frequency one hour earlier in PM peak.
It is also proposed to re-route westbound trips to serve Alameda Station northbound on
Cherokee Street instead of southbound. Westbound trips will access Alameda Station via
Bannock St, Virginia Avenue and Cherokee Street before continuing on Alameda Avenue.
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. (Current OTP: 83%
Weekday/67% Saturday/79% Sunday). Cost impact is estimated to be $121,800 annualized.
Route 4 - Morrison Road
It is proposed to re-route Route 4 to serve Alameda Station northbound on Cherokee Street
instead of southbound. Trips will access Alameda Station via Bannock St, Virginia Avenue, and
Cherokee Street before continuing on Alameda Avenue. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
This proposal reroutes the Route 8 to serve the 41st/Fox Station, as has been previously
approved by the RTD Board of Directors in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan. Cost impact is
estimated to be $53,900 annualized.
Route 19 – North Pecos
This proposal reroutes Route 19 to serve the Pecos Junction Station, as has been previously
approved by the RTD Board of Directors in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan. Cost impacts
are estimated to be $16,800.
Route 21 - Evans Avenue
It is proposed to move the 7:15pm trip leaving Federal Center Station 6 minutes later to leave at
7:21pm to provide a better connection from the W Line. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 37 – Smith Road Industrial
This proposal reroutes the Route 37 alignment via 33rd Place between Sable and Chambers
Road, instead of Moncrieff Place. Due to ADA accessibility issues, there are currently no bus
stops located on Moncrieff, where 33rd Place offers opportunities for the addition of bus stops.
No cost impact anticipated.

Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd.
Schedule adjustments are proposed between 8:00am and 9:30am for sufficient operator
recovery and schedule reliability. Cost impacts are estimated to be $29,200 annualized.
Route 44 – 44th Avenue
Schedule adjustments are proposed due to new reroute near Clayton/43rd area, which were
initiated in January 2017. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 45 – Montbello via 51st/Green Valley Ranch
It is proposed to add PM peak bus for adequate recovery and on-time performance. Cost
impacts are estimated to be $78,000 annualized.
Route 55S – Olde Town Arvada/DUS
This service was implemented in December 2016, as an effort to provide access between the
Olde Town Arvada Park-n-Ride and the University of Colorado A Line. Current ridership
performance on this service continues to be weak relative to RTD Service Standards for fixedroute service. It is recommended that schedule adjustments be made to combine the PM peak
portions of the 55S and 55L services to improve efficiency. It is recommended that this
combined service be renamed the 55L. Approximate savings $59,000 annualized.
Route 73 – Quebec Street
It is proposed to add a PM Peak vehicle to provide adequate operator recovery and schedule
reliability. Cost impacts are estimated to be $78,000 annualized
Route 105 – Havana
This proposal extends northbound evening service 30 minutes later, until 12:20am from
Ulster/Tufts. Current last northbound trip averages 25 passengers. A running time analysis on
this route has shown a need for additional resources to be added to the PM peak period.
Additionally, it is proposed to discontinue 3:08am northbound trip, which carries 5 passengers at
7.6 boardings per hour. Passengers may use alternative trips 30 minutes earlier or later. Net
cost impact is estimated to be $60,000 annualized.
Route 121 – Peoria Street
The 3:07am northbound operating from Peoria/Albrook to 40th & Airport Station (2 passengers),
and 12:45am southbound trip operating from 40th & Airport to Peoria Station (2 passengers) are
proposed to be discontinued. Savings are estimated to be -$21,500 annualized.
Route 131- Iliff
Currently Route 131 is on detour that extends the route beyond Iliff station where it has
operated since it’s inception in 2006. This proposal would make permanent the current detour
routing extending Route 131 to 9Mile station. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 133 – Hampden/Tower

Packet Pg. 88

Attachment: Atch A May 2017 Service Change (3073 : Proposed May 2017 Service Changes)

Route 40 – Colorado Blvd.
This proposal reduces weekday peak service frequency from every 10 to every 15 minutes.
Peak passenger loads and productivity no longer require the higher frequency, passengers can
be comfortably accommodated with a 15 minute frequency. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be -$292,000 annualized.

11.C.a

This proposal would extend evening service one hour later until approximately 12:00 midnight in
each direction. Current last trips average 20 boardings each, or 35 boardings per hour. Cost
impacts are estimated to be $35,000 annualized.

Route 153 – Chambers Road
It is proposed to discontinue 3:35am northbound trip from Sable/Colfax to Peoria Station, which
current averages 2 passengers. Savings are anticipated to be -$10,000 annualized
Route 157 – CCA/Buckley AFB
Due to low ridership it is proposed that evening service after 7:00pm be discontinued. Total
ridership is 16 passengers over 11 trips, or 1.4 passengers per trip and 6.4 passengers per
hour. Savings are anticipated to be - $48,000 annualized.
Route 205/205T – 28th Street/ Gunbarrel/Heatherwood
Schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance. No cost impacts are
anticipated.
Applewood Village Interlines
Route 28 - 28th Avenue
Route 32 - 32nd Avenue
Route 38 - 38th Avenue
Route 44 - 44th Avenue
Minor weekday schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route AB – Boulder/DIA
It is proposed to add 2 AM peak and 2 PM peak trips to create a 30 minute frequency, as of
US36 & Table Mesa Station, in order to address current overloads and pass ups. These trips
are proposed to serve Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station, operate along Pearl Street,
28th Street, US36 to US36 & Table Mesa Station and then along the current AB route. The
introduction of the new Boulder Junction at Depot Square terminal would result in creating a
new pattern for the route and thus within the route would result in patterns AB1 (Downtown
Boulder Station) and AB2 (Boulder Junction at Depot Square Station) within current route AB.
This naming convention would mirror the naming convention of the current Flatiron Flyer
services (FF1, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF5 and FF6) to streamline the naming conventions for regional
routes with multiple patterns, within the Boulder area. Cost impacts are estimated to be
$247,400 annualized.
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont
This proposal Initiates previously Board approved BOLT Ltd trips via Boulder Junction at Depot
Square Station. No cost impacts are anticipated.

This proposal would add a 10:26pm eastbound trip from Nine Mile Station, which extends
evening service one hour later. Current last eastbound trip at 9:26pm averages 20 passengers

Recommendation is that BroncosRide service to the Olde Town Arvada and Ward Road Park-nRide be discontinued with the opening of the G Line. As with past rail openings, duplicate bus

Rail
A Line – DIA/DUS
A slight schedule adjustment to the westbound A Line service is proposed to improve on-time
performance. The westbound schedule is proposed to be shifted to leave Denver Airport 2
minutes earlier on all service days. No cost impacts are associated with this change.
B Line - Westminster/DUS
It is proposed to add stops at the 41st and Fox Station and the Pecos Junction Station to all trips. In
order to accommodate the additional stops, all trips will shift approximately 12 minutes earlier in the
northbound direction from Denver Union Station. Southbound trains would depart Westminster Station
at the same times and arrive Denver Union Station four minutes later than now. This change would
ensure that adequate layover time at both terminals is maintained and avoids conflicts at Pecos
Junction and on the single track segment.
It is proposed to add a later night northbound trip from DUS at 11:09 PM. This will provide a
better option for passengers attending evening events downtown. Cost impacts are contingent
upon a negotiated cost based on the Eagle P3 Concessionaire’s agreement.
R Line – Peoria/Lincoln
Schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance and reduce trip delays,
based on schedule observations post opening the new R Line service. No cost impacts are
anticipated with this proposal.

Comments heard included:
Carol Streamer, expressed concerns for the safety of customers on the R Line at the Metro
Center Station, who cross any of the busy streets (Alameda, Sable, Exposition) after
alighting the train. The participant suggested a shuttle be operated either by RTD or the
Mall to provide circulation from the station to points around the mall. The same participant
requested additional service on the Route 3L, citing overloads due to students using the
service to George Washington High School.
Charlotte Siska stated as a rider of the Route 40 service, one participant asked that RTD
carefully consider the trips during the peak period that are targeted for reduction. She
notices that many of the trips in the peak period are well patronized, while other trips are
not. She would prefer the service be maintained at 10 minute frequency.
A late comer to the meeting who attended last moths Board of Directors meeting again

this was creating a significant hardship for them and they no longer would be able to
access important services, such as the rehabilitation/pool, veteran services and library, as
well as church services. All members of the public were unaware that this had been
included in the G Line service plan and voiced strong concern that this had not been
publicized enough. The member of the public who was not willing to sign in actually got
verbally abusive and was very angry about the discontinuation of this leg of Route 31.
Staff stated that they would pass on these concerns and encouraged all present to contact
their Board member(s) in this regard, as well as handed out contact information so that
staff could be contacted specifically for other potential route connection options.

This meeting was attended by approximately 22 public participants. Director Lorraine
Anderson RTD Board member was also in attendance. RTD staff included Doug Monroe
Cooper Langdon and David Menter.
Doug Monroe briefly explained the purpose of the public hearing at the beginning of the
meeting. Among other issues, Mr. Monroe briefly outlined for the audience the current
operation of the Route 55s and that it is being proposed for elimination due to very low
ridership.
Karlyn Armstrong
Please keep the 55s route. It is not Arvada residents’ fault that productivity is low since it
is not fully being advertised. The low ridership is due to its lack of promotion by RTD.
Keeping it for 6 months, if needed, is worth it until the R-Line starts. Please also keep this
route even after the G-Line starts. I use the 55L to work in Capitol Hill. The 55s provides
good additional service for the 55L. This 55s is currently valuable as it is building ridership
in advance of the coming G-Line.
Charlotte Pustek
(These comments made by Karlyn Armstrong as she said Charlotte could not attend): 55s
serves a need from Arvada to Denver Airport. If ridership is low, this is only because the
route is not being promoted by RTD. RTD should use a smaller vehicle to save money.
RTD should keep the 55s after the G-Line opens.
Shelly Cook
I used to operate the old A-line bus shuttle from Arvada to Denver Airport. Please keep the
55s until the G-line opens. We used to have 60,000 rider boardings/year on the old A-Line
bus shuttle. RTD needs to advertise the 55s. Ridership has already increased on the 55s

since RTD started it. This gradual rider increase should be expected by RTD as that is
what happened on the old A-Line shuttle The 55s is building a rider market for the future
G-Line and is modelling for riders how to transfer at DUS to the current RTD A-Line rail
service.
Julia Morrison
RTD’s delay in starting the G-Line is aggravating. People feel angry and lied-to and abused
by RTD here in Arvada due to its delay. The community here has lost faith in RTD in the
delay of the G-Line and now you are also taking away the little that we have in eliminating
the 55s. The 55s should remain until the G-Line opens. RTD needs to advertise the 55s
since no one knows about it.
Lorrain Anderson (RTD Board Member) - Responding to Julia Morrison’s comment:
I helped put together and promote the 2004 RTD Fastracks ballot measure. The G-Line is
governed by the FRA, since it is classified as commuter rail, and the FRA is reviewing the
requirements about the current issue/problems with the crossing gates of the RTD A-line.
The FRA is holding up the start of the G-Line until the A-Line issues are resolved. The FRA
is requiring positive train control, a new technology which has some glitches. This delay in
the G-Line is for safety. RTD wants to make sure that its services are operated as safely
as possible for its riders and all members of the community that cross its tracks. The ALine and G-Line are being operated by DTO. (Question by Morrison): Are Arvada city
taxes being used on the A-Line now? (Answer ‘No’, these are RTD Fastracks taxes).
(Question by Morrison): Are A-Line gate crossing issues going to happen on the G-Line?
(Answer ‘No’ after the resolution of glitches is resolved the G-Line will open with the
resolution already in place). (Question by Morrison): Is there a chance DTO will fold?
(Answer ‘No’ highly unlikely and RTD is working closely with DTO and FRA and other
regulators to ensure safety).
Cooper Langdon (RTD staff) – also added information about a recent PBS NOVA television
program about the new Positive Train Control technology: “Why Trains Crash”.
Katie Arntsen
Keep the 55s. There has been no RTD advertising of this new route. Put up posters.
Also, the 55L trip @ 6:39a has not shown up 3 times in the last 2 weeks.
Doug Monroe (RTD staff) – Responding to Katie Arnsten
RTD has been working hard to address operator shortages which result in dropped trips at
certain times on all routes.
Rebecca Minor
I would like an existing bus stop on route #38 (ID 11016) to be relocated to a safer
location (from 38th & Clark to nearby 38th & Miller). This new location is near an
abandoned car wash and at an empty lot which has more room to wait for the bus. I was
hit by a car while waiting at this bus stop at 6am. The waiting area is too close to the
street and is not well lighted. The site is too cramped. (She provided her direct contact
info for RTD staff to follow-up: 303-279-6829 (h); 303-672-5037 (w).

John Kiljan, P.E.
The 55s is not being advertised by RTD and should be. This meeting also was not well
advertised. Has the 55s has seen an increase in riders since it started? Has the 55L also
perhaps seen an increase in riders? It is likely these routes are mutually helping each other
and should remain. I can help advertise this route locally here in Arvada for RTD in a
newsletter (He left his contact card/info for RTD to contact to help advertise 55s: 303423-9875; 303-647-2408; jpkiljan@yahoo.com).
Doug Monroe (RTD Staff) – Responding to John Kiljan
Q. How often does the 55s operate? A. Weekdays and Weekends.
Q. Does 55s operate to DUS? A. Yes.
Allen Best
There is no marketing by RTD of the 55s and it needs it. I agree with Carolyn Adams’
comments.
Amy Payton
The 55L 6:39a trip has not been operated 3 times in the last 2 weeks. One time it was
two days in-a-row. I also use the 55s at night when I work later than the 55L operates.
Commenter
There also was a problem with the 6:45a 55L trip being dropped this morning.
Commenter
It is not acceptable that RTD is having such a shortage of operators to fill trips. I have
also noticed that four days in the last 2 weeks that 55L trips were dropped.
Joel DeJong
We need the 55L to operate more reliably. We need this bus and we use it to go to work.
We rely on it to be there for our continued employment.
Virginia Motoyama
The 55L is an important route and it does not operate long enough span during the day.
The 55s helps the 55L but it is confusing that there are these two route names at different
times of the day.
Lorraine Anderson (RTD Board Member) – replying to Virginia Motoyama
I plan to relay your concerns, and of those others here, to the RTD board that the 55s
should remain and that it needs RTD marketing to be conducted. I will also look into the
problem of recent missed 55L trips.
Steve Young
I am looking forward to the G-Line opening. I moved here to Arvada to be near the station
in anticipation of the start of the G-Line. The 55L and 55s needs to be extended most
hours to operate every 30 minutes, but could be reduced in mid-day if stronger ridership is
not there.

Question: Can RTD put an article into the local Arvada Sentinel Newspaper to advertise

continues until the G-Line starts.
Commenter
Marketing could be so simple such as placing signage at the Park-n-Ride also showing the

I made a big commitment on buying my condo on the G-Line starting and we have been

the G-Line will happen.
Commenter
I have been on City commissions here and you have very little info on the RTD website
about the 55s and how it works with the 55L. RTD needs to provide more info about this.
Julia Morrison
It seems line south metro communities get more RTD service than we do here. We need
more service including the 55s.
Virginia Motoyama
Why did questions about the A-Line not get resolved by RTD in advance? This should not
be new or unexpected. Do we really need to wait for the issues of the A-Line to get
resolved?
Lorraine Anderson (RTD Board Member) – replying to Virginia Motoyama
Positive train control is new technology. RTD is the first commuter rail agency being
required by the FRA to implement it. The FRA has a very narrow window of what is and
what is not acceptable in terms of when the gates must come down in advance of a train
and how long they must stay down after the train passes. RTD’s contractor, DTO, has a
good contract so that RTD taxpayers are not bearing the cost burden of these deficiencies
and delays. The issues of the A-Line when resolved will be incorporated into the G-Line
when it starts. We are working hard to get it right. No one is more frustrated by these
technology delays than I am.
Julia Morrison
The DTO contractor is not being paid right now, are they? Are their penalties in their
contract?

Board Meeting Date: March 28, 2017

Subject:

Approve Contract Amendment for the Supply
of 15 - 40' Transit Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to exercise the contract option and amend contract 13FH-053 with Gillig LLC. for the purchase of 15 additional 40’ transit buses and associated spare
components in an amount not to exceed $6,598,000.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Financial Sustainability to include asset management
and state of good repair, Bus Operations is continuing the process of replacing the aging and high
maintenance Model Year 2000 Orion sub-fleet of 40 foot transit buses.
This request is for the Board’s approval of the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase
option for a quantity of 15 additional 40’ transit buses. The new buses are for the replacement of the
remaining Orion buses.
The remaining Model Year 2000 Orion transit buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years.
The buses are now 17 years old and have accumulated on average 702,000 miles of stop-and-go transit
service. They require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The bus manufacturer, Orion Bus
Industries, went out of business several years ago. Many of the parts required for the repair of the buses
are now difficult to obtain. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) calls for the replacement of the
Orion sub-fleet of buses over three years, 125 buses in 2013, 110 buses in 2014 and 64 buses in
2015. Due to the increased service demand, RTD has kept 54 Orion buses in continued service.
Together with the delivery of 40 Gillig buses in May/June this year from the purchase option approved
by the Board last year, this purchase of additional 15 buses will complete the replacement of all Orion
buses. The purchase is included in the adopted SBP.
On November 26, 2013 the RTD Board of Directors approved the procurement of 125 Gillig 40’ transit
buses to begin the replacement to the existing 40 foot Orion buses. The original procurement was the
result of RTD Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-FH-053 issued in May of 2013. Proposals were received in
September, 2013. The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 307 additional buses over a
five year period. Pricing for additional option buses is based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary
price adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
On June 24, 2014 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 110
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
On February 17, 2015 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 64
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.

Packet Pg. 99

11.D

On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Directors approved a contract amendment for an additional 40
Gillig 40’ transit buses as part of the on-going replacement program.
This requested purchase of additional 15 Gillig 40’ transit buses will complete the replacement of the
Model Year 2000 Orion buses.

DISCUSSION
The 40’ transit buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. As
parts of our commitment to the disabled community for continued improvement of access, the buses
will feature enhanced seat layout to better accommodate passengers with disabilities and passengers
with large items such as walkers, shopping carts, baby strollers, etc. Their clean diesel engines will
meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90% from the level of the
existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count system and a security
digital camera system. They will have two passenger doors and 37 passenger seats.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The requested approval is for the contract amendment to Gillig to exercise the purchase option for a
quantity of 15-40’ transit buses and associated spare components in the amount not to exceed
$6,598,000. The funding for this project is included in the adopted 2017 RTD budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Gillig has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its DBE
plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the Interim General Manager to issue a contract amendment to Gillig for the purchase of
15-40’ transit buses. This is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract amendment and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it would
result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
with AECOM for travel modeling services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This
amendment increases the value by $535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the
2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
BACKGROUND
In 2013 RTD awarded a contract to AECOM to perform travel modeling on an as-needed basis, The
contractor performs work when required due to limitations of RTD resources and/or expertise for the
particular task and time. Work has been performed in the context of National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) studies; Federal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts submittals; Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) regional planning activities as required by Federal planning law; RTD internal
planning studies; RTD budget development and contract analysis; and preliminary engineering, final
design, and construction of FasTracks corridors.
The contract is for three years with two one-year renewable options at RTD’s sole discretion. RTD has
exercised these options and 2017 is the last year of the contract. The initial contract value was
$309,706.62. A previous amendment in 2013 increased the value by $46,000 to reach the current
value of $355,706.62.
DISCUSSION
One key purpose is to provide travel modeling services for the SH-119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Planning and Engineering Study. That study will require travel modeling for numerous BRT
alternatives to develop ridership and related data for decision-making.
A second purpose of this contract amendment is to make travel model updates. The Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to regularly
update travel forecasting models for the projects receiving grants. RTD makes use of three travel
models:
1. A traditional four-step model originally developed by DRCOG called Compass
2. A state-of-the-art tour-based model developed by DRCOG called Focus
3. A transit ridership forecasting model developed by FTA called Simplified Trips-on-Project
Software (STOPS)

Packet Pg. 101

12.E

Of the $535,000 being requested for this contract amendment, it is expected that $285,000 will be
used for travel model updates and $250,000 will be used for the SH-119 BRT Environmental
Clearance project.

Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH
119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with AECOM for travel modeling
services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This amendment increases the value by
$535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the 2017 base system expense
budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it will delay the
completion of travel model calibration and the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a sole source contract not to exceed
$2,500,000 with Sierra Wireless America, Inc. (Sierra Wireless) for upgrade of existing onboard routers
and purchase of new onboard wireless routers and associated equipment (Contract Number 17DH004).
This contract will include upgrading existing routers with new integrated cellular data modems, purchase
of new onboard routers with associated equipment, documentation and training.
BACKGROUND:
The majority of RTD vehicles require communications between onboard technology and backend
computer systems. This communication is typically through cellular data communications, Wi-Fi or both.
Additionally, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) information is needed on most vehicles. An onboard
router is a networking device that forwards data between networks and is the most efficient way to
achieve communications with cellular data, Wi-Fi and GPS in one device, while allowing onboard
networking of multiple systems.
RTD’s onboard networks incorporate the router with the Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic
Vehicle Location (CAD/AVL) system, Smart Media Technology (SMT), farebox, destination signs, and on
newer buses, the digital video cameras. RTD purchased onboard routers for the fixed-route fleet as part
of the Smart Media Technology (SMT) project. This router works well and has been meeting RTD’s
needs since 2011.
RTD is upgrading the Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) to use transit hardened equipment.
The technology architecture of this project requires a mobile router. Call-n-Ride vehicles require onboard
communications and GPS, which can use the mobile router. New Light Rail vehicles will have an
upgraded video system and automatic passenger counters, which both will make use of a mobile router.

DISCUSSION:
Cellular data communications using the onboard router are needed to report bus location to Dispatch in
real time, send messages to and from drivers, set the radio to the correct channel for radio calls and
other such actions. When the bus does not have cellular data communications, the bus goes into a state
we call data radio fallback. In fallback, we do not receive bus position information, text message
communications do not work and the voice radio switches to a hailing talk group along with other buses
in fallback. The stand-alone systems of the vehicle continue to work, such as onboard announcements,
destination signs, route navigation schedule information.

The router uses a cellular data card, plugged into the router as a way to communicate through the
cellular data provider to our back-end systems. RTD’s existing installed consumer-grade cellular data
cards on the fixed-route buses have been failing at a rate of several each week. Additionally, the
manufacturer of the consumer-grade cellular data cards that RTD was using unexpectedly stopped
producing these cards. No other cellular data cards are certified to work with the router and
manufacturers are moving away from producing USB plug-in cellular data cards. This makes the upgrade
imperative. Therefore, the consumer-grade cellular data cards need replacing with industrial-grade
integrated cellular data cards.
RTD’s Access-a-Ride, Call-n-Ride and Light Rail vehicles do not have the same routers and cellular data
cards as are used on the fixed-route fleet. RTD has invested significant time and effort to get these
onboard routers configured and secured for RTD’s specific needs. The routers from Sierra Wireless have
been shown to meet RTD’s needs for stability, flexibility and support. For ease of management and
standardization of all onboard routers, RTD will standardize and upgrade the equipment currently used on
fixed-route bus across all of RTD’s services including Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride and Light Rail vehicles.
This procurement will include the purchasing of the same onboard routers equipped with integrated
industrial-grade cellular data cards used on fixed-route buses, new wireless antenna sets, power cables
and communications cabling for installation on the Access-a-Ride, Call-n-Ride and Light Rail vehicle
fleets.
A sole source justification memo for this procurement has been prepared and approved by Materials
Management. This procurement meets the sole source criteria in the RTD "Procurement Standards
Manual" revised December 2016.
Soul Source Criteria: Unique or Innovative Concept
For the installation of industrial-grade cellular-data cards in the routers, this is a circuit-board level
upgrade. Other companies do not likely have the appropriate knowledge of the router to perform the
upgrade successfully. In addition to the circuit-board upgrade, firmware configuration changes are also
required and the firmware is proprietary. If any other company were to perform this upgrade, it would
likely void the warranty.
Sole Source Criteria: Substantial Duplication of Costs
RTD has chosen the Sierra Wireless as the standard for onboard routers for the RTD fleets. This
standardization saves RTD in training, troubleshooting and the stocking of spare parts. Also, the fleet of
routers is managed through the Onboard Mobility Manager Software provided by Sierra Wireless that
allows the System Administrators to manage, upgrade, configure, troubleshoot and develop Key
Performance Indicators. This is nearly $300k worth of software that would need to be duplicated. RTD
has invested several years in getting the firmware and configuration of this router optimized to work as
we need it in our system. To start with another vendor would waste thousands of hours of effort and
likely require a similar effort with another vendor.
Sole Source Criteria: Unacceptable Delay
The external cellular data cards that are used in these routers have been consumer-grade and need to be
replaced with industrial-grade cellular data cards, with this project. It is important to note that the
industrial grade card requested in this project is agnostic when it comes to cellular data service providers
and provides RTD the flexibility to change cellular data service providers without replacing a plug-in card.

With no advance warning, RTD discovered that the Netgear 341U cellular data cards that we have been
using are no longer being produced by Netgear. There are no other cellular data cards that are certified
to work with the routers. The cellular data equipment manufacturing industry is moving away from using
USB-based plug-in cellular data cards. The cellular data cards we have fail at a rate of several a week.
We have already run out of spare cellular data cards and have buses that are unable to use the CAD/AVL
system, thereby degrading operations. It is essential that we get the industrial-grade cellular data cards
procured as soon as possible to keep the majority of the fleet in communications. Using changeable
cellular data cards was originally a requirement of the project. With changes in the market, this is no
longer desirable or sustainable. The need for this change is not a reflection of the quality of the product
produced by Sierra Wireless.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The estimated cost of upgrading 1120 existing routers is $950,000. Purchase of new routers for
Access-a-Ride, Call-n-Ride and new Light Rail Vehicles is $1,200,000. There has been recent discussion
of expanding the Access-a-Ride fleet and possible expansion of the fixed-route fleet. We request extra
contract capacity to be able to purchase additional routers for fleet expansion and to obtain greater
penetration of routers on the Light Rail vehicles without starting a new procurement. Additionally, RTD
has not yet received a proposal from the vendor at the time of this memo. Therefore, we are requesting
contract capacity of $2,500,000.
As the cost of each router is less than $5000, these funds are from expense budgets. Funds for the
Light Rail vehicle routers came from the Light Rail expense budget. The remaining routers are funded
from the IT expense budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Sierra Wireless in
order to purchase and upgrade onboard routers. This is the recommended action.
2. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Sierra Wireless to
upgrade the existing routers and direct RTD staff to pursue an open procurement for the new
routers. This is not the recommended action.
3. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Sierra
Wireless to purchase and upgrade onboard routers and direct RTD staff to pursue an open
procurement for new routers for all projects. As cellular data cards fail, more buses would not
be able to communicate with the CAD/AVL system when on the road until new routers were
procured, delivered, configured and installed. This is not the recommended action.
4. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Sierra
Wireless to purchase and upgrade onboard routers. This action would result in RTD’s inability
to procure needed routers and upgrades. Buses would not be able to communicate with the
CAD/AVL system when on the road. The Access-a-Ride Mobile Data Terminal MDT project
would not have the necessary equipment to operate properly. Call-n-Ride and Light Rail
Vehicles would not have adequate communications. This is not the recommended action.
