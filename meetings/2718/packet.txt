Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for February 2018:
1. Transportation Funding Initiative Update – The Coalition of business interests,
elected officials, transportation and multi-modal advocates and industry representatives
continues to prepare for a transportation funding initiative. The Coalition’s legal counsel
is expected to file at least four ballot titles in the next 10 days. The full Coalition will be
meeting on Wednesday, February 7 from 3-4:30 p.m. at the Denver Metro Chamber of
Commerce.
2. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) Retreat – The MMC’s Annual Retreat was held on
January 13. The MMC reached a consensus that the 1% sales tax increase option remains
its preferred option, but if a lesser sales tax is proposed, then CDOT’s share must be
proportionately reduced to preserve the local share necessary to meet our significant
transportation and mobility needs. A copy of the full MMC statement is attached.
3. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) Meeting – The next meeting of the full MMC is on
Wednesday, February 7 from 7:30-10 a.m. at the Lone Tree Arts Center, 10075
Commons St. in Lone Tree. The agenda includes a legislative update from CML and a
discussion regarding the transportation funding initiative. Following the meeting, there
will be an optional coffee from 10-11 a.m. focused on the history of the MMC’s
engagement on transportation that will be led by Arvada Mayor Marc Williams.

CONSENSUS: MMC January 22, 2018 Transportation Funding Recommendation

The passage of SB 267 combined with the new increased revenue projections for the state General Fund have led some
within the statewide coalition to suggest that because CDOT’s funding need has been reduced, a 1% sales tax may no longer
be necessary.
The Metro Mayors Caucus and members of the broader statewide coalition have repeatedly affirmed the critical importance
of both local and multi-modal funding from any new funding mechanism. However, the legislative efforts provide no new
dollars for local needs and a negligible amount for multi-modal (arguably as much as 10% of CDOT’s dollars, but potentially
less). Because the General Assembly is unable to bind future legislatures through statutory funding commitments, and
because unpredictable economic cycles demand flexibility in General Fund revenues allocation, MMC continues to believe
that a secure, sustainable and predictable revenue source dedicated to transportation and mobility infrastructure at the
state and local levels is critical.
Sales taxes are the primary revenue source for municipalities and are used to fund essential public services — municipalities
must therefore see a significant return of local dollars from any statewide sales tax question. For the above reasons, MMC’s
October 2017 preferred option was that a 1% statewide sales tax proposal with the above described 45/15/20/20 split be
put before voters. At the January 13, 2018 MMC Retreat, mayors asserted and via the consensus process have agreed, that
the 1% option remains our preferred option, but that if a lesser sales tax is proposed (like the example below), then CDOT’s
share must be proportionately reduced to preserve the local share necessary to meet our significant transportation and
mobility needs.

Attachment: Jan 22 2018 MMC Transportation Statement (3384 : Local Update - CRL & Associates)

During the fall of 2017 the Metro Mayors Caucus and stakeholders engaged in substantial discussion of several alternatives
for funding statewide transportation and mobility needs. Those discussions included the October 4 Full Metro Mayors
Caucus meeting, discussions within the MMC Executive Committee, and a 10/9 MMC Transportation & Mobility Committee
meeting. These discussions provided the basis for MMC’s preferred alternative, which was submitted on October 17, via
email, to every mayor within the Caucus for comment or objection. From this intensive process, the Metro Mayors Caucus’
preferred option emerged: a 1% sales tax increase split 45/15/20/20 among CDOT Roadway/Statewide MultiModal/Counties/Cities.

BBMK would like to congratulate Director Solano and Director Walker on your new leadership
positions as the Government Relations Chair and Vice-Chair of the RTD Board. We look forward
to continuing to partner with both of you and stand ready to assist you on legislative matters
important to the District.
SB18-088 Taxation of Retail Marijuana Sales sponsored by Senator Gardner and Majority
Leader KC Becker. SB18-088 clarifies that retail marijuana sales remain subject to the sales
taxes of RTD, SCFD and the HSD and any other sales taxes that limited purpose governmental
entities levied on retail marijuana sales before July 1, 2017. SB18-088 is different from the
legislation proposed during the special session as it puts in place clear direction for organizations
impacted by the error to move forward in collecting the tax. First, organizations governing
boards would be required to make public decisions that would provide direction. Second, the
impacted organizations will not be seeking to collect taxes retroactively. Finally, allowable tax
collection will only resume from the time of the governing board decision authorizing it and
going forward. The bill was heard in the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. General
Manager Genova and Board Chair Tisdale provided excellent testimony to the Committee.
The bill passed the Senate on Second Reading on a voice vote.
SB18-001 Transportation Infrastructure Funding sponsored by Senators Baumgardner
and Cooke and Reps. Buck and Carver. This legislation supported by Senate Republican
Leadership would require the transportation commission to submit a ballot question to the voters
in the November 2018 election that would authorize additional TRANs bonds in a maximum
amount of $3.5 billion and with a maximum repayment cost of $5 billion. The bill would repeal
Sections 3,4, and 7 of SB 267 that require the state treasurer to execute lease-purchase
agreements of up to $1.88 billion for funding high-priority qualified federal aid transportation
projects. The bill would further require 10 percent of the state sales and use tax revenue to be
credited to the state highway fund and used to make TRANs payments. Lastly, it would require
CDOT to report on the use of these funds to the House and Senate Transportation Committees.
The bill was heard in the Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday. The sponsors offered
three amendments to the bill. L001 required that one project be located in each of the five
transportation districts. L002 added a legislative declaration adds that the General Assembly
can determine whether to use a low bill or design process and then contract with separate
entities for the two processes. L003 stated that CDOT must release the first third of the bonds
in 2018, and then a third for each processing year. L004 allows CDOT to use all the money

HB18-1062 Sales Tax on Retail Marijuana sponsored by Rep. Lebsock. The bill reduces the
special sales tax rate on retail marijuana and eliminates the exemption on retail marijuana from
the state’s 2.9 percent sales tax. The bill reduces total state revenue, changes the distribution of
revenue in the General Fund and cash funds, and increases revenue to certain special districts.
The bill has not been calendared to date.
HB18-1067 Right to Rest Act sponsored by Reps. Salazar and Melton. In past years RTD
has had concerns about this legislation having a negative impact on the District’s ability to
manage our property and have opposed this type of legislation along with groups like the
Colorado Municipal League, Downtown Denver Partnership and the City and County of Denver.
The bill is scheduled for a hearing on February 21st at 1:30 pm in the House Local
Government Committee.
HB18-1119 Highway Building and Maintenance Funding sponsored by Rep. Leonard and
Senator Neville. This bill would require the transportation commission to submit to the voters of
the state at the November 2018 general election. The ballot question, if approved without raising
taxes would authorize the state to issue transportation revenue anticipation notes up to $3.5
billion with a maximum repayment cost of $5 billion to fund the construction of specified high
priority projects. The initiative would also repeal sections of 3, 4, and seven enacted in SB267,
that requires the state treasurer to execute lease-purchase agreements of up to $1.88 billion for
funding high-priority qualified federal aid transportation projects. The bill was introduced and
assigned to the House Transportation and Energy Committee.
BBMK is tracking a number of sales tax bills for any impacts to the District.

Purported White House Infrastructure Plan Released by Trade Press
The White House is expected to unveil more details on its infrastructure proposal in the coming
weeks, shortly after the President’s State of the Union address on January 30. The President will
also highlight the Administration’s infrastructure proposal in his State of the Union address.
Last week, a six-page memorandum outlining the Trump Administration’s infrastructure proposal
was obtained by the press. The White House has not confirmed the authenticity of the document,
but it reflects the broad policy positions and four main funding and finance proposals that the
Administration has been publicly discussing for months.
Throughout these discussions, the White House has stated their plan will provide $200 billion in
funding to leverage at least $1 trillion in total investment. Last week, the White House’s
infrastructure director, DJ Gribbon, revealed that there will be no new funding included in the
proposal. Instead, the $200 billion will be derived from redirecting funds away from existing
programs, in line with the President’s FY 2018 budget proposal. In that budget, the President
proposed significant reductions to New Starts, Amtrak, and the multi-modal TIGER grant program,
among other cuts. Additionally, DJ Gribbon said that, while he does not propose eliminating the
Highway Trust Fund, the President’s infrastructure proposal will not include additional revenues to
address the chronic revenue shortfall facing the Highway Trust Fund since 2008.
The memorandum outlines three new programs that would receive Federal infrastructure funding:
(1) Infrastructure Incentives Initiative; (2) Transformative Projects Program; and (3) Rural
Infrastructure Program. Additionally, the proposal would significantly increase funding for several
existing Federal credit assistance programs, including TIFIA and RRIF, which lend to those
infrastructure projects with reliable revenue streams to repay the loans.

Federal Update

1.C.3.a

The Infrastructure Incentives Initiative, accounting for 50 percent of the plan’s spending, would
provide Federal discretionary grants for infrastructure projects to State and local governments that
raise their own revenues – or attract private revenues – for such projects. This program would also
include a short look-back period providing States and local governments with some credit for nonFederal revenues raised in the previous three years. Where Federal highway and transit formula
programs now fund up to 80 percent of project costs, Federal grants under this new incentive
initiative would be limited to 20 percent of project costs.
Attachment: Federal Update 1 29 18 (3387 : Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs)

The Transformative Projects Program would be a discretionary grant program run by the
Department of Commerce and would support a wide range of publicly-sponsored demonstration,
planning, and capital construction projects that include a private or non-profit equity investment.
The Rural Infrastructure Program would be mainly block grants to every State, apportioned based
on each State’s share of all rural lane miles nationwide and its share of the total rural population
nationwide.
Beyond these three funding programs, the bill includes a number of policy priorities, many of which
are aimed at significantly reducing Federal permitting requirements and other hurdles to advancing
infrastructure projects in a timely manner. For public transportation, the proposal would require
New Starts grant recipients to establish value-capture mechanisms (such as a local property tax) as a
condition of receiving New Starts funding.
Among a number of smaller programs proposed in the memorandum is the Public Lands
Infrastructure Fund, which would be a new Interior Maintenance Fund supported by Federal fees
generated from mineral and energy development on Federal lands and waters. No information is
provided on how such revenues would be spent on infrastructure projects.
Federal Government Still Operating Under Continuing Resolutions
After a short Federal government shutdown in mid-January, the Federal government is now
operating under a fourth Continuing Resolution (CR) that funds all programs and agencies through
February 8, 2018. To date, Congress has not yet reached an agreement on a FY 2018 budget and
continues to try to include a compromise on immigration issues in the FY 2018 spending deal.
Because of the difficulty all parties have faced to date in finding consensus on immigration and
spending issues, Congress may adopt another CR by or before February 8 to gain more time for
further negotiations. Under these short-term extensions, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
has not yet released formula funds for the fiscal year that began on October 1, 2017.

Transit Oriented Development Evaluation
Guidelines

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the attached Resolution Number
(the “Resolution”), the “Transit Oriented
Development Evaluation Guidelines” to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating transit
oriented development (TOD) projects moving forward.
BACKGROUND
RTD has invested over $5.8 billion dollars in the rapid transit network for the Denver Metropolitan
Region since 2004. A direct result of this investment and previous rapid transit investments by RTD is a
tremendous level of interest in TOD at or adjacent to stations along RTD’s rapid transit network. In
2016, the Board initiated RTD TOD Assessment was completed by outside consultants. The final report
for the TOD Assessment indicated that RTD would benefit from “achieving mission clarity” on TOD by
more clearly defining the value of TOD for the agency.
DISCUSSION
RTD’s current policy guidance for TOD, including the Strategic Plan for TOD (2010), provides limited
guidance on how RTD should access the value of TOD for the agency. Policy issues related to fiscal
sustainability, social equity, and safety and security are not clearly articulated in the Strategic Plan for
TOD and other policy documents. Clear direction on how to evaluate these policy issues would provide
more transparency and clarity in decision making for TOD projects for both internal staff and outside
stakeholders including local jurisdictions and developers.
It would therefore be beneficial to have TOD evaluation guidelines to provide a clearer direction to RTD
staff and external stakeholders on TOD projects. Draft TOD Evaluation Guidelines were presented at the
December 5th Planning, Capital Programs, and FasTracks Committee meeting. Board feedback on the
draft guidelines was provided at the meeting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no expected direct financial impact of this resolution. This resolution requires that financial
implications be considered as part of any decision related to TOD projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the attached Resolution Number
_
(the “Resolution”), the Transit Oriented
Development (TOD) Evaluation Guidelines, that is recommended by the Planning, Capital
Programs and FasTracks Committee, to provide policy direction to RTD staff on evaluating TOD
projects moving forward.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ____, SERIES OF 2018
(Transit Oriented Development Evaluation Guidelines)
A RESOLUTION PROVIDING POLICY GUIDANCE ON EVALUATING THE VALUE OF
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT TO THE RTD.
WHEREAS, The Regional Transportation District plans, designs, builds and operates mass
transit for the Denver region; and
WHEREAS, the provision of transit service to the Denver region by RTD influences
development patterns and supports transit oriented development; and
WHEREAS, decisions on transit oriented development at RTD are governed by RTD
statutes and a broad set of internal policies including RTD’s Strategic Plan for TOD (2010),
Policy for Joint Development and Disposition of Real Property (RTD Resolution 15, Series
of 2015), Unsolicited Proposal Policy for Real Property (RTD Resolution 16, Series of
2015), and Parking Guiding Principles (Resolution 24, Series of 2016).
WHEREAS, RTD staff would benefit from additional policy guidance from the RTD Board of
Directors on evaluating TOD projects.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT TO ADOPT THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION GUIDELINES
FOR TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS:
TOD Evaluation Guidelines
A transit-oriented development (TOD) project occurring on or adjacent to RTD property will
inevitably affect RTD. When RTD is in a position to influence the TOD project, either by
entering into an agreement with the developer or jurisdiction, or through regulatory means,
and a decision is required regarding RTD’s participation, RTD must consider the value of
the TOD project to RTD.
The principles and evaluation factors below were developed to guide RTD staff’s
assessment of the TOD project’s value. As every TOD project is unique, each one will be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to its total impact (positive or negative) to
RTD.
TOD Value Principles
The following principles set clear standards and thresholds for new TOD projects. Every
new TOD project is expected to satisfy all six principles.

Packet Pg. 14

2.B.1

1. The TOD project must be budget neutral or budget positive for RTD.
Evaluations of budget impact should take into account direct revenue to RTD,
including property sale or lease revenue, increased fare revenue, or other revenue
sources. Replacement, major rehabilitation, maintenance, administrative, and other
operational costs, as well as any capital expenditures, should be considered over
the long and short terms.
2. The TOD project must be expected to increase ridership.
The proposer must demonstrate that ridership is reasonably projected to increase as
a result of project implementation including having ridership projections reviewed
and approved by RTD staff. Ridership increases over the short and long-term will
be considered, but short term increases are preferred.
3. Where feasible, ground leases of RTD property are preferred over sales.
RTD prefers to retain a fee interest in property. In some cases, such as condo
development or an unfavorable economy, a ground lease may not be feasible, and a
land sale should be considered.
4. The TOD project must reflect the Parking Guiding Principles (PGP).
RTD will evaluate third-party parking operations and parking replacement based on
the factors described in the PGP or such other relevant guidance provided by the
Board.
5. The TOD project must enhance safety and security.
The TOD project must positively contribute to the safety and security of the RTD
system by remedying any known problems at the site, as well as by addressing
issues of pedestrian safety and walkability, and by increasing “eyes on the street”
through activation.
6. The TOD project must have jurisdiction support.
The TOD project must be consistent with the local jurisdiction’s plans and the
jurisdiction, formally or informally, must demonstrate support for the project.
Evaluation Factors
TOD projects will additionally be measured against the following evaluation factors. Unlike
the TOD Value Principles, the evaluation factors should be considered as whole, with the
understanding that TOD projects may not satisfy all evaluation factors. In determining the
total impact of a TOD project to RTD, Tier One Factors should be given more weight than
Tier Two Factors.
Tier One Factors:
 Ground Lease/Land Sale
Revenue from a land sale or ground lease should support RTD’s fiscal sustainability.


Increased Ridership/Fare Revenues
Generating new ridership supports RTD’s mission and directly benefits RTD through
increased fare revenues.



Replacement or New Facilities
Leveraging development to provide new or replacement facilities that are needed for
transit operations supports a state of good repair as determined by RTD (the value

Packet Pg. 15

2.B.1

of the facility may be large, such as for a new parking structure, or small, such as
for a Driver Relief Station).


Outsourced Maintenance
Assigning maintenance responsibilities, such as landscaping, cleaning, general
maintenance, snow and ice removal, and graffiti removal, to a third party in a
manner that is consistent with RTD standards and does not increase RTD’s
administrative burden reduces costs and risks for RTD.



Jurisdiction Support
Jurisdiction support for a TOD project beyond basic planning demonstrates the
importance of the project to the local community. Demonstrations of strong
jurisdiction support might include updating zoning, providing financial support,
employing Tax Increment Financing (TIF), contributing to capital projects that
support the TOD project, or assuming part of the TOD project’s risk.



Enhanced RTD Operations
Improved transit operations through more efficient routing, more optimal transfers,
or other operational efficiencies directly benefit RTD.

Tier Two Factors:


Improved Safety/Security
Addressing safety and security issues such as emergency ingress and egress,
fire/life/safety communication, lighting and tripping hazards will positively impact
RTD. The activation of previously isolated stations also positively impacts security.



Upgraded Rider Amenities/Access
Upgraded rider amenities or increased options or access to RTD transit improve the
rider experience and may include improved seating, vending, walkways, open
space, wayfinding, and First Mile/Last Mile solutions.



Community Facilities/Affordable Housing
RTD supports and benefits from community facilities and/or affordable housing at
TOD projects that are consistent with local jurisdiction policies.



Brand Image Enhancement
RTD’s brand is enhanced and RTD benefits as a whole when RTD is positively
associated with a TOD project that supports community objectives.

Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
Section 810.2 of the United States Department of Transportation Standards specifies requirements for
new, altered, or relocated bus stops to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The
Street Improvements program serves the various needs of RTD and its patrons by providing improved
access to bus stops by installing boarding areas, and connecting walkways meeting ADA standards. Bus
pads, miscellaneous street and various emergency park-n-Ride repairs are also performed under this
contract.
Due to the repetitive nature of this work, a three-year contract was determined to be an effective way to
manage this work for the District. Bids were received through a publicly advertised contract, which was
awarded to Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in April of 2017.
Manion has had the Street Improvements contract since 2010 and has proven to be a very good
contractor. The current base contract value and proposed amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
Base year, 2017
$ 339,872.50
$ 150,000.00
$ 489,872.50
First option year (2018))
$ 371,409.75
0.00
$ 371,409.75
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and first option year (2018) =
$ 861,282.25
DISCUSSION
This second amendment (1st year option) will increase the contract by $ 371,409.75, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $ 861,282.25.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $371,409.75 funding for this Board Action shall come from the 2018 Capital Programs Expense
Budgets that are within the approved budget.
DBE GOAL
The contract requires 15% SBE participation - Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor
thereby meeting this goal.

ALTERNATIVES
Accept the Recommended Action.
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) of a three-year contract for the annual Street
Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,409.75. Funding
for this Contract Amendment is provided by the annual 2018 Capital Programs Expense Budgets.
Do Not Accept the Recommended Action.
Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to award a
Contract Amendment to initiate the first option year (2018) year of a three-year option contract for the
annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead
develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s construction work. This is not recommended
because:
a. It would take away RTD’s ability to move, alter, or relocate bus stops.
b. It would create a delay in constructing the planned 2018 street improvements
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2018 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The District desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.
