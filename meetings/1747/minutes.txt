action. The District held seven public meetings regarding the proposed service
changes, 127 people attended.
There was a discussion about the Route J and the Route Bolt and clarification of
what times the routes will run.
Bruce Daly asked about the artShuttle. Did the District cost out to run that in
house? The City of Englewood has earmarked money to fund their share of it for
the last part of this year. The shuttle is currently being operated by Laidlaw.
Director Daly would like to see a costing of doing the service in house. Bruce Abel
said that internal cost of artShuttle would be $390,000 versus $270,000
contracted service.
