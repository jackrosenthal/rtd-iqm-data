BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Winter 2025/2026 Service Change Recommendations

October 15, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Patrick Preusser, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift selection process detailed in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU), the
Winter 2025/2026 Service Change proposal facilitates opportunities for RTD bus and rail operations
personnel to select new work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations
plan for RTD’s transit network.
DISCUSSION
As evidenced in the Five-Year Financial Forecast, available funding levels for transit services are
estimated to remain the same as provided in 2025, which challenges both the growth and maintenance
of operating schedules for bus and rail services into 2026. Though major service reductions are not
currently recommended, optimization of existing transit resources is necessary to maintain services
throughout the District. Considering the current financial situation, the Winter 2025/2026 service
change recommendations contain plans for smaller scale changes to fixed-route bus service, restoration
of rail service patterns, and a reduction in non-fixed route service.
Responding to the budgetary situation, RTD staff are seeking alternative funding to continue the
implementation of the Systems Optimization Plan and to further support recent patterns of growth in the
system.
Considering both the current staffing levels and budget constraints, the Winter 2025/2026 Service
Change recommendations are designed to minimize impact on the budget while addressing service
quality throughout the transit network. Among the more notable changes are:
• Rerouting the D Line back to the Downtown Loop via the Central Corridor
• Extending the H Line from Southmoor Station to the Downtown Loop
• Restoration of service on L Line from 30th•Downing to 16th•Stout stations
• Discontinuance of the Platte Valley FlexRide service due to low customer utilization

Packet Pg. 3

1.E.1

Following RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence, and
recognizing the agency’s people power constraints, the proposals herein are directed at improving ontime performance, maintaining compliance with RTD’s CBA with ATU, and adjusting service levels to
match ridership demand.
The Board adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
The service changes summarized below are further detailed in Attachment A.
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES
Services recommended for routine adjustments (schedule adjustment/schedule analysis)
Route 0 – Broadway: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance
Route 0B – South Broadway: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance daily Route 4
– Morrison Road: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance weekdays and Saturdays
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd: schedule adjustments to improve on-time performance daily
Route 44 – Evans Avenue: a schedule shift for one weekday westbound trip to resolve a gate spacing
issue
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance
Route 76 – Wadsworth Crosstown: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance
Route 145X – Brighton/DEN Express: schedule adjustment to address daily bus terminal gate assignment
conflicts at Denver International Airport (DEN)
Route 153 – Chambers Road: schedule adjustments to improve daily on-time performance daily
FMR – Free MetroRide: schedule adjustments to improve weekday on-time performance
Services recommended for reductions
Platte Valley FlexRide: operation discontinued due to low customer utilization
Services recommended for mixed enhancements and reductions
Longmont Routes: Service along Coffman corridor restored following reconstruction between 9th
Avenue and 3rd Avenue; regional routes BOLT, LD, and LX extended to Coffman Street
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact of the service change is designed to be cost neutral.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Window Covering Prohibition and System Advertising
Policy Amendment

September 30, 2025

REPRESENTATIVES
Brett Paglieri, Director - District M
Matt Larsen, Director - District E
Chris Nicholson, Board Secretary and Director - District A
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Many transit agencies, including RTD, wrap revenue service vehicles with commemorative designs in
recognition of certain major events or holidays (e.g. winter holidays, Transit Equity Day, Pride, etc.), and
these wraps cover portions of windows on the vehicles. Additionally, transit agencies, including RTD,
cover certain buses with wraps covering portions of the vehicle’s windows that correspond to the
names of the routes (e.g. BOUND, DASH, HOP, Flatiron Flyer, JUMP, 16 th Street FreeRide, etc.). Within
the transit industry, there are many different types of on-vehicle commercial advertising products that
are sold which offer advertising space on revenue service vehicles to advertisers. Several of those
products offer the advertiser advertising space which covers various portions of vehicle windows.
Colloquially, these commemorative recognitions, route branded covers, and advertisements are known as
bus wraps or transit wraps. Examples of these wraps appear in the attached On-Vehicle Advertising Ad
Installation Guide (attachment A).
Official board records indicate that the Board has been debating components of advertising on vehicles
at least as far back as 1974. Over the years, the Board has grappled with whether to allow advertising
on vehicles, where to allow advertisements on vehicles, and the content of those advertisements. The
Board has at various times taken actions to prohibit certain types of advertising content and to expand
the available space on vehicles for advertising. Additionally, staff have negotiated advertising contracts
and agreements which have expanded or shrunk available advertising space. As such, the current
advertising practices of RTD are a mix of formal Board actions and contractual agreements negotiated by
staff and often approved by the Board.
The agency’s history of advertising on vehicles and wrapping vehicles is one of change in which various
practices are discontinued and then later reinstated. For example, for several years in the late 1990’s
RTD allowed 40 buses to be wrapped with advertisements covering more than the bottom six inches of
certain windows on the vehicles but then phased out the practice starting in June of 1999 after
receiving customer complaints (attachment B). In an effort to explore new commercial advertising
revenue streams, on September 20, 2011, the Board of Directors approved a pilot program to allow

Packet Pg. 18

1.E.2

certain windows of one light rail vehicle to be covered in advertising (attachment C). Subsequently,
additional light rail vehicles had their windows wrapped in advertising and the agency endeavored over a
six-month period sometime between September 2011 and October 2012 to survey customers as to the
impact of the advertisements on their experience. 185 customers responded to the survey and 85% of
respondents did not object to the windows on the light rail vehicles having advertising coverage
(attachment D). Subsequently, in 2015 the system advertising contract was amended to allow for bus
wraps to cover more than the bottom six inches of windows, effectively allowing for advertising wraps
to cover additional portions of certain windows on RTD buses (see standards below). On December 31,
2016, RTD entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with both the City of Boulder and
Boulder County to provide for the wrapping of certain local bus routes operating in Boulder City and
Boulder County (attachment E). Some of these wraps cover portions of the windows and RTD also has
other route branded wraps with designs covering portions of windows.
While RTD currently allows for the covering of windows of vehicles in revenue service, the agency sets
standards for these coverings, which define the following allowable window coverage:

▪
▪
▪
▪
▪

Bus
0% coverage on operator
window - street side
0% coverage on front door –
curbside
0% coverage of first curbside
window
0% coverage on rear door
upper windows
Up to, but not to exceed
50% coverage of total
remaining square footage on
all other windows

▪
▪
▪
▪

Light Rail
0% coverage on operator
windows
0% coverage on all windows
on doors
0% coverage on first window
at each end of each car
Up to, but not to exceed
50% coverage of total
remaining square footage on
all other windows

▪
▪
▪

Commuter Rail
0% coverage on operator
windows
0% coverage on all windows
on doors
Up to, but not to exceed
50% coverage of total
remaining square footage on
all other windows

In August of 2015, the Board adopted an updated System Advertising Policy, which limited certain kinds
of non-commercial advertising and asserted that RTD’s advertising spaces are a limited public forum
(attachment F). For purposes of this Discussion Item, the 2015 action is seen as creating the current
System Advertising Policy. Then in December of 2019, the Board acted to update the existing System
Advertising Policy to allow for digital advertising and to add cannabis and electronic cigarettes to the
existing list of products for which advertising is prohibited (attachment G). Additionally, the 2019 action
built off the 2015 action and more clearly defined two items: the concept of RTD Advertising Space and
the three clear uses of RTD Advertising Space (Commercial Advertising, RTD Advertising, and
Government Communication).
The following table indicates the current number of RTD revenue service vehicles by type (bus, light rail,
commuter rail) with some kind of commercial advertising or RTD advertising that covers at least some

Furthermore, RTD has the following route branded vehicles, for which the branded wraps cover some
portion of window space. Additionally, these vehicles may or may not also have some kind of
advertisement which covers some portion of the vehicle’s windows.

DISCUSSION
Because the application of advertising or other window coverings on the outside of windows of RTD
vehicles may obscure a customer’s outward visibility, the three Directors initiating this discussion are
concerned that the practice of covering vehicle windows may result in: a decline in the overall customer
experience, an increase in customer perceived safety and security concerns, and impacts on the overall
integrity of RTD’s brand and public image.
At least two transit entities have acted since 2023 to remove exterior advertising from their vehicles
including Albuquerque, NM (attachment H) and Bi-State Development in the St. Louis, MO area
(attachment I). Both cited the customer experience concerns and a desire to create a more distinctive
brand as reasons to discontinue the practice of wrapping vehicles with advertisements.
RTD has received two formal complaints (from one customer) over the past 12 months regarding the
presence of advertising or other vehicle wraps on a revenue service vehicle.
Given the above, the initiating Directors would like the Board to discuss the current vehicle wrapping
practices and advertising policy outlined in both the background section above as well as in the attached
documents. They would like to seek input on whether to bring forward a related action item to
effectuate specific items listed below or some combination thereof:
•
•
•
•

Prohibiting window coverings of any kind on revenue service vehicles
Prohibiting advertising on windows of revenue service vehicles
Further limiting the allowable amount of window coverage for commemorative vehicle wraps or
branded route wraps
Further limiting the allowable amount of window coverage included in RTD’s allowable
Advertising Space

Packet Pg. 20

1.E.2

Following the discussion, the Directors will determine whether to bring forward a related action item for
the regular October monthly board meeting, which is scheduled for Tuesday, October 28, 2025.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Board acted in June of 2025 to terminate the System Advertising Contract with Lamar effective
December 1, 2025 (attachment J), and the agency has an open solicitation for on-vehicle advertising. In
anticipation of this three-Director initiated item coming before the Board, staff has issued an addendum
to the request for proposals asking proposers to submit proposals with and without window space being
included in the allowable Advertising Space. It is anticipated that proposals accounting for the inclusion
of window space for advertising will be higher than those that exclude window space.

June 16, 1999 | Rocky Mountain News (Denver, CO) | April M. Washington News Staff Writer | Page 10A

The eye-catching paintings on some RTD buses to promote products such as Kool-Aid are being tossed out
the window - potentially costing the transit agency hundreds of thousands of dollars.
``It's one of the best advertising schemes in terms of bringing revenue we've created,'' said Beth Stewart,
owner of Denver Transit Advertising, the Regional Transportation District's advertising agency. ``A lot of
people are much more interested in taking out ads if the windows are included.''
The illustrated buses are one of RTD's most profitable advertising gimmicks, but riders complain paintings
block their view, said RTD spokesman Scott Reed.
``It was especially a problem at night for people who had impaired vision,'' he said.
Starting next year, RTD will allow advertisers' murals to cover the body of the buses and only the bottom six
inches of the windows.
The painted ads have generated $531,000 in the past two years, according to RTD records.
``What could be worse than losing something that's so popular?'' Stewart said. ``It's not like you can't see
out of the windows. The paintings are similar to tinted car windows.''
RTD officials said revenue loss will likely be recouped once rates are adjusted to offset the changes.
About 40 RTD buses feature the illustrations. Current advertisers won't be affected by the changes until their
contracts expire, Reed said.
``It's not like we're getting rid of the whole program,'' Reed said. ``The ads can be painted on the back and
sides of the buses.''

and to

exercise the two year option component of the contract, consistent with the terms and
amendments outlined in this action item.

BACKGROUND

RTD' s current contract for on-vehicle advertising was awarded to Lamar Transit Advertising

Lamar) in 2009. The initial period of the contract is from January 2010 to December 2012.

The contract contains an option for an additional two years from January 201 3 to December
2014. Staff is recommending that the option component of the contract be exercised and

that the current contract and the option component of the contract be amended as outlined
below to reflect available fleet inventory.

DISCUSSION

The current contract with Lamar contains a table showing anticipated space availability for
advertising sales. Because of service and fleet reductions in RTD's bus operations, the size
of the fleet available for ad sales is

17 percent less than was anticipated

when

Lamar

submitted their original revenue guarantee proposal. While RTD's contract with Lamar does

not contain a specific trigger for revisiting revenue guarantees, such a clause is quite typical

in the industry and is usually triggered when the fleet size increases or decreases by 10
percent or more.

Lamar has requested that the minimum revenue guarantee for the current contract year be

adjusted to reflect RTD' s reduction in fleet availability. Staff concurs and recommends that
the minimum

guarantee

of the bus component

of the contract for 2012 be reduced

from

2.8 million or 70 percent of net sales ( whichever is greater) to $ 2.324 million or 70 percent

This same

revenue calculation would be included in the two option years of the contract.

Lamar has also asked for consideration
of the contract,

of a revenue adjustment on the light rail component

but for a different reason.

Because

RTD has purchased

and put in revenue

service all of the light rail vehicles to be used on the West Line, RTD now has 172 vehicles
available for service,

but has a peak requirement of only 97 vehicles.

This represents a

temporary spare ratio of 77 percent, far above the 20 percent minimum spare ratio that is
typical in transit. The result of this to advertisers is that an ad vehicle is less likely to be in
revenue service and visible to the

recommending

that the

minimum guarantee on the light rail component of the contract for 2012 be adjusted from

1.6 million or 60 percent of net sales ( whichever is greater) to $1 . 2 million or 60 percent of
net sales ( whichever is greater).

This represents

a 25 percent reduction

in the minimum

The current contract also includes limitations on the number of light rail vehicles that may

service all of the 172 light rail vehicles, so the limit was established based on a smaller total
number of vehicles.

Staff recommends

that the maximum vehicle restriction

and to

alternative.

2. Do not amend the current contract with Lamar and do not change any of the terms of

the contract with Lamar and exercise the two option years of the contract. This is not
recommended

because the size of RTD' s available fleet has impacted

both the bus and

light rail components of the contract.

3. Do not amend the contract, do not exercise the two-year option and put the on-vehicle

MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Regarding wrapping of Community Transit Network (CTN) bus fleet
Summary

Boulder County (County) and the City of Boulder (collectively the Boulder County Local
Governments) wish to partner with the Regional Transportation District (RTD) regarding
individual bus branding "wraps" on the Boulder Community Transit Network (CTN) bus
routes.

This memorandum serves to memorialize Boulder County Local Governments' and RTD's
understanding concerning the above subject.
Background
The CTN bus network was initially launched.in 1994 with the creation of the HOP bus route.

The CTN routes have branded routes in a similar naming convention that help to
differentiate each route while also implying that they are part of a comprehensive transit
network through a similar naming structure (currently SKIP, JUMP, DASH, BOUND, and
STAMPEDE). As part of this unique branding, each route has a vinyl "wrap" graphic on the
outside that helps to differentiate the CTN routes from other routes throughout the transit
system.

Boulder County Local Governments and RTD wish to balance the unique branding of the
CTN buses through bu's wraps with the need for RTD to receive ad revenue that is
expected from their bus fleet as part of a necessary element to maintain fiscal solvency.

This MOU serves to outline the terms of the CTN bus branding/wrapping/advertising
understanding among RTD and Boulder County Local Governments to continue unique
branding of the CTN routes and to help ensure their continued effectiveness.
CTN bus wrap - technical specs and logistics
Technical specifications for CTN bus wraps and logistics for their installation and removal
shall be as follows:
a

current crN bus routes (defined as the sKlP, JUMp, DASH, BouND, STAMPEDE)
and any future CTN designated routes (as may be determined in conjunction among

the Boulder County Local Governments and RTD) will be eligible to have uniquely
branded bus wraps.

Committee Meeting Date:
RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy Update
Board Meeting Date:
August 18, 2015
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt the
attached advertising policy.
BACKGROUND
Currently, RTD operates an on-vehicle advertising program that accepts both commercial and non-commercial forms of
advertising. Under current policy, RTD’s advertising program creates a ‘limited public forum’ by which public service,
nonprofit and political advertisements are allowed within the guidelines established by the policy.
RTD’s Current Advertising Policy is as follows:
Advertising Policy and Objective:
It is the policy of the RTD to utilize space on the interior and exterior of its buses and light rail vehicles for commercial
advertising, RTD advertising, Corporate Partnership Program and public service messages. The primary objective of the
commercial advertising program is to maximize the net revenues to the District within the policy and standards of the
District.
Advertising Standards:
All advertising matter displayed on or in buses, light rail and commuter rail vehicles shall be of a reputable character as
determined by the RTD. Objectionable advertisements shall, upon the request of a responsible officer of the RTD, be
removed immediately. All advertisements must be in accordance with applicable Federal, State and Municipal laws,
ordinances and regulations within the District.
Political advertisements may be displayed only within six months of the election date. Said advertising must contain the
following disclaimer: "This Ad Paid for by (sponsor/advertiser)" and shall be subject to prior approval by RTD.
The following standards for advertising, as adopted by the RTD Board of Directors, shall be strictly adhered to by the
Advertising Company:
1. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is false, misleading, or deceptive;
2. The RTD will not display advertising copy which relates to any illegal activity under local, state or federal statute;
3. The RTD will not display advertising copy which is obscene;
4. Any advertisement not relating to a commercially available product or service including political advertising shall
include a clearly visible phrase "This Ad Paid for by (the identity of the sponsor/advertiser)". These ads shall be
subject to prior approval by the RTD; and
5. The RTD will not display advertising copy, which promotes the sale and/or use of tobacco products.
RTD has Non-Commercial Advertising Disclaimer Specifications under the current policy.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

DISCUSSION
The proposed RTD Advertising Policy would establish uniform, reasonable, and viewpoint-neutral standards for the
display of advertising in and on the facilities, vehicles and other property (together "Property") of the Regional
Transportation District and its affiliated and subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and restrict the use of RTD's
Property for First Amendment political speech.
By accepting paid advertising for display in and on the Property, the RTD is acting in a proprietary capacity as a
provider of public transportation seeking to maximize advertising revenue to support its transportation operations.
Starting from the Effective Date of the new Policy, the RTD does not intend that the advertising permitted to be
displayed in and on the Property be created, designated, or used as a public forum for expressive activities or
general discourse or opinions.
In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary capacity would be
limiting advertisements it will accept for display in and on the Property to paid commercial advertising, certain
public service announcements that will help provide information to the public about RTD’s own and other
government activities to help build goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public. The RTD would continue to
retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the Property by subjecting all proposed
advertisements to the Advertising Standards included in the proposed RTD Advertising Policy. This proposed
advertising policy is attached to this report.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is currently contracted with Lamar Advertising to receive a minimum guarantee of $4,000,000.00 in 2015,
$4,100,000.00 in 2016, and $4,200,000.00 in 2017 in advertising revenues. Non-commercial advertising accounts for
approximately $1,000,000.00 annually of those revenues. Adoption of the revised Advertising Policy may result in
an initial decrease of advertising revenue, as some advertisers will no longer qualify to participate in the RTD
Advertising program. Please also note that those advertisers are currently paying a lower rate for ads than the
commercial rate, and under the proposed updated policy, we will have only one rate. Staff also observes that some
non-commercial advertisers will be able to participate in the proposed advertising program as commercial
advertisers.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the attached proposed advertising policy, effective August 18, 2015. This alternative is the staff
recommendation.
2. Retain the existing RTD On-vehicle Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended due to the creation of
a ‘public forum’ on RTD property.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Revised System Advertising Policy
Board Meeting Date:
December 17, 2019
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Communications and Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board
of Directors approve the revision to the RTD System Advertising Policy. The revisions bring the policy
up to date to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy. The proposed policy
(attached) provides two specific updates from the previous version:
1. Includes stations, buildings, facilities and properties as well as RTD’s electronic
communications channels to expand the assets available for advertising.
2. Formally prohibits the advertising of cannabis and electronic cigarette products on RTD
assets.
The first revision is needed in order to provide the forum for RTD to entertain proposals for digital
advertising. The second revision formally excludes cannabis as a product allowable for advertising on
RTD properties. Despite not being excluded previously, RTD has not entertained any cannabis
advertising to date.
This recommended action supports the General Manager’s 2019 goals – Task Goal #1 – Fiscal
Sustainability
BACKGROUND
In August of 2015, RTD adopted the current System Advertising Policy. At this time, with the proposed
introduction of digital advertising, the Communications and Government Relations Committee is
recommending updating the advertising policy to reflect these changes in advertising media and
locations. This recommendation maintains the current commercial advertising standards adopted in
2015 and applies them to a wider array of advertising options across RTD’s assets. Further, excluding
the advertising of cannabis on the system maintains RTD’s good standing with regard to federal
funding.
DISCUSSION
The recommended change to the RTD System Advertising Policy would maintain uniform, reasonable,
and viewpoint-neutral standards for the display of advertising in and on the vehicles, stations,
buildings, facilities and properties of the Regional Transportation District and its affiliated and
subsidiary agencies (together "RTD") and maintain the property as a limited public forum by excluding
advertising of a non-commercial nature.

Committee Meeting Date:

1.E.2.g

In furtherance of the RTD's purpose of maximizing advertising revenue, the RTD in its proprietary
capacity would limit advertisements it will accept for display across the agency’s assets to paid
commercial advertising, certain public service announcements and messages that will help build
goodwill for the RTD among its riders and the public, and governmental partners. The RTD would
continue to retain control over the advertising that it will allow to be displayed in and on the system.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the change to the System Advertising Policy. This alternative is recommended to reflect
important updates to the policy to reflect current trends and factors that impact advertising policy.
Also, the update allows RTD to add digital advertising to the advertising program and provide a
new revenue stream for the agency. This alternative is the staff recommendation.
2. Retain the existing System Advertising Policy. This alternative is not recommended because it
doesn’t align with the agency’s desire to add digital advertising to its advertising program and
generate additional revenues for the agency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD is preparing a more robust and financially lucrative system advertising approach. This approach
would combine the On-Vehicle Advertising Program with a Digital Public Information and Advertising
Program into one larger comprehensive program. This more comprehensive advertising program will
enhance the delivery of customer information and optimize advertising revenues through RTD’s assets.
Adoption of the Revised System Advertising Policy will allow this RFP to be published and RTD to
assess the value of proposals from prospective vendors. Without this change, RTD will not be able
pursue enhanced digital advertising and will have to forego the increased revenue that is expected
through digital advertising.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
System Advertising Contract Termination

June 24, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
June 24, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her delegate to execute all
documents necessary to terminate RTD’s System Advertising Contract with Lamar Transit for an amount
not to exceed $2,534,655.15.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
For more than 20 years, RTD has supported an advertising program that generates revenue by
strategically using the agency’s revenue vehicles and other public-facing assets. RTD’s contract with
Lamar began in January 2022, and it included on-vehicle advertising, as well as a new digital advertising
program. Under the 10-year base agreement, Lamar pays RTD a “minimum annual guarantee” (MAG) in
advance. In addition to the MAG, RTD is entitled to receive 60% of any advertising revenue that is
generated in excess of the MAG. The MAG incrementally increases throughout the duration of the
contract. For example, in 2024, Lamar paid $5.6 million to RTD, and the payment increased to $6
million in 2025.
In addition to generating revenue through on-vehicle advertising, the contract requires Lamar to install
approximately 300 digital advertising displays, 60 digital kiosks, and 30 LED wall displays, within the
first three years of the contract. RTD retains a share-of-voice (i.e., a measurement model within
advertising that measures the percentage of media spending by a company/agency compared to the total
media expenditure for the product, service or category in market) on the digital screens for customer
information and agency promotions.
DISCUSSION
RTD and Lamar have mutually agreed to terminate and unwind the 10-year contract early, contingent
upon Board approval. If the termination is authorized by the Board, it would become effective December
1, 2025.
As part of the wind-down, RTD will pay Lamar for the amortized value of all assets it will obtain upon
termination in the amount of approximately $2,010,000. RTD will then assume ownership of all digital
signs and screens that have been deployed across the system. Additionally, due to the contract ending

RTD will use the five-month wind-down period to launch a public solicitation structured for a sustainable
path to utilizing its assets to generate advertising income. If the solicitation is successful, it is currently
anticipated that a new contract will come before the Board for consideration and approval prior to the
end of 2025.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is $2,534,655.15 and will be funded from the existing Lamar revenue accounts.

prior to December 21, 2025, RTD will return to Lamar a prorated portion of the 2025 MAG for the final
month of the contract termination, which is approximately $500,000.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
RTD and Customer Shared Commitments

October 15, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Kathleen Chandler, Vice Chair Operations, Safety, and Security Committee, Director - District F
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the March 13, 2024, meeting of the then Operations and Safety Committee, Director Harwick moved
to amend the Committee’s work plan to include a discussion on the development of a Customer Bill of
Rights. That motion, along with the Committee’s 2024–2025 work plan, was unanimously approved.
However, due to other priorities and scheduling constraints, the Committee did not address the
Customer Bill of Rights during that period.
In February 2025, the Operations, Safety, and Security (OSS) Committee adopted its 2025–2026 work
plan, again including a scheduled discussion in March 2025 regarding a Customer Bill of Rights. Due to
competing demands and turnover among participating Directors, that discussion was postponed.
In the spring of 2025, Directors Chandler and Paglieri agreed that while a discussion regarding customer
expectations of RTD was valuable, the term Customer Bill of Rights was not the most appropriate
framework. With the support of OSS Chair Ian Harwick, it was determined in July 2025 that the topic
should move forward under a revised title, RTD and Customer Shared Commitments.
Subsequently, Director Chandler collaborated with Director Paglieri and General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson to prepare a discussion item fulfilling the Committee’s work plan. That
collaboration resulted in a draft document outlining mutual commitments between RTD and its
customers, which is now presented for Committee review and discussion.
DISCUSSION
The Committee is requested to review and provide feedback on the attached draft RTD and Customer
Shared Commitments.
Discussion should focus on:
•

The content and clarity of the proposed shared commitments between the agency and its
customers

Packet Pg. 86

1.E.3

•

Whether the Board should consider adopting the document as a formal statement of expectations
and mutual responsibility

•

How and where the shared commitments should be communicated to the public to enhance
understanding and engagement

If there is consensus that further action is warranted, Director Chandler will work with GM/CEO Johnson
and the Board Office to bring forward a Recommended Action for consideration during the Board’s
November 2025 meeting cycle.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the OSS Committee’s review of the draft RTD and
Customer Shared Commitments.

Shared Commitments

Overview
Public transportation plays an essential role in connecting people, strengthening communities, and
supporting regional growth. Delivery of RTD’s bus, rail, paratransit, and microtransit services
requires a shared responsibility among the agency, its customers, and communities throughout the
Denver region. The relationship is built on trust, accountability, and mutual expectations.

Objective
The purpose of this pledge of Shared Commitments is to define the responsibilities and requirements
that guide this relationship. It outlines RTD’s purpose in delivering an optimal transit experience, as
well as highlights the roles and obligations of customers to contribute to a welcoming transit
environment.

Expectations
Public transportation is a vital public service, but access to it is not an unlimited right. RTD is
responsible for providing services that are safe, secure, reliable, and accessible, within its defined
service area and financial capacity. In return, customers are expected to adhere to RTD’s Customer
Code of Conduct, which includes paying the required fare, observing safety instructions, treating
others with respect and courtesy, and refraining from disruptive behaviors that interfere with
services.
RTD’s commitments and those of its customers are built upon mutual expectations and
reciprocal responsibilities.
