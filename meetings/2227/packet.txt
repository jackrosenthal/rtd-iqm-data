BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: December 31, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 31, 2014

Board Meeting Date: January 20, 2015

Subject:

Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at
Yale Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell
approximately 1,384 square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of
Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
BACKGROUND:
This action meets the 2015 General Manager goal of Fiscal Sustainability. The property was acquired in
December 2003 as part of the T-REX project and consisted of 46,255 square feet of vacant land at
5281 E. Yale Circle and a two level 12,600 square foot office building located on 16,614 square feet.
An eminent domain process resulting in a Certificate of Ascertainment and Report of Commissioners
issued after a three day Commission Hearing to determine value of the property acquired from Walter A.
Koebel in RTD v. Walter A. Koelbel, et al Case No. 01-CV-2025, District Court, City and County of
Denver resulted in RTD’s ownership of the property. The vacant land was determined to have a value of
$18.00 per square foot. The property was used for the development of the Yale Station and associated
park-n-Ride.
In 2011, Koelbel and Company, Mile High Development and the Urban Land Conservancy with support
from RTD developed a Transit-Oriented Master Plan for the Yale Station area including parcels of land
owned by each of the aforementioned parties.
DISCUSSION:
The Urban Land Conservancy and Yale Station Workforce Housing LLC, a joint venture of Koelbel and
Company and Mile High Development desire to acquire approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
from RTD to support their development of the Yale Station Family Apartments consisting of 66
affordable, income-restricted housing units in a four story multi-family building. Yale Station Family
Apartments will be constructed immediately west of the existing Yale Station park and ride on land
purchased from the Urban Land Conservancy through the Denver TOD Fund. Yale Station Family
Apartments will reserve 3 three-bedroom units, 18 two-bedroom units, and 45 one-bedroom units for
families earning 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of the area median income (AMI).
RTD’s sale of this small piece of undeveloped property supports the development and demonstrates
RTD’s support and cooperation in the development of transit oriented development and affordable
housing. In addition to receipt of revenue from the sale of the property, RTD has the benefit of
increased ridership at this location.
The property was appraised by Barrett D. Johnson, MAI, SRA and Brad A. Weiman, MAI, FRICS of
Integra Realty Resources in Denver in November of 2014. The property appraised at $18.79 per square
foot.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD will receive purchase price at closing, however, the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT related to acquisition of property required for the T-REX Project provided that the cost of
acquiring property would be shared on a 50/50 basis and the disposition of any property would be
shared on the same basis.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the recommended action.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing,
LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to sell 1,384 square feet of real property.
