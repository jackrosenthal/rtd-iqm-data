#### 1. Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at Yale Station

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384 square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.

Motion:                Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015 Board meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, introduced Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property.  Susan Altes pointed out that the property in discussion is a remnant of the Yale Park-n-Ride.  The property sits west of the Park-n-Ride wall.  The property boundary was uneven but the wall was built straight.  The owner of the land west to the property intends on building a 66 unit affordable housing building.  The property was appraised in November, 2014 at $18.79 per square foot.  No other parties have shown interest in acquiring the land.

Director Folska noted that the land was acquired through eminent domain.  She wondered if RTD needed to give the right of refusal to the previous owner.  Susan Altes replied that was not part of the eminent domain law.

Director Hoy said that the $26,000 proceeds from the sale would be shared with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT).  He asked if RTD’s $13,000 proceeds could be allocated, for example, to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) or if the funds had to be allocated somewhere specific.  Phil Washington, General Manager noted that the funds would probably have to go back to the general fund since they originally were a Federal grant for the T-Rex project.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, added that some amount of the proceeds would have to be set off against a future grant.  Susan Altes said that RTD would have to check with the Colorado Division of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) since they managed the T-Rex project.

Director Bagley asked why the land was not included in the original T-Rex design.  Rick Clarke explained that the land was not usable but  RTD had to buy the property as a whole.  He noted that it is not uncommon to have small areas that end up unusable during these types of projects.  Director Bagley clarified that when the Yale Park-n-Ride was designed it was known that this part of the property would not be usable.  Rick Clarke agreed and added that RTD was very lucky that someone was interested in the property.

Director Walker pointed out that this was a lot line adjustment.

Committee Chair James asked what the buyer intends to do with the property.  Susan Altes replied that they plan to use this area as the property’s entrance.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.
