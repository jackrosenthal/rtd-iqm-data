B. Recommended Actions

• Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at Yale Station
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384
square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County
of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or
$18.79 per square foot.
Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the January 20, 2015
Board meeting.
Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
introduced Susan Altes, Senior Manager for Property. Susan
Altes pointed out that the property in discussion is a remnant

of the Yale Park-n-Ride. The property sits west of the Park-nRide wall. The property boundary was uneven but the wall
was built straight. The owner of the land west to the property
intends on building a 66 unit affordable housing building. The
property was appraised in November, 2014 at $18.79 per
square foot. No other parties have shown interest in acquiring
the land.
Director Folska noted that the land was acquired through
eminent domain. She wondered if RTD needed to give the
right of refusal to the previous owner. Susan Altes replied
that was not part of the eminent domain law.
Director Hoy said that the $26,000 proceeds from the sale
would be shared with the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT). He asked if RTD’s $13,000 proceeds
could be allocated, for example, to the FasTracks Internal
Savings Account (FISA) or if the funds had to be allocated
somewhere specific. Phil Washington, General Manager noted
that the funds would probably have to go back to the general
fund since they originally were a Federal grant for the T-Rex
project. Marla Lien, General Counsel, added that some
amount of the proceeds would have to be set off against a
future grant. Susan Altes said that RTD would have to check
with the Colorado Division of the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) since they managed the T-Rex project.
Director Bagley asked why the land was not included in the
original T-Rex design. Rick Clarke explained that the land was
not usable but RTD had to buy the property as a whole. He
noted that it is not uncommon to have small areas that end up
unusable during these types of projects. Director Bagley
clarified that when the Yale Park-n-Ride was designed it was
known that this part of the property would not be usable.
Rick Clarke agreed and added that RTD was very lucky that
someone was interested in the property.
Director Walker pointed out that this was a lot line adjustment.
Committee Chair James asked what the buyer intends to do
with the property. Susan Altes replied that they plan to use
this area as the property’s entrance.
