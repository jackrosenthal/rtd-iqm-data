Recommendation for Contract Award to
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. for RFP
18FH013, On-Call Construction Materials
Testing and Inspection Services

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a Work Order contract to RockSol Consulting
Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for On-Call Construction Materials Testing and
Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four years, with four one-year options to extend the
period of performance. Funding for the initial tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding
for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goal - Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
On May 18, 2018, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals for On-Call Construction Materials Testing
and Inspection Services. The selected firm would conduct testing of construction materials that is
required within RTD specifications, and specialized inspections of construction that lies outside the
expertise of RTD staff. This work is currently performed under a previous contract that was awarded in
2008, but that contract is approaching the end of its period of performance, so it was necessary to
bring in a new firm that could perform the necessary services for upcoming projects.
The RFP included the following evaluation criteria:
1. Project Team – Weight 30%
 Qualifications and ability of professional personnel
 Experience on similar projects as a team
 Commitment of key staff members
2. Firm Capability – Weight 30%
 Firm’s ability to do project concurrent with existing and project work load
 Firm’s to provide entire spectrum of testing services identified in the Scope of Work
3. Past Performance on Similar Projects – Weight 20%
 Demonstrated ability to control costs
 Demonstrated ability to perform quality work
 Demonstrated ability to meet project schedules
4. Work Location – Weight 10%
 Ability to support projects throughout RTD’s entire District boundaries
5. Commitment to and Substantive Utilization of Disadvantaged Business Enterprises – Weight 10%
 DBE Program Plan demonstrating DBE commitment
 Identify past performance with DBE programs

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1




Demonstrate how DBE firms will be integrated into team structure
Demonstrate creative initiatives, technical support and outreach efforts for DBE
participation

Since this is an Architectural/Engineering procurement, selection was based solely on the Technical
Proposal without reference or consideration to cost.
On June 29, 2018, seven written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:
 Geocal
 Ground Engineering Consultants, Inc. and TRIAX Engineering
 Kleinfelder, Inc.
 Kumar and Associates, Inc.
 RockSol Consulting Group, Inc.
 Vine Laboratories, Inc.
 Yeh and Associates, Inc.
On July 26, 2018, the five-member selection committee met to review and score the proposals. As a
result of this meeting and by unanimous consensus, RockSol Consulting, Inc. was selected as the best
technically qualified firm.
DISCUSSION
RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. is recommended for contract award as the most technically qualified
consultant team for the following reasons:
 Project Manager is licensed Professional Engineer with 33 years experience
 Highly experienced technicians
 RockSol along with subs Vivid and ITC provide qualifications necessary to provide full spectrum
of expected services
 Capacity matrix provided available resources and commitments
 Utilization of Cost Projection Reports to track budget
 Certification to international quality management standard ISO 9001
 Team members familiar with RTD management systems such as Aconex and Quality Records
Database
 RockSol and Vivid provide two labs within the District for good coverage
 Although RockSol is a DBE, they provided a very detailed DBE Program Plan in their role as a
prime contractor for this work
Although cost was not a consideration for selection, RockSol provided a cost proposal that was
consistent with RTD’s Independent Cost Estimate. RockSol’s workscope will initially include two
upcoming projects:
 Commuter Rail Maintenance of Way Building and Related Infrastructure
 20th and Chestnut Turn Lane
DBE INVOLVEMENT
RTD specified a DBE goal of 16% for the Work to be performed under the resulting contract. Since
RockSol is a certified DBE, they have committed to exceeding the RTD goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

RTD began negotiations on August 6, 2018. We have concluded negotiations with an initial pricing of
$30,000 for the two tasks identified in Discussion. Funding for these tasks is included in the 2018
Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the budgets for the projects where these
services will be utilized.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a
contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. in the not-to-exceed amount of $5,000,000 for OnCall Construction Materials Testing and Inspection Services. This is a multi-year contract for four
years, with four one-year options to extend the period of performance. Funding for the initial
tasks is included in the 2018 Amended Budget. Funding for future tasks will be included in the
budgets for the projects where these services will be utilized.
2. Do Not Accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to RockSol Consulting Group, Inc. Rather, continue utilizing the existing
consultant contract for all testing and inspection needs. This is not recommended. Although the
Board has previously authorized an extension of this consultant’s contract through 2019 to
complete their current work on the SERE and NMRL projects, the Period of Performance including
option years is approaching its end and the recommended firm provided the best proposal going
forward.

Subject:

Authorization
for
Additional
Acquisition for Eagle P3 Project

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018
Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs and FasTracks Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties as
necessary for constructed infrastructure on the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorize staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 Goal – Task Goal #1 – Successful
Delivery of Transit Services
BACKGROUND
RTD issued an RFP for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of the Eagle P3 Commuter
Rail Project and contractually, RTD has been required to obtain possession and make available to the
contractor right of way necessary for the construction of the project. By Resolution 001 Series of
2010, Resolution 017 Series of 2011, Resolution 006, Series of 2012 and Resolution 012 Series of
2012, the Board found and determined certain property to be necessary to be acquired within the
corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose. As construction on the project was completed, it
was determined that survey work to verify location of certain constructed infrastructure should be done
and as a result of the survey work, additional property needs have been identified as required for the
project. Specific legal descriptions will be prepared beginning the formal acquisition process. This
process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court proceedings under
eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of the additional property
identified.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by survey and authorize the
General Manager and/or Project Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this right of way acquisition is included in the Eagle P3 Project budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Pass the attached resolution. It is recommended by the Eagle P3 Project Team that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying certain additional properties

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

as necessary for construction of the Eagle P3 Commuter Rail Project and authorizing staff to
proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law. Funding for this property
acquisition is included in the 2018 Amended Budget for the Eagle project.
2. Do not pass the attached resolution. This is not recommended as failure to acquire required
properties would be contrary to federal guidelines.

Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation
sheets, which list the additional properties to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the acquisition of the Properties, it may
be necessary to initiate condemnation proceedings and to obtain immediate
possession of the properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the Properties as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by

makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by
others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.

Construction Award for RFP 18 DB-001 –
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement

General

Board Meeting Date: October 16, 2018

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash LLC in the amount
not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract
is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
This Recommended Action supports the General Manager’s 2018 goals – Task Goal #3 – Asset
Management/State of Good Repair.
BACKGROUND
The Boulder maintenance and storage facility was constructed in 1978 and opened for operations in
February 1979. Original design capacity of the garage was based on 96 buses. Currently, 123 buses are
being stored and maintained including washing the busses at this facility.
DISCUSSION
The system is a two lane bus wash. The original wash was installed in 1979 and then replaced in 1995.
This new project is considered to be a full rebuild. This system has been increasingly difficult to repair as
parts are becoming obsolete. The project was advertised as an RFP. The RFP was advertised on June
14, 2018. Proposals were due on August 8, 2018. Qualifications, experience, personnel, and cost were
all a part of the award criteria. Twelve firms were originally notified of the project. Four teams ended up
on the proposers list, but only two teams submitted.
1. AutoAuto Wash LLC
AutoAuto Wash LLC – Demolition
InterClean Equipment - Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
Galloway Engineering, Inc – Engineer of Record
Security Plumbing – Plumbing
Zapplin Electrical, Inc. – Electrical
DeAndrea Concrete – Concrete
2. Gilmore Construction Corporation
Kubat – Wash Equipment Installer
NS Corporation – Bus Wash Equipment Designer & Supplier
ADK – Electrical Design Build Subcontractor
MSI – Mechanical / Plumbing Design-Build Subcontractor
ABO Group – Architect
Proposals were rated in the following manner:

1.
2.
3.
4.

Cost – 40%
Key Staff and Technical Experience – 25%
Technical Approach – 25%
Technical Innovation / Creativity – 10%

Gilmore Construction Corporation cost proposal came in at $1,174,240 and AutoAuto Wash was at
$841,111.48.
The selection committee was made up of three evaluators. The evaluators were Shayne Ford of the
Facilities Engineering Division, Anthony Romero, Boulder Maintenance Manager for Bus Operations, and
Edward Callies, Boulder Facilities Maintenance Supervisor. The evaluation meeting was held on August
22, 2018. The committee’s combined evaluations clearly identified AutoAuto Wash to be the most
qualified proposer. Their proposal was $333,129 less than Gilmore Construction Corporation and their
proposal strengths were technical approach with their proposed equipment, technical innovation,
creativity, and previous project experience with vehicle wash systems.
SBE/DBE INVOLVEMENT
There was no SBE goal set for this project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Local funding for this contract is included in the 2018 Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning, Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Funding for this contract is included in the 2018
Amended Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Re-advertise the project later in the year. Re-advertising
could gain additional competition, but could also lose competition or have no proposers.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee
to award a contract to AutoAuto Wash in the amount not-to-exceed of $841,111.48 for the
Boulder Bus Wash Replacement project. Cancel the project and utilize the funds to repair the
system as it breaks down. This is not recommended because the existing system is difficult to
repair as parts are becoming more obsolete.
