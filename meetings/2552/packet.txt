BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 29, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Local Government Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services with CRL
Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019), at a cost of
$102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices specified in the
Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors pursuant to the
Contract Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
In September 2016, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for Local Government Liaison Services. Eight
potential bidders looked at the RFP, but only one responded to this request. The procurement panel is
recommending to the Government Relations Committee the selection of CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s
Local Government Liaison with the elected officials and staff of the cities and counties of the Denver
metropolitan area, as well as the business community and economic development organizations. This
team has broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns, as well as an extensive network of
relationships with local governments, elected officials, and stakeholders along the Front Range. The
proposal was submitted for the period of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, with the
potential for two (2) one-year option periods. The Government Relations Committee will make future
annual recommendations to the Board of Directors at the end of each contract period regarding the
exercise of future option periods.
DISCUSSION
CRL Associates, Inc. as RTD’s Local Government Liaison maintains contact with the elected officials and
staff of the cities and counties of the Denver metropolitan area, as well as the business community and
economic development organizations. This team has a broad knowledge of RTD’s needs and concerns,
as well as an extensive network of relationships with local governments, elected officials, and
stakeholders along the Front Range.
As part of the Local Government Liaison services, frequent contact will be made with RTD staff and the
Chairman of the Board to ascertain a coordinated plan to monitor and report on activities at the city and
county levels of government. In addition, as part of the coordinated plan, CRL will provide regular
outreach to the business community and economic development organizations in the Metro area to
develop partnerships and garner feedback on RTD issues of concern.
CRL will represent RTD at meetings at the local level of government and provide professional advice,
counsel, and analysis of issues regarding local government activities as they relate to RTD. CRL will also
provide Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) liaison services.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2017 is included in the annual budget and future years will be included in the respective
annual budgets.

1.C.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to enter into Contract No. 16-DO-025 for Local Government Liaison services
with CRL Associates, Inc. (CRL) for three years (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019),
at a cost of $102,000 per year, and for two (2) additional one-year options to renew at prices
specified in the Contract, each option period contingent upon approval by the Board of Directors
pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. A new Request for Proposals could be sent to
interested parties, and a new Local Government Liaison firm could be retained. This action is not
recommended because CRL Associates, Inc. has been very effective in assisting RTD with local
government matters in the past, and this group is very familiar with RTD’s issues and policies.
This option is also not recommended because a valid RFP process was utilized for this
procurement.

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 29, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 29, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

Federal Liaison Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the RTD Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for federal liaison services with Squire Patton
Boggs LLP to exercise a one-year option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) to extend
Contract No. 14-DX-001, at a cost of $264,000. Funding for this contract is included in the 2017
budget.
BACKGROUND
A solicitation for proposals for Federal Liaison Services was issued on August 12, 2014. This
solicitation was a Best Value Procurement where technical factors and cost were all considered. Ten
responsive proposals were received, and they were evaluated by a five-member evaluation committee
that recommended Squire Patton Boggs LLP. The recommendation of the evaluation committee was
subsequently referred to the Government Relations Committee on November 11, 2014.
The
Government Relations Committee recommended that Squire Patton Boggs LLP be offered a new contract
for a five-year period. Squire Patton Boggs has been RTD’s federal lobbyist since 2000 and has assisted
in RTD’s receiving over $2.5 billion in federal grants and loans. In addition to constant monitoring of
Congressional and Executive Branch activities, status reports are issued and special reports are prepared
when significant events occur in the federal government.
DISCUSSION
Constant monitoring of federal legislative activities that relate to RTD is required, and RTD’s interests
must be conveyed to appropriate members of Congress, including the Colorado delegation and other key
Congressional committee members. The Squire Patton Boggs team has excellent rapport and respect
from the Colorado delegation and serves as a resource for the delegation staff. When RTD has a Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) in place as it now does (Eagle P3 Project), the annual appropriations
process requires intense attention to committee hearings and to the status of the Congressional budget
process. In addition, in 2016 RTD received a $92 million Full Funding Grant Agreement for the
Southeast Rail Extension (SERE), which entailed extensive contacts with the Colorado Congressional
delegation. Significant lobbying efforts were required to follow the steps to ensure being awarded the
annual appropriations in the current Eagle P3 FFGA, as well as procuring the SERE FFGA.
The MAP-21 Continuing Resolution expired on May 31, 2015, and the federal lobbyists played a key role
in representing RTD’s needs in the new authorization bill—Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act
(FAST Act). With the build out of FasTracks, the lobbyists will need to be especially attentive to the
federal financing needs for the unfunded corridors, and they will monitor the possibility of new funding
sources in the FAST Act and advocate for RTD’s best interests.
In addition to helping with Congressional activities, assistance is also necessary with the Executive
Branch of the federal government, including the Department of Transportation (the Federal Transit
Administration and the Federal Railroad Administration). Squire Patton Boggs provides guidance and
assistance in applying for and receiving federal funds from the Department of Transportation.

Packet Pg. 52

1.C.2

For the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference in March each year,
Squire Patton Boggs staff advises which offices are critical to visit or are of relevant interest for
board/staff visits. Then, the Squire Patton Boggs team sets the meeting times on behalf of RTD.
The Denver office of Squire Patton Boggs serves as important advisory role in RTD’s connection to
relevant national personnel and issues. In addition, annually, or as required, meetings with the Board of
Directors are also held.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Government Relations Committee’s Recommended Action to exercise a one-year
option (January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017) at a cost of $264,000 ($22,000 per
month) with Squire Patton Boggs LLP.
2. Continue the contract on a month-to-month basis, if amenable to the current Contractor
(Squire Patton Boggs LLP). This option is not recommended because continuity and stability
in liaison services is an important consideration.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action and issue a new Request for Proposals (RFP) for
Federal Liaison Services. This option is not recommended because RTD’s RFP process was
properly utilized for this procurement.

Local Government Relations Update

The following are items for December 6, 2016:
1. November Election Results – In addition to the RTD elections, local elections were held

in Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Douglas and Jefferson Counties, as well as the Town of
Parker. Four new commissioners were elected. Eleven officials were re-elected. Attached
is a contact list of those elected and re-elected in November.
2. MPACT64 – The Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) and the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) are reconvening the MPACT64 coalition on December 8th to
discuss transportation funding needs and possible solutions. This meeting will “pick up
where they left off” to see if there is a formula that could unite our urban, mountain and
rural areas around a statewide funding proposal. As you may recall, MPACT64 was
originally comprised of four regional organizations that collectively span Colorado’s 64
counties: MMC, Progressive 15, Action 22 and Club 20. In 2012, MPACT64 adopted a
series of Transportation Principles to address mobility needs in Colorado’s rural, resort
and urban communities. Polling at the time indicated insufficient support to move
forward with a new funding measure.
3. Transportation Funding – In addition to the MPACT64 meeting, several stakeholder,
business and industry groups are actively meeting to discuss transportation/transit needs.
These groups are working with legislative leaders to evaluate various funding options,
discuss how new revenue might be allocated, and assess the viability for voter approval.
Since much of this is occurring “under the dome”, CRL is staying closely coordinated
with Brandeberry McKenna regarding implications to RTD.
4. Metro Mayors Caucus Annual Retreat – The MMC will hold its annual retreat on January
14, 2017. The agenda is not finalized, but certainly will include discussions about
transportation/transit funding and next steps.

issues in Washington?
• Lame Duck session:
• Only one of the 12 spending bills has been passed for the fiscal year that

started on October 1. Federal government agencies and programs are
operating under a short-term spending bill (a “CR”) that expires on
December 9.

• Republican-led House and Senate are waiting out Obama’s final weeks in

office; with no incentive to compromise, few bills expected to be passed
– funding for Flint water crisis, national defense.

• Fiscal Year 2017 Transportation/HUD Appropriations Bill:
• Controls funding for New Starts projects, TIGER program for FY 2017.
• Under any CR: short-term extension of FY 2016 levels for transit

formula programs under the FAST Act; no discretionary grant
awards.

• A big infrastructure bill in first 100 days of the next Congress?

FY 2017 Appropriations Outlook
• Deadline: Members of Congress are eager to pass another spending bill
before December 9 deadline.
• Another CR: House and Senate Appropriations Committees negotiating
another short-term spending bill – through to the Spring – to allow the
incoming Trump Administration to have the final say in FY 2017 spending
priorities.
• Final transportation spending levels next Spring: House and Senate 2017
THUD bills both fully fund transit and highway formula programs at their
FY 2017 FAST Act levels.
• TIGER funding: House $450 million, Senate at $525 (FY 2016 TIGER

was $500 million)

• New Starts funding: House $2.50 billion, Senate $2.338 billion (both

above $2.302 billion FY 2017 FAST Act authorization for New Starts)

What does this mean for New Starts funding?
• RTD’s FY 2017 New Starts request:
• $167 million for Eagle P3 FFGA

• President’s FY 2017 budget:
• $175 million for Eagle P3 FFGA

• Pending House and Senate FY 2017 THUD appropriations bills: Both fund the
Eagle project at $150 million.
• US DOT will not award grants in discretionary programs (programs in the

control of the Appropriators) in the absence of a full-year spending bill.

• Bottom Line: Likely that no FY 2017 New Starts funding will be awarded until

after an omnibus spending bill is enacted in the Spring.

Trump’s Infrastructure Proposal
• Much speculation, few specifics.
• Timing: Trump wants to see an infrastructure bill advance early in the next

Congress. Pelosi, other Democrats, have signaled general support for increased
infrastructure funding.

• Revenues gained through tax reform: One-time funding through taxation of all

revenues ($2.6 billion) of US companies held overseas: “deemed” repatriation.

• Finance: tax credit for private investors in infrastructure projects. Funding

component, too?

• Equity investors support a small fraction of transit projects, so tax credit only

part of the solution.

• Infrastructure package should include grant funding; sent out to States

through FAST Act formula programs?

• Regulatory reform: reducing or eliminating burdensome regulations.

Opportunity for HTF Revenue Solution?
• Any infrastructure bill will attract policy riders, large and small.
• Long-sought Highway Trust Fund revenue solution?
• Closing the gap between spending levels and dedicated HTF revenues seen

as “unfinished business” after FAST Act.

• But surface transportation funding is not a must-pass bill:
• FAST Act funds surface transportation programs through 2020.
• Other Trump priorities: trade, immigration could take precedence.
• Competing transportation priorities in FY 2017: FAA reauthorization.
• Some Republicans want to use tax reform only to lower rates, not for new

spending.

• Same politically difficult revenue options: taxes on gasoline, oil and gas

production, vehicle-miles traveled.

• Return of earmarks could enable support for revenue increase for HTF.

Transit Programs in a Trump US DOT
• FAST Act in place through FY 2020:
• Second year into 5-year authorization governing overall funding levels,

transit’s share of HTF revenues, major policies and programs.

• So major changes not expected immediately in surface transportation
programs.
• Transit’s place in the Highway Trust Fund?
• While Republican Party platform does not support dedicated HTF revenues

for transit, Trump (www.greatagain.gov) appears supportive of federal
funding for transit.

• Regulatory reform is likely:
• Streamline/reduce environmental requirements for projects
• Two-man crew rulemaking is vulnerable (Congressional Review Act, if

finalized by Obama US DOT)

• Strong support for Buy America
