BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: August 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

August 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 2nd year 2014 option
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 33DM005

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to
initiate the second year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter
Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment
is provided by the annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.
BACKGROUND
This action will address the General Manager’s 2015 goal of improving service delivery including
developing a cost-loaded, multi-year maintenance, repair and replacement schedule. This contract is an
on-call contract that performs street improvements, installs bus shelters and is available to perform
emergency repairs on short notice.
Due to the repetitive nature of this contract, a three-year option contract was determined to be an
effective way to manage this work for the District. Bids were received and a contract was awarded to
Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in September of 2013. The
current base contract value and amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
first year (base year), 2013
$ 354,061.25
$150,000.00
$504,061.25
second year, 2014 (option)
$ 371,711.30
0.00
$371,711.30
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and 2nd year option =
$875,772.55
DISCUSSION
This second year amendment option would increase the contract by $371,711.30, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $875,772.55.
RTD Engineering develops a specific list of street improvements and shelter installations for the year.
Street improvements are related to specific locations where repairs are related to bus traffic. Locations
are determined through inspections by Engineering, reports from Bus Operations or input from local
jurisdictions. This input is evaluated and a priority list is developed.
Bus shelters are installed consistent with the program presented to the Board in August 2014. It is also
desirable to have an on-call contractor available when an unexpected emergency repair needs to be
performed on an immediate basis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Estimated $371,711.30 budget shall come from the 2014 and 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets
dependent on the calendar year in which the work is performed.

DBE GOAL
Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year of a three-year
option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion
Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by the
annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.
2.

Delay the recommended action. This is not recommended as it will delay the construction of
projects that have been identified for repairs and impact coordination efforts with various
jurisdictions.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year of
a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract
with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s
construction work. This is not recommended because:
a.
b.
c.
d.

It would create a delay in constructing the 2014 -2015 street improvements.
The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
The 2014 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
The district desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.
