### 2. Recommended Actions

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, indicated that the first four items were housekeeping items.  He said that each of the four projects were included in the 2017 Adopted Budget.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move the first four items on the Agenda to the full Board at the December 20, 2016, Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Committee Chair Anderson stated that it was moved to combine the first four items for approval at the same time.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, commented that as long as there were no objections by the Board, the four items could be moved together.

Director Francone asked how the van pools were operating and if staff had performance statistics.

Bruce Abel remarked that the van pool has grown from 10 to 122.  He added that staff subjects those to the same analytics of subsidy per passenger and the van pool is one of RTD’s best performing services.

Director Francone inquired if staff had a customer service metric for the 5311.

Bruce Abel stated that 5311 is a moniker that comes from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) legislation regarding rural service.  He added that staff does have metrics, and the performance would be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND

Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, on-going service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.

As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute distances.

DISCUSSION

RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001.  The vanpool program had previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to 122 active vans.

In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.  DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan areas.  After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program.  VPSI took over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.

DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold.  For comparison, the subsidy per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

#### 2. 5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County, Adams County and Jefferson County.  These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND

The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized, or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).

Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District.  RTD has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties since 1993.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017.  RTD shall also contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.

RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.

These Agreements will be for a period of one year.  5311 performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the funding agreements is warranted.  Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards.  If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance.  The provision of 5311 service in 2015  resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately $5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

#### 3. Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTIONIt is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND

The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.

RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.

The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays.  In addition, Night HOP service is provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately 2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  HOP performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the HOP service were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Boulder for the HOP circulator bus service so that the City of Boulder can continue to provide this service to the residents, students and businesses in the City of Boulder.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the heavily-used HOP circulator service.

#### 4. Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND

In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) Grant for a circulator bus service.  This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007.  CMAQ funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the City of Englewood contributed 10%.  The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service.  In September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations.  The City of Englewood continues the management and marketing of the art shuttle.  The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.   The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD fare.

The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays.  There is no service on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.  The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15) minute frequency.  Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION

RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017

This Agreement will be for a period of one year.  The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted.  Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.  The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29.  For comparison, the boardings for RTD local fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding. The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget.  Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

1.                Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents, visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.

2.              Do not approve the cost sharing agreement.  This course of action is not recommended as it may result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.

#### 1. Authorization to enter into contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers (16DR004)

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Anderson declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Code of Conduct for Persons on RTD Vehicles and Property

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Code of Conduct for persons on RTD vehicles and property.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 20, 2016, Board Meeting.

Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Director Deadwyler asked who would enforce the code of conduct.

Rolf Asphaug indicated that most of these items were common sense items that people know not to do anyway.  He said that a bus or rail operator would contact transit security should an issue occur.

Director Deadwyler inquired if there might be a situation where bus or rail operators would try to enforce the code of conduct.

Rolf Asphaug stated that bus and rail operators would not enforce the code of conduct, but they might offer a gentle reminder.

Director Deadwyler asked how staff will inform RTD’s ridership about the code of conduct once it is passed by the Board before it goes into effect.

Rolf Asphaug noted that RTD’s Leadership Academy has been working on a marketing campaign to promote the code of conduct.

Rolf Asphaug added that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had two minor changes to the code of conduct: Item 15 would now read as “Distributing or posting handbills in RTD vehicles, or on RTD property or vehicles parked on RTD property” and Item 21 would now read as “Engaging in activities not authorized by RTD’s Facilities Use Policy”.

Steve Martingano, Transit Policy Commander and Fare Enforcement Officer, stated that RTD has reached out to the Homeless Coalition and we provided them with a copy of the new Code of Conduct.  He stated that they did not request any changes, but they did provide staff with locations to place the Code of Conduct pamphlets so that people can easily access them.  He noted that the majority of the public are already adhering to the Code of Conduct, but the written document is for security to show in case they are asked to prove something in writing.

Committee Chair Anderson asked the mover and the seconder if they would accept the two minor changes suggested by Rolf Asphaug.  Directors Deadwyler and Chair Tobiassen said yes.

Director Francone inquired about RTD’s policy for expressive speech.

Rolf Asphaug stated that RTD’s policy for expressive speech was approved several years ago and it allows for expressive activities.  The only exception is expressive activities may not occur in interior spaces.  He noted that generally, the policy is supportive of first amendment activities because it is very broad and applied with a light touch, and so far, people have been okay with it.

Director Deadwyler asked if a smoking section had been created on RTD property.

Rolf Asphaug indicated that RTD does not have the rights at our bus stops to tell people they can or cannot smoke.  He stated that for a typical location in Denver, RTD does not regulate smoking unless it is within 15 feet of an interior space.

Director Bagley asked when staff could post signs at the Littleton and Mineral light rail stations to inform passengers that smoking is prohibited.

Rolf Asphaug commented that staff would have to come back to the Board with more information for that particular item.

Director Bagley stated that RTD needs to protect its property from cigarette litter that is not covered by local jurisdictions.

Director Bagley inquired about item 23 and the use of light rail boarding ramps.  He stated that the Code of Conduct says the ramps are not for patrons with luggage, bicycles or shopping carts.  He asked if someone had a 50-pound suitcase, how will they get on to the light rail train.

Rolf Asphaug noted the intent of item 23 is to demonstrate that the ramps are meant for and the priority is given to disabled passengers, except with operator permission.  He said the ramps can be used for other purposes, but the priority must be given to ADA passengers.

Director Menten noted she was happy that staff reached out to the ACLU.  She stated that item 20 was not addressed by the ACLU and the Board should strike out Soliciting, Petitioning or otherwise.

Director Menten requested that the motion be amended so that item 20 would read as “Engaging in unwanted conversation with any other person while such person is a captive audience (i.e., standing in line for a vehicle, or while riding a vehicle)”.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Committee Chair Anderson stated there was a motion and a second to amend.

Director Francone remarked that she has had personal experience with being harassed on a light rail car and while she is not opposed to Director Menten’s amendment, she thinks the language should be left as is.

Director Deadwyler commented that she is okay with removing petitioning, but soliciting needs to stay.

Director Walker said he is opposed to any change to this item as it represents a specific type of activity at a specific point of time.  He said that item 20 does not infringe on anyone’s first amendment rights.

Director Bagley noted that he preferred the specificity of item 20 and both petitioning and soliciting should stay.

Director Menten stated she would accept keeping soliciting as long as petitioning was removed.

Steve Martingano added that Denver has an aggressive panhandling law.  He said if the language is kept as is, it would be useful for educational purposes.

Committee Chair Anderson called for the vote on Director Menten’s amendment to the motion to remove petitioning, and keeping soliciing so that item 20 says, “Soliciting, or engaging in unwanted conversation with any other person while such person is a captive audience (i.e., standing in line for a vehicle, or while riding a vehicle)”

Vote on Amendment to the Motion:

Vote on Amendment to Item 20

Director Lasater asked why item 23 did not include strollers.  He stated that the ramps should not be used by patrons with strollers.

Rolf Asphaug commented that patrons with ADA strollers would have priority use of the ramps, but they are not intended for non-ADA strollers.  He added that RTD has provisions for strollers in the Trailblazer, and stroller issues should be addressed on a case by case basis by the vehicle operator.

Director Sisk stated he has an issue with item 13 concerning eating on any RTD vehicle.  He said item 13 prohibits any eating, and he has serious concerns with where staff and the Board is going with candy bars and candy.  He noted that littering, including spilled foods and liquids are covered in item 16.

Rolf Asphaug remarked that right now, buses say no eating.  Trailblazer’s say there is to be no eating on RTD vehicles.  He noted that as a practical matter, it will not be an issue if someone pulls out a lifesaver or lozenge.

Director Folska said that when she was going to school, her commute was two hours each way.  She asked why the buses and trains do not have garbage receptacles to collect litter.  She said there are people who are diabetics who need to eat, and young children need to eat too.

Rolf Asphaug indicated that no one would bother someone who is feeding their child.  He added that garbage receptacles in vehicles would be a security concern, and the various departments would not want to start having to clean garbage out of trains or busses.

Vote on Main Motion:

#### 3. Change in language item 20 Leave soliciting

#### 4. Amendment 1 Friendly ATU

#### 1. L Line Service Proposal Planning and Operations

Bruce Abel said the first update is to provide information to the Board.  He stated that staff is evaluating a new concept and service, the L Line.  He noted that it will bifurcate the D Line to create a downtown loop.

Eric Miller, Senior Rail Service Planner/Scheduler, indicated that the L Line would run on a loop making transfers to other lines possible.  He stated that the L Line will fit into other changes within the system.  He commented that the next steps will be to work on the equity analysis and Welton Survey later this year.

Bruce Abel noted that the service change process for May 2017 is ambitious and as of right now, this is only a concept that staff is proposing.  He said that this is not a definite service change.

Director Bagley said he is in favor of moving forward with this as it is an improvement of service, and it will save RTD money.

Director Lubow asked if there would be any cost involved in starting this new service.

Bruce Abel remarked that there would need to be improvements to switches, but there would not be any new construction.

General Manager Genova added that this is a service plan change, so the costs would come from the Base System.

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, indicated that costs would be under $100,000.  He said that staff would need parts, materials and updates to the switches.

Bruce Abel noted that this service is not intended to replace the central connector.  He said this is to improve the current system, and if all goes well, service could begin with the August Run Board.

##### a. L Line Service Proposal Planning and Operations 12-7-2016

#### 2. Eagle Review (no back-up)

General Manager Genova said that yesterday he, along with Greg Straight, Henry Stopplecamp, Mike Meader and Denver Transit Partners staff (DPT) were in Washington D.C. to meeting with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA).  He said that staff presented a progress report on the At Grade crossings and most of the items on the progress report have been completed.  He said a full update will be provided to the Board tomorrow during the lunch and learn.

#### 3. Olde Town Arvada Service Update (no back-up)

Bruce Abel stated that bus service from Olde Town Arvada to Union Station will begin on Sunday, December 18th.  He said service will be operated by Rambling Express via the Charter Authorization and funding which was approved at the November Board meeting.  He stated that Rambling will operate the service until the January Run Board at which point in time staff will examine if we can operate that service internally.

#### 4. Lost Service Hours Review 12 13 16

Committee Chair Anderson indicated that the next seven items were reports that the Board had included in their packets for review.  She asked if there were any questions.

### 6. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 8:56 p.m.
