DRCOG Vanpool Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into an
Agreement with the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) to provide RTD support for the
DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program in the Denver metropolitan area. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and shall be in an amount not to exceed $1,058,600.

BACKGROUND
Vanpooling is a transportation option in which commuters/employees whose residences are
geographically clustered ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven and maintained
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically, the vans carry from six (6) to twelve (12) riders and are
provided by the vanpool program. Vanpools are organized to be sustainable and to render regular, ongoing service to vanpool members on a break-even, cost sharing, fare basis. Vanpools eliminate the costs
associated with dedicated drivers and expensive equipment.
As a transportation mode, vanpools provide personalized transportation at low cost and offer greater
opportunities for increased capacity as compared to carpooling. Vanpools also offer a cost-effective
alternative to conventional transit service in areas of low population density and longer commute
distances.

DISCUSSION
RTD has supported the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program since 2001. The vanpool program had
previously experienced limited participation due to perceived high fares, insufficient funding for van
acquisition, difficulties in recruiting drivers, and the lack of funding to support necessary marketing
activities. In order to help overcome these barriers, the RTD and the DRCOG entered into a partnership in
April of 2001 to expand vanpool service in the Denver metropolitan area. In doing so, RTD and DRCOG
believed that the organizations could make meaningful advances toward meeting shared goals of offering
desirable mobility options, reducing traffic congestion, and improving air quality in the Denver
metropolitan area. Benefits for RTD include substantial cost savings from avoidance and/or replacement
of marginal bus routes with vanpools. Benefits to both RTD and DRCOG include complementary
marketing programs and increased commuter transportation alternatives.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

RTD financial support is used to help underwrite the vanpool pricing structure in order to make vanpool
fares more competitive in the transportation marketplace. By subsidizing vanpool fares, vanpools are able
to compete with other transit alternatives and are perceived as a more attractive alternative for area
commuters. In addition, RTD support is used to provide incentives to attract and retain vanpool drivers
and to provide capital funding to acquire necessary rolling stock to provide vanpool services. Since the
advent of RTD support for the vanpool program in late 2001, the number of vans has grown from 11 to
122 active vans.
In 2009 the vanpool program became difficult to manage due to a shortage of DRCOG personnel.
DRCOG looked outside their agency at private companies operating vanpool services in other metropolitan
areas. After a competitive bid process, DRCOG choose VPSI to operate the vanpool program. VPSI took
over all operating aspects of the vanpool program. Currently the vanpools carry an average of 5.4 riders
per van and the fleet is at 76% capacity.
DRCOG vanpool performance through October in 2016 (thru the 3rd Qtr) resulted in an RTD subsidy per
passenger seat used of approximately $4.52 and $2.94 for each seat sold. For comparison, the subsidy
per passenger for RTD fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of $3.66 subsidy per
passenger for CBD local routes to an average of $7.18 subsidy per passenger for suburban local service
and an average of $5.17 subsidy per passenger for regional service.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the DRCOG Van pool program are budgeted in the approved 2017 budget.
Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the financial support of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool service in order to continue to
provide and expand this transportation option for residents of the Denver metropolitan area who
work/commute in the Denver metropolitan area.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the DRCOG Way to Go vanpool program which would
result in an increase in single occupant commuting.

Board Meeting Date: December 20, 2016

Subject:

5311 Agreements

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into
funding agreements with Via Mobility Services and the Seniors’ Resource Center to provide RTD
financial support for the provision of FTA Section 5311 (non-urbanized) services for Boulder County,
Adams County and Jefferson County. These Agreements are for calendar year 2017 and for amounts
not to exceed $372,232.00 for Boulder County, $366.026.00 for Adams County and $113,411.00 for
Jefferson County.

BACKGROUND
The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEALU), along with previous transit legislation, provides for the funding of transit services in non-urbanized,
or rural, areas. The section of the Act that addresses the provision of services in non-urbanized areas is
Section 5311 and thus these services are often referred to as “5311 service.” In 2013, SAFETEA-LU
provisions moved under the new Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21).
Since 1991, RTD has provided funding to various private, non-profit agencies to assist with the
provision of transit services in non-urbanized areas of the District and to provide local match money for
federal grant funds to support the provision of 5311 services in the District. RTD has provided
financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Jefferson County since 1991 and has
provided financial assistance for the provision of non-urbanized service in Adams and Boulder Counties
since 1993.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services
in Boulder County in an amount not to exceed $372,232.00 in 2017. RTD shall also contribute
funding to Via Mobility Services to support the provision of non-urbanized services in Adams County in
amount not to exceed $366,026.00 in 2017.
RTD shall contribute funding to Seniors’ Resource Center to support the provision of non-urbanized
services in Jefferson County in an amount not to exceed $113,411.00.00 in 2017.
These Agreements will be for a period of one year. 5311 performance will be assessed at the end of
the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if continuation of
the funding agreements is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service
standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and the affected
party(s) will confer on modifications needed to bring it into conformance. The provision of 5311
service in 2015 resulted in monthly performance that ranged from 1.6 to 2.2 passengers per hour

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

and an RTD subsidy per passenger boarding ranging from approximately $1.29 to approximately
$5.59 (subsidy reflects only the RTD contribution). As a comparison, RTD Call-n-Ride monthly
performance averaged 4.0 passengers per hour in 2015 while RTD Access-a-Ride service performs at
approximately 1.2 passengers per hour. Call-n-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger
boarding of $19.26 and Access-a-Ride performed at an average subsidy per passenger trip of
approximately $42.92 in 2015.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the 5311 services were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. This
Agreement will be for a period of one year. Nothing herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this
Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the 5311 cost sharing agreements with Via Mobility Services and Seniors’ Resource
Center so that these organizations can continue to provide transit services to individuals in the
non-urbanized, rural areas of Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of transit services in the non-urbanized, rural areas of
Boulder, Adams, and Jefferson counties.

Hop Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Cost Sharing Agreement with the City of Boulder to provide RTD financial support for the operation of
the HOP circulator bus service in the commercial areas of the City of Boulder, the University of
Colorado at Boulder and adjacent business and residential areas. This agreement is for calendar year
2017 and is for an amount not to exceed $1,454,514.00.

BACKGROUND
The City of Boulder has funded and provided circulator bus service, known as the HOP, within the City
of Boulder since October of 1994. This service provides mobility and access to the commercial areas of
the city, the University of Colorado at Boulder, and adjacent business and residential developments.
RTD also provides extensive bus service to/from and within the City of Boulder. RTD and the City of
Boulder have worked together to assure that these services are complementary and work together to
provide attractive and effective transit service for people living, studying and working in the area.
The HOP currently operates from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on weekdays, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 PM on
Saturdays, and from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM on Sundays and holidays. In addition, Night HOP service is
provided and funded entirely by the University of Colorado. Currently, the HOP provides approximately
2,800 passenger trips per weekday.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Boulder to support the operation of the HOP in an amount
not to exceed $1,454,514.00 in 2017. This Agreement will be for a period of one year. HOP
performance will be assessed at the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have
been met and to determine if continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will
be evaluated in terms of RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance does not
warrant continuation, RTD and the City of Boulder will confer on modifications to the service in order
to bring it into conformance. The provision of HOP service through 3rd Quarter in 2016 resulted in 24.3
passengers per hour and an RTD subsidy per HOP passenger trip of $1.77. For comparison, the
boardings for RTD local fixed route service in 2015 ranged from an average of 32.6 boardings per hour
for CBD local routes to an average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service.

Art Shuttle Cost Share Agreement

RECOMMENDED ACTION
RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2017 and is for
an amount not to exceed $311,356.00.

BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the management
and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related expenses.
The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood. The City of
Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged a RTD
fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 636.0 boardings per day or 25.5 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD will contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $311,356 in 2017
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2015 resulted in 25.5 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.29. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route suburban service in 2015 was 17.7 boardings per hour with a subsidy of $7.18 per boarding.
The City of Englewood will continue to pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2017 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES

Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.

Authorization to enter into contract with
Nordco Mobile Railcar Movers (16DR004)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar
Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00.
BACKGROUND:
When RTD prepared to open the first Light Rail line in 1994, we purchased a 1984 Mercedes-Benz
Unimog to move single LRVs in rail yards and on rail lines that did not yet have overhead power. This
type of vehicle was the Industry standard for moving LRVs in rail yards across the country. RTD also
used this vehicle to tow LRVs on new lines for clearance and overhead wire position testing. RTD
learned that the Unimog was not large enough to efficiently and safely tow our 88,000 lb. LRV’s on 6%
percent grades and the tight curves that exist on our rail lines. Having a Brakeman on board the LRV is
the only way to tow safely and still doesn’t solve the lack of towing effort needed to go up steep
grades.
RTD initially issued a Request for Proposals on August 26, 2016. Evaluative criteria were cost- 50%,
conformance with specifications- 30%, supplier’s history and proven track record with this equipment10%, and quality of references- 10%. RTD’s evaluation committee consisted of Robbie Hunter, Senior
Equipment Engineer; Phil Eberl, General Superintendent, LRV Maintenance; Tim Walker, Manager, LRV
Maintenance; and Leo Fautsch, Senior Buyer.
RTD received two proposals; one from Nordco and one from Colmar. The evaluation committee
recommends Nordco, the proposer that met our specification and was the only one that met our
evaluation criteria.
DISCUSSION:
A larger rail car mover is the only feasible way to recover trains from the mainline and to tow LRVs. This
mover will also be used by our Maintenance of Way group to tow their ballast car as needed. The
proposed mover could retrieve two to four LRVs at a time.
It will have a 30,000lb winch installed to aid in derailment retrievals and couplers for LRV retrieval. Most
Light Rail properties in the U.S. have a larger LRV mover capable of towing multiple LRVs in the event of
a major accident or power failure on the line in order to recover their trains and return them to the rail
yard.
The existing Unimog is obsolete, undersized and almost impossible to purchase parts for due to its age.
A newer model of the same vehicle is not available in the U.S. due to EPA regulations. The proposed
vehicle exceeds the tractive effort (pulling power) of common Track Mobiles.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of the Recovery Vehicle is in the Rail Operations capital budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract with Nordco Mobile Railcar

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.5

Movers for the purchase of a LRV Recovery Vehicle in the amount of $550,360.00. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute a contract with Nordco for
purchase of a Railcar Mover. This action would result in RTD’s inability to efficiently and safely
retrieve LRVs on rail lines absent of overhead power and could not be shared by MOW for the
movement of their ballast car. This is not the recommended action as it would not allow us to
improve our ability to efficiently move or recover LRVs on dead track sections.

Code of Conduct for Persons on RTD Vehicles
and Property

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Code of Conduct for persons on RTD vehicles and property.
BACKGROUND:
Since its founding, RTD has not had a written code of conduct that describes acceptable behavior for
individuals on RTD vehicles and property. Many other transit agencies including Los Angeles, Atlanta,
Dallas, and New York City have such codes to promote public safety, health, and peace. Codes help
passengers and visitors understand acceptable behavior, and help transit agencies communicate and, if
necessary, enforce such behavior.
A 2016 RTD Leadership Academy group has been working on a campaign to educate RTD users on
courtesy to fellow passengers, to help make everyone’s ride more enjoyable. While working on this
project the Leadership Academy group identified the need for RTD to have a formal Code of Conduct.
RTD currently has a Facilities Use Policy posted on RTD’s website. However, that policy applies solely to
RTD real property, and focuses mainly on commercial activity and First Amendment issues concerning
non-commercial activity. RTD’s Trailblazer contains requirements for passenger conduct, but the
Trailblazer is an operator’s guide, not instructions to the public. Historically, verbal guidance and
directions from RTD security and staff have sufficed to maintain acceptable behavior, but recently RTD
Transit Police officers have been challenged to “show me the rule” when they ask patrons to refrain
from disruptive activities. The attached Code of Conduct will provide clear and consistent answers and
guidance to RTD Transit Police, other RTD staff, and RTD patrons.
The Code has been written to avoid infringing on the public’s First Amendment rights, and to respect the
rights of disabled persons under the Americans with Disabilities Act. For example, the Code restricts
disruptively loud noises or unsanitary practices, but does not try to regulate what people say or wear.
The Code also emphasizes that it is subject to reasonable modification if otherwise prohibited conduct is
due to a disability, and directs RTD staff to consult with RTD Dispatch or Security for advice in such
cases.
The Code reflects that RTD does not intend to use it to punish violations. Instead, RTD will continue to
enforce its standards of behavior in a compassionate and sensible manner, with an emphasis on
education and warnings whenever it is practicable to do so. If a patron violates the Code and refuses to
stop even after a warning, or in extreme cases where immediate action must be taken without a prior
warning, the Code will aid RTD Transit Police and other staff to direct the patron to leave the premises
or face trespassing charges.

Packet Pg. 13

1.B.6

The Code does not alter or replace existing applicable laws, such as criminal violations for “Endangering
Public Transportation,” “Hindering Public Transportation,” and assault.
RTD has developed the Code after review of similar codes by peer transit agencies including those
mentioned above, and with input from the Senior Leadership Team, RTD’s Civil Rights Division, and
other RTD staff. An initial draft of the Code was provided to the Operations Committee on November 1,
2016 for review and comment. The Code has also undergone substantial outreach with stakeholder
groups, including input sought from the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, the Colorado CrossDisability Coalition, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Downtown Denver Business Improvement
District, and other local entities. Numerous suggestions by these groups have been included in the final
draft.
Rollout, education and publicity on the Code is anticipated to be done in conjunction with the Leadership
Academy education program.
The Code will be posted on RTD’s website and made available in pamphlet form, and RTD security and
operations staff will be trained in its provisions and enforcement. RTD staff will also educate individuals
on the Code while performing ongoing security, operations and maintenance functions.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The cost to implement the Code of Conduct will be very minimal, and a Code will help protect RTD
against legal claims based on arbitrary RTD conduct.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is
recommended, because RTD staff needs a comprehensive code of conduct to educate the public
and, if necessary, enforce appropriate behavior.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and do not approve the attached Code of Conduct. This is not
recommended, since RTD will continue to have no written, easy to find, and easy to apply rules
governing behavior of RTD passengers and others; and legal challenges may be filed against RTD
staff issuing directives not based on written policies.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: December 8, 2016

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

December 8, 2016

Board Meeting Date: December 13, 2016

Subject:

2016 3rd Quarter Contracted Fixed Route
Report

The following is a discussion of the performance measures for the third quarter of 2016 for the fixedroute services provided by private contractors:


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle
Accidents per 100,000 miles in the 3rd quarter. First Transit and Transdev continue to utilize bus
operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. The
contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at monthly safety meetings, through
periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles in
the 3rd quarter. First Transit Longmont continues to make progress in this performance measure
by decreasing their passenger accident ratio from 0.28 during the 2nd quarter to 0.19 during the
3rd quarter. All five passenger accidents that occurred in the 3rd quarter were classified as nonpreventable. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled in the 3rd quarter. RTD and the contractor organizations
place a high emphasis on completing preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as
such, the local operations are diligent about completing these inspections on time.

Packet Pg. 36

1.C.5



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
First Transit Longmont met the target of 88% Local On-Time Service with 89.2% on-time
performance in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (87.4%), Transdev (87.2%), First Transit
Commerce City (83.3%) did not meet the goal due in part to the high number of new operators.
RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and operators with low on time
performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a monthly basis contractors
review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing routes to discuss factors that
are impacting their ability to reach 88% on time performance. Running time issues are forwarded
to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.



MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 28,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls in the 3rd quarter. The contractors continue to improve in this
area by completing preventive maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely
manner, monitoring repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a proactive approach to maintaining the buses in their fleets.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
First Transit Longmont met the target of .0004 Complaints per Boarding with .0003 complaints
per boarding in the 3rd quarter. First Transit Denver (.0005), First Transit Commerce City
(.0006) and Transdev (.0007) did not meet the goal. Complaints per boarding continue to reflect
the difficulties experienced in the earlier part of the year due to operator shortages which resulted
in a high number of bus late and bus no show complaints. Since the later part of 2015 and
continuing into 2016, the contractors have taken a variety of actions over and above contract
requirements to address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses,
wage increases, incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and
mentoring programs
The contractors continue to investigate and address customer complaints with operators. The
contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool to assist operators in improving
customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above regarding on-time performance should
help address some customer complaints. The contractors also continue to address complaint
trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.

Access-a-Ride/Cab 3rd Quarter Performance
Report

Ridership
Access-a-Ride ridership levels remained essentially unchanged through the 3rd quarter of 2016 compared
to the same period of 2015. Productivity increased from 1.20 to 1.25 passengers per hour. During the
same period, Access-a-Cab ridership decreased by 10%. Combined Access-a-Ride and Access-a-Cab
ridership decreased by 2% compared to 2015. Total boardings decreased from 687,225 total boardings
thru Q3 of 2015 to 674,894 total boardings thru Q3 of 2016.
Revenue Hours
Revenue hours of service provided on Access-a-Ride decreased by 3% during the 3rd
quarter of 2016
as compared to the same period of 2015. Access-a-Ride is approximately 6% under budgeted revenue
hours through the third quarter of 2016.
On-Time Performance
Carrier on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 95.56% a slight decrease as compared
to the same period of 2015 (95.59%).
Passenger on-time performance through the 3rd quarter of 2016 was 84.31% a slight decrease as
compared to the same period in 2015 (84.4%).
On time performance continues to be impacted by operator shortages and the continuing trend of traffic,
construction, and other delays. Our private contractors continue to try to address the operator shortages
by continuing their job fair efforts and implementing/continuing a variety of other recruiting
methodologies in an attempt to attract potential operators and by improving wages in an attempt to
attract and retain operators.
Customer Complaints
Complaints increased through the 3rd quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Staff
continues to work with our carriers and passengers to try to improve overall system performance. The
major obstacle to improved system performance continues to be the shortage of operators which results
in dropped runs, degraded on-time performance and increased on-board ride times. We continue to work
with our contractor partners to address these issues.

RTD currently provides Call-n-Ride service in 21 Call-n-Ride service areas throughout the District. The
following is a discussion of Call-n-Ride performance through the Third Quarter of 2016.

Preventable Accidents:
3rd Qtr 2016 – 3 Accidents
3rd Qtr 2015 – 4 Accidents

Call-n-Ride Comments:
Ridership continues to be down. Changes to how we are scheduling trips for the school children,
low gas prices and the new fare increases have affected ridership in the Call-n-Ride areas.
Broomfield – The City of Broomfield applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality
grant to expand the current Broomfield Call-n-Ride. The Call-n-Ride has been expanded in size and
now has two vehicles serving the Broomfield community. The expanded service began operations on
August 1, 2016.
Highlands Ranch - This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Highlands
Ranch CnR replaced the poorly performing Route 426 Ranch Rider. Over the years RTD has tried
numerous adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be
discontinued twice. Highlands Ranch has carried a high percentage of Access-a-Ride qualified users.
While the subsidy is high for the CnR, if CnR were to be discontinued, this ridership would move to

Packet Pg. 54

1.C.7

Access-a-Ride where the subsidy would be much higher. Douglas County has contributed financially
to the CnR in the past. In 2015 Douglas County and Highlands Ranch provided a cost share with the
RTD for 50% of the subsidy. A Transportation Advisory Committee (TAC) was formed to reevaluate service and develop marketing to increase ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas
that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard. The school trippers have increased ridership
slightly, but this requires a great deal of staff time. Ridership continues to be a challenge.
Recommendation to discontinue the Call-n-Ride was placed in the Winter 2016 Service
Recommendation. A proposed 50% cost share with Douglas County was offered to the County.
The County turned this offer down. The Call-n-Ride’s last day will be Friday, January 13, 2017.
Superior – The Town of Superior applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality grant
to start a new Call-n-Ride. The new service began operations on August 1, 2016.
Parker – This CnR opened with the Southeast Corridor in November 2006. Over the years RTD has
made adjustments to the service area and marketing. It has been recommended to be discontinued
twice. In 2015 Douglas County and the Town of Parker provided a cost share with the RTD for 50%
of the subsidy. A TAC was formed to re-evaluate service and develop marketing to increase
ridership. The TAC came up with some ideas that were implemented in the August 2015 runboard.
In August 2016, a school trip was set up that is showing positive results. The Parker Call-n-Ride is
showing positive ridership results.
Lone Tree and Thornton call-n-rides are being monitored.

2016 3rd
Analysis

Quarter

Customer

Complaint

Recapped below is an analysis of the customer complaint trends for the 3rd Quarter of 2016. Also
included is a comparison of customer complaint data for the same period in 2015.
As noted in previous reports, in 2007 and 2008, RTD and the private contractors were meeting the
performance goal for customer complaints of .0002 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2009, RTD
began stricter enforcement of the fare policy and the priority seating area policy which advised
passengers with strollers or other large items that they would need to move from the priority seating
area if those seats were needed for disabled passengers. In addition, RTD posted notices on all buses
and light rail vehicles advising passengers of the requirement under Title VI of the Civil Rights Law for
operators to call out transfer points. Following the implementation of these policies/procedures,
customer complaints increased, but for 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 RTD and the private contractors
performed, for the most part, at a level of .0003 to .0004 complaints per passenger boarding. In 2012,
the performance goal for passenger complaints was adjusted to .0003 complaints per passenger
boarding. The goal for 2014 was again adjusted to account for the static higher level of complaints due
to the securement area/priority seating issues, the fare enforcement campaigns, TIC availability,
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line service. The 2015 goal remained at .0004
complaints per passenger boarding. The 2016 goal was again set at .0004 complaints per passenger
boarding.
For the 3rd Quarter of 2016, RTD and First Transit Longmont met the goal of .0004 complaints per
passenger boarding. First Transit Denver had .0005 complaints per passenger boarding. First Transit
Commerce City has .0006 complaints per passenger boarding. Transdev (formerly Veolia) had .0007
complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for all of the private contractors was
.0005 complaints per passenger boarding. The combined performance for RTD and the private
contractors was .0004 complaints per passenger boarding.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer complaints on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer complaints using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the complaint is not valid. Some of the reasons for the “Not
Valid” classification include the following:
Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
Operator followed proper procedure
Passenger presented insufficient fare
Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
Passenger presented an expired transfer
Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
Buses were running late District-wide due to weather
There was no video evidence to support the complaint

Packet Pg. 60

1.C.9

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer complaints.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 Bus operator trainers from RTD and the private contractors meet weekly in an effort to ensure
consistency in training messages and practices and produce a quarterly newsletter which is
shared with operations personnel.
 RTD is conducting refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis,
DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service for
passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
Historically, and in 2016, the following complaint categories generated the highest number of customer
complaints:
Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop
All of these complaint categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
complaint numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high complaint categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and
external, that are impacting the number of complaints. The input received from both RTD and private
contractor operations is noted below:
Bus Did Not Show – 3rd Quarter 2016: the complaints in this category increased 29.3% compared to
the same period in 2015. Due to on-going operator shortages at both RTD and the private contractors,
a high number of trips were either dropped or ran late. Consequently, a number of passengers
experienced times when their bus did not show. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 6.74
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.21 complaints per day.
Bus Early – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 5.4% compared to the same period
in 2015. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” complaints often show buses running late. It is possible

Packet Pg. 61

1.C.9

passengers see the prior bus running late and will assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 5.16 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 5.46 complaints per day.
Bus Late – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 12.1% compared to the same
period in 2015. This category was also impacted by the operator shortages. Additionally, improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips; and the inability to fund service improvements to address running-time issues. The YTD average in
this category for 2016 is 10.78 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 12.26
complaints per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 18.5% compared
to the same period in 2015. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride
checks are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In
addition, RTD and the private contractors have “G-force activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam,
Smart Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators
continue to be counseled and retrained as needed to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety
campaigns are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
4.21 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 5.16 complaints per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 9.9% compared to the
same period in 2015. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 10.69 complaints per day.
The comparable number for 2015 was 11.86 complaints per day.
Discrimination – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category decreased 25.0% compared to the same
period in 2015. Investigation into discrimination-related complaints usually shows the operator not at
fault. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 0.24 complaints per day. The comparable number
for 2015 was 0.32 complaints per day.
Fare Dispute – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 30.8% compared to the same
period in 2015. The implementation of the new fares and fare equipment resulted in an increase in
complaints. Investigations into “fare dispute” complaints often show that passengers presented an
improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’ enforcement of the fare policies. The
YTD average in this category for 2016 is 1.31 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015
was 1.00 complaint per day.
Improper Procedure/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 6.2% compared
to the same period in 2015. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel meet on a
regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In addition, the
on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held at the
private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of RTD
passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not

Packet Pg. 62

1.C.9

following proper procedures, appropriate action is taken. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is
8.71 complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 8.21 complaints per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 29.8% compared to
the same period in 2015. The recent high turnover of operators has resulted in an increase in new
operators on routes. This in turn has contributed to the higher numbers in this category. The combined
efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street
Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to provide operators with up-to-date information to answer
customer questions and address customer concerns. The YTD average in the category for 2016 is 0.54
complaints per day. The comparable number for 2015 was 0.42 complaints per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 3rd Quarter 2016: complaints in this category increased 5.7% compared
to the same period in 2015. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these complaints will confirm buses are on
route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the stop when
the bus arrived. Many complaint comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” complaints from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
complaints (146 of the total 3,331 = 4.4%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjustment as needed and as resources
will allow. The YTD average in this category for 2016 is 12.20 complaints per day. The comparable
number for 2015 was 11.55 complaints per day.

Customer Satisfaction Survey
Although customer complaints help identify those areas in which RTD and the private contractors can
continue to improve the quality of service provided, the results of the 2011 Customer Satisfaction
Survey indicate that the majority of RTD passengers are satisfied with RTD services. On a scale of 1
(poor) to 5 (excellent), over 80% of bus, light rail, Call-n-Ride, and SkyRide passengers rated RTD either
a 4 or a 5.
Specific driver related areas that received ratings of 4.0 or higher were as follows:
Courtesy of bus driver
Driving skills
Drivers’ knowledge of their specific route
Drivers’ ability to answer your questions about bus service
Drivers announcing transfer stops

Fare Enforcement Statistics
Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection onboard buses and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then
to issue a citation if that person is contacted a second time without fare. The table below shows the
actual number of patrons without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers
from month to month may be due to several factors: special events or other security security-related
incidents.

Light Rail Station and Commuter Rail Platform Sweeps and on-Board Enforcement Sweeps
In addition to the regular on-board fare enforcement, security officers conduct random, unannounced
fare checks at light rail and commuter rail 11platforms twice a week. Below are the numbers of patrons
contacted during the quarter. Any area that exhibits a higher fare evasion rate, we go back to that area
and conduct an on-board enforcement sweep.

Plain Clothes Police Officer Fare Inspection
Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors,
dispatch logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.
The following tables lists the number of patron boardings observed, no fare or partial fares, the
estimated fare evasion rate, the number of warnings and citations issued, and the number of arrests
made by police officers. Arrests include citations issued or physical arrests made for criminal violations
other than fare evasion. This is an additional advantage to the plain clothes police fare inspection
program as peace officers have the authority to check for warrants and take the appropriate law
enforcement action. This quarter the bus routes inspected include the 15, 16, 31 & 0.

The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a
slightly higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain clothes program than for the rail station sweeps
and bus enforcement because of the following factors:
 Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all
patrons to have fare before boarding vehicles
 Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
 Plain clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they
inherently find more violations of fare evasion.
