#### 1. Amended Annual Audit Plan 2016

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan for 2016.

Motion:               Director Walker made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ann Marie Issac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit, said staff is requesting that consideration be given to amend the 2016 Annual Audit Plan.  She commented that due of the complexity of many of the audits included in the plan, staff would like to move several audits to the 2017 Annual Audit Plan, as many require an increase of time and resources.  She stated that in order to continue to contribute to the improvement of RTD’s operations, staff must dedicate the time and resources to an Audit that will facilitate the best recommendations. She added that the number of audits completed has little relevance compared to the impact that the recommendations have on the operations of RTD.  She noted that while RTD has expanded over the years, the Audit department has not.

Director Folska indicated that she would be in full support of amending the audit plan.  She asked what the agency’s plan was for expanding the human capital needed to keep the audit department staffed appropriately.

Committee Chair Menten said there was an action item planned to add staff, but it did not make it to the Board level.  She stated that this is an area that needs additional staff and support.

General Manager Genova remarked that every year during the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process, departments have to address their needs for six years.  He noted that as staff prioritizes everything in the SBP, the reality is that only the high priority areas are considered.  He stated that as staff examines the 2017 Audit Plan, this would be a good opportunity to address the number of audits with the Board, as well as the scope, and possibly, determine if staff should reduce the amount of audits performed.

Chair Tobiassen commented that auditing is important, complex and not easy to do.  He suggested that the auditor’s report to the General Manager and the Board as an independent audit team.  He added that he is happy RTD is stepping up its auditing for IT.

Director Lubow stated that the savings made by these audits may defray some of the costs of a new employee for this department.  She added that the Board should examine the annual audits to determine if they still apply.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, stated that the investment policy specifies the practices and procedures for the investment of RTD’s funds.  The following items are the highlighted changes for 2017:

- Minor changes for clarification in response to recent SEC Money Market Reform.

- Clarification to some wording.

- List of financial institutions that RTD does business with.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

##### a. Recommended Investment Policy Red Line 9-21-16

##### b. 2016 Resolution - 019 Investment Policy

#### 4. Approval of 2017 Contribution for the Salaried Employee's Retirement Plans

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement.  It is also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, explained that the Defined Benefit Pension Trust (DB) Plan is for employees hired prior to January 2008, and employees hired after that date are on the Defined Contribution (DC) Plan.  With the DB plan, there is an annual assessment of the plan and it was recommended that RTD contribute $7.63 million dollars per year  to meet the original payoff  date in 2026.  She explained that staff has not been making the recommended contributions outlined but staff has  increased the contributions from $4.1 million to $4.6. She noted that it is a small incremental step, but RTD will need to make larger contributions in the future in order to meet the contribution goal. She noted that the recommendation for the DC plan is 9% ,or $3.5 million dollars to contribute to the plan.

Director Lubow asked if the incremental increases to the DB plan, with hopes of reaching 100%, is actually obtainable.

Heather Copp said the ability to do that in 2018 is slim.  She added that as staff has discussed previously,  we will need to do something with both plans in the future.  She noted that the salaried plan is a much more robust and stable plan than the represented plan is at this time.  She remarked that at this time, this is the contribution RTD can make.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 5. 2017 Salaried Benefit Plan

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approves the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Heather Copp said this is something that is brought to the Board annually.  She noted that for medical, there are two providers: Cigna and Kaiser, and the overall net increase is $634,000.

Director Sisk stated that ¼ of RTD’s employees chose to use Kaiser.  He remarked that Kaiser is less expensive, and he prefers a single provider option.  He recommended that RTD pay a set dollar amount and if the employee wanted to participate in the higher cost plan, they would pay the difference.

Heather Copp stated that a single provider option usually works for three years, and then the rates begin to increase significantly.

Director Hoy said he agrees with Director Sisk.  He noted that Adams District 12 opted to use a single provider and it saved the district a substantial amount of money.  He commented that eventually RTD needs consider a single source option, or request that the employee pay the difference for the better program.

Chair Tobiassen said that he concurs with Directors Sisk and Hoy, and asked if there are things we can do to incentivize employees to be healthy.

Heather stated that RTD’s internal wellness program is successful, and we also offer on-site rehabilitation to help employees get back to work faster.

Director Deadwyler asked why RTD offers Cigna, when there are other companies that are more comparable to Kaiser’s rates.  She recommended that staff examine all healthcare providers for competitive rates.

Heather Copp indicated that staff reviews medical providers almost every year.  She stated that most providers do not give us the same benefits that our current employees have for the price that we pay.

General Manager Genova added that before Cigna, RTD used United Healthcare.

Director Francone said fundamentally, healthcare is an emotional and passionate issue.  She stated that while there are other options, RTD needs to keep in mind our current state of healthcare and keep in mind what changes future legislation may bring.

Director Folska suggested that it might be beneficial if a policy was put in place that if a current health care provider exceeds a certain benchmark amount, it will then require RTD to look for another provider.

Director Lubow said some employers may opt to choose a plan where they pay more because it might offer employees more options.  She stated that perhaps by offering more options, RTD is a more competitive employer.

Heather Copp stated that RTD strives to offer multiple options to our employees so they can make the best choices for themselves.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 6. 2016-016 : Approval of 2017 Recommended Budget

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 for the adoption of the 2017 Budget, Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 for the 2017 Budget Appropriation and Resolution No. ___, Series of 2016 for the appropriation of 2017 Previously Appropriated Capital.

The 2017 Recommended Budget includes the following summary of operating and non-operating revenue, and operating expenses, debt and reserves, capital expenditures, and fund balances.  The attached Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) provide the supporting detail for the Base System, FasTracks Project (Construction) and FasTracks Operations (West Line, Denver Union Station, Free Metro Ride, I-225 Corridor, US36 BRT, H Line Extension, and Eagle).

The 2017 Budget includes the following projected operating and non-operating revenue as follows (in thousands):

The 2017 Budget Appropriation below includes the following projected operating expenses, debt and reserves, capital expenditures, and fund balances as follows (in thousands):

BACKGROUND

In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body by October 15, 2016.  By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8, 2016.  A public hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

DISCUSSION

The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget (combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million.  This includes an operating expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of $29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million.  The previously approved capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million.  The sum of the budget appropriation and capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.

Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget

Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0 million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  The increase is due to 1) an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.

- Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  On the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal.  For FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought on-line in 2016.  The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation.  Any ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.

- Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase 6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business. Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CU-Leeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million.  This differential between the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.

- Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts.  Base System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million.  FasTracks grants are budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.

- Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds.  An expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize investment income.

- Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line and an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017 (excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.8 million.  On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP.  For FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense to FasTracks Project.  The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks Operations.  It should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.

Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of approximately $5.3 million.  Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP, the savings is $1.2 million.  This differential between the SBP and actual lock price is contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.  Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.

The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A.  The majority of the changes from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.

Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  The increase is due to the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance.   This increase is offset by a reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing.  Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4 million is budgeted for FasTracks.  Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project.  Capitalized interest will be part of the actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.

Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget.  Base System principal payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail).  FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization on current debt.  No new debt issuances are planned in 2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks.  Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.

Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016 (previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2017.  The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.

New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks.  New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to North Metro.  For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million.  Of this amount, the Base system will spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project).  These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District).  The Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.

New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in Attachment B.  The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.

Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0 million.  This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0 million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments.  The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become evident in the 2017 amended budget).  Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.

The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at $15.9 million.  The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million.  In FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of operating expenses up from 2 months previously.

On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9 million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million.  The Board-appropriated fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected to increase by $25.3 million in total.  These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.

Cost Recovery Ratio

The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Fund Balance Policy

The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently for the Base System.  The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks.  The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks construction schedule.

The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7 million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $14.3 million.  The Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.

Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting

The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two exceptions:

- Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.

- Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.

- The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.

- Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget and Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/non-operating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets.  Also attached is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary (Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget.  This is the recommended action.

2.       Revise the 2017 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.

3.       Do not adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget.  This is not recommended since the District will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by December 31, 2016. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2016, State statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:

"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016 Board Meeting.

Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Jannette Scarpino reminded the Board that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) discussions began in April, and it was approved in September along with the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE).  She said the Highlights to the 2017 Recommended Budget are as follows:

- Total revenue projected to be $174 million

- Sales/use tax increase of 6.7% in 2017

- Farebox revenue up $20.2 million

- No growth in ridership on base side

- Projected grant revenue at $122 million dollar increase

- Operating expenses will be down $12.2 million

- FasTracks projects down $25 million; due to projects being finalized

- Locked in fuel rate of $1.69 for diesel fuel, staff estimated $1.80 a gallon in the SBP which creates a difference of $1.2 million

- All bank savings will go into an Operations reserve account.

#### 3. FasTracks Bond Sale Update

Brenden Morgan updated the Board on the sale of the FasTracks bonds.  The bonds were sold on October 27th, prior to the school bonds showing up on the election ballots.  He stated that RTD sold $195 million worth of bonds, and the sale is scheduled to close this week.

#### 4. Smart Media Technology (SMT) Monthly Update

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said the EcoPass and CollegePasses have been consistent over the past couple months. She noted that the total monthly taps for October were approximately 1.57 million .  She added that staff has completed installation and training in all King Soopers locationsbut there is a bit of a challenge with the upcoming holidays as Abertsons/Safeway and King Soopers will not start using new software during their busy season.

Heather Copp stated that Xerox is still working through the PCI compliance document.  She said that they will deliver their final document to RTD in mid-December and if they meet their dates, staff will be able to determine when we can go live with the web portal.

Director Folska stressed that RTD is paying Xerox over $28 million dollars for this project and we should be setting the expectations and timeline.  She added that RTD should not pay for services not rendered.

Heather Copp clarified that they have not been paid in full; they have only been paid for services that they have completed.

### D. Other Matters

Director Francone congratulated the returning directors.  In addition, she recognized the City of Denver’s partnership in making sure there will be temporary shelters at Civic Center.  She gave a big thank you to Anthony Graves for mediating and assisting in getting the approval.
