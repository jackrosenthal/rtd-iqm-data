B. Recommended Actions

• Amended Annual Audit Plan 2016
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan
for 2016.
Motion:

Director Walker made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Ann Marie Issac-Heslop, Manager of Internal and IT Audit, said
staff is requesting that consideration be given to amend the
2016 Annual Audit Plan. She commented that due of the
complexity of many of the audits included in the plan, staff
would like to move several audits to the 2017 Annual Audit
Plan, as many require an increase of time and resources. She
stated that in order to continue to contribute to the
improvement of RTD’s operations, staff must dedicate the
time and resources to an Audit that will facilitate the best
recommendations. She added that the number of audits
completed has little relevance compared to the impact that the
recommendations have on the operations of RTD. She noted
that while RTD has expanded over the years, the Audit
department has not.
Director Folska indicated that she would be in full support of
amending the audit plan. She asked what the agency’s plan

was for expanding the human capital needed to keep the audit
department staffed appropriately.
Committee Chair Menten said there was an action item
planned to add staff, but it did not make it to the Board level.
She stated that this is an area that needs additional staff and
support.
General Manager Genova remarked that every year during the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) process, departments have to
address their needs for six years. He noted that as staff
prioritizes everything in the SBP, the reality is that only the
high priority areas are considered. He stated that as staff
examines the 2017 Audit Plan, this would be a good
opportunity to address the number of audits with the Board,
as well as the scope, and possibly, determine if staff should
reduce the amount of audits performed.
Chair Tobiassen commented that auditing is important,
complex and not easy to do. He suggested that the auditor’s
report to the General Manager and the Board as an
independent audit team. He added that he is happy RTD is
stepping up its auditing for IT.
Director Lubow stated that the savings made by these audits
may defray some of the costs of a new employee for this
department. She added that the Board should examine the
annual audits to determine if they still apply.

• Proposed 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
that the Board of Directors approves and adopts the 2017 Fiscal Policy
Statement.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.
Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and
Financial Analysis, said the changes to the 2017 Fiscal
Policy Statement include revisions, clarifications and
clean-up. She added that all of the changes are
summarized in the Board Report, but the majority of the
changes are updates to the fund balance policies.

attached.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments,
stated that the investment policy specifies the practices
and procedures for the investment of RTD’s funds. The
following items are the highlighted changes for 2017:
 Minor changes for clarification in response to
recent SEC Money Market Reform.
 Clarification to some wording.
 List of financial institutions that RTD does
business with.

• Approval of 2017 Contribution for the Salaried Employee's Retirement Plans
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to
RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”),
which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement.
It is also
recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of
9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’
Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified
amount to the plan for each year of employment.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General
Manager of Finance and Administration, explained that the
Defined Benefit Pension Trust (DB) Plan is for employees hired
prior to January 2008, and employees hired after that date are
on the Defined Contribution (DC) Plan. With the DB plan,
there is an annual assessment of the plan and it was
recommended that RTD contribute $7.63 million dollars per
year to meet the original payoff date in 2026. She explained
that staff has not been making the recommended contributions
outlined but staff has increased the contributions from $4.1
million to $4.6. She noted that it is a small incremental step,
but RTD will need to make larger contributions in the future in
order to meet the contribution goal. She noted that the
recommendation for the DC plan is 9%, or $3.5 million dollars
to contribute to the plan.
Director Lubow asked if the incremental increases to the DB
plan, with hopes of reaching 100%, is actually obtainable.
Heather Copp said the ability to do that in 2018 is slim. She
added that as staff has discussed previously, we will need to

do something with both plans in the future. She noted that
the salaried plan is a much more robust and stable plan than
the represented plan is at this time. She remarked that at this
time, this is the contribution RTD can make.

• 2017 Salaried Benefit Plan
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors approves the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan
and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his designee to enter into
agreements with the insurance carriers.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the November 29, 2016
Board Meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Heather Copp said this is something that is brought to the
Board annually. She noted that for medical, there are two
providers: Cigna and Kaiser, and the overall net increase is
$634,000.
Director Sisk stated that ¼ of RTD’s employees chose to use
Kaiser. He remarked that Kaiser is less expensive, and he
prefers a single provider option. He recommended that RTD
pay a set dollar amount and if the employee wanted to
participate in the higher cost plan, they would pay the
difference.
Heather Copp stated that a single provider option usually
works for three years, and then the rates begin to increase
significantly.
Director Hoy said he agrees with Director Sisk. He noted that
Adams District 12 opted to use a single provider and it saved
the district a substantial amount of money. He commented

that eventually RTD needs consider a single source option, or
request that the employee pay the difference for the better
program.
Chair Tobiassen said that he concurs with Directors Sisk and
Hoy, and asked if there are things we can do to incentivize
employees to be healthy.
Heather stated that RTD’s internal wellness program is
successful, and we also offer on-site rehabilitation to help
employees get back to work faster.
Director Deadwyler asked why RTD offers Cigna, when there
are other companies that are more comparable to Kaiser’s
rates. She recommended that staff examine all healthcare
providers for competitive rates.
Heather Copp indicated that staff reviews medical providers
almost every year. She stated that most providers do not give
us the same benefits that our current employees have for the
price that we pay.
General Manager Genova added that before Cigna, RTD used
United Healthcare.
Director Francone said fundamentally, healthcare is an
emotional and passionate issue. She stated that while there
are other options, RTD needs to keep in mind our current state
of healthcare and keep in mind what changes future legislation
may bring.
Director Folska suggested that it might be beneficial if a policy
was put in place that if a current health care provider exceeds
a certain benchmark amount, it will then require RTD to look
for another provider.
Director Lubow said some employers may opt to choose a plan
where they pay more because it might offer employees more
options. She stated that perhaps by offering more options,
RTD is a more competitive employer.
Heather Copp stated that RTD strives to offer multiple options
to our employees so they can make the best choices for
themselves.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the
governing body by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body presented
the proposed 2017 Requested Budget for public review on October 8, 2016. A public
hearing to solicit formal public comment is scheduled for the November 29, 2016
regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget
(combined Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating
expense budget of $626.1 million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized
interest of $33.0 million, new capital expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of
$58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal
Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund of $29.7 million, capital
replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and
estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million. The previously approved capital
(capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and
capital carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0
million (16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1)
an increase in farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue
of $38.5 million, and 3) an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an
increase in investment income of $0.4 million, offset by a decrease in other income of
$7.2 million.








Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4
million are budgeted to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget. On the Base System, fare revenue is budgeted to remain flat in
2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to minimal. For
FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year
operation of the FasTracks service corridors brought on-line in 2016.
The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual Program Evaluation. Any
ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to
increase 6.7% over the 2016 projected level according to the most
recent September quarterly forecast by the CU-Leeds School of Business.
Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2% based on the CULeeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the
unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, including new and carry forward
amounts. Base System grants are estimated to total $148.0 million in
2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants while projected
carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are
budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016
Re-Amended Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward
grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to
the impact of continued low short term interest rates coupled with



deployment of invested funds. An expected small increase in interest
rates will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of
$9.0 million released from TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year
payment by the University of Colorado for naming rights on the A Line
and an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017
(excluding depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 ReAmended Budget. Base System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8
million, FasTracks Project operating expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million,
and FasTracks Operations operating expenses are budgeted to increase $3.8 million.
On the Base System, departmental operating expenses are targeted amounts derived
from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases for salaried
personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and salary
adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For
FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to
FasTracks of costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of
TABOR interest expense to FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to
2017 is $15.0 million for Base System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5
million for FasTracks Operations. It should be noted that substantial reductions were
made to departmental operating budgets to align them with the SBP target, which
offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of
$2.23 per gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of
approximately $5.3 million. Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP,
the savings is $1.2 million. This differential between the SBP and actual lock price is
contributed to the unrestricted operating reserve in the 2017 Budget. Gasoline is
budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per gallon budget price of $3.00, for
year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the
posted Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes
from the Requested Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an
increase of $43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to
the inclusion of the TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO
service payment for the first time in 2017 and new interest expense for the full year
from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This increase is offset by a reduction to
total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond refinancing. Of total interest
expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4 million is budgeted for
FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million, the majority

of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized interest will be part of the actual
cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which
is $2.8 million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System principal
payments of $48.6 million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of
COPs issued for fleet purchases (bus and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $10.3
million are $0.5 million higher due to refundings and scheduled principal amortization
on current debt. No new debt issuances are planned in 2017 for either the Base
System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued debt to fund major capital
purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016
(previously approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital
for 2017. The capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million
on the Base System and $698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in
FasTracks. New capital spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4
million in 2017 due to on-going project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance
Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT, Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to
North Metro. For the Base System, new capital spending will decrease $43.2 million
to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will spend $6.0 million more on
facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care Center relocation),
$1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly Colfax
Avenue Transit Priority Project). These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on
bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail),
$5.3 million less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The
Base System new capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in
September 2016 and is the amount identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017
Recommended Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan
are shown in Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the
change in the capital carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016
Re-Amended Budget are shown in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base
System year-end unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0
million. This projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0
million after incorporating all revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount
realized, however, may be lower (or higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher)
fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016 (this will become evident in the 2017
amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Board-appropriated fund is projected
to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital replacement fund is projected

to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted operating reserve is
established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at
$15.9 million. The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. In
FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital
replacement fund, and unrestricted fund are established at 3 months of operating
expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9
million from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Board-appropriated
fund, the capital replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected
to increase by $25.3 million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with
fiscal policies for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the
Colorado General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue
except ADA farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation,
except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and
development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly.
Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Boardappropriated fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund
balance for both the Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted
operating reserve currently for the Base System. The objective is for the total of these
funds excluding the capital acquisition fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base System and FasTracks. The
2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management reserve and
construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the FasTracks
construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is
projected at $68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7
million, 2) the capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating
reserve of $9.7 million, and 4) the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of
$14.3 million. The Base System portion of these fund balances listed for 2017 is
projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting
with two exceptions:






Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as
expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is
excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended
action.
2. Revise the 2017 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed
revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended
since the District will not be in compliance with State regulations that
require the District to adopt a budget by December 31, 2016. If the
District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2016, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:
"Only ninety percent (90%) of the prior year's appropriation for operations and
maintenance purposes and objects is deemed reappropriated."

C. Updates

• September 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Heather Copp highlighted the September Monthly Financial Status Report:





Sales and Use tax was near target, only down 0.2%
RTD is short to date at approximately $4.2 Million. RTD will need to
recoup that in October, November and December
Below on ridership year to date
Fare revenue is up 11.3%

Heather Copp also mentioned that an adjustment was made to the
FasTracks Internal Savings (FISA) account after numbers were revised to the
financial plans. She also included the funds of the Fort Lupton property sale,
which totaled $4 million.
Director Hoy congratulated staff on the Fort Lupton property sale.

• Quarterly Investment Report
Brenden Morgan reported on the 3rd quarter investment report. He stated
that investment returns are in line with bench marks and short term rates
appear to be low.

• FasTracks Bond Sale Update
Brenden Morgan updated the Board on the sale of the FasTracks bonds. The
bonds were sold on October 27th, prior to the school bonds showing up on
the election ballots. He stated that RTD sold $195 million worth of bonds,
and the sale is scheduled to close this week.

• Smart Media Technology (SMT) Monthly Update
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, said the EcoPass
and CollegePasses have been consistent over the past couple months. She
noted that the total monthly taps for October were approximately 1.57
million. She added that staff has completed installation and training in all
King Soopers locations but there is a bit of a challenge with the upcoming
holidays as Albertsons/Safeway and King Soopers will not start using new
software during their busy season.
Heather Copp stated that Xerox is still working through the PCI compliance
document. She said that they will deliver their final document to RTD in
mid-December and if they meet their dates, staff will be able to determine
when we can go live with the web portal.
Director Folska stressed that RTD is paying Xerox over $28 million dollars
for this project and we should be setting the expectations and timeline. She
added that RTD should not pay for services not rendered.
Heather Copp clarified that they have not been paid in full; they have only
been paid for services that they have completed.
