BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: November 10, 2016

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

November 9, 2016

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

Subject:

Amended Annual Audit Plan 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan for 2016.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager’s Goals have historically included the completion of 20 Audits which have been
included in the Annual Audit Plan and reflected in the Performance Measures. Audit has been staffed by
two employees for many years – a manager and a Senior Auditor. The level of staffing has not kept
pace with the work load or complexity of the audits. Information Technology (IT) Audits were
introduced to RTD in 2015 and are an integral part of the Audit function. IT Auditing is not a
temporary part of the Annual Audit Plan; it is a necessary part of the Audit function for all
organizations including RTD. IT Audits are larger, more complex and very detailed requiring more
time and knowledge of worldwide technical standards.
The Approved Annual Audit Plan for 2016 includes 20 audits. The plan was produced based on the
expectation that the Audit staff would be increased to accommodate the work load and capacity
associated with IT Audits. RTD has grown significantly in the past few years but the size of the Audit
team has not grown proportionately. No additional staffing was approved in the 2016 amended budget
or the 2017 budget.
DISCUSSION
Audit is very concerned about the large number of audits (20) and the quality of those audits if that
number continues to stay the same in future years. Twenty audits put
pressure on Audit to
compromise the comprehensiveness of the audit process.
We feel the quality of Audit work has improved drastically since the middle of 2013. Audits have been
selected for the Annual Audit Plan according to their potential to improve RTD’s policies and procedures
and contribute to the achievement of RTD’s Goals and Objectives. This has resulted in Audit taking on
more complex and detailed audit work, ensuring the complete Audit process has been utilized in every
case, which means that several of the audits required a much longer time resource investment than
originally planned.
In the past, in order to complete 20 audits, the following has been done:
Limiting the Audit scope
Using very small sample sizes
Limited substantive testing
Incomplete Audit Files and
Selecting less complex audits to include in the Annual Audit Plan.
In addition, the current Annual Audit Plan reduces flexibility. There is very limited time for the review
of audits completed by the Senior Auditor and no time for projects that may arise during the year

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

which require immediate attention. Follow-up Audit work, which would ensure that the agreed upon
recommendations are being complied with and the policies and procedures are being applied as
prescribed, has not been completed due to time constraints. There is also insufficient time for
continuing professional development training which is imperative to keep up with the latest in
Governmental Auditing Standards and industry best practices.
The complexity, types of audit, and additional issues that arise during the course of the audit
process have required more attention and time than originally anticipated. In addition, as was
mentioned previously, additional resources were not forthcoming.
The quality of the audit work and the improvements brought about by the recommendations, made
by Audit to improve the systems, policies and procedures, should be the focus as opposed to the
number of Audits. It is not beneficial to continue to include 20 audits in the Annual Audit Plan when
it is impossible to complete 20 audits of good quality and of sufficient value to the organization in
any one year, with the current limited staff resources.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no current financial impact; however, going forward consideration woul d have to be given
to additional staff to address the future workload of RTD Audit.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors approves the attached Amended Annual Audit Plan for
2016.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not Adopt the Amended Annual Audit Plan for
2016. This action is not recommended. Internal Auditing is an independent, objective assurance
and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It is
impossible to complete the original Audit plan without additional staff or outside services.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

November 9, 2016

Subject:

Proposed 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 10, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves and adopts the 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement.
BACKGROUND
Proposed modifications to the Fiscal Policy Statement (the “Policy”) are brought to the Board of
Directors for approval during the year, as necessary. In addition, each year staff presents the
proposed Policy for the upcoming fiscal year for approval to the Board of Directors as an initial step
in development of the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and Recommended Budget.
The most recent modification to the Policy was approved by the Board of Directors in November
2015 for the 2016 fiscal year. Those changes primarily related to: 1) review of potential fare

equitable, and achieves revenue levels in the SBP; 2) contracting with a qualified third party to
provide sales and use tax forecasting; 3) an investment in safety outreach programs and personnel;
and 4) other miscellaneous clarifications. The Policy Statement was also updated with the most
recent rating agency credit ratings at the time.

DISCUSSION
For 2017, the following major changes are proposed.
Fund Balance Policies #1 is revised as follows: The Base System should strive to maintain a total
fund balance at an amount approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses
excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the
unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total
of the Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation.
Fund Balance Policies #4 is revised as follows: In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will
designate an unrestricted operating reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to
mitigate service or project disruptions due to revenue fluctuations, unanticipated expenditures of a
nonrecurring nature, or to avoid cash flow disruptions. The source of replenishment of this fund will
be identified and replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
Fund Balance Policies #6 is updated to reflect only one FasTracks reserve for future construction
remaining under the FasTracks plan and that is the FasTracks Management Reserve.

Packet Pg. 25

1.B.2

Fund Balance Policies #7 is revised as follows: The FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) will
be used to provide funding to complete and operate additional FasTracks projects. Expenditures from
the FISA will be subject to Board approval.
Debt Policies #5 is updated with the most recent rating agency credit ratings in effect at this date.
All other proposed changes to the Policy Statement are primarily wording clarification and are
reflected in the attachment.
Please see the attachments for the full proposed document and document with changes indicated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adopting the Fiscal Policy Statement as requested will not have a financial impact on the 2017
Recommended Budget.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended changes to RTD’s 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement. Staff supports
this alternative because the Policy Statement documents the policies to be adhered to in 2017
and provides clarification of certain practices.
2. Board further modifies the recommended changes. Staff reviewed the fiscal policies and
welcomes any suggestions for modifications requested by the Board of Directors.
3. Do not adopt the RTD 2017 Fiscal Policy Statement. This is not recommended because
RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement would not contain all current language, would not adhere to
best practices, and would not best facilitate the needs of RTD’s financial operations.

REVENUE POLICIES
1. Staff will plan fare adjustments every 3three years in the mid and long-term
budgets to adjust for inflation. The Board of Directors may consider potential fare
adjustments annually at the time of the development of the Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP). As part of this process, staff will review potential fare adjustments to
establish a fare structure to ensure that it:
 is understandable
 is implementable
 is equitable
 achieves revenue levels established in the Strategic Budget PlanSBP, and
 facilitates the integration of the 2016 rail and BRT projects.
2. Fare policies will take into account the special needs of all transit dependent
patrons.
3. RTD will avoid dependence on temporary revenues to fund ongoing services. Onetime revenues will be used for one-time expenditures.
4. RTD will continuously explore additional sources of revenue to help balance the
budget.
5. When appropriate the Board will actively pursue legislation that would help ensure
the continued accomplishment of RTD’s goals and mission statement. The Board
will support efforts to ensure that legislative intent is realized in allocation of state
financial resources to public transit. The Board will actively oppose legislation that
would limit or diminish revenue.
6. On an annual basis, staff will identify under- or un-utilized property and equipment,
and will make an ongoing attempt to sell such property and equipment to enhance
cash flow.
7. RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and use tax
forecasting containing projections for the short-term (one year by quarter),
medium-term (six- year SBP period) and long-term (30-year APE Financial Plan

of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following
three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating
reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. This unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board appropriated fund, a capital replacement fund
and an undesignated working capital fund as described below. For the Base
System, the total of these three funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three months of Base System operating expenses excluding

budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions allow.
2. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a Board- appropriated
fund balance on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be minimized and
occur only in specific circumstances such as economic downturns. With Board

need for short-term borrowing, and assist in maintaining an investment-grade bond
rating.
The source of replenishment of this fund will be identified and
replenishment will take place in a prompt manner.
3. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate a capital replacement
fund on an annual basis. With Board approval, these funds will be used for
scheduled major vehicle replacements and other capital purchases. The source of
replenishment of this fund will be identified and replenishment will take place in a
prompt manner.
4. In accordance with the adopted budget, RTD will designate an unrestricted
operating reserve on an annual basis. Use of the fund balance will be to mitigate

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Heather
Copp,
Administration

Date:

November 9, 2016

Subject:

Authorization of RTD Investment Policy

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 10, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.
BACKGROUND:
The Policy specifies the practices and procedures that pertain to the investment of RTD’s operating and
reserve funds. The Board last approved modifications to the Policy in September 2015. Section 10 of
the Policy states “The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the
policy, denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.”
DISCUSSION:
Staff solicited the expertise, knowledge and recommendations of its investment advisor, Public Trust
Advisors, in reviewing the current Policy. Minor changes are recommended this year for clarification
sake and in response to the recent SEC Money Market Reform.
The purpose of the Investment Policy (the “Policy”) of the Regional Transportation District ("RTD") is to
specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and systematic program for investments in
RTD’s operating and reserve funds. The Policy also provides for the investment of bond proceeds that
are authorized through bond resolutions or indentures of trust.
By following best practices with respect to the management of public funds, the primary objectives of
RTD’s Investment Policy in order of priority are: 1) safety of principal, 2) sufficient liquidity to meet
known cash flow requirements, and 3) yield (achieving a market rate of return). Although RTD must
legally follow the investment parameters dictated by Colorado Revised Statutes (C.R.S. 24-75-601.1) it
has previously made a policy decision to implement its investment program in a more conservative
manner than is dictated by state statute through imposing stricter diversification limits.
On October 14th, 2016 the Securities and Exchange Commission enacted amendments to the rules that
govern money market mutual funds. The amendments make structural and operational reforms to
address risks of investor runs in money market funds, while preserving the benefits of the funds.
The new rules require a floating net asset value (NAV) for institutional prime money market funds, which
allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes in the market-based value of
fund assets and provide non-government money market fund boards new tools – liquidity fees and
redemption gates – to address runs.
Colorado State Statute does not allow State or local governments to invest in money market funds with
a floating net asset value. RTD is and has been compliant with this requirement and has not been
investing in institutional prime money market funds since the reform was enacted.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The Policy presents no negative financial impacts to RTD.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. The Board may authorize the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. The Board may further revise the Policy.

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

1.B.3.a

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

Packet Pg. 50

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy Red Line 9-21-16 (2940 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

3.2 Liquidity

1.B.3.a

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

1.B.3.a

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

7.1 Safekeeping and custody

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to specify the policies and procedures that support a prudent and
systematic program for investment transactions involving operating and reserve funds of the
Regional Transportation District ("RTD").
2. SCOPE
This investment policy ("Policy") applies to investment of all operating and reserve funds of the
RTD (collectively, the “Portfolio").
This Policy shall not restrict the ability of RTD to invest proceeds from the issuance of RTD
securities in financial obligations permitted through board-approved bond resolutions or
indentures of trust pursuant to which the securities were issued. The standards of care dictated
for investments of other RTD funds shall also pertain to the investment of such proceeds.
3. OBJECTIVES
The objectives, in priority order, of the RTD's investment activities shall be:
3.1 Safety
Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of RTD
will be made in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the Portfolio. To
attain this objective, RTD will endeavor to mitigate credit and interest rate risks.
Credit Risk: RTD will minimize credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the
security issuer or backer, by:



Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in the Authorized Investments
section of this Policy.
Diversifying the Portfolio in accordance with Policy limits in order to minimize the
potential for losses from any one type of security or any one individual issuer.

Interest Rate Risk: RTD will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market
value of securities in the Portfolio will fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:


Maintaining Portfolio duration appropriate to the cash flow requirements of RTD,
thereby reducing the likelihood that securities would need to be sold on the open
market prior to maturity.

Regional Transportation District
Investment Policy Statement

1.B.3.b

The Portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable RTD to meet all cash flow requirements
which might be reasonably anticipated. This will be achieved through maturity diversification
and purchases of securities that have an established secondary market.
3.3 Yield
The Portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout
budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints, liquidity
needs, and cash flow characteristics of the Portfolio.
4. STANDARDS OF CARE
4.1 Prudence
All RTD officers and employees involved in the investment of RTD funds, along with any
external investment advisors, shall adhere to the guidance provided by the “prudent investor”
standard to insure that:
“When investing, reinvesting, purchasing, acquiring, exchanging, selling, or managing
public funds, a trustee shall act with care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing, including, but not limited to, the general economic
conditions and the anticipated needs of the agency, that a prudent person acting in a like
capacity and familiar with those matters would use in the conduct of funds of a like
character and with like aims, to safeguard the principal and maintain the liquidity needs
of the agency. Within the limitations of this section and considering individual
investments as part of an overall strategy, investments may be acquired as authorized by
law."
RTD shall recognize that no investment is totally riskless and that the investment activities of
RTD are a matter of public record. Accordingly, it recognizes that occasional measured losses
are inevitable in a diversified portfolio and shall be considered within the context of the overall
Portfolio’s return, provided that adequate diversification has been implemented, and that the sale
of a security is in the best long-term interest of RTD.
Authorized investment personnel acting in accordance with this Policy and exercising due
diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security’s credit risk or
market price changes, provided that deviations from expectation are reported in a timely fashion
and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
4.2 Delegation of Authority
RTD is granted legislative authority to invest its funds pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes,
Section 32-9-119. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to

2
Packet Pg. 64

Attachment: Recommended Investment Policy FINAL 9-21-16 (2940 : Authorization of RTD Investment Policy)

3.2 Liquidity

1.B.3.b

RTD may, in its discretion, contract with one or more investment advisers, registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to manage a
portion of its Portfolio assets. Any such advisor shall comply with this Policy and such other
written instructions as provided by RTD.
While it is understood that the procedures and trading counterparties of a contracted investment
adviser may differ from those of RTD, contracted investment advisers must maintain internal
controls and compliance systems at least as extensive as those of the RTD in order to assure
adequate protection of RTD assets in keeping with the standards of prudence outlined below.
4.3 Investment Procedures
The CFO shall establish written procedures for the operation of the investment program,
consistent with this Policy, which shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons
responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction
except as provided under the terms of this Policy and the internal procedures established by the
CFO. Persons who are authorized to transact investment business and wire funds on behalf of
RTD are listed in Appendix 1 to this policy.
4.4 Internal Controls
The CFO shall establish a system of internal controls, which shall be reviewed annually. The
controls shall be designed to prevent loss of funds due to fraud, employee error,
misrepresentation by third parties, or imprudent actions by employees of RTD.
4.5 Ethics and Conflicts of Interest
Investment activities shall be performed in accordance with RTD’s Code of Ethics and other
policies of RTD. Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from
personal business activity that could conflict with the proper execution of the investment
program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions. Employees
and investment officials shall disclose to the General Manager any material financial interests in
financial institutions that conduct business with RTD, and they shall further disclose any large
personal/financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the Portfolio.
Employees and officers shall subordinate their personal investment transactions to those of RTD
particularly with regard to the timing of purchases or sales.
5. AUTHORIZED INVESTMENTS
Authorized investments for RTD funds are specifically listed below. RTD recognizes that
investment risk can result from issuer defaults, market price changes or various technical
impediments leading to diminished liquidity or loss of capital. Portfolio risk management and
diversification are employed as a way to minimize the risks inherent in investing.

the General Manager and his designees. The General Manager’s designee will hereinafter be
referred to as the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”).

Credit Criteria: Credit criteria listed in this section refer to the credit rating at the time the
security is purchased. Rating categories defined by nationally recognized statistical rating
organizations (“NRSROs”) include intermediate rating categories. For example, the second
highest rating category (“AA”) includes bonds rated AA+, AA and AA- for Standard & Poor's
and Fitch, and Aa1, Aa2 and Aa3 for Moody's Investors Service. In the event that an issuer or
security is downgraded below the minimum rating level for any specific security that is held in
the Portfolio, the CFO will review the exposure of that security holding and will determine if it is
advisable to sell such holding.
Maturity Restrictions: Maturity restrictions shall be calculated from settlement date to maturity
date. Portfolio percentage restrictions by security type and issuer are applicable only on the date
of purchase of the investment.
Sector Diversification: The Portfolio will be limited to an aggregate exposure of 50% for the
following investment types: Municipal Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Commercial Paper, Time

6. INVESTMENT PARAMETERS

RTD does not make investments for the purpose of trading or speculation, but, rather, with the
prevalent intent to hold securities to maturity. The prohibition of speculative investment
precludes pursuit of profit through unusual risk or conjectural fluctuations in market prices.
However, fluctuations in market rates or changes in credit quality may produce situations where
securities may be sold at a nominal loss in order to mitigate further erosion of principal or to
reinvest proceeds of sale in securities that will out-perform the original investment.
6.2 Competitive Bidding
A record shall be maintained of all bids and offers for securities transactions to support RTD’s
competitive pricing process. Relative offerings shall not be required in the purchase of
obligations at their initial auction or offering. Typically, awards will be made to the bidder
offering the highest effective yield consistent with the Policy: however, transaction costs,
diversification requirements, extraordinary events and other factors may be considered when
awarding investments.
6.3 Portfolio Duration
The maturity of the securities in the Portfolio shall be managed with respect to the cash flow
needs of RTD and the Portfolio shall be managed to maintain a duration of three years or less.
6.4 Authorized Financial Dealers and Institutions
RTD or an investment advisor hired by RTD will maintain a list of financial institutions
authorized to provide investment services and it shall be the policy of RTD to purchase securities
only from those authorized institutions and firms. Trading counterparties shall be limited to (i)
primary dealers reporting to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or (ii) broker/dealers that
qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
6.5 Authorized Investment Advisors
RTD may engage the services of one or more professional investment advisory firms to assist in
the management of the Portfolio. Such investment advisors may be granted discretion to
purchase and sell investment securities in accordance with this Policy and may utilize their own
approved list of broker/dealers. Such firms must be authorized to conduct business in the State
of Colorado and shall be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

6.1 Sale of Securities

1.B.3.b

7. SAFEKEEPING AND CUSTODY

With the exception of collateral under repurchase agreements (discussed below), all investment
securities purchased shall be held in a safekeeping account or trust custody account at a
designated third party custodian. For safekeeping accounts, the institution shall issue a
safekeeping receipt for each security, listing the specific instrument, par value, rate, CUSIP and
any other pertinent information. In addition, the safekeeping or trust custody institutions shall
provide a statement on at least a monthly basis listing all securities held in account, including
book value and market value of holdings at month-end.
For collateral (purchased securities) under repurchase agreements, RTD may utilize tri-party
repurchase agreements with an acceptable third-party custodian provided that RTD is satisfied
that it has perfected interest in the securities used as collateral, and that RTD has a properly
executed tri-party agreement.
7.2 Delivery vs. Payment
All investment transactions will be executed on a delivery versus payment basis.
8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Investment reports shall be prepared on a monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Transaction
summaries shall be maintained and available in the office of the CFO or other authorized
investment personnel. Quarterly investment reports shall be submitted to the Board of Directors
and shall outline RTD’s total investment return and compare the Portfolio’s performance to a
publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics.
Within 120 days of the end of RTD’s fiscal year, a comprehensive report on RTD’s investment
program and investment activity shall be prepared for the Board of Directors. The annual report
shall include quarterly comparisons of investment return and may suggest improvements that
might be made in the investment program. Such annual report shall include any other item of
significance which may enhance the understanding of the investment program. Each investment
advisor shall submit like reports in a timely manner based on the respective terms of each
contract and agreement
All securities holdings reports for RTD shall disclose the maximum maturity liability to RTD
(the stated maturity) as well as the first call date of each callable security held.
9. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
RTD's Portfolio is managed with the objective of obtaining a market rate of return,
commensurate with identified risk constraints and cash flow characteristics. Because the
composition of the Portfolio fluctuates, depending on market and credit conditions, various
indices may be used to monitor investment performance.

7.1 Safekeeping and custody

The current board-approved index for the liquidity tier of the Portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents) is the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. For the enhanced cash portion of the Portfolio (securities maturing between 90 days and
5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated performance benchmark is the
Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.
RTD recognizes that bond proceeds must be invested in accordance with Section 1.148 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code, related to arbitrage rebate, which limits the investment returns
which may be achieved or retained by RTD on such proceeds investments. For purposes of this
Policy “bond proceeds” shall mean proceeds from the issuance of bonds, certificates of
participation or other financial securities issued by RTD.
10. INVESTMENT POLICY REVIEW AND APPROVAL
The CFO shall conduct a review of the Policy on an annual basis and present the Policy,
denoting any changes, to the Board of Directors for approval.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

From:

Copp,

Date:

Subject:

Approval of 2017 Contribution for the Salaried
Employee's Retirement Plans

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: November 9, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
adopt a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust
(the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is also recommended that the
RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of 9% of each participant’s eligible compensation to
the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC Plan”), which contributes a specified amount
to the plan for each year of employment.
BACKGROUND
In December, 2007, the RTD Board of Directors closed the DB Plan to new employees with new
employees hired on January 1, 2008 and later participating in the DC Plan. From January 1, 2008 to
December 31, 2012 both the DB and DC Plan had been funded on a 9% of salaries basis.
DISCUSSION
DB Plan
In 2012, the Board of Directors agreed that beginning in 2013, annual contributions to the DB Plan
would be made at a fixed annual amount of $3.1 million rather than as a percentage of salaries as a
result of the actuary’s recommendation at that time. The fixed annual contribution of $3.1 million to the
DB Plan was determined by the plan’s actuaries to be the annual contribution necessary to maintain a
“fully funded” status for the plan in the future.
The actuaries have updated the DB Plan projections to reflect the final 1/1/2016 valuation assumptions
for the DB Plan. The 2017 Actuary recommended contribution is $7.63 million. If RTD contributes $4.6
million in 2017, $7.4 million in 2018, and a slightly declining amount each year, i.e. $7.2 million in
2019, 100% funding could be reached in 2031. This also assumes an annual rate of return of 7 1/2%
per year. This option has been deemed too costly to fund at this time.
The recommendation is to increase the annual fixed contribution by $500,000 to $4.6 million
DC Plan
Section 4.1 of the RTD Salaried Employees’ DC Plan adopted by the RTD Board provides that the
Employer may, at its sole discretion, set a contribution rate between 7 to 9% per year for participants.
The contribution rate has been 9% each year to the DC Plan from 2008 through 2016.

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors adopts a 2017 contribution of $4.6 million to RTD’s Salaried Employees’ Defined
Benefit Pension Trust (the “DB Plan”), which pays a specified monthly benefit at retirement. It is
also recommended that the RTD Board of Directors adopt a 2017 contribution of 9% of each
participant’s eligible compensation to the Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution Plan (the “DC
Plan”), which contributes a specified amount to the plan for each year of employment. These
amounts have been included in the 2017 Recommended Budget.
2. The RTD Board of Directors could certify an amount to be contributed to the RTD Salaried
Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Trust or the RTD Salaried Employees’ Defined Contribution
Plan at amounts other than $4.6 million and 9%, respectively.
3. Do not authorize a contribution to the RTD Salaried Employees’ Pension Plans. This is not
recommended because the DB Plan’s funding status would deteriorate and the liability would
increase.

Board Meeting Date: November 29, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorizes the General Manager/CEO or his
designee to enter into agreements with the insurance carriers.
BACKGROUND
Annually the staff brings the proposed Salaried Employee Benefits plan for approval to the Board of
Directors. Approval of the plan by the Board establishes the rates for Open Enrollment and provides
costs for the 2017 Budget. The Open Enrollment period for salaried staff begins November 6 through
November 20, 2016.
DISCUSSION
The goals for the 2017 plan year are: 1) Achieve the 2017 budget goals, 2) Continued focus on
containing cost and emphasis on improving health and wellness consumerism, 3) Maintain market
competitiveness, and 4) Insure compliance with PPACA – Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(Health Care Reform provisions as applicable to RTD).
Following is a summary of the changes for the 2017 plan year.
Medical
- Cigna administers two self-funded plans on behalf of RTD. Both the PPO Plan and the HDHP (High
Deductible Health Plan) Plan have a specific individual $150,000 stop-loss ceiling in 2017. The
administrative cost will increase by 9.8% in 2017. The Cigna Plans are estimated to have
approximately 518 employees enrolled. 2016 claims are running slightly lower than expected claims
YTD and 2017 claims are currently projected to be marginally lower than 2016 levels. The overall
increase in total premium is expected to be 7.3%
-

Kaiser provides two plan options: a DHMO (HMO Plan with deductibles), and a HDHP. The Kaiser
plans are estimated to have approximately 223 employees enrolled. This plan has proposed a 3.7%
blended increase over 2016.

-

The employee cost share for 2017 will be 10% for the Cigna PPO and Kaiser DHMO plans and 5%
for the Cigna HDHP and Kaiser HDHP plans.

Cigna has agreed to provide $15,000 to our wellness program in 2017.
Dental
- No carrier/plan changes and a -2.8% renewal rate decrease based on reduced major claims and
increased preventative care.
- The employee cost share for 2017 will be 25% on the Preferred Provider plan and 20% on the
Exclusive Provider plan, which offers a much smaller dental network. RTD will pay slightly more of
the premium this year in order to smooth out the percentages.

1.B.5

Life & Disability
- Basic Life Insurance/AD&D, Voluntary Life/AD&D, Long and Short Term Disability are under a multiyear rate guarantee; however, we have anticipated a 3% increase in the non-voluntary plans based
on increase in salary dollars for 2017. Life Insurance and LTD premiums are salary based.
Vision/Business Travel Accident
- Vision Plan is currently a fully insured plan with Anthem Blue Cross–Blue Shield. A rate guarantee is
in effect through 2017 so there will be no increase in premium.
-

We recently renewed the organization’s Business Travel Accident insurance for three years; there
was no increase in premium.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2017 planned Salaried Employee Benefit budget is projected to be a 5.37 % increase over 2016
projected benefit costs. RTD’s current utilization and projections are below the national medical trend of
6.0%-with no plan changesi.
The major cost impacts in 2017 are due to Cigna plan increases of 7.3%. The net additional benefit
costs anticipated in 2017 are essentially flat. Reduction in the Transitional Reinsurance fees and rate
guarantees are responsible for results of an approximate overall 5.37% increase over last year. This is
the seventh year we have achieved strong cost containment as a result of our shift in carriers, plan
offerings, plan design and funding models.
The 2017 estimate of the Salaried Employee Insured Benefits is $11,816.598. The projected increase
of 5.37% results in an increase of $634,706 in 2017. The increase meets the projected costs in the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the 2017 Plan Year Salaried Benefits plan and authorize the General Manager
or his designee to enter into agreements with the Insurance Carriers.
2. Further modify the salaried employee benefit plans to be offered in 2017. This is not
recommended since it would require additional negotiations with benefit providers and delay
the employee enrollment period.
3. Do not approve the recommended salaried employee benefit plans. This is not recommended, as
this will result in the Agency being unable to provide competitive and cost effective benefit
plans to the salaried employees.

NOTE: All projected costs are based on the current employees enrolled in 2016. Overall costs should
decrease as project employees complete their assigned projects and exit RTD throughout 2016.

BACKGROUND
In accordance with State law, the District submitted its proposed budget to the governing body
by October 15, 2016. By legal notice, the governing body presented the proposed 2017
Requested Budget for public review on October 8, 2016. A public hearing to solicit formal public
comment is scheduled for the November 29, 2016 regular meeting of the Board of Directors.

Packet Pg. 84

1.B.6

DISCUSSION
The total proposed current year appropriation for the 2017 Recommended Budget (combined
Base and FasTracks) is $2,169.2 million. This includes an operating expense budget of $626.1
million, interest expense of $160.9 million, capitalized interest of $33.0 million, new capital
expenditures of $301.0 million, debt payments of $58.9 million, FasTracks management reserve
of $15.9 million, FasTracks Internal Savings Account of $40.6 million, Board appropriated fund
of $29.7 million, capital replacement fund of $15.0 million, unrestricted operating reserve of
$9.7 million, and estimated unrestricted fund balance of $14.3 million. The previously approved
capital (capital carry forward) is $864.1 million. The sum of the budget appropriation and capital
carry forward is $2,169.2 million.
Overview of the 2017 RTD Recommended Budget
Revenues of $1,258.2 million on a combined basis are expected to increase $174.0 million
(16.1%) in 2017 from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to 1) an increase in
farebox revenue of $20.2 million, 2) an increase in sales/use tax revenue of $38.5 million, and 3)
an increase in grant revenue of $122.1 million, and 4) an increase in investment income of $0.4
million, offset by a decrease in other income of $7.2 million.









Combined (Base System and FasTracks) farebox revenues of $150.4 million are budgeted
to increase 15.5% over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. On the Base System, fare
revenue is budgeted to remain flat in 2017 and ridership as well is expected to be flat to
minimal. For FasTracks, farebox revenue is budgeted to increase $20.2 million over the
2016 Re-Amended Budget to $32.9 million due to the full-year operation of the FasTracks
service corridors brought on-line in 2016. The FasTracks estimate is per the Annual
Program Evaluation. Any ridership increases are attributed to FasTracks.
Sales and use tax revenue of $608.3 million in 2017 is expected to increase 6.7% over
the 2016 projected level according to the most recent September quarterly forecast by
the CU-Leeds School of Business. Compared to the growth rate used in the SBP of 5.2%
based on the CU-Leeds March forecast, the gain is $3.9 million. This differential between
the forecasts used in the SBP and the 2017 Budget is contributed to the unrestricted
operating reserve in the 2017 Budget.
Total Base System grants are projected to increase $30.5 million over the 2016 ReAmended Budget, including new and carry forward amounts. Base System grants are
estimated to total $148.0 million in 2017; of that amount, $94.1 million is new grants
while projected carryforward grant funding is $53.9 million. FasTracks grants are
budgeted at $328.9 million, an increase of $91.7 million from the 2016 Re-Amended
Budget largely due to significant projected carryforward grant funding of $119.7 million.
Investment income is budgeted to increase slightly by $0.4 million due to the impact of
continued low short term interest rates coupled with deployment of invested funds. An
expected small increase in interest rates will stabilize investment income.
Other operating income and other income together will decline by $7.2 million from the
2016 Re-Amended Budget due to the non-recurrence of $9.0 million released from
TABOR reserves in 2016, offset by full-year payment by the University of Colorado for
naming rights on the A Line and an increase in DUS rental income.

Operating expenditures are budgeted at $626.1 million on a combined basis in 2017 (excluding
depreciation), which is $12.2 million lower compared to the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base

Packet Pg. 85

1.B.6

System operating expenses are budgeted to increase $8.8 million, FasTracks Project operating
expenses are budgeted to decrease $24.8 million, and FasTracks Operations operating expenses
are budgeted to increase $3.8 million. On the Base System, departmental operating expenses
are targeted amounts derived from the SBP and amounts allocated for health insurance increases
for salaried personnel, costs for material salvage, an increase in LRV spare parts, wages and
salary adjustments, and other miscellaneous increases unknown at the time of the SBP. For
FasTracks Operations, the increase is generally due to full allocation from Base to FasTracks of
costs of operating the new service corridors offset by reclassification of TABOR interest expense
to FasTracks Project. The expense project carryforward to 2017 is $15.0 million for Base
System, $19.9 million for FasTracks Project, and $1.5 million for FasTracks Operations. It
should be noted that substantial reductions were made to departmental operating budgets to
align them with the SBP target, which offset unanticipated expense increases over 2016.
Diesel fuel is budgeted at the lock price of $1.69 per gallon, compared to a price of $2.23 per
gallon in the 2016 Re-Amended Budget, for year-over-year savings of approximately $5.3 million.
Compared to the budgeted price of $1.80 used in the SBP, the savings is $1.2 million. This
differential between the SBP and actual lock price is contributed to the unrestricted operating
reserve in the 2017 Budget. Gasoline is budgeted at $2.65/gallon, down from the 2016 per
gallon budget price of $3.00, for year-over-year savings of $0.6 million.
The major changes in operating expenses comparing the Recommended Budget to the posted
Requested Budget are shown in Attachment A. The majority of the changes from the Requested
Budget consist of the expense projects carry-forward.
Interest expense in 2017 is budgeted at $160.9 million on a combined basis, an increase of
$43.6 million over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. The increase is due to the inclusion of the
TABOR interest expense of $41.0 million as part of the DTO service payment for the first time in
2017 and new interest expense for the full year from the 2016 FasTracks bond issuance. This
increase is offset by a reduction to total interest expense from the favorable benefit of bond
refinancing. Of total interest expense, $25.5 million is budgeted for Base System and $135.4
million is budgeted for FasTracks. Capitalized interest (combined) is budgeted at $33.0 million,
the majority of which will occur in FasTracks Project. Capitalized interest will be part of the
actual cash outlay for interest payments in 2017.
Principal payments on debt are estimated at $58.9 million on a combined basis, which is $2.8
million lower than the 2016 Re-Amended Budget. Base System principal payments of $48.6
million are $3.3 million lower due to scheduled amortization of COPs issued for fleet purchases
(bus and rail). FasTracks principal payments of $10.3 million are $0.5 million higher due to
refundings and scheduled principal amortization on current debt. No new debt issuances are
planned in 2017 for either the Base System or FasTracks. Both will draw from previously issued
debt to fund major capital purchases and construction in 2017.
Capital expenditures are comprised of both the capital carry-forward from 2016 (previously
approved capital) arising from timing of project completion, and new capital for 2017. The
capital carry-forward will be $864.1 million made up of $166.1 million on the Base System and
$698.0 million on FasTracks.
New capital spending of $301.0 million on a combined basis will decrease $219.0 million from
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget due mainly to project completion in FasTracks. New capital
spending for FasTracks will decrease $175.8 million to $234.4 million in 2017 due to on-going

Packet Pg. 86

1.B.6

project completion on the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility, Eagle project, US36 BRT,
Northwest Rail and I-225, offset by increases to North Metro. For the Base System, new capital
spending will decrease $43.2 million to $66.6 million. Of this amount, the Base system will
spend $6.0 million more on facilities construction and maintenance (primarily Customer Care
Center relocation), $1.4 million on Park-n-Rides, and $4.1 million on systems planning (mostly
Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project). These increases will be offset by $1.0 million less on
bus infrastructure, $49.4 million less on fleet modernization/expansion (bus and rail), $5.3 million
less in capital support projects (primarily IT support for the District). The Base System new
capital was approved as part of the Strategic Budget Plan in September 2016 and is the amount
identified for minimum “must have” projects.
New capital expenditures for 2017 and the change in new capital in the 2017 Recommended
Budget over the previous 2017 Requested Budget/Strategic Budget Plan are shown in
Attachment B. The capital carry-forward expenditures for 2017 and the change in the capital
carry-forward in the 2017 Recommended Budget over the 2016 Re-Amended Budget are shown
in Attachment C.
Notable designated fund balance changes include a minimal decrease in the Base System yearend unrestricted fund balance from the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $2.0 million. This
projected fund balance is in agreement with the SBP target of $2.0 million after incorporating all
revenue and expense adjustments. The actual amount realized, however, may be lower (or
higher) than that projected due to lower (or higher) fare revenue and sales tax revenue in 2016
(this will become evident in the 2017 amended budget). Also on the Base System, the Boardappropriated fund is projected to increase by $7.0 million to $17.4 million, the capital
replacement fund is projected to increase by $2.7 million to $2.7 million, and an unrestricted
operating reserve is established for the first time in 2017 at $9.7 million.
The FasTracks management reserve (formerly contingency reserve) is budgeted at $15.9 million.
The FasTracks construction reserve is budgeted at $56.3 million. In FasTracks Project and
FasTracks Operations, the Board-appropriated fund, capital replacement fund, and unrestricted
fund are established at 3 months of operating expenses up from 2 months previously.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to increase $2.9 million from
the 2016 Re-Amended Budget to $14.3 million. The Board-appropriated fund, the capital
replacement fund, and the unrestricted operating reserve are projected to increase by $25.3
million in total. These increases are in minimum accordance with fiscal policies for each of the
District entities (Base System, FasTracks Project and FasTracks Operations) per Fund Balance
Policy below.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The 2017 Recommended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado
General Assembly. The estimated SB 154 recovery ratio (all non-tax revenue except ADA
farebox revenues divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures
and expenditures incurred for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure)
exceeds the annual target of 30% mandated by the General Assembly.

Packet Pg. 87

1.B.6

Fund Balance Policy
The Fund Balance Policy for 2017 requires fund balances to consist of a Board-appropriated
fund, a capital replacement fund, the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance for both the
Base System and FasTracks, and an additional unrestricted operating reserve currently for the
Base System. The objective is for the total of these funds excluding the capital acquisition fund
to equal approximately three months of operating expenses excluding depreciation for both Base
System and FasTracks. The 2017 budget reflects maintenance of a FasTracks management
reserve and construction reserve at levels deemed sufficient to fund adjustments to the
FasTracks construction schedule.
The total of these unrestricted fund balances for 2017 on a District-wide basis is projected at
$68.7 million, comprised of 1) the Board-appropriated fund of $29.7 million, 2) the capital
replacement fund of $15.0 million, 3) the unrestricted operating reserve of $9.7 million, and 4)
the remaining unrestricted year-end fund balance of $14.3 million. The Base System portion of
these fund balances listed for 2017 is projected to total $31.8 million.
Basis of Accounting Used in Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the GAAP accrual basis of accounting with two
exceptions:





Capital outlays and payments of bond principal are treated as expenditures.
Gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment are excluded.
The non-cash portion of the long-term unfunded pension accrual is excluded.
Asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included.
Attachments

As noted above, please refer to the attached Fiscal Year 2017 Recommended Budget and Fiscal
Year 2017 Recommended Budget-Fund Balance (Exhibit I) which shows the operating/nonoperating sources, debt and reserves, and capital sources as well as operating uses, capital
expenditures, and fund balances of the District, and a reconciliation of net assets. Also attached
is the Program Capital Summary including previously approved capital, an Operating Budget
Changes Since Posted Budget summary (Attachment A), a New Capital Projects summary
(Attachment B), and Capital Carryforward Expenditures (Attachment C).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is the recommended action.
2. Revise the 2017 Recommended Budget and adopt with Board-directed revisions.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Recommended Budget. This is not recommended since the District
will not be in compliance with State regulations that require the District to adopt a budget by
December 31, 2016. If the District does not adopt a budget before December 31, 2016, State
statute (29-1-108 (3) C.R.S.) specifies the following penalty:

Reconciling items reflect cash activity in capital projects, inventory, accounts receivable and prepaids, accruals and capitalized interest.

2

Reserves include funds that are legally restricted by bond covenants, other contracts, Board designation and policy guidelines.

3

Reserves are an appropriated reserve which is available to fund unforseen projects expenses (such as a contingency reserve).

4

Reserves respresent revenues that are designated to be spent in future years for the construction of the FasTracks capital program.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the third quarter of 2016 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the third
quarter of 2016. The U.S. unemployment rate was little changed at 4.9% and general inflationary
pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to leave the federal funds target rate range (0.25% - 0.50%), unchanged from the prior
quarter. The Federal Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby
supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2% inflation.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier (3 months or less)
RTD cash and cash equivalents:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the third quarter of 2016 was 0.80% which
would produce annualized earnings of $1,537,625. The yield for the last month of the prior quarter
(June) was 0.92%.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

FasTracks Bond Sale Update

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: November 15, 2016
Information

INFORMATION
As previously approved by the Board, staff has taken steps necessary to issue FasTracks Bonds to
provide funding for design and construction of the FasTracks projects currently under construction. This
process has been under way for several months and the District recently reached the milestones of
pricing the bonds on October 27, 2016.
The Bonds were underwritten by a team of investment banks which included Goldman Sachs as senior
manager and Harveston Securities, RBC Capital Markets, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Piper
Jaffray as co-managers.
Staff received several phone calls from institutional investors shortly after the pending bond sale was
advertised. The ability to speak with RTD finance staff allowed potential investors to ask questions and
get comfortable with the idea of purchasing the bonds.
The Bonds were brought to market in the par amount of approximately $195 million and generated a
premium of $35 million generating total proceeds of $230 million. Costs of Issuance, including the
Underwriter’s Discount are expected to be approximately $1.3 million. The interest rate obtained for the
bonds is 3.91% which is in line with staff expectations and within the Board approved parameters
outlined in the Bond Resolution.
During this process, the District requested credit ratings for the bonds from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s
and Fitch. Staff prepared and presented thorough presentations to all three rating agencies and provided
a walking tour of Denver Union Station to demonstrate the progress that RTD is making on the
FasTracks projects.
Standard & Poor’s affirmed their AA+ rating and stable outlook for the RTD FasTracks bonds. Moody’s
affirmed their Aa2 rating and stable outlook. Fitch used their new rating methodology and affirmed their
AA rating and stable outlook to the RTD FasTracks bonds. Through the use of this new Fitch
methodology, they also issued a two notch upgrade to RTD COPs to AA- from A and downgraded RTD’s
senior bonds which were originally issued to fund the T-Rex projects to AA from AA+.
“Investment Grade” ratings fall within the following ranges, with AAA (S&P and Fitch) and
Aaa (Moody’s) reflecting minimal default risk:

Institutional investors who purchased substantial amounts of the bonds included JP Morgan ($75

RTD received the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors, Butler Snow
LLP as Bond Counsel and Hogan Lovells as Disclosure Counsel in regard to the bonds.
The closing for this financing transaction is scheduled to occur November 17, 2016.

Information

The Smart Card Program continues to gather taps for EcoPass (business and neighborhood) and
CollegePass riders since the program’s launch on January 2, 2013. There are approximately 475,000
active cards in circulation. During the month of October, 2016, 1.57M taps were recorded.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards. These cards can be loaded with certain dollar amounts and
used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or rail until the dollar
amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto the card at RTD
sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. As of November 1, 2016, a total of 1,920 cards were issued of
which 1,520 (79%) were full fare and 400 (21%) were discount cards. The average initial stored value
loading is $41.09 with a total value loaded including reloads of $297,300. There have been 106,010
boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $233,900. Of these boardings; 70%
were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations were completed for operational service. Additional validators will be installed as
buses are purchased.
Additional platform validators were installed for the University of Colorado A Line and B line to
Westminster. More platform validators will be installed on the G Line to Wheat Ridge and the R line to
Aurora. All 191 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been installed and are operational.
