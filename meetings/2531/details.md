#### 1. Proposed Winter 2016/2017 Service Changes

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Winter 2016/2017 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in an annualized cost savings of approximately $1,337,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions. Based upon current and past ridership performance Route 116 Limited is proposed to be discontinued. Also related to its ridership performance, the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride is proposed to be continued contingent upon discovery of alternative funding from sources outside RTD. Additionally, service reductions on the W Line (light rail) are proposed in an effort to match the level of service and expense to current ridership demands. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS

Eight public hearings were held in Aurora, Brighton, Denver, Highlands Ranch, Ken Caryl, Lakewood, and Stapleton Denver at the Blake Administration building. Comments and further details from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in Attachment B of this report.

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS

Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus: the proposal to discontinue this route has been rescinded.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: the proposal to discontinue the Call-n-Ride, has been modified and is contingent upon funding alternatives.

SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service reductions:

Route 40 – Colorado Boulevard: discontinue the 6:32pm northbound trip from Colorado Center

Route 89 – Stapleton/Anschutz Campus:  proposal to discontinue service rescinded

Route 116L – Ken Caryl Limited:  discontinues service on the Route 116L, due to very low ridership.

Route 169L – Buckley Road/Denver Airport: discontinue 7:10pm southbound trip daily and 5:10pm southbound trip on Saturday and Sunday only.

Highlands Ranch call-n-Ride: continue the Call-n-Ride, contingent upon alternative funding

RockiesRide: discontinue all but two RockiesRide bus services

W Line (FasTracks): discontinue 16 Monday-Friday trips in the AM and PM peak periods

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:

Route 324 – Main Street Crosstown:  reroute of service currently on St. Vrain School District property

Route R/RC/RX – Brighton/ Denver; Brighton/Denver Express: renaming of route

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments

Route 15 – East Colfax: running time analysis

Rail Lines proposed for routine schedule adjustments:

Minor running time adjustments are proposed for all light rail lines: C, D, E, F, H, and W Lines, on all service days.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a cost reduction of $962,000 from FasTracks and $375,000 cost saving from the base system, for a total savings of approximately $1,337,000 annualized.

EQUITY ANALYSIS

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed Winter 2016/2017 service changes does not reveal any disparities in impacts absorbed by minority or low-income populations.

A Look Ahead – May 2017

L – Line

A proposed solution to D Line on-time performance issues and consequentially, overall light rail system performance, this proposal introduces a modification to current D Line operations. The L  Line adds a new 30th& Downing to 14th Street Loop (Downtown) movement, replacing the D Line service between 30th & Downing Station and 19th Street. More extensive information regarding this proposal will be made available in a future update to the Board of Directors.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the October 25, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, communicated to the Board that staff had cancelled the October 23rd service change.  He stated there were a variety of restructurings associated with rail changes, which would not be implemented until later this year.  He noted today, staff will be discussing the winter 2016/2017 service changes.

Jesse Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, remarked that there were a total of 8 public hearings with 84 participants.  He commented that the largest number of inquiries were for Route 89 and the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.  He said staff has removed the Route 89 from the service change schedule and there is an update for the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.

Bruce Abel noted that staff received a letter from the Douglas County Commissioners and staff is currently considering a new option.  He stated staff communicated to Douglas County that RTD could continue this service under a cost sharing alternative, where Douglas County would fund half of the costs associated with the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride.  He added that it is currently under review by the Douglas County Commissioners and staff will update the Board when additional information is available.

Director Deadwyler noted that the 89 has been problematic for the past couple of years.  She asked why this route was removed from the service change schedule.

Jesse Carter stated after review of the subsidy level and ridership numbers, this route is in the middle of the pack.

Director Bagley said this is the fourth time that the Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride has come up for discontinuance.  He commented that RTD has tried everything with regards to marketing and working with local municipalities to promote the service, but added if the community does not adopt the service, it will not work.

Director Sisk commented that the Rockies Ride from Boulder is being eliminated.  He stated that all of the Directors need to step up and put the needs of the Regional District ahead of their own districts.

Director Hoy noted he had several calls about Route 31, but stated the 31 is not included in the winter service changes.

Jesse Carter remarked that when people say the 31, they are usually referring to the 31L.  He noted that the 31L will change once the G line is opened.

Director Menten asked if the winter service changes would affect Access-a-Ride.

Jesse Carter indicated there would be no changes to Access-a-Ride, and none of the Access-a-Ride riders would be affected.

#### 2. Authorization to enter into contract with Protran Technology for purchase of Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System (16DR0003)

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into a contract not to exceed $1,500,000 with Protran Technology for the purchase of a Railway Worker Protection Early Warning System and associated equipment (Contract Number 16DR003).

Motion:               Director Lubow made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the October 25, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, stated that the avoidance of work accidents and fatalities has been in the spotlight for many years.  He said that RTD’s current policy relies on human notification, but the Early Warning System can provide better, and more timely warnings.  He added that RTD received competitive bids, but only two proposers met the specifications.

Director Bagley said it critical that the Board makes sure our employees are safe.  He stated that the Maintenance of Way employees are important, and we need to send a message to our patrons that the Board cares enough about staff to protect them.  He added that if our ridership does not think the Board is taking care of its employees, what will they think about the manner in which they are cared for.  He asked his fellow Board members to support this too.

Director Deadwyler agreed that employees need to be protected.  She noted her concerns with the University of Colorado A line, and commented that this money might be needed to fix issues with that line.  She said employees need to be safe, but light rail has been running for 23 years with no issues.

Director Solano agreed with Director Deadwyler and stated these funds might need to be diverted.  He commented that this should be tabled until next month.

Director Walker remarked that maintenance is critical for both old and new systems.  He added that one accident is one too many and by passing this item, maintenance crews will be able to operate more effectively with the better notification system.

Chair Tobiassen said this is something that he has been discussing for several years and asked why RTD did not have this yet.  He stated he would be supporting this item to enhance the safety of RTD’s workers and to give them the extra seconds they need to clear the tracks.  He added that anything the Board can do to enhance safety is imperative.

Director Lubow said she would be supporting this item.  She remarked that staff has been waiting to get this since 2011 because it kept getting pushed back in favor of other projects.

Committee Chair Anderson commented that she is the daughter and granddaughter of rail road workers.  She said getting injured is always a possibility and anything the Board can do to improve the safety of our workers should be done.  She said the cost of this contract does not compare to someone’s life.

Director Sisk stated he had represented someone who had been crushed between two trains, and that person lives in a way that they had never imagined.  He said he cannot be more unequivocal about supporting this.

#### 1. RTD Code of Conduct

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, said this is an advance preview of a proposed Code of Conduct for RTD’s passengers.  He stated that since RTD has been in existence, it has not had a comprehensive code of conduct governing behavior for passengers on RTD vehicles, facilities or property.  He added that other transit agencies have such codes which help passengers understand what they can or cannot do.  He stated that the codes help passengers understand acceptable behavior and assist transit police and staff communicate, and if necessary, enforce.  He commented that the attached code has been developed after review of codes by other peer transit agencies, with input from Senior Leadership and other agencies.  He indicated that staff plans to bring this to the Board for approval at the November 15th Financial Administration and Audit Committee, and for final adoption at the November 22nd Board Meeting.

Steve Martingano, Transit Police Commander of Fare Enforcement Operations, added that when people come to the Blake offices to complain, staff cannot show anything in writing where it states what behaviors people can or cannot do.

Mike Meader, Chief Security Officer and Assistant General Manager of Security & Asset Management, stated the Code of Conduct will be used to educate people so that everyone has a better experience when they ride the buses or trains.

Director Bagley said it is imperative to adopt something like this.  He added that it is crucial to have, as it gives our employees something to stand behind.  He remarked that he has seen inappropriate behaviors and activities on the Mall Shuttle and he thinks finalizing the Code of Conduct will be a good step forward.

Director Deadwyler indicated that she is in favor of establishing a Code of Conduct, but she is concerned as she does not want to add extra work for the bus drivers.  She added that she does not believe anyone on staff knows how to recognize people with cognitive disabilities, and staff needs to be able to identify those patrons.

Director Solano stated that until there is fare check consistency between light rail and commuter rail, this Code of Conduct is presumptive.

Director Sisk said staff needs to be careful when finazliing the Code of Conduct.  He added that we need to be clear on what we want to achieve.

Director Menten asked to sit down with staff offline to discuss a few changes.

Chair Tobiassen stated that he was surprised that the Code of Conduct was not already documented.  He said there are a lot of disturbances on the 15L that are problematic, and sometimes those situations escalate.

Director Hoy inquired about the Code of Conduct process going forward.

Rolf Asphaug remarked that staff anticipates bringing this back to the Financial Administration and Audit Committee in November for approval, and then to the November Board Meeting for final adoption.

Director Lubow commented that she attended a candidate forum hosted by 9 to 5, and some people there claimed that RTD Security profiled in its enforcement.  She said there were a lot of comments and it would be useful to discuss those remarks.

Director Menten mentioned that the timeline Rolf presented was pushing this item forward too quickly.  She asked that this come back to the Board in December after there has been public outreach efforts.

Director James commended staff for bringing this to the attention of the Board.

##### a. 2016-10-13 Code of Conduct

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley reminded the Board that tomorrow, October 19th would be the last day to complete the General Manager’s Survey.  He indicated the survey takes a bit of time to complete and asked those who had not submitted their survey to do so.  He noted the General Manager had a quarterly update press conference today and stated it is imperative that the updates are on YouTube, or aired live so that the public can see what RTD is doing.  He added that this information should be for everyone.

Director Solano stated he is putting together a panel discussion for ADA and Access-a-Ride issues.  He said addressing these topics will help everyone understand how Access-a-Ride works, and why it works the way that it does.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Anderson adjourned the meeting at 6:41 p.m.
