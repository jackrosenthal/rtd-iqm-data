## III. Other Matters

Chair Tisdale suggested that meals for the Directors and staff required to attend meetings of the Board be served on the third floor of the Blake Street building, rather than in the Boardroom, referred to internally as R, T, & D. He offered several reasons for doing so, stating that the food would not appear on camera during the recorded meetings, that the food could be seen as distracting to the viewing and visiting public, and that Directors might be self-conscious eating during meetings knowing that they were being recorded. He said he had made it a point to eat before Tuesday night’s meeting to avoid eating on camera.

Director Deadwyler said that she had always been uncomfortable eating in front of the public in the Boardroom. She said she fully endorsed moving the meals to the third floor.

Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed and said she felt strange eating in front of others. She asked whether staff would eat downstairs.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that staff would also eat on the third floor. She said that the Directors could eat in their own offices on occasions when the conference room was unavailable.

Director Lubow said she appreciated the ability to eat as the meetings started, because she had a tendency to be late, but she agreed that the appearance would be better if meals were served upstairs.

Chair Tisdale said that some sort of accommodation could be devised for Directors who ran late.

Director Deadwyler said that serving food on the third floor would also give close access to a microwave.

Ms. McManus said that the food would not be left out until the end of the meeting or meetings.

Director Walker said he agreed with the proposal. He said he usually tried to eat before the meetings, because he did not like the optics of eating in front of others. He said that guests from the public took time off from work in order to attend meetings and would likely have to delay eating dinner themselves. He said he would be fine stopping meals altogether, except for those provided to staff required to attend meetings.

Director Menten said she had no comment.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she had a problem with the policy that barred security personnel from eating the food provided for the Board and staff.

General Manager Genova said that the rules were changed so that security personnel were allowed to eat the food, so long as they were not eating while carrying out their duties.

Chair Tisdale said he had neglected to inform the committee that he had spoken with General Manager Genova about that change. He said the problem had been addressed and resolved.

Ms. McManus said that the Board Office had previously shared pizzas and boxed lunches with security personnel, but she said that foods that could potentially cause illness if not properly stored were not shared.

Chair Tisdale said the committee would need a motion to adopt this policy.

Director Lubow asked whether the rest of the Board should be included in the decision.

Chair Tisdale said the policy needed to be addressed immediately, but he said the other members could provide feedback.

Director Deadwyler suggested that a memo could be sent out, but she said the change should not present a problem.

Chair Tisdale said that the change would only apply to meals served before committee meetings, as meals preceding Board meetings were already served on the third floor. He said a better way to phrase the motion would be to state that the serving of meals prior to committee meetings would now follow same model as meals served at Board meetings.

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to allow for a change in Board procedure for the serving of meals.

Director Folska, Ph.D., seconded the motion.

Vote on

the Motion:               The motion passed with 5 in favor and 0 opposed.

Chair Tisdale said that the motion passed unanimously and stated that he would speak to another matter regarding motions later on in the meeting. He asked if any Directors had other matters to discuss before the General Manager presented his updates.

Director Lubow said she was surprised and saddened to hear about the late Mayor Steve Hogan. She asked whether his passing would have an effect on RTD, given that Mayor Hogan was a great supporter of the agency.

General Manager Genova said that RTD had a good relationship with the management and staff of the City of Aurora. He said he was planning on attending Mayor Hogan’s memorial services.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said she would attend as well.

Chair Tisdale noted that he was in Aurora the previous evening to attend auditions for persons interested in appearing in segments regarding the R Line, which would air on the local public access station. He said he had suggested the idea of such programming to Mayor Hogan the previous year. He said the number of people auditioning was evidence of the fact that everyone in Aurora was invested in the continued development and success of the R Line.

Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that the R Line featured prominently in the City of Aurora’s marketing materials.

Director Deadwyler said she wanted to follow up on an earlier discussion about compensating individuals inconvenienced by the recent shut down of the A Line. She said one gentleman in particular had missed being able to attend a baseball game, for which he had paid a large amount of money.

General Manager Genova said that the agency responded to the gentleman via the General Manager’s Response (GMR) process. He said the agency’s policy was to not reimburse passengers for their losses, and he said that other transit agencies followed that policy as well, as did other organizations such as taxi companies and network transportation companies. He said that Denver Transit Partners (DTP) had responded in a similar fashion. He said that the policy was the agency’s stance unless the Board wanted staff to reevaluate.

Director Deadwyler said she thought the agency should reevaluate its policy. She said the agency should determine what was reimbursable, and she stated the man who missed the ballgame had lost $600 from having been stuck on the train for three hours. She said airlines gave free tickets to inconvenienced passengers, and she said that doing nothing would be bad for the agency’s reputation.

Director Menten said she would personally worry about guaranteeing service on RTD’s system. She said that there were many examples of people who would seek reimbursements and that a missed run on a bus could lead to a person missing a job interview, which could result in the potential loss of thousands of dollars. She said she was concerned where that policy would lead.

Director Deadwyler said the reimbursements should be discretionary.

Chair Tisdale suggested that staff check with the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and its committees to see whether relevant information had been gathered by other agencies across the country.

Director Lubow said the agency’s response felt rude but acknowledged that reimbursing inconvenienced passengers could lead to a slippery slope. She said she would urge staff to investigate how this was dealt with elsewhere, and she stated there must be a way to address similar situations in a way that felt less abrupt. She said that, if nothing else, the agency could send an apology email.

Ms. McManus said that RTD responded to all of the people who contacted the agency.

Chair Tisdale noted that the agency did not collect contact information as of the time of the incident, but he stated that staff responded if the passengers reached out.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether the passengers were given new tickets.

General Manager Genova said they were given new tickets in some cases.

Chair Tisdale said that felt like an appropriate response.

Director Lubow asked whether it would be possible to give passengers who missed flights a 10-ride fare coupon book.

General Manager Genova said that the Customer Care department typically gave out a few free ride coupons to the affected people if the agency did not perform properly.

Director Lubow raised a point of procedure and said she had always felt uncomfortable that committee members were allowed to speak during committee meetings before non-committee members. She said it had always bothered her that non-members spoke last.

Chair Tisdale said he was always open to whatever the committee decided. He said his approach had been to try to give accord to the committee members first.

Director Walker said he was not in favor of giving people money for lost wages, and he asked where the line was between people between who were directly and indirectly affected. He said there were risks with everything people do.

Director Deadwyler said that the agency should have some sort of discretionary budget to reimburse persons who could prove a monetary loss. She said she did not feel that everyone should be reimbursed, such as those simply inconvenienced by a bus running late. She said that, if a person could prove a loss of dollars, the agency and DTP would be held accountable and would put people first because of having to pay. She said her concern was for fare-paying passengers, and she said that they might not have incurred losses if they were allowed to leave the train. To address Director Lubow’s comment, she said that persons not on the committee should speak last. She said she had been in enough committees of which she was a member but was required to speak last.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said she felt Director Deadwyler’s point about reimbursement was a valid one. She said that weather delays were one thing. She stated that those who incurred a loss should be required to prove their monetary loss. She said she was tired of hearing that things break, and she added that the train was relatively new and that DTP had been operating for decades. She said the way DTP responded made them seem like deer in headlights. She asked why DTP did not think to remove the passengers first, and she said she was appalled.

Director Menten said that, having owned an auto shop, she knew that things would break, new or not. She said the reason RTD did not offer reimbursements was the same reason car manufacturers did not cover the cost of towing. She said that the problem was one of process. She stated that such issues would continue, and she reiterated that she did not want the agency to try to guarantee a public service. She said such a guarantee would cost the agency, and she said she would be more concerned with the person who missed a job interview as a result of a dropped run. She said that people were focused on the train but noted that similar instances happened with buses as well.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she regularly requested reimbursement from utility providers at times when they were unable to provide their services.

Director Menten said there was a difference between giving passengers a credit and a check.

Director Deadwyler said that everything broke down. She said that the highway patrol would not leave her sitting on the side of the road if her car broke down, and she said that similarly people should not have been left sitting on trains. She said only those who could prove a monetary loss should be reimbursed.

Chair Tisdale reiterated that the request to staff was to compile information from other states or districts to help the Board address certain situations where people were unable to access alternate means of transportation for extended periods. He said that, when buses or trains break down, the agency was usually able to provide alternate transportation. He said that the information gathered from other districts would help the Executive Committee’s further discussion, which could then be sent back to committee for potential action.

Director Lubow said that Chair Tisdale’s proposal covered too narrow a focus. She said that the most recent incident fit those criteria but said that another incident might not fit. She agreed that she would like to see what other agencies do when people have been terribly inconvenienced.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether operators have the discretion to give inconvenienced passengers additional tickets if they were approaching the expiration of their passes.

General Manager Genova said that, under certain circumstances, operators or street supervisors had the discretion to issue a transfer or a free ride coupon.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the instance in which passengers had to be evacuated from the top of a bridge would be a similar situation.

General Manager Genova said that that situation was different. He said there was no power in the overhead line, which meant that a rescue train could not be brought in. He said that commuter rail trains featured level boarding, whereas passengers would have to step down from light rail vehicles. He said that the preferred option for reaching a stranded train would be the use of a rescue train, and he noted that right-of-way evacuations were not preferred because of the potential hazards. He said he was not defending the time required for DTP to deliver those passengers back to safety, but he said that the deployment of fire trucks and equipment vehicles was time-consuming.

Director Menten asked what the agency provided for emergency bathrooms on trains.

General Manager Genova said the trains had no such provision.

Director Menten asked how passengers relieved themselves.

General Manager Genova said that he knew of one passenger who relieved himself in the corner of the train.

Director Menten said that the agency should look into providing a five-gallon bucket with sawdust for emergency situations.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked about an incident that occurred on the W Line earlier in 2018. She said that a customer witnessed a man engaging in an indecent act and reported it to RTD. She said the incident was not handled appropriately and Customer Care did not follow up as it should have. Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for more details on the response.

Chair Tisdale said that the incident was the subject of a GMR and had been addressed. He said the customer had been contacted and was satisfied with the resolution of the incident.

General Manager Genova said that security had tried unsuccessfully to pull video from the incident. He said the onboard video system on the train was not working properly, though the platform cameras were. He said that RTD provided images for the Golden Police Department, though Golden did not pick up the files from RTD security command. General Manager Genova said that RTD reached out to the Chief of Police in Golden about the incident and that the agency had since changed its practices, so that security command would contact the local police jurisdiction if footage was not retrieved within 24 hours. Regarding light-rail vehicle cameras, he said that the manufacturer of the vehicles, Siemens, would not allow RTD to upgrade the video components without contract amendments. He said staff was trying to standardize video on light-rail vehicles. He noted that video systems upgrades had been deferred due to their cost but were included in the midterm financial plan.

Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that General Manager Genova had spoken with the customer, and she asked how long the agency would wait for law enforcement.

General Manager Genova said that security would pull video immediately after a known incident. He said law enforcement would be contacted within 24 hours if they did not retrieve the footage.

Director Deadwyler said that customers who experience security incidents become frustrated when RTD cannot provide additional information. She suggested that a special section of the call center could be dedicated to providing comprehensive information.

Chair Tisdale noted that the RTD Transit Watch app was available and would allow for users to capture and report incidents and communicate in real time with security personnel.

Director Deadwyler asked if the agency should refer customers to the app.

General Manager Genova said that the agency made people aware of the app’s availability. He said that, in addition to the features mentioned by the Chair, users could both record videos of events in progress and place a call to security.

Chair Tisdale said that he had mentioned the app to many people. He said he was appalled by the number of women who reported they were not comfortable riding transit services due to the perceived security risks.

Director Menten said that the Golden Police Department did not participate in the security program wherein members of law enforcement served as auxiliary transit security officers. She asked how best to share information between police departments.

General Manager Genova said that police departments had ways of sharing.

Ms. McManus reminded the committee that there were two technical workshops on transit apps that were scheduled for the following week. She said that RTD security personnel would not be in attendance but could share with attendees how to download the Transit Watch app.

Director Folska, Ph.D., referring to the incident discussed earlier, said that the person affected was an adult woman, and she asked what would have happened if the person was a child. She said she was confronted with all manner of incidents when she was a young transit rider, which could be terrifying. She said that, if this adult woman’s report fell through the cracks, she was concerned what young people could expect to encounter.

General Manager Genova said that the agency required robust design criteria, with many layers of security, and he said improvements were made every year.

Chair Tisdale said that he and the General Manager had discussed the incident several times and was comfortable with the solution. He said the key was continual communication.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the Transit Watch app should be included in the safety briefing.

Chair Tisdale said that was a wonderful idea.

General Manager Genova said that he had presented the agency’s annual FasTracks briefing to the Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) the previous day. He said he had shared his talking points via email to the full Board. He said that the most interesting item he covered concerned the grade-crossing verifications of the A Line. He said that RTD and Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) staff had field-verified eight of the 11 crossings on the A Line, and he added that the CPUC staff was filing paperwork to include those eight crossings on the CPUC agenda. He stated RTD had filed corollary paperwork and was monitoring the progress closely. He said the reason the other three crossings had not been field-verified was due to signal traffic controlling.

Director Deadwyler asked which three crossings had not passed field-verification.

General Manager Genova said he would report back but knew one of them to be the Quebec crossing. He said his hope was that those three crossings would be tested the following week and that, if they were to pass, the next step would be to add those crossings to the CPUC agenda as well. He said at that point RTD could provide notice of the removal of the grade crossing attendants following the public outreach agreed to in the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) plan, for which the longest notification window was seven days. He said that the grade crossing attendants could be removed from the crossings following CPUC notification to that effect. Regarding the quiet zone process, he said that RTD was sending paperwork to regulators describing the agency’s description of its process to meet the constant warning times required by the FRA, though he noted the FRA’s definition of “constant warning time” was not straightforward. He said that the notice of intent to establish quiet zones was submitted much earlier and that the current paperwork was indication of the agency’s desire to proceed to the next step. General Manager Genova said that the agency would have to apply for a waiver if the FRA were to determine that the system did not meet the requirements for constant warning time, but he was hopeful that would not be necessary. Regarding the G Line, he said the field testing would hopefully begin the following week, but he noted the agency was waiting to hear from the FRA on the schedule. He added that the testing along the G Line could be completed during daylight hours, as opposed to the A Line testing, which had to be done during non-revenue hours in the middle of the night.

Chair Tisdale said that it was important to share this information with everyone in the region and that they would want to know what the outreach would involve.

General Manager Genova said that the outreach would involve notices to schools, news releases, and public service announcements to jurisdictions.

Director Deadwyler said that her biggest concern was for the three locations that did not pass. She said that the Quebec crossing was close to the constituents who had been the most vocal about their concerns. She asked what was being done.

General Manager Genova responded that staff was doing everything possible to address those crossings and that the fix should be relatively quick. He said the system was being adjusted and that the necessary parts were on order.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the agency could inquire about the FRA’s interpretation of constant warning time before the FRA’s determination was made.

General Manager Genova said that staff had made inquiries. He said staff felt that the current design met the FRA’s intent.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what the go live schedule might be.

General Manager Genova said it would not be clear until testing had been performed. He said the next step was getting through the grade crossing verification and testing. He said staff had submitted a concurrent request to allow multiple trains to run on the G Line for testing purposes, as the current limit was set two trains for the entire line. He added that, following approval of the grade crossing tests and the removal of the train limit, the next phase was the system demonstration period, and he said that the DTP contract stated that period was set at 21 days.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked whether this would be a six-month process.

General Manager Genova said it would not take six months. He said that, after the system demonstration process, staff would petition the FRA to add the G Line to the waiver that addressed the A Line. He stated the process would take a couple of months, but he said he was not comfortable setting a date until the test data was available.

Chair Tisdale said that the agency would like to see an opening by Independence Day.

Director Deadwyler mentioned that Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, had sent a potential news alert about an incident in which vehicles had inappropriately stopped inside of the crossing gate arms as a train was approaching. She asked what the agency was doing to educate people.

General Manager Genova said the motorists were not paying attention, violated the stop signs, and stopped in the wrong place.

Director Deadwyler said that the area within the crossing gates must have been sizeable if it could accommodate two vehicles.

Chair Tisdale said they ran the red lights in order to get into the area beyond the crossing gates.

General Manager Genova agreed and said the vehicles were too late entering into the crossing. He said he reviewed the video of the incident, and the flashing lights at the gates were behind the vehicles, indicating that the motorists must have seen them and ignored them. He said that motorists often start to proceed through crossing gates as soon as the arms go up, despite the fact that the red lights are still flashing.

Director Folska, Ph.D., recalled an incident in 2010 when a man was killed because he went around the crossing gate arms after the first train had passed and was killed as a second train came from the opposite direction. She said that the gate arms often came down for multiple trains.

General Manager Genova noted that RTD employed signs to warn of the approach of a second train, whereas most systems did not display such signage.

Chair Tisdale said that there were systems in place to give protections and that, despite those systems, there were people who would not abide by the rules.

General Manager Genova said that he had hoped to provide information regarding the FRA to the Board at the meeting on Tuesday of that week, but he said the meeting ran late. He said he would send updates on the progress of the testing.

Chair Tisdale said that he had spoken with Rolf Asphaug, RTD General Counsel, about the practice of reading in full motions to approve recommended actions. Chair Tisdale said Mr. Asphaug indicated that Directors were under no obligation to read the entire motion and could instead give an introductory summary of the verbiage. He said that motions were typically read in full as a general rule, but in practice, in the case of a particularly long recommended action, Directors could simply offer a motion that would describe the action.

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the RTD Board of Directors approve a budget transfer of $2.82 million from the FasTracks Management Reserve to the commuter rail operations budget for third party reimbursable projects to allow RTD to compensate Denver Transit Partners (DTP) for costs it will incur for work associated with third party agreements.  The FasTracks Management Reserve will be replenished in the 2018 Amended Budget with the funds that will be received from third parties to compensate RTD for the impacts to its operation.

This action addresses two of the General Manager’s goals for 2018:  Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services, and Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability.

#### C. Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and Budget Transfer due to Operator Wage Increases

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts:  First Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract #14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the contract.

Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH-003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.  Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH-021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.  Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH-064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00. Group 27 – add up to $6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH-055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.

The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while these services are rebid.

It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018 Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased costs incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases for 2018:

Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00

This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services; Task Goal #1, Fiscal Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and Human Capital.
