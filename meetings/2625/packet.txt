Subject:

Budget Transfer for Router Upgrades

CFO/AGM,

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 26, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage
Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services
expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of
the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest,
Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.
BACKGROUND
Network equipment that supports commerce and security activities on the Southwest, Southeast and
Central Plate Valley rail lines are no longer in a state of good repair. The network equipment and
switches need to be replaced as the technology is at end-of-life and may become unreliable.
The new network equipment includes multiple network switches and routers which connect to RTD’s
core network infrastructure. Total estimated costs are not to exceed $900,000.
In 2015, a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) funding request was made to replace equipment on one of the
three rail lines. This project has $320,000 available. An unrelated project, the Garage Concentrator
Upgrade project, was completed under budget and has $325,000 remaining that can be used for the
Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project. The Garage Concentrator Upgrade project originally
included contract services to install the equipment. The Information Technology team opted to install
the equipment using in-house resources resulting in overall project savings of $325,000. The remaining
$255,000 needed for the Network Equipment project is available in the Information Technology
expense budget.
DISCUSSION
As the district continues to lean more heavily on technology, our reliance upon the network
infrastructure increases in need and criticality. For example, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) accept
credit cards. The network equipment that connects the TVMs to RTD infrastructure must adhere to
Payment Card Industry standards. Moreover, this network equipment is used to transport information
to the Public Information Displays (PIDs) on the platforms, and is used by security in support of the
security cameras and emergency telephones.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project budget will not exceed $900,000. $325,000 was previously approved in the SBP. This

1.B.1

request is asking for permission to transfer $320,000 from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade Project
and $255,000 from the Information Technology expense budget to the Network Equipment and
Switches Upgrade project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage
Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services
expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement
of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest,
Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines. This is the preferred alternative.
2. RTD replaces the equipment and switches on one rail line at a cost $325,000. This leaves two other
rail lines at risk of equipment failure potentially leaving RTD unable to collect revenue, use
emergency telephones, and collect security camera footage.
3. RTD does not replace the legacy switch equipment on these lines and continues to use the existing
equipment, some of which is not Payment Card Industry compliant. This puts the agency at risk of
violating PCI endorsement.

ITS Work Order Contract

CFO/AGM,

Board Meeting Date: September 26, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract
(Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years. Work is
administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the
budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.
BACKGROUND
RTD has need of an on-call contractor to perform work in support of initiatives including Information
Technology Governance; Service Provision, Acquisition and Contracting; Intelligent Transportation
Systems, Emerging Technologies and Transit Business Operations. The contractor will provide
technical support of the agency’s broad range of technologies and applications. The Work Orders (WOs)
will be short to mid-term periods.
DISSCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an ITS Work Order contractor.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $10,000,000. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in
the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed. The types of funds are dependent upon
the funding source of each individual project. Individual work orders will be funded as the project
requirement is processed. The amount is not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one year.

ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order
Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.
This is the preferred alternative.
2. Provide the needed services with RTD personnel. RTD personnel does not have the expertise or
capacity for the work provided by a work order contractor. This does not meet the needs of RTD.
3. Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement. This would take well over six
months and not likely result in a different outcome.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Subject:

Approval of Contract Extension for Special
Event Ticket Sellers

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: September 7, 2017
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: September 26, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and
increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System,
Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD is currently contracted with Central Parking Systems, Inc. for a term of three years plus two option
years. The initial three-year period had a contract value of $448,336.09. The first option year has been
exercised increasing the contract amount to $598,336.09. Exercising the final option year will add
$172,000.00 to the contract authority for a revised contract amount not-to-exceed $770,336.09.
DISCUSSION
Ticket sellers are deployed to supplement ticket vending machines (TVMs) and Park-n-Rides during
periods of high passenger volume for special events. Providing these supplemental ticket sales avoids
long lines at the TVMs, allows for more streamlined boardings and provides good customer service.
These ticket selling services are used during Rockies and Broncos games as well as other special events
such as The Race for the Cure, large concerts, etc.
Central Parking provides the staffing necessary for these supplemental ticket sales. RTD retains all fares
sold by the ticket sellers and pays Central Parking for the staffing they supply. The following shows the
last three years of ticket sales performed by Central Parking.

The ticket sellers on the rail corridors are housed in secure booths at certain rail stations where high
passenger volumes occur. The booths have internet and power connections which allow the sellers to
accept credit cards as well as cash.
RTD has contracted with Central Parking to provide the staffing for these supplemental ticket sales
because RTD does not have enough staffing resources in-house. During these events, RTD schedules
additional coverage with RTD revenue technicians to service TVMs and also may provide some RTD
ticket sellers that use handheld ticket selling devices.

1.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Exercising the final option year will authorize $172,000 in contract funding. Funding for 2017 is
included in the 2017 Amended Budget approved by the Board of Directors in June 2016 and will be
included in the 2018 Budget request.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option
year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central
Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15,
2019. This is the recommended action.
2) Do not approve the recommendation by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the
RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event
fares through April 15, 2019. This is not the recommended action because it would result in long
lines to purchase tickets, uneven boardings and customer dissatisfaction.

Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the Second Quarter of 2017. These year-to-date measures
provide a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and
the citizens of the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures
tracked for the GM, RTD met 34 of the goals in the second quarter. The following is a discussion of
the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – System-Wide On-Time Performance
The District as a whole did not meet its goals for on-time service in Q2, but performance is
somewhat improved over Q1. System-wide Local on-time service at 86.7%, though not on goal,
was higher than 2016 at 85.3% but the same as in Q1. In Local on-time service, both Transdev
and First Transit-Longmont met/exceeded goal while the remaining carriers did not. Regional ontime service at 87.1% did not meet goal and was below Q1. Staff will continue its targeted efforts
in studying the worst performing routes and identifying the resources needed to improve such as
service changes and operator training.
Overall Light Rail on-time service exceeded goal in Q2 at 94.1%. Commuter Rail on-time service at
91.7% also exceeded goal.
Goal 4.2 – Improve Level of Customer Complaints
In responding to customer complaints, the overall average cycle time at 10.9 days in Q2 slightly
exceeded goal. One customer service position at Access-A-Ride was vacant for much of the
reporting period.
Goal 6.2 – Increase Ridership
Ridership for year-to-date Q2 was down 1.8% compared to same time prior year, which mirrored
the national trend.
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Operating Revenue
Year-to-date Q2 fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 9.6% and 9.7%, respectively,
over same time prior year, but did not meet respective budgeted goals of 11.7% and 11.4%.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Bus operator vacancies exceeded goal in Q2 due to attrition, retirements, system growth, and the
strong local economy.
