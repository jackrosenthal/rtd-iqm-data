#### 1. 2017-006 : Budget Transfer for Router Upgrades

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.

BACKGROUND

Network equipment that supports commerce and security activities on the Southwest, Southeast and Central Plate Valley rail lines are no longer in a state of good repair. The network equipment and switches need to be replaced as the technology is at end-of-life and may become unreliable.

The new network equipment includes multiple network switches and routers which connect to RTD’s core network infrastructure. Total estimated costs are not to exceed $900,000.

In 2015, a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) funding request was made to replace equipment on one of the three rail lines. This project has $320,000 available. An unrelated project, the Garage Concentrator Upgrade project, was completed under budget and has $325,000 remaining that can be used for the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project. The Garage Concentrator Upgrade project originally included contract services to install the equipment. The Information Technology team opted to install the equipment using in-house resources resulting in overall project savings of $325,000. The remaining $255,000 needed for the Network Equipment project is available in the Information Technology expense budget.

DISCUSSION

As the district continues to lean more heavily on technology, our reliance upon the network infrastructure increases in need and criticality. For example, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) accept credit cards. The network equipment that connects the TVMs to RTD infrastructure must adhere to Payment Card Industry standards. Moreover, this network equipment is used to transport information to the Public Information Displays (PIDs) on the platforms, and is used by security in support of the security cameras and emergency telephones.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The project budget will not exceed $900,000. $325,000 was previously approved in the SBP. This request is asking for permission to transfer $320,000 from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade Project and $255,000 from the Information Technology expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       RTD replaces the equipment and switches on one rail line at a cost $325,000. This leaves two other rail lines at risk of equipment failure potentially leaving RTD unable to collect revenue, use emergency telephones, and collect security camera footage.

3.       RTD does not replace the legacy switch equipment on these lines and continues to use the existing equipment, some of which is not Payment Card Industry compliant. This puts the agency at risk of violating PCI endorsement.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 26, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Walker seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance & Administration, stated that staff is asking the Board to combine three different funding pieces together for a larger project.

Director Solano asked what the Garage Concentrator project was for.

Ms. McKillop explained that, when buses enter RTD’s garages, they can now communicate and download or upload information for staff to use.  She noted that the concentrators were upgraded in-house instead of using a contractor which resulted in additional savings.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. 2017-007 : ITS Work Order Contract

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.

BACKGROUND

RTD has need of an on-call contractor to perform work in support of initiatives including Information Technology Governance; Service Provision, Acquisition and Contracting; Intelligent Transportation Systems, Emerging Technologies and Transit Business Operations.  The contractor will provide technical support of the agency’s broad range of technologies and applications. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods.

DISSCUSSION

RTD conducted an open procurement for an ITS Work Order contractor.  Six firms submitted proposals.  The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected three firms for interviews.  Apex was selected as the successful proposer.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The contract authority shall not exceed $10,000,000.  Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.  The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project.  Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.  The amount is not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one year.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       Provide the needed services with RTD personnel.  RTD personnel does not have the expertise or capacity for the work provided by a work order contractor.  This does not meet the needs of RTD.

3.       Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement.  This would take well over six months and not likely result in a different outcome.

Motion:               Director Tisdale made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 26, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. McKillop commented that this action item is for a work order contract which will be administered on an as-needed, work order basis.  She added that the preferred vendor based on the project criteria and designs was Apex Design, PC.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 3. 2017-008 : Approval of Contract Extension for Special Event Ticket Sellers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.

BACKGROUND

RTD is currently contracted with Central Parking Systems, Inc. for a term of three years plus two option years.  The initial three-year period had a contract value of $448,336.09.  The first option year has been exercised increasing the contract amount to $598,336.09.  Exercising the final option year will add $172,000.00 to the contract authority for a revised contract amount not-to-exceed $770,336.09.

DISCUSSION

Ticket sellers are deployed to supplement ticket vending machines (TVMs) and Park-n-Rides during periods of high passenger volume for special events.  Providing these supplemental ticket sales avoids long lines at the TVMs, allows for more streamlined boardings and provides good customer service.  These ticket selling services are used during Rockies and Broncos games as well as other special events such as The Race for the Cure, large concerts, etc.

Central Parking provides the staffing necessary for these supplemental ticket sales.  RTD retains all fares sold by the ticket sellers and pays Central Parking for the staffing they supply.  The following shows the last three years of ticket sales performed by Central Parking.

The ticket sellers on the rail corridors are housed in secure booths at certain rail stations where high passenger volumes occur.  The booths have internet and power connections which allow the sellers to accept credit cards as well as cash.

RTD has contracted with Central Parking to provide the staffing for these supplemental ticket sales because RTD does not have enough staffing resources in-house.  During these events, RTD schedules additional coverage with RTD revenue technicians to service TVMs and also may provide some RTD ticket sellers that use handheld ticket selling devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Exercising the final option year will authorize $172,000 in contract funding.  Funding for 2017 is included in the 2017 Amended Budget approved by the Board of Directors in June 2016 and will be included in the 2018 Budget request.

ALTERNATIVES

1)      Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is the recommended action.

2)      Do not approve the recommendation by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is not the recommended action because it would result in long lines to purchase tickets, uneven boardings and customer dissatisfaction.

Motion:               Director Broom made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the September 26, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Tisdale seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Ms. McKillop commented that RTD currently has a contract with Central Parking for large events and this is extension would be the last year of the contract.  She noted that with the extension, the end of the contract would be pushed out to April 15, 2019.  She added that if it was deemed that RTD still needed parking ticket sellers at the end of the contract, a new Request for Proposal (RFP) would be issued.

Director Francone noted that the contract amount increased almost $30,000 from 2016 and asked what constituted the increase.

Ms. McKillop explained that most likely Central Parking would not bill up the full amount as they only billed based on ticket sales and other factors, but $172,000 was the remaining amount left on the contract.

Committee Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. 2018 Budget Update

Ms. McKillop said that in the consideration of time, staff would discuss a few things in the budget that were slightly different than the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).  She added that staff will review the revenue from sales and use taxes, but will assume that there will not be any revenue from retail marijuana for 2018 at this time.  She further added that this time of year is usually when staff tends to lock in fuel rates, but with the hurricanes in Florida and Texas, they are going to wait until production in those areas pick up again.  She noted that staff had been reviewing the budget from an administrative stand point and they want to better tie in the various budgets that drive RTD’s service and core mission allocations.

Director Tisdale commented that the draft budget should be included on RTD’s website for better transparency.

Ms. McKillop explained that typically staff does not post the draft budget until it is approved, however, they can work with marketing to accommodate the request.

Director Francone asked if the union negotiations would be reflected in 2017 or 2018’s budget.

General Manager Genova stated that staff has already begun to estimate accommodations that will go into effect in 2018.

Committee Chair Menten said that the proposed R Line changes are substantial, and asked what the savings would amount to.

Ms. McKillop remarked that the savings would equal $3.6 million, but that figure was not reflected in the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) or Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) last month.  She also added that it is not yet reflected in the 2018 budget at this time because the service change still has to go through the public process and the proposed cuts might change.

#### 2. Quarterly Performance Report

Ms. McKillop explained that staff will have a brief overview and noted that the document was included in the packet.

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, commented that the Board Report was self-explanatory.  She commented that on-time performance improved in the second quarter over the first, and the average cycle time in response to customer complaints was slightly higher due to a staffing vacancy.  She noted that operating revenue is up on a year to date basis, but RTD is still not meeting the goal.  She added that bus operator vacancies are up and are higher than they were in the first quarter.

Committee Chair Menten asked that the Board receive a report that breaks down ridership by line.

Ms. McKillop stated that, in the Monthly Financial Status Report, the lines were at one time listed individually, but as more FasTracks lines opened up they were merged.  She noted that staff can look into providing an additional document that would breakdown the ridership of each line.

Bruce Abel, Acting Chief Operations Officer and Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, explained that one of the major challenges this year has been the allocation of revenue.  He added that for 2017 staff will not be able to provide subsidy by route, but staff can provide cost by route.  He noted that this year, as staff overcomes financial challenges, ridership will only be broken down as cost per route and cost per rider, which will be presented in October.

Committee Chair Menten said that she did not like that response at all.

Ms. McKillop remarked that the issue is making sure that the information staff would be providing on a route level is reliable and correct.  She stated that at this time, staff does not feel comfortable releasing that information due to accuracy concerns.

Committee Chair Menten asked if ridership could be broken down by class of service.

Ms. McKillop remarked that she would review the information to see how far down the ridership could be broken down.

##### a. 2017 performance measures-Q2

#### 3. July 2017 Monthly Financial Status Report

Ms. McKillop explained that the good news is that sales and use tax figures were higher than what staff had originally estimated.  She noted that the variance is $11.1 million over budget which will provide some cushion in the next few months.  She said that ridership is still slightly down, but fare revenue is up over the revised amended budget estimates.

Director Broom asked if the RTD marijuana tax revenue is being collected and not dispersed, or if the state is charging less in taxes.

Ms. McKillop stated that the state eliminated the 2.9% tax rate and substituted a higher tax.

Director Broom inquired if the state is keeping the 2.9% for itself instead of the special districts.

Ms. McKillop said that the state replaced the 10% tax with a 15% tax, but the way that the bill was written omitted the special districts from collecting any revenue from marijuana sales.

Director Broom asked if RTD could recoup in January the sales tax it had lost retroactively.

Ms. McKillop explained that taxes could not be collected retroactively, but they could be collected from January on, once the funding is restored.

Committee Chair Menten commented that she heard SB 267 was going back to the legislature in a special session.  She asked if staff had heard anything about that.

Ms. McKillop said that staff had not heard any updates as to SB 267’s status.

### D. Other Matters

Director Francone reminded the Board that the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee would be meeting on Thursday, September 21st to review the core task goals.

Director Tisdale informed the Board that he would be sending them an email and they should be on the lookout for it in the upcoming days.

Mr. Abel noted that the RTD Bus Roadeo would take place on Saturday, September 16th at District Shops.  He stated that the event would begin at 7:00 a.m. and would be finished by 2:00 p.m.  He also added that the RTD Employee Awards would be held on Thursday, September 14th at Tivoli beginning at 9:00 a.m.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Menten adjourned the meeting at 8:38 p.m.
