4.1.a

Game Changer – DENVER POST Endorsement
The overall theme is that the best anecdote to gridlock is change
(Oct. 10, 2014).
§ Washington is gridlocked. It needs “fresh leadership, energy and
ideas.”
§ Gardner has been a reservoir of ideas and leadership from the
start of his career.
§ Udall is a fine man, but “not perceived as a leader” and “not at the
center of the issues that count.”
§ Udall’s multi-million dollar “war on women” ad campaign is now
damaging him more than Gardner. As the Post says, the
“obnoxious one-issue campaign is insult to those he seeks to
convince.”
§ Flipping the Senate to Republican control will, in their view, be
more productive for the next two years. President Obama’s desire
for a legacy and Republican self-interest in repairing their
reputation for gridlock could converge and would be enhanced in
the Post’s view by Gardner’s election (See The Buzz, October 13).

Bennet is on Deck

Democrats Need 5 Seats to Win Back Senate in 2016
There are several factors that point to his initial advantages
going into the election:
•

•

•

Voter turnout will be up to presidential levels. The 2 million
this year will balloon to 2.8 or 3.0 million. Many of the less
frequent voters lean Democratic.
Bennet works his Washington and Senate networks for
maximum advantage. He’s substantially less publicity shy
than Mark Udall. It’s assumed he’ll be ready with a powerful resume
and a substantial war chest. Denver Post likes him.
The Republican bench in Colorado is thin if current officeholders are
the main prospective candidates. Congressman Coffman and State
Treasurer Stapleton may not be interested.

But there are several factors that point to a tough race for Bennet:
• The Democratic nominee for president and Democratic senators up for
re-election will likely be running with a very unpopular president.
Historically, passing on the presidency to the same party after an
unpopular president is difficult.

term. He was replaced for 7 months by Bill Vidal (Jan. 12 to Jul. 18, 2011).

“There is generally a good feeling about the city right now,” he said. “And
Hancock nicely represents a fulcrum point in the politics of the city. He is not too
left or not too right.”

Former Mayor
Bill McNichols

“Ultimately, the final thing is leadership,” Ciruli said. “Is there someone with the
name ID and money and grassroots support — not just a gadfly or marginal
candidate? I don't see that person.” (Denver Post, 2-1-15)

Denver Metro Economic Surge
The latest sales tax revenue report from the Denver metro seven-county region
shows a 9.22 percent increase over last year. A one-percent sales tax collected
region-wide would have produced $467 million for local governments (or RTD)
through September, on its way to more than half billion by year’s end.
Colorado’s economy in 2014 has benefitted from the national economic improvement
and specifically local population increases (4th fastest growth in U.S. in 2014). One
risk is the impact of declining oil prices on metro economic activity.

Four Trends Affecting Transportation In the Future
In a sense, formerly clear lines—between humans and
machines, between ownership and non-ownership,
between goods and services—blur when information
generated and used interchangeably by people and
machines becomes ubiquitous.
Ubiquitous Connectivity – pervasive networking
throughout the transportation system between vehicles
(V2V), between vehicles and their surrounding
infrastructure (V2I), and between transportation systems
and their users.
Integration of Disparate Systems - A well-connected
system of systems that enables users to easily move from
point A to point B regardless of mode, service provider, etc.
Dynamic Pricing and Mobile Payments- Variable pricing
of road, parking and shared use assets to balance supply
and demand, and the ability to leverage NFC technology to
allow for mobile payments
Reliant on New Models of Public-Private Collaboration Transportation needs will be met by an increasingly diverse
ecosystem of public, private and nonprofit entities

Trends Affecting Rail Systems
Technology

Customer Forces
•

Climate change and environmental concerns, coupled with energy
and raw material scarcity drive the need to renew the infrastructure in
order to meet the latest safety, security and energy saving standards.

•

Urbanization and increased mobility gives rise to an
increasing number of commuters and demand. Which in
turn drives the need for Mass Transit systems and
associated signaling systems such as CBTC

Competitor

•

•

Moving from separated service networks to a
converged IP/MPLS multi-service network offers
operational flexibility and efficiency while reducing the
total cost of ownership.
•

Rail Systems –
Trackside and
PTC

Key differentiations occur in the following applications:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Redundancy management protocols need to be increasingly
efficient and enabling network architecture increasingly complex

Communications-Based Train Control (CBTC)
Video surveillance
Railway and metro signaling
Passenger information and entertainment
Communication networks along track
Traffic management systems
Control rooms.

16

Ever increasing bandwidth requirements give
rise to the demand for more switching
capabilities in trackside networks

Socio-Economic
•

International, National & Regional regulations apply
to many infrastructure markets, especially where
safety is involved.

•

In general it is a phase in which research is
conducted for “Full convergence on IP” of the
systems. But still some systems remain with
proprietary protocol or with other non-IP
technological standard. For example some specific
kinds of signaling and service telephony.

How Does the IoT Enable RTD?
• Real-time equipment tracking: Cloud-based central control systems will
enable operators to pinpoint any piece of equipment.
• Inter-equipment communication: Much as PTC helps avert rail accidents, bus
operators can report traffic to other drivers, alerting them to take appropriate
precautions; urban mass transit vehicles can report traffic delays or accidents.
• Predictive maintenance: Rather than simply alerting drivers, vehicles will
transmit defect data directly to engineers. Predictive maintenance will identify
components in need of repair, eliminating the need to take equipment out of
service for routine inspections and preventive maintenance.
• Remote upgrades: Operators can upgrade software over the air in hundreds of
connected devices spread across hundreds of vehicles simultaneously.
• Fuel management: System operators will have better visibility into fuel
consumption and efficiency, potentially saving millions in fuel costs.
• Improved passenger comfort and convenience: Carriers can offer more
onboard amenities. Transit riders can know how soon the next bus is coming.
Air travelers can be alerted to delays via their mobile devices before they leave
for the airport
