Jeanette Scarpino noted that the 2011 amended budget was first presented to the
Board of Directors in June adding that the amounts have not changed, and staff has
been answering any and all questions pertaining to this budget amendment since that
time.
Bruce Daly inquired what the Station Area Master Plans included. Bill Sirois_________
explained that Station Area Master Plans are plans for future station areas. We have
been working with DRCOG for the past few years and receiving CMAC grant funding to
complete these planning studies and since there is a cost attributed to complete these
studies, we generally use grant revenues to cover most of the costs.
Motion:

Director Anderson made the motion to amend and appropriate
funds for the proposed 2011 Amended Budget as detailed in the
Overview of the 2011 Budget Amdendment and to decrease the
appropriation of Capital Carryforward.
Director Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Deadwyler noted that she was under the impression that
RTD was under a hiring freeze and instead of adding staff we
should give raises to the salaried and represented employees who
have not had a raise in several years; therefore she would be
voting against this motion.
Director Anderson indicated that if we didn’t add these positions,
especially for civil rights issues that are brought to us by the
Federal Government this cannot be characterized as taking away
from current employees since these positions are needed and
required and she would be supporting this item.
Director Deadwyler realizes the need for additional staff in the
Civil Rights Office, but noted that 4 additional employees would
be added in Communications and if we are on a wage and hiring
freeze, the Board has not lifted that freeze. Additional
justification has not been brought before the Board to warrant
these new positions.
Director Daly referenced the memo from General Manager
Washington noting the head count increases, and the need for
new hires in certain departments. Agreeing with Director
Anderson, Director Daly added that these positions are valuable
to RTD as we grow and should be filled.
Chair Kemp indicated that he was in support of approving the
amended budget since it will keep us moving forward with our
Affirmative Action group and the WIN Program as well as the
accountability and reporting that is required for our Federal
Contracts.
Barbara Brohl inquired as to what were the requirements for
abstention votes. Rolf Asphaug indicated that Directors may not
abstain for personal choice, Directors present must vote yea or
nay, unless there is a specific conflict of interest as determined
by the Chairman of the Board as noted in our bylaws Article 5,
section 5.A.

Vote on
Motion:

An electronic vote was taken with 12 in favor (Anderson,
Bagley, Brohl, Cohen, Daly, Hoy, James, Malpiede, McMullen,

Riley, Tayer, Tobiassen) and 1 against (Deadwyler). Chair Kemp
was present by phone but could not vote and O’Boyle was
absent from this vote.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer declared this action PASSED.
B.

Board Policy on Organizational Memberships
It is recommended by the Executive Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt this policy on the process establishing Board individual and agency
memberships in community organizations.

Director James explained that this was a process that began quite a while ago. The
reason for creating this policy was to broaden the scope of organizations in which RTD
can have more enhanced relationships. The recommendation allows Board Members to
propose Organizational Memberships to the Executive Committee who will be the final
approval authority with the budget beginning at $5000.
Director Brohl indicated that the Board has tried to reduce Board Member expense
accounts over the past few years and inquired that instead of making a new budget line
item for this, would it make more sense to reinstate the original Board member budgets
to allow each Director to decide what they would like to do with their funds and what
memberships they would like to be a part of.
Matt Cohen noted that Scott Reed provided a list of Organization and Chamber
memberships to which RTD belongs. As members of an Organization, individual
Directors can participate in whatever activities and events are up coming. Further, this
policy is really just geared to keep us thinking in terms of transit/community/district
related memberships that are mutually beneficial to both RTD and the organization we
might subscribe to.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer noting the many comments and dialogue between Directors
indicated that it may be appropriate to bring this particular item back to the Board at a
later date.
Director O’Boyle added that he wanted to know what we are spending now for
Organization and Chamber memberships and how did $5000 become the base figure
and if this is a Budget line item, perhaps it should be in the budget versus a separate
document. The current Organization membership list should be circulated around the
Board and the organizations with the least interest should not be renewed. This is
definitely a Board interest, but Executive Committee should not have final say regarding
which memberships are pursued.
Director Brohl added that RTD currently has 13 Organizational Memberships, and 20
Chamber Memberships and indicated that this policy would have to go over and above
what we already have and if there is a membership available that we are not members
of, and is being requested by an individual Director, that Director should pay for the
new membership out of their own local expense account.
Chair Pro Tem Tayer thanked Directors James and Tobiassen for their efforts in this
project, but explained that additional input will be needed on this item, and suggested
that this be tabled to be brought back by the Executive Committee after their July 14th
meeting.
Motion:

Director Cohen made the motion to table this item.
Director James seconded the motion.
