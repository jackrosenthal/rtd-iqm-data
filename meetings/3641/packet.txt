BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan

June 4, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Environmental Sustainability
The Board of Directors has collectively demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to addressing
the climate impacts of the agency’s services, programs, and initiatives throughout the Denver metro
region, both in terms of operating and administrative facilities as well as the existing fixed-route bus
fleet.
First among RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan Priorities is Community Value, which states: “RTD
strives to be a community partner, providing value to customers as well as to the broader Denver
metro region while sustaining planet Earth.”
In support of this priority, the agency is committed to supporting local, state, and national efforts to
mitigate to the extent feasible the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including those
derived from operating and administrative facilities, as well as fixed-routes buses.
Current Bus Facilities
RTD currently owns and directly provides transit services from three bus division facilities across the
service area. The Platte, East Metro, and Boulder facilities were purpose-designed in the late 1970’s
for a diesel fleet and became operational in the early 1980’s. Over the years, these facilities have
been modified to accommodate diesel bus fleet replacements and upgraded to current building codes.
These facilities meet RTD’s transit service delivery requirements.
Current Diesel Bus Fleet
RTD’s current fixed-route bus fleet includes more than 1,000 clean-diesel vehicles, which are
operated by RTD directly and by contractors. Given the size of the current fleet; the typical useful
service life of diesel buses as well as federal minimum (12-year/500,000 mile) service-life
requirements; and the magnitude of the facilities enhancements that will be required to house,
maintain, and support alternatively fueled transit vehicles, the transition toward lower-emission and
zero-emission buses is a significant undertaking that will require many years to fully implement.

B.1

Alternatively Fueled Buses
RTD was an early adopter of low/no emission technologies. The agency’s first steps toward a
low/no-emission bus fleet transition were taken in 2000, with the deployment of hybrid
electric/compressed natural gas (CNG) buses along the 16th Street Mall. A subfleet of hybrid
diesel/electric fixed-route buses followed in 2008. The CNG-powered MallRide buses were also later
replaced by a fleet of 36 zero-emission battery electric buses (BEBs) in 2017. The agency has
garnered operational knowledge through the deployment and maintenance of these low- and noemission vehicles, as well as industry best practices and lessons learned, both by RTD and other
public transit service providers throughout North America and globally.
Transition Planning
On April 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors passed a motion to approve the summary scope of work
for a solicitation, and to subsequently authorize the General Manager and CEO to enter into a contract,
for consulting services for the development of a holistic Low/No Emission Facilities and Fleet Transition
Plan (Plan) compliant with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Pub. L. 117-58, in an amount not to
exceed $10,000,000.
Following the Board action, the agency subsequently released a solicitation on May 23, 2023, to select
a consultant to lead the planning process. After reviewing proposals from five qualified firms, WSP USA,
Inc. was selected to lead the Plan. On August 24, 2023, RTD executed a contract with WSP USA, Inc.
to complete the Plan, and the project kicked off shortly after.
DISCUSSION
This Study Session will set the project context for the Plan, provide an overview of key concepts related
to low and no emission facilities and fleets, discuss why it is important to approach this transition with a
“facilities first” strategy, discuss transition plan considerations, and provide several case study examples
from other transit agencies that have implemented similar transition plans.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.
