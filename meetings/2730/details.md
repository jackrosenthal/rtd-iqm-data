She said that RTD held an event in November 2017 celebrating the fact that the agency had reached the $1 billion mark in projects awarded to disadvantaged business enterprises and small business enterprises (DBE and SBE). She stated that representatives from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) attended the event and spoke highly of the program. She noted that a video on the subject had been posted on the RTD website and that the story had been featured in several publications across the nation, including the DBE magazine. She said that a new committee, called the Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (APCD), was also established in 2017 with the goal of partnering with the disabled community. She said the committee was composed of 13 members, along with a steering committee of 11 members made up of RTD senior managers. She noted that the agency’s equal employment opportunity (EEO) program would begin to train all RTD employees in the near future.

Chair Tisdale reiterated the fact that RTD had invested $1 billion in DBEs and SBEs and noted that the official 2017 report would be forthcoming.

Director Folska said that $1 billion was a huge amount of money and that the agency should be proud. She advised that persons with disabilities should be part of the conversation and should be embraced.
