C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee- 2017 Annual Report
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, presented highlights from the
2017 annual report, which had not yet been released. She said that RTD
held an event in November 2017 celebrating the fact that the agency had
reached the $1 billion mark in projects awarded to disadvantaged business
enterprises and small business enterprises (DBE and SBE). She stated that
representatives from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) attended the
event and spoke highly of the program. She noted that a video on the
subject had been posted on the RTD website and that the story had been
featured in several publications across the nation, including the DBE
magazine. She said that a new committee, called the Advisory Committee
for People with Disabilities (APCD), was also established in 2017 with the
goal of partnering with the disabled community. She said the committee was
composed of 13 members, along with a steering committee of 11 members
made up of RTD senior managers. She noted that the agency’s equal
employment opportunity (EEO) program would begin to train all RTD
employees in the near future.
Chair Tisdale reiterated the fact that RTD had invested $1 billion in DBEs and
SBEs and noted that the official 2017 report would be forthcoming.
Director Folska said that $1 billion was a huge amount of money and that
the agency should be proud. She advised that persons with disabilities
should be part of the conversation and should be embraced.
