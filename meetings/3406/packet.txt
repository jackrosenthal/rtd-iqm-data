PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 28, 2022, prior to the expiration of the current contract, negotiators for the RTD and ATU
1001 reached a tentative agreement (TA). On March 17, 2022, at approximately 8 a.m., the General
Manager and CEO was apprised by the President of ATU 1001 that a majority of its membership ratified
the TA. Adoption of the TA by the RTD Board of Directors is required for the GM/CEO to execute the
new agreement.
DISCUSSION
The adoption of the successor CBA demonstrates the agency’s commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial Success by
ensuring employees are paid a market-based living wage and improving employees’ quality of life while
enhancing operational efficiencies.
The RTD and ATU’s bargaining teams began meeting October 7, 2021 to negotiate a successor CBA. In
working toward said CBA, all documents pertaining to the existing CBA, including articles, sections,
memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and side letters were carefully assessed and discussed during the
negotiations. Outlined herein are the significant changes from the existing CBA delineated by article.
Article I: General Provisions
• Establishes a three-year contract term, from January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2024
• States the parties will split the cost of printing the CBA for ATU 1001 to distribute

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The increased cost of the CBA for 2022 is $23.8 million and has been included in the previously
approved 2022 Budget. The one-time pension contribution of $160 million in 2022 will reduce cash
balances and have no impact to reserves. The incremental additional CBA costs in 2023 and 2024 are
$7.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, and have previously been included in the Mid-term Financial
Plan with request for Board appropriation to occur during the 2023 and 2024 fiscal year budgeting
processes.
