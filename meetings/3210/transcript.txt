General Manager Performance
Oversight Committee
VINCE BUZEK: I'm going to call the roll at this point in time. Vince Buzek is here. Vice Chair Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm here.
VINCE BUZEK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Here.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Bouquet? Now we had a email from Director Bouquet earlier who indicated he
would not be attending.
Director Dishell. I had a message from Director Dishell this morning indicating that he may not be able to
attend.
Director Lewis. I didn't hear anything from Director Lewis about whether she'd be here or not.
So we've got three absent, our present. We do have a quorum, so let's get the ball rolling.
You've all gotten a copy of the agenda. It's a action packed one, too. So we've got one recommended
action and discussion item. So the recommended action is the strategic plan survey data validation that
we've had a lot of discussion about. And I will read the recommended action.
The action is for the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to utilize the agency's
contracted external audit firm, Plante Moran, to authenticate the customer excellence and community
value survey data compiled by TransPro Consulting through its contracted team of surveyors. Do we
have a motion to-PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So moved.
VINCE BUZEK: Was that Director-- or was that Chair Rivera-Malpiede that was--

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It both of us at the same time. So it should be Director Catlin and I could be
the second.
VINCE BUZEK: OK. Director Catlin moved, Chair Rivera-Malpiede seconded. Is there a discussion?
Anybody have any questions or comments on this action item?
I'm going to take a roll call vote. Director Catlin, did you have a question?
PEGGY CATLIN: Oh, no. I just think the price seems to be really reasonable.
VINCE BUZEK: Oh, yeah. There's a fiscal note in here too, $2,500. Thank you. That's great.
OK, so I'm going to take a roll call vote. Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Director Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: And Vince Buzek, yes. That's four yes and three absent. OK. So we move that four to the
next-- when is the next Board meeting? Can somebody tell me that?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It is the-VINCE BUZEK: Not a trick question.
DEBRA JOHNSON: It's October 20-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is it the 20-DEBRA JOHNSON: The 26th.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, the 26th.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks. I should know that but-OK. Next on to the discussion items. And that is with regard to the 2021 General Manager's performance
appraisal. So we had a meeting, Vice Chair Sloan and I had a meeting with GM and CEO Johnson, Ms.
Snyder and others earlier this week, on Monday, to talk about the timeline involved in the 2021
evaluation.

And I can, I suppose I can summarize that, if that's OK. So what's going to happen is by Wednesday,
November 10, GM and CEO Johnson will submit her self-evaluation to the Board through a digital wizard,
which also serves as our appraisal tour-- tool, sorry. By Friday, November 19, 2021, that will be the
deadline for Directors to submit appraisal scoring and comments through the appraisal tour, tool, for
compilation by Board staff.
Thursday, December 2, 2021, GMOC Executive Session and meeting will take place to discuss the draft
appraisal and proposed 2022 compensation increase. On Tuesday, December 7, 2021, we're going to
have a special Board meeting. There will be an executive session and a meeting to approve the final
written appraisal and 2022 compensation increase. And Friday, December 31, 2021 is the deadline for
the Board to provide the 2020 to 2021 appraisal. If the deadline is not met, all performance expectations
for the performance period will be deemed to have been met pursuant to Ms. Johnson's contract.
So that's kind of the timeline. It seems pretty straightforward. I know Debra is working on her selfappraisal. We've got, after that, nine more days for us to digest and put our scoring together and then
move everything forward. Does anyone have any comments or concerns or questions about the timeline?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I see Director Catlin.
VINCE BUZEK: Oh, I'm sorry, Peggy. I'm sorry, Director Catlin, I didn't see your hand. Go ahead.
PEGGY CATLIN: No problem. I have two things. Can you provide us with that timeline in a written format,
or can staff, somebody provide us with that timeline, and the dates and stuff?
VINCE BUZEK: I will.
PEGGY CATLIN: Or somebody. And then, so as I recall, the date of November 9 was the end of the
evaluation period. Is that right? Hence, the November 10th date for the self-evaluation?
VINCE BUZEK: That's the contract, the anniversary date, yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. I just wanted to clarify. Because that seems to fall right in line with that. OK, that's
all I had.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you. Any other questions, comments?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I just can't believe it's been a year.
VINCE BUZEK: It feels like two.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I know.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It's been a year-[INTERPOSING VOICES]
[LAUGHTER]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I was going to say, filled with total bliss.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, OK. OK, so there we have our action packed agenda. And if there are no other
discussion items, are there any other matters to come before this august body? Sounds like a Tisdale
comment. Sorry. Oh, I'm out of control.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm good. I'm good.
PEGGY CATLIN: I'm fine. Thank you for keeping it brief.
VINCE BUZEK: So we had talked about the possibility of a second meeting in October. I don't know that
we need that. I mean-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I don't think we do.
VINCE BUZEK: We've got our timeline, we've got our action item coming out of here. So we're done until
November 4.
PEGGY CATLIN: When are we going to get the validation results from Plante Moran?
VINCE BUZEK: That's a good question. And I don't know the answer.
DEBRA JOHNSON: I will-- if I may, Mr. Chair.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes, please, yes.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Recognizing that we are in the process of actually leveraging the surveys going
forward, as you are aware, we first have to receive that data, so we anticipate that to be the latter part of
November. And I can give you an update, because the timeline was extended, as we talked about at the
last meeting.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Thank you. Because I'm curious to see what the survey results are. And then the
reason for the Plante Moran independent validation is because there were some concerns raised about
Trans Core, TransPro?
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. I don't know that they were necessarily concerns. I think that people actually just
wanted to have an independent take on everything, just so that we can say that we did our due diligence
and really ensured transparency and accuracy.

PEGGY CATLIN: Poor choice of words on my part. But OK, I'm just curious about both of those things.
And given that we're not going to have any results in October, then it makes no sense to have a meeting.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah. Perfect.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK.
VINCE BUZEK: Anybody else, anything? Does anybody want to stay and talk some more?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Sure.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
VINCE BUZEK: All in favor of adjourning, raise your hand, your real hand.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Your real hand.
VINCE BUZEK: All right, we're adjourned. Thanks, everybody.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
VINCE BUZEK: See ya. Bye.
