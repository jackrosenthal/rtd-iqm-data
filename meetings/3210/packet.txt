BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Strategic Plan Survey Data Validation

Committee Meeting Date:
October 7, 2021
Board Meeting Date:
October 26, 2021

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO to utilize the agency’s contracted
external audit firm, Plante Moran, to authenticate the Customer Excellence and Community Value survey
data compiled by TransPro Consulting through its contracted team of surveyors.
REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
On August 10, 2021, the Board of Directors adopted four strategic priorities in its 2021-2026 Strategic
Plan, namely:
•
•
•
•

Community Value
Customer Excellence
Employee Ownership
Financial Success

The Strategic Plan leverages survey data to gauge key stakeholders’ and customers’ satisfaction with
RTD and the services the agency delivers throughout the region. To establish the baseline and
supplemental data for the Community Value and Customer Excellence strategic priorities, TransPro
Consulting, the consulting firm initially selected through a solicitation process to assist in the creation of
the Strategic Plan, was engaged to conduct surveys in 2021 through the deployment of contracted
professional surveyors.
DISCUSSION
During the June 26, 2021 Board retreat, Directors expressed an interest in engaging a third-party to
validate the survey results as a means of ensuring that the survey data collected by TransPro accurately
reflects the views of RTD’s stakeholders and customers.
In approving this action, the Board acknowledges its intent for Plante Moran to validate the Community
Value and Customer Excellence survey data.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The cost of survey data validation services performed by Plante Moran at its contractually established
rate is not expected to exceed $2,500.
