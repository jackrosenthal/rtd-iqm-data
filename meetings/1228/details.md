Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to approve the October Board Agenda.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:                            It was determined that Bruce Daly would assist Chair Anderson in the presenting of the Bus Roadeo certificates.  Director Hoy noted that Past Chair Kemp would be attending the meeting as well.

Director Bagley mentioned that they only have 4 responders to the GM Survey to date and asked if any of the executive committee were outstanding and if so please take the time to go through the survey.

Director Bagley asked Phil to review the upcoming meeting dates.

GM Washington stated the following schedule.

- November 5th scheduled FasTracks Meeting.  Staff will bring its recommendation to the board.  The discussion will include the RFP Criteria, reason for their selection and would include an overview of the impact to the entire FasTracks project.

- November 14th will be a Special FasTracks Meeting to include Public Comment.  This session will provide a recap of all the answered questions from November 5th.  Staff will ask the board for approval.

There will be a placeholder on each of the following meeting agendas for Executive Session should one be needed.

Chair Anderson mentioned she was studying the P3 process and was reviewing the lessons learned from other lines and suggested sharing this information with the other directors.

GM Washington said all of the projects were different and this might confuse the matter.

Director Hoy asked for clarification regarding a Board Meeting on November 12th.

GM Washington confirmed no meeting would be held on November 12th.  This would give the board members the additional time to understand and be prepared for the November 14th meeting.

Director Hoy asked GM Washington if staff could keep agenda items to a minimum to help in the timing of the meetings and avoid getting off track.

GM Washington said other than contract renewals and housekeeping items staff would try to keep the agenda’s to a minimum.

## V. Other Matters

Director Daly commented on the closing of the 16th Street Mall to accommodate the Zombie Parade.

Chair Anderson announced that she would not be able to attend the Transit Alliance Event honoring RTD and Kent Bagley as 1st Vice Chair would attend in her place.  Chair Anderson requested that Director Bagley include Directors Deadwyler and Tobiassen on the stage as well.

Director Bagley requested the board office reach out to Directors Deadwyler and Tobiassen with the detail of the Transit Alliance Event and work with Scott Reed’s team for talking points should they be needed.

Director Bagley voiced his concerns regarding the lack of consistency from meeting to meeting.  He cited an instance where some Chairs read the Board Action and some do not as well as the protocol with Director speaking multiple times.  He might want to state a motion to the Executive Committee to set up some standard so consistency is the same across all meetings.  He proposed a list of standards for all Director who Chair or Co-Chair a committee.

Chair Anderson mentioned she was working on putting together a Brown Bag forum to increase the efficiency of our meetings.  She also said following set standards would also give Director Folska the cues needed so she can effectively participate in the meetings.

Director Hoy said once the standards are set we should have a bulleted list for all of the Chairs to follow.  He also mentioned that the e-Boardroom system allows you to move any director who has already spoken to the end of the list and he plans to use this tool in the future.

Director Daly mentioned the timing of the meetings has to stop and implementing standards should help.

Chair Anderson mentioned she has sent an e-mail in the past outlining the protocol that she would like used and perhaps she should resend from the Executive Committee.  Chair Anderson complemented Director Walker on how he conducted his meeting on Tuesday evening and his ability to keep the meeting on track.

Director Bagley said we have a renowned reputation and a great “Brand.  It is our responsibility to keep it clean.  He mentioned that many agencies have only received one FFGA and that we have received multiples and will probably have another opportunity open to us and we cannot have Board Members tarnishing our name because of their behavior.  He indicated at this time I will not ask for a motion regarding meeting standards. He said he would wait to see the outcome of the Chair’s efforts in putting together a Brown Bag learning session.

Chair Anderson said she would try to have the facilitator address all the concerns and present effective strategies on meeting standards.

Director Hoy said he was working with Brenda Tierney on a plan of attach for those who are opposed to the North Metro.  He gave the committee a heads up that we may hear some negatives at the November 14th FasTracks meeting.

AGM Genova reminded Director Hoy that we have FasTracks Fact Sheets that may help get the correct information out to his stakeholders.  He would have them updated and get them to Brenda Tierney.

Chair Anderson thanked Dave Genova for his presentation on Security.

Director Walker mentioned all constituents should be aware of safety practices and that his stop at Broadway and Evans has the potential for hazard as well as many other stations.  Director Walker mentioned he would be going on a local private tour in Seattle and he would report on it at the next meeting.
