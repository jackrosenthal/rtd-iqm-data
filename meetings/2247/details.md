#### 2. Cybersecurity Update (MacLeod/Heldman)

Doug MacLeod, Acting Chief Financial Officer, introduced Sheri Le, Manager for Cybersecurity and Kim Heldman, Senior Manager for Information Technology (IT).  Sheri Le reviewed the Cybersecurity presentation included in the February 10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Agenda packet.  The presentation included the top 6 areas Directors need to pay attention to regarding Cybersecurity:

- Cybersecurity Framework

- Cybersecurity Risks

- Employee Cybersecurity Awareness

- Cybersecurity Threat Analysis

- Security Governance

- Incident Response

The presentation also included Future Focus, Hot Topics, and Key Take Aways.

Director Bagley said he assumes there are conferences and discussions with other transit agencies about Cybersecurity and best practices.  He wondered, given the recent Cybersecurity issues with health care facilities, if there are any threats specific to transit agencies defined in the past couple of years.  Sheri Le said that so far there is not anything specific to transit.  However, transit needs to be aware of other types of threats, such as data breaches like the one in New York, which compromised personnel information in early 2014.

Director Folska mentioned that it was comforting to know that Sheri Le is in charge of Cybersecurity and that there is a plan looking forward.  She added that the Directors were recently given a presentation of the “Internet of Things”(IoT).  She also saw a 60 Minutes episode related to the IoT about the Department of Defense (DOD) and DARPA’s hacking into cars to prove automakers are not securing them.  Director Folska wondered if RTD is vulnerable to those kinds of attacks.  Sheri Le replied that those types of attacks require a very sophisticated attacker.  RTD would be fooling itself by believing that no one would attack as anything is possible.  Sheri Le noted that there are multiple, simpler layers to address before avoiding an attack of that magnitude.  She said that her original research when she first started at RTD involved investigating highly sensitive threats, such as if an outside program could move a train.  Her conclusion was that it could happen but it is not easy.  She pointed out that her job is to add as many layers and doors as possible in order to stop an attacker as early as possible.

Director Hoy recalled the breach of Point of Sales (POS) machines last fall at a couple of light rail stations where customer credit card information was compromised.  He pointed out that RTD could be a target for many reasons, including the security of the Front Range and the operation of the City and County of Denver and other Metro area cities.  Director Hoy wondered if there have been any outside breaches at RTD.  Sheri Le replied that there have been breaches but nothing has precipitated to a safety issue that might harm individuals.  Director Hoy pointed out that a lesson to learn from those attacks is to change shields.  Sheri Le added that once an attack happens RTD needs to engage in incident response: stop the attack, notify the appropriate parties and authorities, assess what needs to happen, and assess the damage.  She said that the next step after mitigating the attack would be to figure out how to prevent such attacks from happening.  The final step would be to do a forensic assessment on how they got into the system.  She pointed out that as a defender the goal is to make access difficult so the attacker can be stopped as they approach before they get to what is really valuable.

Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that Cybersecurity is what he has been doing with the DOD for the past 20 years.  He pointed to the Snowden case as a watershed moment for the DOD.  He is glad to see Sheri Le on the team as she brings serious expertise in this area.  Committee Chair Tobiassen would like to instill Cybersecurity as a priority for Senior Management and the Directors in order to provide all the necessary resources.  He thanked Sheri Le and her team for their work and for starting to develop a culture of security at all levels.

#### 3. Fourth Quarter 2014 Investment Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer, introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt & Investments.  They referred the Directors to the Fourth Quarter Investment Report included in the February 10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Agenda packet.

Committee Chair Tobiassen pointed out that it seems to be a good time to borrow money.  He added that the funds are not making a lot of money due to low interest rates.

##### a. QUARTERLY DEC 2014 INV REPORT

#### 4. December 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller and Acting Chief Financial Officer, presented the unaudited December 2014 Monthly Financial Status Report as included in the February 10, 2015 Financial Administration & Audit Committee Agenda packet.  He pointed out the variance on the 16th Street Mall Shuttle, which is attributed to the Free Metro Ride, the variance on the West Line, and the variance of Fare Revenue.

Director Bagley noted that the Fare Revenue has gone down significantly.  He speculated it could be due to the reduced cost of gas.  He asked the Directors to take this into consideration as the Board works to balance the budget as well as the Fare Study recommendations.  Director Bagley asked Doug MacLeod when the CU-Boulder Leeds School of Business would present to the Board next.  Doug MacLeod noted that they are scheduled for the March Financial Administration and Audit Committee meeting.
