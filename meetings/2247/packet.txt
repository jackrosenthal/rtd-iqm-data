REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 ALLIED BARTON SECURITY SERVICES
AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-15

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD entered into an agreement with Allied Barton to provide security services at
various RTD locations and special events, effective February 1, 2013. The initial
agreement covered a three year period for approximately $14.6 million. Several
amendments have added additional services and new locations which increased the
overall cost of the contract. Most recently, Amendment # 8 dated December 2014,
revised the Statement of Work and increased the contract to a new maximum of $16.1
million.
AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit’s review concentrated on the monthly process of invoice creation by Allied
Barton and the subsequent review, approval, and payment within RTD. The audit
universe included a total of 45 invoices from January 1, 2014 through early November
for a total of $5.2 million.
Internal Audit performed tests as considered necessary to ensure invoices supplied by
Allied Barton clearly indicate the hours charged by location and employee, and are
reviewed and approved by appropriate RTD management before payment is authorized.

CONCLUSION
The controls over invoice review and approval appeared adequate. RTD management
will request Allied Barton to include ‘totals’ for selected ‘hours’ calculations on their
invoice and supporting worksheets in an effort to make the review and approval process
more efficient within our organization.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

CARTER BURGESS/JACOBS ENGINEERING INC. CONTRACT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-12-20
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD contracted with Carter Burgess/Jacobs Engineering Inc. for Program Management and
Planning Assistance for FasTracks Implementation. The effective date of the contract was June
28, 2005. It was a Cost Plus Fixed Fee contract. The period of performance was for 6 years with
an option for an additional 6 years following the initial 6 year period. The scope of services was
to be negotiated annually for the next calendar year. The initial not-to-exceed amount was
$2,270,227.00. In the past 9 years there have been 15 Amendments (Board approved) to the
contract with the total contract not-to-exceed amount, including previous expenditures, reaching
$150,982,726.00 in 2014.
SCOPE
The scope included the examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of RTD’s
system of internal controls pertaining to RTD’s expenditure for contractual supply services from
Carter Burgess/Jacobs Engineering Inc. The period under review included January to
December 2014.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
1. Determine whether the selection of the contract was properly justified.
2. Ensure that the contract was valid, properly authorized and approved.
3. Ensure that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable, accurate and according to the
terms and conditions of the contract.
4. Ensure contract compliance by RTD and the contractor.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1. Obtained and reviewed the contract file, the contract, the Standard Procurement Manual
and all relevant invoices.
2. Checked that the process used for determination of the contractor agreed with the
requirements of the Standard Procurement Manual and was justified.
3. Vouched invoices for accuracy and approval.
CONCLUSION
The selection of the contractor was properly justified. The contract was valid, properly
authorized and approved. Payment was only made on invoice charges that were valid,
reasonable, accurate and according to terms of the contract. There was compliance by both
RTD and the contractor. At this time there are no reportable exceptions.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 CDW DISCOUNT COMPUTER WAREHOUSE
AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-11

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD purchases computer hardware, software, user licenses, etc. from various sources,
including Computer Discount Warehouse (CDW). Generally, IT managers identify a
need for such equipment or software, and then request RTD Procurement to obtain
pricing quotes from reliable vendors.
The largest acquisition during the Scope period was for SharePoint user licenses which
allow RTD employees access to required software, at a cost of approximately $371,000.

AUDIT SCOPE
The Audit Scope included purchases from CDW between January 1, 2014 and midOctober. During this time, RTD spent approximately $622,000 on 18 purchases from
CDW.
Internal Audit performed tests as considered necessary to ensure the bidding and
evaluation process to choose CDW for selected purchases was properly executed and
documented in accordance with RTD procurement standards. The Audit Scope also
included a review to ensure that Software License purchases are properly justified and
internal tracking is adequate.
CONCLUSION
Internal Audit’s testing found that the process to select CDW for purchases was
adequately documented and payments were supported by Purchase Orders and
Invoices. IT Management will utilize Systems Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) in
2015 to improve the tracking of software licenses assigned to RTD employees and
contractors.
CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal
Audit follow-up review.

CONTRACT AND TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-04-08

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has been using contract and temporary staff to augment the regular staff. In 2011 RTD
issued Contract #11DO018 Temporary Personnel Services with an internal annual estimate of
$361,065.00 and an award not-to-exceed amount of $50,000.00 per contract. The period of
performance indicated was from 9/1/2011 to 5/31/12 with two (2) additional one (1) year options.
The awards were issued to 15 Temporary Agencies. The total amounts paid were
$1,538,722 for 2012, $3,217,774 for 2013 and $2,095,042 for January to August 2014.
SCOPE
The scope of the audit included an assessment of RTD’s controls governing the use of contract
and temporary employees during the audit period.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:






Determine the number of contract and temporary employees currently at RTD.
Analyze the use and cost of the contract and temporary employees.
Ensure these employees are classified correctly in the financial records.
Ensure appropriate procedures exist to control the use of contract and temporary staff
and they are being applied as prescribed.
Determine whether an adequate need exists for RTD to continue at the current level of
temporary staff.
CONCLUSION

RTD should not continue at this level of temporary employment.
RTD has not established adequate internal controls related to the use and control of temporary
personnel. As a result Internal Audit found instances that warrant rectification including:
 Lack of written policies and procedures.
 Temporary personnel providing services for prolonged periods.
 No verification of identity or eligibility of temporary personnel to work in the USA.
 Issues related to identification of budgeted funds.
 Lack of controls over authorization of timesheets and overtime.
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
Follow-Up Review.

DATAMAN USA LLC CONTRACT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-05-09

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Dataman USA LLC describes itself as a leader in providing innovative complete temporary
professional services. The Information Technology (IT) Division uses Dataman USA LLC to
provide staffing through work order contracts under Contract #12DKO018A. RTD also uses
Dataman USA LLC to provide temporary staffing under Contract #11DO018-5, Temporary
Personnel Services.
The following amounts, calculated using Oracle reports, were paid to Dataman USA LLC under
both contracts between January 2012 and July 2014.

SCOPE

Based on the work performed during the preliminary survey and the assessment of risk, the
audit period will cover the operations of Dataman USA LLC from 2011 to 2014 however, there
may be references made to earlier periods as required.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:
 Determine the need for RTD to continue at the current level of temporary personnel.
 Determine whether appropriate procedures exist to control the use of temporary/contract
staff and that they are being applied as prescribed.
 Ensure that temporary/contract employees’ costs are accurately recorded in the financial
system.
CONCLUSION
It is not in the best interest of RTD to continue at the current level of temporary staffing. In light
of the recent changes introduced by the Affordable Care ACT and the IRS regulations that have
played a part in several court cases ruling against government organizations, RTD must ensure
compliance with all relevant legislation.
Internal Audit has identified significant findings and made recommendations to comply with the
required legislation.
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
Follow-Up Review.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
2014 DENVER TRANSIT PARTNERS – DIA
CONTINUOUS MONITORING – INTERIM # 1
AUDIT REPORT # 14-12-14
BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD investigated the option of building two major rail lines using a public-private
partnership, in early 2007. Significant effort was involved in developing and soliciting a
‘Request for Quotations’ (RFQ) and evaluating the results pertaining to a Design, Build,
Finance, Operate and Maintain Agreement for the East Rail Line to Denver International
Airport.
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) was awarded the contract with the lowest cost at
approximately $1.3 billion for the construction phase, and the best overall technical
score. Groundbreaking was initiated in August 2010 with significant progress since
then. The line is expected to open in 2016.
DTP submits a monthly invoice with documents to support ‘percentage of completion’
calculations and related charges to RTD. These are reviewed and approved by various
RTD individuals before payment is made to DTP.
AUDIT SCOPE
Internal Audit performed a limited review of the controls within RTD over DTP invoice
receipt, review, and approval to ensure that construction work billed for has been
properly completed. We also participated in a bus tour to observe actual construction
progress as of mid-December.
Testing was performed, including a detailed sample walkthrough, to validate that
monthly progress invoices are properly supported by detailed worksheets which identify
the tasks completed. We also ensured that there is evidence of RTD management
review and approval of the entire invoice package, including supporting progress
worksheets.
CONCLUSION
Based on the results of our limited testing, it appears that monthly progress invoices are
adequately supported by DTP and sufficiently reviewed by appropriate RTD employees
before payment is authorized. Internal Audit will continue our involvement with this
project as it proceeds in 2015.

IGA AND CAM AGREEMENTS
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-12-16

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has entered into agreements with various Inter-Governmental Agencies (IGA’s) to
share the costs of maintaining the common areas at various light rail and bus stations,
and park-n-Ride locations. Other non-governmental agreements provide an annual
budget for anticipated Common Area Maintenance (CAM) costs, which allocate a
calculated percentage to RTD and other involved parties.
RTD had the following IGAs and CAMS at the time of this audit and these were the
subject of the review - Arista Metropolitan District, Carr America/Dry Creek, US 85 and
Bridge Street PnR, AHEC- Auraria East and West, Stonegate – Lincoln and Jordan
PnR, Hampden Town Center – Dayton Station, Lincoln Station and Englewood
Environmental Foundation – Englewood Station.
SCOPE
The scope included examination and evaluation of the adequacy and effectiveness of
RTD’s system of internal controls and the reporting upon such controls and other
procedures pertaining to RTD’s IGAs and CAMs.

OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to:




Review procedures for cost determination and ensure compliance with them.
Ensure costs are appropriate.
Analysis of agreements to ensure monitoring is adequate.

CONCLUSION

The differences in the agreements make it difficult for actual comparison one to another;
however individual agreements were compared annually. In our opinion the IGAs and
CAMS are being adequately monitored.
This audit is considered closed.

INTERIM REPORT 1
AUDIT REPORT # 14-06-13

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD entered into Contract #12DH015 with Kiewit Infrastructure Co. for the design and
construction of the I-225 Rail Line project. The contract was signed on August 28, 2012. The
total Contract value was $350,000,000 including the design portion, the Right-of-Way
management portion and the construction part. Construction began in 2012.
SCOPE
This audit will involve continuous monitoring of the contract as it goes toward completion. This
section of the audit focused on the contract.
OBJECTIVES
This audit was selected by Internal Audit. The objectives of the audit will be to:
 Ensure compliance by RTD and the contractor.
 Ensure RTD Management has policies and procedures in place for physical verification
of construction and they are being applied as prescribed.
 Review Management oversight and legal involvement.
PROJECT STATUS
The I-225 Rail Line project team and the Design-Build team (Kiewit and AECOM) continue to
make progress on the Project. AECOM is approximately 97% complete with the design and
Kiewit has completed approximately 30% of the construction.
AECOM continues to coordinate with the City of Aurora (COA) for agency reviews of RFC
packages, site plan submittals, and have facilitated comment resolution meetings. Kiewit has full
access to in Segment 1 and have continued track construction north of the median bridge by
placing the initial ballast, concrete ties, attaching the rail, and placing the second lift of ballast.
Kiewit is also working on seven out of the eight bridge structures along the alignment including
the elevated station at Colfax Avenue.
The station platforms are being constructed at Iliff Station and Florida Station with foundation

PURCHASING CARD (PCARD) AUDIT
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) DIVISION
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT # 14-01-17

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
Purchasing Cards are intended to be an easy to use, more efficient and cost-effective way to
buy and pay for lower value purchases. RTD participates in the State of Colorado Master
Contract for Credit Card Services via Citibank. At the current time, there are 10 Citibank
‘Corporate Cards’ assigned to IT employees. Approval limits for purchases generally do not
exceed a $3,000 per individual transaction. The current PCard arrangement generates a semiannual rebate to RTD of approximately 1.7% of purchases. Year-to-date through November, the
IT employees spent $525,228.
SCOPE
The scope included review of the transactions from January to November 2014.
All employee PCard statements were included in the review and testing of supporting
documentation and compliance with RTD policies and procedures.
OBJECTIVES
The objectives of the audit were to ensure:
1. Adherence to Purchasing card policies and procedures and
2. Purchasing cards are used for valid business purposes only.
METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to accomplish the objectives of the audit included but were not limited to
the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Reviewed the policies and procedures for RTDs Purchasing cards
Obtained information on all card holders and reviewed related forms.
Obtained lists of all transactions for the period indicated under the scope.

Interviewed staff to provide further information where needed.
CONCLUSION

There was compliance with the purchasing card policies and procedures. All purchases
reviewed were for RTDs business purposes. One purchasing card was not used within the audit
scope; a review should be conducted to determine if the card should be terminated.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
SMART MEDIA TECHNOLOGY PROJECT
SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE REVIEW
2014 INTERIM AUDIT REPORT # 14-11-10

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD has elected to implement the Smart Media Technology (SMT) system on its buses, and
train platforms using a ‘phased in’ approach. ACS (Affiliated Computer Services) a subsidiary of
Xerox has been working with RTD since 2011 to implement all aspects of this project. The RTD
Board recently approved a contract increase which raises the project cost to $19.7 million,
including equipment for the new RTD Light Rail platforms.
Since 2013, efforts have concentrated on developing a system that will allow passengers to
purchase credit as ‘stored value’ on their Smart Card, which will then be reduced when the card
holder ‘taps on’ to ride an RTD bus or Light Rail (LRT) vehicle. Security Officers will be utilized
to periodically test LRT riders’ cards to verify that they have ‘tapped on’ and have not exceeded
their ‘paid-for’ trip length. Stored Value capability was planned for mid-2014, but has been
delayed and is currently expected to be implemented in August 2015.
One of the stated project benefits is to eventually collect ridership data from passenger use of
electronic media cards for both bus and LRT rides. Such data will be analyzed by RTD and
used in future pricing analyses.
AUDIT SCOPE
Utilizing a System Development Life Cycle approach, our participation in 2014 has continued to
include a review of the development procedures being used to build a system that will satisfy
the needs of the District. Internal Audit has also monitored activities to ensure new capabilities
are adequately tested in advance of moving into a live, full production environment.
CONCLUSION
During 2014, the RTD Project Team has consistently worked with Xerox to develop the
electronic fare media system that was originally anticipated. However, as noted above,
problems and setbacks have been experienced and the goal to ‘go live’ with Stored Value
capability has now been postponed until the third quarter of 2015.
Due to ongoing issues, the development and use of Hand Held Security Devices has not met
original expectations. This has resulted in a limited ability to ensure that ECO and College Pass
riders have ‘tapped on’ before boarding RTD Light Rail vehicles. Audit has suggested that
efforts be initiated to utilize these devices as originally planned and full use of these devices is
now expected during the first quarter of 2015.

CURRENT STATUS
Mutually agreed upon corrective action is underway and will be subject to our normal Audit
follow-up review as Internal Audit continues to be involved with the Project Team.

VEOLIA TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FUEL AUDIT
REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
AUDIT REPORT #14-12-19

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
This audit was included as part of our Annual Audit Plan for 2014. In May 2009 Regional
Transportation District (RTD) entered into Contract #19DH010 with Veolia Transportation
Services Inc. (Veolia). The contract was for an initial three years with two further option years.
The initial 3 years - $79,689,258.00 (including Est. $12,264,770.00 Fuel). Option Year 1 $28,309,762.00 (including $4,323,822.00 Fuel), and option year 2 - $29,240,654.00 (including
4,459,836.00 Fuel). The fuel costs were to be reimbursed by RTD. Option year one
commenced on January 10, 2013 and expired on January 9, 2014 and option year 2
commenced on January 10, 2014 and will end on January 9, 2015.
Veolia has delivery times on Monday to Friday from 7:00am to 5:00pm. Veolia has two above,
ground diesel fuel tanks each with a capacity of 10,000 gallons. Their monthly/annual purchases
are 92,000 gallons per month or 1.1million gallons each year.
SCOPE
The audit concentrated on those areas of the contracts which were signed and define fuel costs
as they relate to Veolia during 2014. It covered the internal controls surrounding the accounting
for this contract as invoices for fuel are submitted and paid on a regular basis
OBJECTIVES
This audit was selected by Internal Audit. The objectives included:




Confirming that Veolia was only being reimbursed for fuel purchased and used for RTD
purposes.
Ensuring that payments were properly authorized and approved
Ensuring that all invoice charges were valid, reasonable and accurate and according to
contract terms and conditions.
CONCLUSION

The process for approving and authorizing payments for fuel are very rigorous, ensuring that the
entire process is in agreement with the contract terms and conditions. Review of a sample of
paid invoices supported the above statement.
At the current time Internal Audit identified no significant issues. We would like to thank all those
who assisted with this review.

RTD’s Cybersecurity Framework
(1) Does the organization use a security framework?

Answer: Yes. RTD’s cybersecurity assessments and strategy are
informed by multiple government and private industry standards
and frameworks.
•

Standards used for benchmarking RTD’s cybersecurity posture in 2014:
• NIST Cybersecurity Framework (pub. 12 Feb 2014); correlates to:
• NIST SP 800-53
• COBIT
• ISO 27001
• SANS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense

•

Standards that additionally inform the growth and development of RTD’s
cybersecurity strategy:
• APTA Standards Development Program Recommended Practices

Top Five Cybersecurity Risks
(2) What are the top five risks the organization has related to cybersecurity?

Answer: The top five things that keep me up at night are:
1) Securing RTD’s credit card Point of Sale systems
2) Maintaining the integrity and availability of RTD’s customer communications systems
3) Reviewing and applying appropriate access control to RTD’s sensitive data, including personnel,
payroll, and accounting systems
4) Managing third party and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) access to RTD systems and networks
5) Controlling visibility and access to control and dispatch systems

Employee Cybersecurity Awareness
(3) How are employees made aware of their role related to cybersecurity?

Answer: RTD’s security policy, Management Directive IT-1: Secure Computing Standards,
and an accompanying cybersecurity training program and wiki, Cybersecurity@RTD,
were published in May 2014, piloted with employees throughout 2014, and became an
annual requirement for all salaried employees in January 2015.
•

In 2014, 226 employees took the
Cybersecurity@RTD self-guided training
from the RTD intranet site

•

Training was introduced to all new
employees joining RTD since June of
2014

•

Training and policy are revised and
evaluated annually as the cybersecurity
program matures

Cybersecurity Threat Analysis
(4) Are external and internal threats considered when planning cybersecurity program activities?

Answer: Yes. RTD’s receives information about threats originating from inside and
outside the organization from a variety of external sources. RTD follows FTA
methodologies to identify our most critical assets and prioritize cybersecurity actions to
have the most impact on the greatest areas of risk.
•

Government and private sector information sharing
groups for transportation, cybersecurity, and critical
infrastructure threat intelligence

•

Focus on the “unintentional insider” with
cybersecurity governance, awareness training, and
enforcement

•

Security Governance
(5) How is security governance managed within the organization?

Answer: Cybersecurity responsibility is delegated to the Information Technology
department. Major risks are reviewed with the Senior Manager of IT and IT
Management as they are identified; critical risks and incidents are reviewed with the IT
Governance Committee (AGMs) and Senior Leadership Team (AGMs and GM).

Incident Response
(6) In the event of a serious breach, has management developed a robust response protocol?

Answer: Yes. In early 2014, RTD developed a preliminary critical incident handling
framework for IT that addresses data breach or loss, security incidents, and major
outages. Using industry best practices and lessons learned in 2014, RTD formally
defined and published a robust incident management process in December 2014.
•

Three-phased response process:
• Declare an incident
• Execute the response plan
• Incident review

•

Identifies roles and responsibilities and communication flows from identification to closure

Fourth Quarter 2014 Investment Report

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the fourth quarter of 2014 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded at a rate of 2.4% percent during the fourth quarter of 2014. The national
unemployment rate declined to 5.6% and general inflationary pressures remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve has continued with its accommodative
monetary policy and left the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%). The committee noted that
in determining how long to maintain this target range, it will “assess progress-both realized and
expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation”. The Federal Reserve
finished winding down its $85 billion a month bond purchase program in October, 2014.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

4th Quarter

Y-T-D

RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

0.042 %
0.004%

-0.066%

0.276 %
0.138%

Enhanced Cash Tier:
RTD enhanced cash:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the fourth quarter of 2014 was 0.20% which
would produce annualized earnings of $366,961. The current return for the month of December was
0.22%.
