addition, RTD will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in amounts estimated to
total approximately $2,457,532 for the initial three year period and $4,445,115 for the
five year period. This results in combined contract totals not to exceed $15,642,853 in
total for the initial three year period (2008-2010) and $29,436,203 for the five year period
2008-2012.
Bruce Abel introduced this item and indicated RTD has been working with Global
Transportation on their business model and feels they are making progress.
Motion:

Director Martinez made the motion to move this
action item forward to the full Board for a vote
on November 23, 2010.

Second:

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Tobiassen asked what were the number
of vehicles in their fleet. Larry Buter responded
56 vehicles. Director Bagley inquired about the
business model which implied a deficit. He
asked if we should be working with the vendor
on this model. Bruce Abel responded that we
have mentored other vendors especially
SBE/DBE vendors to help them become
successful.
Director Malpiede shared a problem that one of
her clients had experienced in pickup and dropoff. Larry Buter indicated RTD was aware of
this problem which occurred through no fault of
Global but because of a glitch in our Route
match software. Director Christopher inquired
what % increase have we seen in the proposed
2011 contract over 2010. Bruce Abel
responded but will follow-up with Director
Christopher with a more definitive response.
