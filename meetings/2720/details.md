#### 1. Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44 Cutaway Buses

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, said that Michael Ford, Chief Operating Officer, and Steve Gieske, General Superintendent of Maintenance, were with him to discuss the motion. He said that this action related to Task Goal #3, State of Good Repair. He noted that this action would replace 32 vehicles currently used in the Call-n-Ride service that were seven years old. He added that this action was an administrative detail that allowed staff a five-year period to have a phased replacement of the fleet.

Director Archuleta inquired as to what brand the buses would be.

Mr. Gieske stated that they were Goshen buses from Elkhart, Indiana.

Director Broom asked what would happen to the buses that were being phased out, and inquired if they would they be traded in or sold.

Mr. Abel stated that RTD disposes of vehicles via auction. He said that RTD has a contract with Roller Auctions and they auction all of RTD’s retired vehicles electronically.

Director Menten commented that the service lifespan for these buses were five years, and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) minimum guidelines for these buses were five years. She asked if this purchase was really the best buy for RTD’s money.

Mr. Abel said yes, and added that staff felt that this was appropriate and in line with the FTA’s guidelines. He said that the FTA separates vehicles into three categories: light, medium, and heavy duty. He remarked that these buses fall into the light duty category, and RTD has been able to get a seven-year lifespan from them.

Director Menten asked what the seating configuration would be for the new buses.

Mr. Gieske commented that the Call-n-Ride vehicles have two wheelchair positions and thirteen seats and the Access-a-Ride vehicles have four companion seats and three wheelchair tie down positions.

Committee Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 2. Recommended Changes to Special Event Services

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors approve the following changes to Special Event services:

1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and

2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.

BACKGROUND

1.       RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and RockiesRide service began that same year.  The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games.  Over the years, service levels have been adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton park-n-Rides).  Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks games; most games operated with six buses.  In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of $20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.

Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board passengers.  In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer be available.  Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another location to the Rockies-Lot.  RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for the past 24 years.

Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.

2.       RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides.  Race for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006.  Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in 2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011.  In 2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers).  As Race for the Cure participation has declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.

It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service standards.

DISCUSSION

1.       RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of buses that can be used.  Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.

Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.  No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide service.

2.       RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place at one time.  The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.

Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and US-36 & McCaslin.  No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and US-85 & Bridge.

Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative Offices.  Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and email:

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

12:00 noon

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter.  There were six members from the public in attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments included the following:

- Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game

- Sports-rides should be better marketed

- Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L

- Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.

Monday, February 5, 2018

RTD Administrative Offices

6:00 pm

Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade.  There were three members from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.

No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.

RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.  Those comments are summarized below:

- Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide Service.

- Email (3):  Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was good and/or full.  A third email shared several comments:

o        Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and non-existent on Sundays

o        RTD does not market anything

o        RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on ridership

o        RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game

o        Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park Avenue

o        Fares should be collected in both directions

o        RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service

o        RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service

o        RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting services that people actually use

FINANCIAL IMPACT

1.       RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of service.

2.       RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:

1.              Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station.  This alternative is not recommended because on opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.

3.              Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent years.

Prepared by:

Brian Matthews, Manager, Special Services

Motion:               Director Broom made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the February 27, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Mr. Abel said that this action as brought forth in support of RTD’s fiscal sustainability goals. He noted that, when Major League Baseball (MLB) opened in Denver in 1993, RockiesRide service was added for ridership to those games. He explained that RockiesRide service had been reduced over the years, and in 2017, there was only an average of 236 people each way. He added that this year the Rockies had advised RTD that the lot at Wazee and 22nd would be used for parking for their games due to local development. He stated that the Race for the Cure ridership had declined dramatically as well, and for those reasons staff would like to discontinue those two services. He remarked that RTD’s service standards require a minimum attendance of 40,000 people to justify the usage of buses for special services, and because the RockiesRide and Race for the Cure have not met that attendance in years, staff would like to discontinue those services. He noted that RTD had alternative services available, such as routine service to Denver Union Station (DUS) and on game days, and that RTD would back those services up.

Director Lubow stated that she would vote no on this because she wanted the issue to continue to be discussed. She added that there were people in Longmont that felt that they were not listened to about this and she felt that everyone could get to the same place with more discussion.

Mr. Abel commented that there were two open houses at RTD’s Blake Street office and constituents also shared their comments with staff via phone and email.

Director Lubow explained that people in Longmont felt aggrieved, and there was a sense that they were treated like a stepchild. She said that it was important to deal with the ridership in Longmont sensitively and she would like to see more discussions happen in her district.

Chair Tisdale stated that it might be fair to say for the record that this action was not a discontinuation, as it was more akin to a right-sizing of service. He said that retooling to be more effective in the light of changes in circumstances was appropriate, so he would be voting to support this item.

Director Hoy asked if Mr. Abel meant to infer the 120X would run on Sundays.

Mr. Abel said yes and added that staff would be looking at that as an alternative option. He said that the 120X runs from the Wagon Road Park-n-Ride to DUS, and that was the terminal that RTD would use henceforth for any special service for events such as the Rockies games.

Director Hoy inquired if the 236 Longmont passengers who used the RockiesRide had the same opportunity to participate in the open house that RTD hosted.

Mr. Abel said yes, they participated via phone or email, but there were no physical meetings held in Longmont.

Director Sisk commented that RTD needed to provide more service to Longmont. He said that RTD was leaving them stranded so he would vote no on the action until he could see a plan that would service Longmont. He said that he wanted staff to show him what they had planned, and what alternatives were being considered as well.

Director Anderson remarked that staff would do a good job to provide service and increase service in places that need it, such as Longmont. She added, however, that RTD would not be able to please everyone.

Director Menten said that she was in support of this item, and no matter what part of the district this affected, it needed to be done for the taxpayers.

Committee Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. Service Availability Update 2 13 18

Mr. Abel said that lost service hours increased from 270.76 in January 2017 to 664.04 in January of 2018. He stated that at the conclusion of 2017, staff provided 99.4% of all hours, but that required mandates or volunteers. He added that staff continues to work with HR for recruitment and retention to right size RTD’s service and balance the level of service with the amount of operators available.

Chair Tisdale noted that on the cover memo, the increase from 271 lost service hours to 664 is actually a 245% increase that was only identified as “a slight increase”.

##### a. Service Availability Update 2 13 18 Revised

### D. Other Matters

Director Anderson remarked that she wanted to take an opportunity to offer her deepest condolences to the family of the bus driver who passed away earlier in the week. She said that this had happened before and it would be her desire for RTD to look to the health of its bus drivers and operators. She said that RTD should ensure its employees are receiving good healthcare and good advice about some of the things that cause sudden death. She added that RTD as a whole should become healthier and there are some quick and easy ways to do that. She further stated that RTD needed to help its employees lead a long and productive life.

Mr. Abel stated that he wanted to update the Board on the upcoming work for the I-25/C470 interchange. He said that RTD staff would take advantage of that nine-day period that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) was using for the C470 widening project to do some work on RTD’s system. He explained that due to the magnitude of the shut down and the level of service necessary to provide meaningful bus bridge service, RTD was currently not in a position to provide bus bridge service. He stated that staff had secured additional parking at the Arapahoe Station and were working on securing additional parking at the Southmore and Dry Creek Park-n-Rides. He said that the General Manager would meet with the Denver South Economic Development Partnership (EDP) to discuss the impacts to that area.

Director Walker asked if there would be any lane closures on I-25 or C470.

Mr. Abel stated that there should be closures on C470 because of the interchange.

Director Walker commented that staff was taking the appropriate steps to provide other options to people who might be impacted.

Mr. Abel said staff would message carpooling, ridesharing, and other such efforts to minimize the impacts.

Director Folska asked what contingency support did staff have in place for those who were transit dependent.

Mr. Abel said that staff has the potential use of Call-n-Ride vehicles, and staff has reached out to Lyft for other options. He added that staff is currently engaged in a variety of conversations as well.

Director Lubow asked if it was correct to say that RTD was stopping service because it has to, but at the same time, it was not offering anything else to replace it.

Mr. Abel stated that Light Rail would run as far south as the Dry Creek Station. He commented that it was appropriate to say that service was being curtailed at Dry Creek and that constituents would need to access service from other stations during the nine day period.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Deadwyler adjourned the meeting at 6:09 p.m.
