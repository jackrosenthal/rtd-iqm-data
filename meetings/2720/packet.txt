BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 7, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Contract Option Award for the Purchase of 44
Cutaway Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee, to exercise the option of contract 25FK006 with
Master’s Transportation for the purchase of 44 Goshen cutaway buses to be used for the Access-a-Ride
and Call-n-Ride services at a price not to exceed $3,100,654.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted 2018 Task Goal #3, Asset Management and State of Good Repair, Bus
Operations has begun the process of replacing the aging and high maintenance Cutaway Buses,
currently being used for the Access-a-Ride and Call-n-Ride services.
On January 19, 2016 the RTD Board of Director approved the procurement of 233 Goshen cutaway
buses. The procurement was the result of RTD Information for Bids (IFB25FK006) issued on October 19,
2015. Five bids were received on December 8, 2015 in response to this IFB. Master’s Transportation
was the responsive and responsible low bidder for the selected bus configurations. The IFB allowed RTD
to purchase additional cutaway buses for a five-year period with each successive year pricing to be
based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price adjustment set by the US Department of
Labor’s Producer Price Index (PPI). The application of this formula to the original price quotes results in a
per bus unit cost of $69,303.57 for a Call-n-Ride bus and $65,371.03 for an Access-a-Ride bus.
Staff is requesting Board approval to exercise the option to Contract 25FK006 with Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 additional Goshen cutaway buses. The new buses will replace 322011 Model Years Eldorado buses used for the Call-n-Ride service and 12 2007 and 2011 Model Year
buses used for the Access-a-Ride service.
DISCUSSION
The 2007 and 2011 Model Year cutaway buses to be replaced have exceeded their Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) service life of 5 years or 150,000 miles. They are currently over 7 years old and
have accumulated on the average of 190,000 miles. They require intensive maintenance to keep them
in service.
The new ADA cutaway buses will conform to the configuration that was developed in cooperation with
the disability community several years ago during the initial 2015/2016 procurement of ADA cutaway
buses. The new Goshen cutaway buses will be up to 24’ long. The buses will be equipped with an
extended sized wheelchair lift to accommodate large sized wheelchairs, two wheelchair access areas for
the Call-n-Ride buses and three wheelchair access areas for the Access-a-Ride buses to allow for ADA
compliance. The buses will also be equipped with a security camera system per the current standard on
all new RTD buses.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for this contract amendment is included in the District’s 2018 Adopted Budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Master’s Transportation selected bus manufacturer, Goshen, has
submitted a certificate attesting to FTA's approval of its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. To authorize the General Manager or his designee, to award the Contract Option to Master’s
Transportation for the purchase of 44 cutaway buses at a price not to exceed $3,100,654. This
is the recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not recommended as it would result, at
the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost to the project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: February 8, 2018

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 8, 2018

Board Meeting Date: February 27, 2018

Subject:

Recommended
Services

Changes

to

Special

Event

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the following changes to Special Event services:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends; and
2. Discontinue RTD RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event.
BACKGROUND
1. RockiesRide - Major League Baseball expanded to include the Colorado Rockies in 1993 and
RockiesRide service began that same year. The service operated with 12 routes to 23 Park-n-Rides
and ran approximately 175 buses to all home games. Over the years, service levels have been
adjusted to better match ridership. In 2017, the service was reduced to just two routes serving four
Park-n-Rides (8th & Coffman and 815 South Main in Longmont and Wagon Road and Thornton parkn-Rides). Service operated on Opening Day, for Saturday and Sunday games, and for fireworks
games; most games operated with six buses. In 2017, there were an average of 472 boardings per
game (approximately 236 RTD passengers) for the two routes. In 2015, RockiesRide service
operated at a $16.84 subsidy per passenger boarding versus $5.15 subsidy per boarding for
BroncosRide service that same year. In 2016, RockiesRide service operated at a cost per boarding of
$20.96 versus a cost per boarding of $10.07 for BroncosRide service. Costs for 2017 have not yet
been calculated pending the final close of the 2017 financial books.
Since the opening of Coors Field, the Colorado Rockies have allowed RockiesRide buses to use the
parking lot located on the corner of Wazee St. and 22nd Ave. (Rockies-Lot) to board and de-board
passengers. In November 2017, the Colorado Rockies notified RTD the Rockies-Lot would no longer
be available. Due to construction, the Colorado Rockies are required to relocate parking from another
location to the Rockies-Lot. RockiesRide is no longer able to use the parking lot as it has used for
the past 24 years.
Due to the loss of parking at Coors Field, any bus service for passengers desiring to attend Rockies
games will be need to terminate at Denver Union station as do other RTD bus services from the north
metro area. Therefore, it is recommended that “RockiesRide” service as a free standing branded
sports ride service be discontinued and staff be authorized to develop alternative service
configurations to serve Longmont and Thornton areas on Rockies game weekends in order to serve
the ridership that does exist, especially on Sundays where no alternative service exists.
2. RACE - RTD began offering RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event on

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

October 3rd, 1999. That year, the service operated with 20 buses from three (3) Park-n-Rides. Race
for the Cure attendance peaked at 65,350 in 2006. Peak boardings for RACE Service occurred in
2005 (12,671) and has generally ranged between 8,000 and 12,000 from 2001 and 2011. In
2017, Race for the Cure attendance dipped to 10,200 and RACE Service boardings dropped to an
all-time low of 786 (approximately 393 RTD passengers). As Race for the Cure participation has
declined, RTD boardings have followed suit.
It is recommended that RACE Service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event be
discontinued due to low ridership and levels of event participation do not meet RTD service
standards.
DISCUSSION
1. RockiesRide - The Colorado Rockies offered to assist RTD in securing access to 21st St. between
Blake and Market for RockiesRide use to compensate for the loss of the Rockies-Lot parking. After
looking at this location, bus operations staff raised concerns as the location limits the number of
buses that can be used. Moreover, it constricts operations as driveways and alleys need to remain
clear. This location will not work for RTD operations. In addition, RTD service standards require a
minimum attendance of 40,000 persons in one location at one time to warrant consideration for
special event bus service. While previous attendance at Coors Field met this standard, recent
attendance figures would not meet the standard for special event bus service. Average attendance at
Coors Field for the 2017 season was 36,465.
Alternative service exists on the Routes 120X and LD/LX for customers on Weekdays and Saturdays.
No alternative service is available on Sundays and this reinforces the recommendation to authorize
staff to develop alternative service configurations to provide access to downtown Denver on Rockies
game weekends, especially Sunday, from the areas previously served by weekend RockiesRide
service.
2. RACE Service - The RTD service standard for event service requires 40,000 participants in one place
at one time. The 2017 Race for the Cure event participation (10,200) does not meet the RTD
service standard of 40,000 persons in one place at one time.
Alternative service exists on the Flat Iron Flyer for customers traveling from US36 & Table Mesa and
US-36 & McCaslin. No alternative service is available for passengers traveling from Wagon Road and
US-85 & Bridge.
Two public meetings were held on February 5 at 12:00 noon and 6:00 pm at the RTD Administrative
Offices. Listed below is a summary of the comments received at the public meetings and via phone and
email:
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
12:00 noon
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter and Jessie Carter. There were six members from the public in
attendance, five of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service changes. Comments
included the following:
 Concern for the elderly and ADA passengers who could not otherwise get to the game
 Sports-rides should be better marketed
 Perhaps use RockiesRide buses to back up regular service and add Sunday service on the route L



Jessie Carter addressed the individual who attended the meeting to share comments regarding
the route L and the 27 following the discussion of the RockiesRide service

No one in attendance spoke regarding the proposed elimination of the Race for the Cure service.
Monday, February 5, 2018
RTD Administrative Offices
6:00 pm
Staff in attendance included Dan Menter, Jessie Carter and Jonathan Wade. There were three members
from the public in attendance, all of whom attended because of the RockiesRide proposed service
changes. None of the attendees requested to speak or provide input at the meeting.
No one attended on behalf of Race for the Cure proposed service changes.
RTD staff received one phone call and three emails regarding the RockiesRide proposed service changes.
Those comments are summarized below:
 Phone (1): Phone conversation suggested RTD keep Saturday and Sunday only RockiesRide
Service.
 Email (3): Two emails were in support of RockiesRide claiming ridership from Longmont was
good and/or full. A third email shared several comments:
o Scheduled service alternatives are very limited and inconvenient on Saturdays and nonexistent on Sundays
o RTD does not market anything
o RTD requirement that buses wait 45 minutes after the game has a negative impact on
ridership
o RTD should consider an alternative loading/unloading location, i.e., layover in Union
Station and then load at top of Wewatta ramp post game
o Need a free shuttle between DUS and a convenient location near Wewatta and Park
Avenue
o Fares should be collected in both directions
o RockiesRide service should be a scheduled service, not a Special Service
o RTD needs to do a better job protecting for overloads on game days on the FF service
o RTD should contemplate how to generate more boardings systemwide, rather than cutting
services that people actually use
FINANCIAL IMPACT
1. RockiesRide – Eliminating the service saves approximately $108,000 annualized. Some of this
funding will be required to provide alternative service from the areas affected by the elimination of
service.
2. RACE – Eliminating the service saves approximately $16,800 annualized.

ALTERNATIVES:
1. Discontinue RockiesRide bus service and authorize staff to develop alternative service configurations
to serve Longmont and Wagon Road/Thornton on Rockies games weekends and discontinue RTD
RACE service to the Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure event. This is the recommended alternative.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

2. RockiesRide - Run the service out of Union Station. This alternative is not recommended because on
opening day and fireworks games RTD does not have the capacity to operate the service and the
service would duplicate existing service on the route L and the 120X, on all days except Sundays. In
addition, the service would not the minimum requirements of RTD’s adopted service standards.
3.

Race for the Cure – the existing service could be maintained but this alternative is not recommended
as it would be in violation of RTD service standards and has generated very low ridership in recent
years.

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.4% of all scheduled hours of bus service in
January 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase slightly from January
2017 (from 270.76 hours in 2017 to 664.04 in 2018), however, RTD did provide in excess of 99.4%
of all scheduled hours. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to
