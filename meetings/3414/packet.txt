BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
2021-2026 Strategic Plan Performance Update

Committee Meeting Date:
September 14, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Leah Riley, Chief Administrative Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
A strategic plan provides an organization with a north star and is a means to align resources and
activities to outcomes. The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Plan) is RTD’s north star and provides the
overarching framework for decision-making at every level. The Plan also represents a fundamental shift:
reframing the value of transit in terms of outcomes, not simply inputs. While the traditional metrics of
ridership and on-time performance are important, transit brings greater value to the community, even to
those who are not customers.
The Plan articulates:
•
•
•
•

Mission: We make lives better through connections
Vision: To be the trusted leader in mobility, delivering excellence and value to our customers and
community
Values: Passion, Respect, Diversity, Trustworthiness, Collaboration and Ownership
Strategic Priorities: Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial
Success

In addition, the Plan elements can be viewed in four areas:
1. Why: the mission, vision and values
2. What: the measurable strategic outcomes
3. How: the work plan, milestones and budget
4. Who: the performance metrics and monitoring thereof
Pursuant to the Plan, the Board is responsible for the Why and the What, which provide clarity in
mission, vision and outcomes. The General Manager and CEO, along with agency staff, is responsible for
the How and the Who, enabling progress on outcomes.
During the most recent Performance Committee (Committee) meeting held on June 1, 2022, staff
presented information regarding the ongoing implementation of the Plan, including a review of the
agency’s Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and resulting areas of opportunity.

DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable highlights regarding Plan implementation since the June 1, 2022
Performance Committee meeting, including:
•
•
•
•
•

Quarterly scorecard review
Employee survey results
Areas of opportunity progress
Community and customer surveys for 2022
TransDASH performance dashboard introduction

Quarterly Scorecard Review
The agency has garnered baseline data and is tracking progress on the quarterly performance goals for
the Plan’s strategic priorities:
•
•
•
•

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong community partner, providing value to customers
as well as to the broader Denver metro region while sustaining planet Earth
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the management of all financial resources.

Much of the data for the quarterly performance goals is garnered through annual surveys. Thus, agency
progress for a given strategic priority can be analyzed once a survey baseline is established a second
survey is conducted.
Employee Survey
To establish a baseline for the Employee Ownership strategic priority, the agency conducted an
employee survey in May 2022. With a participation rate of 37 percent for all employees, the statistically
valid survey yielded an employee net promoter score of 38. According to Qualtrics, a web-based survey
service, the typical participation rate for employee surveys is between five and 30 percent, meaning that
RTD’s employee survey response is encouraging and denotes a high degree of engagement.
Internal teams have analyzed the results of the survey and have been empowered to turn these results
into action. Their collaborative efforts, based on Design Thinking principles, rely heavily on collecting and
measuring employee feedback. This system places the accountability and responsibility with the
appropriate groups to ensure proposed solutions are actionable and will resonate with employees across
the agency.
Areas of Opportunity
As shared with the Board in February 2022 and again in June 2022, the agency continues to make
progress on the areas of opportunity discerned from the 2021 community and customer surveys:

2022 Community and Customer Surveys
The community and customer surveys will launch no later than September 14, 2022 and will be
conducted for no fewer than 12 days. The surveys will be conducted by BB Research, and the
methodology will be similar to that used by TransPro for the community and customer surveys
conducted in 2021, ensuring consistent and comparable data collection and responses. The surveys will
be available in English and Spanish, and responses will be closely monitored to ensure statistically valid
results from traditionally underrepresented communities. Survey results will be presented to the
Performance Committee in October 2022 and further disseminated to the full Board.
TransDASH
RTD is participating in the TransDASH performance dashboard, a public-facing analytical tool that will
launch on September 26, 2022, along with several other transit agencies of varying size from across the
country. TransDASH focuses on measuring the value that transit brings to communities over the volume
of a system’s ridership. Similar to the Plan, it focuses on measuring Customer Value, Community Value
and Taxpayer Value, and it establishes objective indicators of success and analyzes performance, both
over time and seasonally, and compares metrics across participating agencies.
Next Steps
Staff continues to focus on the How and the What, taking actionable steps to move the needle on the
strategic priorities. Efforts are being made to empower employees to streamline systems, break down
silos, and continue to allocate resources in alignment with the Plan.
Moving forward together, through the end of 2022, collaboration with the Board will focus on:
•
•
•

The mission, vision and outcomes, thereby highlighting the Why and the What
Reviewing progress on the How and the Who through reports on metrics and success outcomes
Reviewing the second wave of Community Value and Customer Excellence surveys launching no
later than September 14, 2022, as well as additional updates regarding:
o Areas of opportunity identified in the first wave of surveys conducted in the fall of 2021
o Possible new areas of opportunity to be identified in the second wave of surveys

The success of the Plan requires continued collaboration and agility. It is important to remember that,
even though the Plan is far-reaching and structured, it must be able to account for the dynamic
environment in which it exists. With the Board focused on the What and Why, and staff focused on the
How and Who, the needle will continue to move in the right direction.
