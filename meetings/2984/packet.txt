RESOLUTION NO. _______, SERIES OF 2020
Remote Participation in Meetings During Emergencies
WHEREAS, A disease outbreak related to the spread of a novel coronavirus reached the
United States in February 2020; and
WHEREAS, State and federal agencies are mobilizing efforts to respond to the disease, and
those efforts are continually evolving; and
WHEREAS, Members of RTD staff have begun to prepare for the agency’s own swift and
agile response to the threat of the disease, should it appear in the state of Colorado, in order
to continue to meet our constituents’ public transit needs to the greatest extent possible;
and
WHEREAS, As safety is RTD’s core value, and since a policy of social distancing is among
the chief strategies to combat the spread of the coronavirus disease, it is in the interest of
the agency and the wellbeing of the public, the staff, and the Directors themselves to
conduct Board Meetings and Special Board Meetings telephonically or via other electronic
means; and
WHEREAS, Other emergency situations may arise in the future that could impair the Board’s
ability to congregate in a single location in order to conduct critical business; and
WHEREAS, Currently the Board Bylaws expressly permit electronic participation in
committee meetings “by speakerphone or other similar electronic means by which all
participants can hear and speak with each other”1; and
WHEREAS, The Bylaws are currently silent on Directors’ ability to participate electronically
during Board Meetings or Special Board Meetings.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Board of Directors hereby authorizes the
Chair of the Board to determine, in the Chair’s sole discretion, that the conduct of a Board
Meeting or Special Board Meeting telephonically or via other electronic means is in the
interests of safety, public health, and continuity of operations, so long as either:

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT




RTD has activated its Continuity of Operations Plan (COOP) in response to a
perceived threat; or
The Governor has declared that a disaster emergency exists in the state of Colorado,
which emergency could threaten the health, safety, or welfare of persons physically
attending meetings of the Board.

For a Board Meeting or Special Board Meeting to be conducted telephonically or by other
electronic means, the following protocols will be observed:
1) The Board Office will continue to publish any Board Meeting or Special Board Meeting
agenda as closely as possible to the currently established time frame for the
distribution of meeting materials. In no event shall the Board Office publish an agenda
less than 24 hours prior to the meeting.
2) The public agenda will cite the location of the meeting. If the meeting is to be
conducted telephonically, the telephone number and conference ID must be provided.
If the meeting is to be conducted via electronic means, a URL for the meeting will be
provided.
3) Directors attending the meeting remotely may participate and vote telephonically, so
long as a quorum has been established.
4) The Board Office will audio record the meeting to the extent possible, recognizing
that video recording of meetings conducted either outside of the RTD Administrative
Offices located at 1660 Blake Street or via web-based means may not be possible
due to the circumstances.
5) To the greatest extent possible, Directors participating remotely should contact staff
and other Directors in advance of the meeting with any questions or comments.
6) All votes will be conducted via roll call rather than by electronic means.
Upon the deactivation of the COOP or the declaration by the Governor that the emergency
situation has abated, as applicable, Board Meetings and Special Board Meetings will once
again be held at the Board’s primary business office or such other physical location in the
District as the Board may designate, and Directors must once again be physically present at
such meetings in order to vote.
It is the intent of the Board that any meetings of the Board conducted telephonically or via
other electronic means must comply with all applicable provisions of Colorado law, including
the Open Meetings Law, §§24-6-401 and 24-6-402, Colorado Revised Statutes, as those
provisions pertain to the District, as well as with the Board Bylaws and Board Operating
Guidelines.
Nothing in this resolution is intended to permit Directors to participate remotely in an
executive session held during a Board Meeting or Special Board Meeting conducted

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

Date:

March 4, 2020

Board Meeting Date: March 24, 2020

Subject:

May 2020 Recommended Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2020 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized base system cost savings of $6,737,700 and a FasTracks cost savings of $1,534,700,
and a reduction of 43 operator shifts and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.
The funds that are saved through the service reductions will be placed in the Board Appropriated
Reserves for future Board consideration.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions aimed at addressing an
operator shortage which has resulted in increase in loss of service and service unreliability. As presented
in the December 19, 2019 Board of Director’s Study Session, this proposal seeks to reduce the number
of operators necessary to provide RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching our service offerings
to our operator headcount. The Board adopted Service Standards were used as a guiding policy in the
development of this plan, which include consideration toward ridership performance and service
duplication.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;



Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

available March 12th.

COMMITMENT TO PARATRANSIT CUSTOMERS
Access-a-Ride is our federally mandated, ADA-compliant, complementary paratransit service. The service
is provided during the same service hours as fixed-route buses and is offered within ¾ of a mile of fixedroute bus service and within ¾ of a mile from a rail station.
While we finalize work on the new service deployment for fixed-route service, we are keenly aware of
how any reductions to fixed-route services might impact the ability of our Access-a-Ride paratransit
customers to gain access to service.
RTD is committed to our Access-a-Ride customers, and we understand the best way to continue to meet
the needs of this at-risk population is to grandfather in customers who might be impacted in those areas
where all fixed-route service is eliminated. Grandfathering, i.e. the continuation of service to existing
Access-a-Ride customers in areas where all fixed-route service is eliminated due to the May service
deployment, is recommended by staff as a solution to this concern. Upon approval of this action by the
Board, staff will work with its Call Center team and software provider to adjust training and update
software to assure that Access-a-Ride paratransit service to those customers who are grandfathered in
is offered at the same levels and in the same areas as those immediately prior to the May service
changes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $6.74 million and a FasTracks cost savings of $1.53 million. The operator requirement
impacts are an estimated reduction of 34 Bus and 9 Rail work shifts.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations.
Prior to the Title VI analysis, many routes were removed from the service changes based on community
feedback from 20 public meetings. The Title VI analysis of the proposed May 2020 service was
completed after these changes were removed from the proposal. The analysis has shown the service
changes would result in a disparate impact to populations served by three routes (Routes 65, 130, and R
Line) and a disproportionate burden to populations served by one route (Route 236). However, because
these routes have fallen below RTD’s adopted service standards and RTD is grappling with a severe
labor shortage, there is legitimate business justification for reducing service on the routes. After
reviewing routes similar to the ones listed above, it was determined there was no less discriminatory
alternative than the changes currently proposed.

May 2020 Service Change

Wednesday, February 19, 2020
Boulder Chamber of Commerce
2440 Pearl Street, Boulder
6pm
Staff in attendance included Sage Thornbrugh, Brian Matthews, Pauline Haberman, and Nataly Handlos.
Alex Hyde‐Wright from Boulder County, Danny O’Connor from Boulder County, John Tayer from the
Boulder Chamber of Commerce, Andrea Meneghel from the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, Joan Lyons
from Boulder Transportation Connections, and Cliff Bosley from the Bolder Boulder were also
present. There were 4 members of the public in attendance, along with Lynn Guissinger, Director
District O, RTD Board.

John Tayer introduced himself as a former board member and a friend and partner of RTD.
He spoke about his opposition to the cancellation of the RunRide by stating that it is
impossible to safely and timely serve 50,000 people in such a small time window without
transit. He indicated that the Bolder Boulder is most people’s first experience with transit,
and that we should preserve those opportunities for newcomers. He stated that the Bolder
Boulder is an iconic local event, and that everyone needs to do what they can to make
sure it remains an enjoyable and well-run experience. He claimed that the deadline for the
decision to cut the RunRide service is too close to the race for organizers to develop an
alternative plan. He asked that the service not be cut in 2020.

Beth Hendorf asked whether RTD ridership would improve with more neighborhood/group
passes. She said that RTD should market their services better so as to not repeat the
issue. She asked if RTD fees for development within Boulder County could be instated.
She then stated that big buses are scary for her as a potential driver, and asked if she
could drive a smaller vehicle.

Lynn Segal asked if RTD could implement an AirBnB model where you can pick what you
want - she did not clarify what this meant. She later asked why the 236 was being
eliminated. She claimed that there should be an Uber-like service for ADA passengers. She
talked about transit as being important during peak events like the Bolder Boulder. She
indicated her desire for further municipalization of local transit. She asked if it would be
possible to have a “Super Uber Day” for the Bolder Boulder. She said that there needs to
be more think tanks involved to develop more ideas.

Public Meeting Comments

Joan Lyons asked that RTD not suspend the RunRide service, citing the same points as
John Tayer. She said that BTC (Boulder Transportation Connections) agree with the 236
changes, and that they hope for better service to Boulder Junction at Depot Square
Station (BJDS) in the future. She asked for RTD to reinvest money into the BJDS area.
She stated that Route 206 was inefficient, and that South Boulder deserves more direct
service to BJDS. She asked why RTD would consider cutting the JUMP when BRT is being
planned for SH7. She stated that Route Y would perform better with more frequency and
reliable service, and that the Y deserves weekend service.

Cliff Bosley introduced himself as the Director of the Bolder Boulder. He stated that there
have been 250,000 public transit riders to the Bolder Boulder since the run’s inception. He
claimed that the RunRide service is great exposure for newcomers to transit. He stated
that 47% come to the Bolder Boulder in their car, and 7% carpool. He indicated that there
are lots of riders utilizing the RunRide service, but that he understands the driver shortage
issue. He then claimed that he had received lots of letters from Bolder Boulder participants
advocating for keeping the RunRide service. He stated that the decision to cut the RunRide
service was too close to the day of the race to organize alternative transportation options.

Andrea Meneghel said that the immediacy of the decision to cut RunRide service means
that it is too close to the deadline to cut the service. He indicated that the Bolder Boulder
is a big money maker for Boulder County. He asked that RTD explore alternative ways to
provide service if the RunRide service is cut. He said that he would be sending over a SH7
Coalition letter regarding the JUMP service changes, which would indicate their desire that
RTD not cut JUMP service as BRT is “imminent.”

Rebecca Loughner identified herself as a passenger with disability issues, and thanked RTD
for the changes made to the 225. She stated that 15 minute frequency is essential for
disabled passengers due to lack of transportation alternatives. She indicated that she
agreed with the fixed route changes that RTD was making. She asked the RTD and
Boulder County do everything they can to remove the difference in transportation options
for ambulatory and disabled passengers.

Alex Hyde-Wright thanked RTD for working with Boulder County in making service
changes, and claimed that he understands the mandating issues. He indicated a desire to
partner with RTD in alternative ways in the future.

13.B.b

Danny O’Connor stated that the JUMP reduced frequency is a concern for him. He claimed
that the 206 & 236 changes would mean no midday service to BJDS. He wants to make
sure that we can provide all day service to the Flatiron Business Park. He stated that he
agreed with John Tayer’s and Cliff Bosley’s comments regarding the RunRide service. He
asked that we restore RunRide service permanently when RTD has enough operators to do
so. He also asked about the possibility of using resources saved from the Route 236
changes to provide more service on the FF4.

Lynn Guissinger closed the meeting by thanking everyone for coming, and speaking about
the driver mandating issue.

Menten from RTD’s Board of Directors was also present.
Jacob Britton – Mall service.
Asked for the proposal to be postponed after an outside analysis is completed.
Aaron Smith – Route 99L
Need a reliable service from Lakewood to CCS. Other options add significant time, takes
20 min right now and W line takes 50 min as an alternative. Felt like RTD poorly handled
the name change back in January this seemed to cause a lot of confusion. Contacted RTD
and was told that the latest performance report and 99L is the lowest performing and the
same fare is used over three classes including the urban, downtown, and suburban. The
regional fares seem to be all different. Seems odd to be using fare to eliminate service.
Talked to Nataly Mitten and she suggested using the EV and CS to the Federal Center.
Andre Iltis - MallRide
Spoke to a lot of businesses and this is a serious concern especially with the Mall Ride, in
past years there have been service cuts and they’ve noticed the decline in ridership. There
has been a loss in reliability to the service. It is a public service that people use in
downtown. 12,000 residents in downtown and a quarter of them don’t have a car. No
other service compares to the mall ride across the board. Ask to propose to do a bit more
of a study to see what the impacts would be and find a way to mitigate the impact.
Michael Bailey – Route 32
Been using for over 30 years, they are a one car house hold. The alternative is the 28. The
route is a ‘half mile’ away with poorly maintained sidewalks. Need to do a better job in
advertising on the buses since the operators don’t know the service changes. This seems

Rachel Cusimono
Question of mandating. How did mandating come about and what’s the big picture of it
and other options of cutting routes? (Response given).
Robin Finegan
Good information to share about the efforts that RTD is putting in about the real problems
of bus operators shortage, the hiring, to retain, salary. As a consumer it is helpful to know
what RTD is doing to try to solve the problem of keeping operators. What about reaching
out to voc rehab, coalition for the homeless, etc. I’m a resident of downtown. The
relationship of sales tax is obvious to keep my own business downtown to help support
the mall ride. If there is no consistent mall ride, I have to wait in the cold, I will take my
business outside of downtown, go online, or not do business at all.
Jeff Mayer – Route 99L
Similar thoughts to Aaron Smith, there are some folks who do not have the flexibility of
taking the W-Line. “my commute will go up 75% taking the W Line.” Federal Center trips
should be reconsidered.
Alisha Humphrey
Temporary, how temporary? How long will this be? (Response given)

Robin Finegan
We really appreciate the operators and what they are doing. It would be great to know
how much effort they are putting in.
Cody Seal
Service cuts are because of mandating, few routes would lead to better retention? Is that
what this is supposed to come out of it? Any numbers to show what retention is like?
Does RTD predict that if there would be no mandating, in that world, would retention go
up and then routes would return? What are wages for operators and what would happen
if raises were given to operator’s? (Response given)
Jeff Bamer
RTD considering additional raises? It’s worth considering.

entirely).

13.B.b

Michael Bailey –
Could there be a phone number online for comments? There used to be one and doesn’t
seem to be up there. (Response given, will be fixed)

Jacob Britton - MallRide
Gates’s official position is that we would prefer any cuts to the MallRide service be
postponed until a detailed analysis of the impacts can be performed and considered and a
plan to put in place based on that anslysis to minimize loss in mobility. Gates is a
participant in the ECO Pass program and a great many of our employees rely on RTD
service. Any reduction in MallRide service would likely have a measureable impact on the
daily commute of numerous Gates employees.
Alisha Humphrey - Route 139
Please do not cancel the 4:41am route. The riders on that route are commuting to work,
the airport, and the school. We all use that bus to transfer to the other buses and light rail.
No other buses are in the area. Also, please do not discontinue the special routes, ie.
Broncos Ride, Buff Ride, etc. many people solely rely on these to get to these events and
have no other way to get there.
Michael Bailey - Route 32
Please do not cancel our Route! This is a historical transit route. There were trolley lines
into 22nd ave. the neighborhood was designed around available transit. I’ve been riding
this route for over 20 years. My wife and I have been able to share a single car for this
entire time. The nearest alternative route is not practical in terms of time and dangerous
conditions in the winter. If this route closes, I’ll probably have to buy the second car and
stop using public transit for my commute.
I only found out about the change by accident. I’ve spoken to about a dozen people on my
route and no one knew about the proposed changes. Some obstacles on the RTD side:




No service change fliers on the affected buses.
Website lists no phone number for comments.
Website meeting times inconsistent with flier times.

13.B.b

Carl Crosswhite - LD1/LD3
We live in Broomfield, the LD 1 was gone, and the LD3 feeds into the FF and then to
downtown. The screens never showed that the bus was not going to show up. From
Union Station we tried to take the 0 and the bus never showed up. On the Free Mall
shuttle it was cancelled until 7/7:30 in the morning. It never showed up and the officer
didn’t know that either. The summary is communication, instant communication. If a bus
(FF) doesn’t leave Boulder, it should tell us right away instead of waiting 20 min. LD1 one
time didn’t show up. We can’t make our commute decisions with no knowledge of when a
bus isn’t coming.
Patty Lovelace - Route 1
Maybe have the bus connect with Route 0 to connect to the Broadway bus instead of
Alameda Station?
Avery Saenz – Route 20
I take the 20 to the Anschutz campus, I have a smartphone, during snow a couple months
ago I waited for the bus thinking I made it on time, it was supposed to be a minute away,
the app showed the bus had passed by when I was waiting there the whole time. How
does that work on your end when it’s inputted into the system so I can see it on my app?
How is it updated? (Response given)
Alyssa Parette - Notifications
There is another app that exists, called transit app, it uses real time data from other
peoples phones, and allows you to buy bus tickets. Is that being used? What is being done
to get more people hired? (Response Given)
Leon Wolken & Joane Wollken – Route 32
She doesn’t want to cancel the bus because she takes the bus to school and next year her
brother will take the bus and he won’t have the bus to take to school.
Casey Cadmallader - Operators
Questions about employment, why is this happening and what’s being done? Is it a tight
market? (Response given). I didn’t realize it was a union?! How long has it been that
way? Are all employees unioned?
Pat Casey - Operators and 16L
Three questions. Any future plans to get retention rates better than they are. Turnover
rates are high and what’s being done for the future? (Response given). Any way to keep
the 16L and the difference from the end of the line from the W to where the 16L drops off
in downtown Golden is about a 45 min walk. (Response given). May I give an email of the
slides just shown? (Response given).

the actual bus stops very slippery and dangerous, especially at the Elati & Englewood bus
stop that she normally uses. Also concerned about the D Line being cut on the weekends
since there is so much entertainment downtown. Also wanted to express her appreciation
for the bus drivers as they’re all so nice and so great, she said.
John Azuc had questions about the C and D Line changes as he now uses the D Line to
get to work on the weekends from Littleton. Wanted clarification on the specific changes.
Also very concerned about the route 32 changes as he uses that to get to his job at the
Zoo. He does not feel that the alternatives are adequate as they extend his commute time
significantly and could increase the number of transfers required. Also concerned how this
will impact people who want to visit the Zoo and the Museum of Nature and Science.
Wanted to know exactly when the C Line schedule will be posted and also concerned
about the proposed H Line changes in combination with the C/D Line changes as it will
impact his ability to transfer. Wanted to express his sympathy for the drivers and how
tough it must be to work 6 day weeks, claiming he would not be able to do it.
Erin Nobler echoed concerns about the route 32 proposed changed. She also wanted
clarification on the paratransit information. Was particularly concerned about any impact
on the disability community as they are some of the most transit-reliant.
Peter Leising wanted to let us know that he supports the C/D Line change as he and his
wife often travel downtown on the weekends and are excited that the will not have to
transfer trains to get to union station. He was wondering if there was more that RTD could
do to better support the crowd capacity after events, since the train platforms are always

Route 1 - I asked for a map, to see the service of alameda station didn’t get one. 16/16L The 16L is faster which is nice to have. (Response given) the 16L has better connectionsIs
there a map for the 46 and 27 merger. Route 55, started in August, it’s only had one
runboard. (Response given) perhaps a FlexRide. C,D,H – 8 trains an hour, why that and to
union station? (Response Given)

Cathy Storey wanted to better understand the reasoning for cutting the BroncosRide
service as she has been using it since it was first introduced and it always seems well
utilized, since there is less bus service on Sundays (when the games usually are). She
thinks it’s the best way to get to and from the Broncos games and believes that
passengers would pay more for the service if that would help keep it. Staff explained the
toll Broncos Ride takes on resources and sometimes budget and explained that the service
must be comparable to fares to be in compliance with federal regulations.
Ann Wilseck really appreciates the rider alerts and that the advanced notice is a significant
improvement since sometimes the notifications weren’t coming in soon enough. She is
concerned about the C/D Line change since she sometimes uses the D Line to get to and
from the performing arts center on the weekends. She feels that the current transfer
opportunities are not well timed or well-coordinated and often just misses the train she
needs and then has to wait a while for the next one. She is willing to sacrifice service for
reliability, but feels that lately RTD is providing neither. Suggested the GPS tracking for
trains and buses would be helpful for passengers. Also mentioned that it would be useful if
the digital displays inside the train showed the next stop instead of the train line so it was
easier for customers to get off at the right stop.

Random Participant: Differentiate between eliminate and discontinuation? (Response given)
Patty Dreiling– 99L
From Lakewood, having a tough time understanding discontinuing service. The 99L, could
be 25-30 depending on traffic, there are many people such as Denver county, the federal
people. The light rail is an hour and 15 min to get to downtown. Then you have to catch
the shuttle or the MetroRide. Why couldn’t we even get the EV or the CS to Federal
Center to pick up riders. I’m 68 and have a few more years to work. I don’t know where
to catch the 87L or the 116X, by then to catch those I’ve driven half my commute. I
always park at Federal Center Station.
Fred Kumlluilm–
From/representing Auraria Campus, and the students, I’m more concerned with the
MallRide and take that part of the way to campus, a lot of those Union Station riders take

so crowded. He also thought that the meetings should be better publicized as he only
found out about the meeting that day from watching the news.

Brad Neiman
I live in Whittier, and take the 32 in to downtown, the modification is troubling as a
Whittier resident and those in City Park West. There isn’t other bus coverage, options
were the 28 or the 20. That’s about half a mile to those routes. If the bus stops operating
east of downtown there’s no way to get downtown.
Mr. D. Martinez
I’m a volunteer neighborhood advocate, we have dozens of people concerned. I called
service development to ask about a petition and was told that it wasn’t going to do any
good to keep service. On Route 1 you are cutting 5 miles east of Alameda, that’s a lot of
miles. Once the bus passes Broadway it’s not a lot of people but there some throughout
the day. The 1 is proposed to go down Cherokee, but the 52 already goes down
Cherokee, that doesn’t make sense for two routes to service that area. A lot of the elderly
people cannot walk far, and then we would have to transfer to the 3 to head east of
Alameda Station. Maybe carry the bus over to Clarkson/Emerson to Speer to Washington
and turn back west. (Response given about restrooms) Current operators can’t even use
restrooms over near Target now it’s so far to walk around.
Andrew Ilitis
Would like to emphasize a few points, 16th street mall, it’s the lifeline through the city and
a gateway. It’s how people get to other transit lines and introduces new people to transit.
They get on the mall ride and feel like it’s an opportunity for them to do. There’s the
disproportion of those people who can’t get around, it’s really tough to have those people
get around and make changes. On behalf of the businesses there’s over 370+ businesses
that use ECO pass, 43% of people who commute downtown use transit, and that number
would drop with the cuts.

Holly thanked staff for their attendance and for allowing her the opportunity to speak in
behalf of the Denver Zoo. Holly rides the route 32 east of downtown to get to work at
the zoo. Would like to ask that the route 32 run later in the evening when she gets done

the MallRide, what degree of confidence does RTD have to cure this issue. (Response
given). When I take the G-Line in, I get the warnings about trains cancelled. With regard to
the Mall Shuttle that’s your flagship, doesn’t just affect the people who live downtown
but the tourists who come to the city. Please thing long and hard about the mall shuttle.

13.B.b

On behalf of the Zoo, Holly wanted to let RTD know that the Denver Zoo will be opening
two new exhibits this year. The city has restricted the zoo’s ability to add more parking,
when there are free days at the zoo families rely on RTD to get to the zoo. Patrons to the
zoo come with many children, strollers, and coolers. Walking to the zoo from the route 20
wouldn’t be convenient for the customers. Many tourists come to the Denver Zoo, there
is a concern that tourists may no longer want to come to the zoo if they don’t have access
by way of the route 32.

Allen wanted clarification with the route 16L elimination that the route16 would still go
into Golden. Curious the difference of times are for the route 16L compared to the route
16. Wondered if meets will occur with the W line, and when the services would be
reestablished.
Staff assured him that the route 16 would still continue into Golden, the route 16 is about
15 minutes slower than the 16L, and that there will be consideration to the route 16
meeting the W line.

Adina angrily stated that the services have already been paid in advance by the tax payers.
The CEO was the highest paid in the nation, allowed to retire early, and wants to know
who is accountable for that $43 million shortfall.
Concerned that the surplus of money is not going to the operator’s wages, operators at
other agencies are paid more, the disparity in wages is why there currently is an operator
shortage.
Complained that the route 21 has a different schedule on the weekends compared to
weekday, which causes confusion for the customers who are used to the weekday
schedule, and despite complaining about it repeatedly no one has addressed her concerns
mentioned at previous meetings.
Feels that RTD is not considerate to the communities when removing services.
Told staff there needs be an operator retraining, because operators laugh and wave at her
as they leave stops early.
Colorado Station is a horrible design with trains arriving and customers have to run up 50
stairs to connect to the trains, and the trains don’t wait for customers and leave people as
they are running for the train. Yelled, why are people having to run to make connections?
Nothing has changed in the last 10 years!

with her shift at the zoo. Doesn’t feel that walking down to the route 20 is a good option
because of the poor walking conditions of the connecting sidewalks, and doesn’t feel safe
with that walk in the late evening. The stop right in front of the Denver Zoo is so much
safer and more convenient to access.

13.B.b

Mentioned an emergency bus bridge that occurred a while ago, when people were
transported to University by a bus bridge, and was exasperated that she, along with many
others had to wait at the platform for 40 minutes in the cold for a train while the busses
just sat there at the station idling. Wondered why the buses just didn’t continue taking
the people downtown.
The schedule changes are a sham, and the reason why there is a decline in ridership,
because the schedulers change schedules at a whim.
Demanded that RTD be accountable to the customers. Compensation for the customers
lost wages and cancelled doctor’s appointments that are resulted because of the dropped
services.
Wants to know where the 63 new operators that Mr. Schaffer said were hired ended up.
Wants to know what is going to happen when RTD brings back the service and the
ridership doesn’t come back?

Denise asked if the operator shortage is only RTD operators or system wide. Stated that
RTD has an operator shortage because HR takes too long in the recruitment process.
Thinks that cutting the route 66 after just changing this service is nonsensical, especially
with the cut to the R line. The route 66 is finally running just fine with the changes made
to allow the operators the ability to use the restroom on the east side of the route. Asked
why RTD is removing services from the Arapahoe Justice Center? Doesn’t understand
how the route 153 can cover the service being cut from the route 66.
Removing the route 16L is going to add too many passengers to the route 16, which the
route 16 can’t handle, bad idea. When RTD removed the route 16L with the opening of
the W line the route 16 couldn’t handle the added capacity.
RTD needs to have a refresher training of all operators, especially to be more considerate
to the passengers. Operators laugh at her when they make her run for the bus. Operators
drive off before she sits down, even after she has asked the driver to wait to proceed until
she sits down, and she has almost fallen a few times. The operators are rude and
inconsiderate.
The buses and trains don’t meet at Colorado Station.
Thinks that the paratransit service change is a violation of ADA.
Doesn’t understand how RTD can open a new line, in reference to the N line, when there
is an operator shortage going on.

His brother takes bus to the mall and up to Golden, he counts on the bus. If not every half
hour, cut to an hour so everyone still has the bus to get to the mall. (Response given).
There are two 16s one to Oak Station and one to Federal Station, why are there two 16s
when they go to the same place. RTD can cut out the trips going to Oak Station.
(Response given)
Denise Burrows
From Golden, do both drive and ride the bus, a lot of us work between civic center and
13th street, state workers. The amount of time it would take to ride the W line will double
our commute and we can’t afford that. The mall shuttle, I have to work at 6:15 and
doesn’t even start by then, that’s unacceptable, the CV and ES used to stop at Federal
Center station to get to downtown. Why can’t that be put back in, if needed to decrease
the number of routes? The ridership being counted, ECO pass is being used for counting
but other people use other methods to pay, I think that the ridership numbers are off from
that. (Response given) How to get to Federal Center to Civic Center, there are several
people form my office to the state office, we may consider changing from riding RTD to
driving. (Response given) (Question to public, how many board at Fed Center and how
many board on Kipling? - All 10 board at Fed Center)
Rick Muriby
Concerns from staff and area residents, the time would increase from Golden to Civic
Center, right now 50 min for limited and 75 for local bus, that’s been a concern, the W
Line doesn’t take to account it goes to different destinations and more time to get there.
Would probably be over an hour on W Line for our residents. (Response given)
Crystal Dorsey
Resident of Golden, work downtown Denver for over 12 years, took the bus from Fed

another route. Now I have to think about time and money and what that’s worth. When I
take the current drive myself it’s worth it, up to 45-50 min. getting 99L taking the W line
it takes over an hour to get to downtown. I know the time difference, I’ve taken both
routes. The options I would offer to the board, cutting the number of routes in half for the
99L, if a bus misses a time then all of us get doubled up on the bus and in that case the
bus is completely full and standing room only. The ridership would be there if the routes
were even cut in half. The other option would be the CS and ES there’s one route on each
route that stops at the Fed Center, the CS stops then changes its sign to 99L and heads
to Civic Center and that’s a route that could be considered. The 16 to cover the 16L for
the evening trips, the concern is safety, this is a concern for those who work late.
(Response given)
Lori Maloney
The added time to and from work, dropped off at the 13th stop, with the cold weather and
the cold mall shuttles, the buses are frequent and you have to go all the way down to
union station, there’s no way to get out of the weather. At the PnR you can wait for the
bus in your car, the 16 doesn’t stop at Fed Center to take into downtown. The 16L I had
to take into downtown and the W line wasn’t running. Had to take the 16L to get home
because of snow. It doesn’t have to come every 15 min. It’s dark when we get off of
work and there’s the safety concern.
John Duran
Resident of Arvada. Since G line was operating a lot of people from Golden have avoided
the W line and using G line parking lots, especially at Downtown Arvada. The parking lots
are full, the Ward Station lot was full. My request for an adjustment to not terminate
where they terminate and extend them to the Ward Road Station so they have an
alternative to get to G line route. Couple questions. 1. What are the expectations of this
proposal that the adjustments will be in line with the labor resources. 2. What is the
projected revenue hours per capita with the proposed service adjustments? They are
around .87 right now of revenue hours of service. What would be the new revenue hours
of service per hour. (Responses given)
Janet Binz
99L rider, Golden resident been taking this route for 15 years from Fed Center, if you
eliminate the route and push us to the W then my commute will increase, I could drive a
lot faster. I’m fine with reducing the number of trips and frequency to half hour. If you
force people on to the W….Why does the W stop on every stop? It would be nice to have
it stop at some stations and not others.
Jeff Pickles
Lakewood resident, Peggy did not respond to my email. For the 99L, I take it everyday for
past 5 years, I cannot change to drive, I have anxiety so I depend on taking RTD and not
drive, took the W line today for an appointment and took 5 min longer than bus, took the
shuttle bus to get where I needed to go, and that took 20 min. This adds to my commute.
I’m insulted that the W is your replacement for the 99L. There are much better options to

Connor Bray
Grad student at Mines, one of 5 students who use the 16L at night to get home. I wake
up at 6:30 to get to a 9 am class. It takes that long to get to Denver to Golden, I’m
usually late to class. Taking W-Line adds 25 minutes, that means I have to get up earlier, I
would have to get up earlier. Would have to wake up at 5:30 to get to a 9am class. I can’t
afford a car right now, driving isn’t an option. We rely on this line to get to school,
cancelling this would really affect us and I don’t know how to get to school. Only half of
W lines make it out to golden and I can’t get to school from the end of the line. The
FlexRide is a joke, it doesn’t operate after I get out of class.
Lisa Scott
I work downtown Denver, there is not enough parking for the majority of the parking at
my work, I ask that please do not cut our route. Take a scalpel at this route, cut some
trips or trim the route. I have no choice but to drive, I can’t afford to drive. This is not an
option. There are state employees. Please don’t cancel the bus.
Assaf Wunsch
Some people cannot afford to take the W line. Some trains are packed, and sometimes
there’s only 2 cars and not 3. If ridership goes up the trains will be packed. If something’s
inefficient then we aren’t going to ride it. If you have something people want to use then
ridership will go up. Give a list of trains that are on schedule.
Karen Oxman
I have used the W-Line, I empathize with everyone, but with RTD issue, we are looking
from the bottom up, routes and drivers, it should be the reverse, it should be looked by the
budget, why isn’t there enough money for the drivers to keep the routes for the riders.
Look at the budget, where are the dollars, why aren’t we paying enough for the drivers.
We are behind compared to other major metro areas. Maybe we don’t need people at top
getting paid top dollar, and time is taken away from families, maybe that needs to change.

Katie McCure
The drivers are amazing and I feel for them. I live in Lakewood, I work at City and county
of Denver for a year. My choice to work there was because of the transportation option to
work. I get on the bus, right after work and make it to daycare right in time before they
close. I have a child that goes to daycare and without the bus I would have to change my
childcare. I can’t afford to drive and parking lot passes are expensive. There are people
who depend on this. This affects major life choice and circumstances. On the west side of
the metro, we are disproportioned because of the 99L and the 16L. It’s discouraging to
see these on the list of cutting. I hope there’s a way to get those on the west side of the
city to the city.
Bill Overman
I work for the City of Denver in the post building. I accepted that position recently and a

choice of taking the job was the bus service downtown. I take the 99L into downtown.
The concept of 99L name seems incorrect, I’m not sure why the route was named that.
The other Limiteds have good ridership, this bus goes on US 6 to downtown. Four times in
the morning when they start that so early is not reasonable for a 9 to 5 job. If you
changed the classification to an express or a regional route and the subsidy of the bus
goes up, and RTD is willing to pay that higher subsidy. This route should be classified to
another class. I appreciate you listening to us tonight. (Response given)

Karen Shlay
Resident of Golden, Director Menten we exchanged emails, thank you. I work for Denver
Health, 99L is the only option. Taking other options to downtown, my friends only have to
go to the capitol, I have another 15 min ride to go to Denver health and that’s if
connections were on time. I would be looking at 80 minutes one way if everything was
timed correctly. We had a petition to keep the 99L, we have the ridership. We would even
pay more for the ECO pass for our way of life. Many of us get together for drinks after
work and we are a bus family, if it wasn’t for RTD we wouldn’t have that relationship, it’s
part of our life. We are close on our bus. Most of the time it’s standing room only, a can
of sardines. I have pictures to show how packed it is. I have to walk to 9th and Broadway
now. This route is very important to us. Thank you for listening to us, I know the board
has a tough decision. Maybe affect all routes in a small way rather than cutting a whole
route entirely. Traffic is already bad in Denver this would add so many cars on the road
and downtown doesn’t have the capacity. We need to know we have that reliability to get
downtown. (Response given).
Unnamed Participant
Going from the Fed Center to Civic Center would take less operators. Please don’t assume
we are going to complain when there is a compromise.
City Manager/Mayor
City gets a lot of contacts from residents about the cuts that are proposed, my voice if for
those who aren’t here. Questions: 1. Budget is important but so is business strategy, what
RTD is doing to adjust the recruitment and retention of operators. 2. What are you doing
to grow ridership? (Response given).
We do hear from the residents of Golden, but we are a destination for the metro area.
Many people come to Golden to work and go to school. It’s more than how do we get
people to Denver, we have people coming this direction. We have downtown Golden, the
Mines and other larger employers. JeffCo has the light rail. The 16L has been popular and
Lakewood has been investing in transit. We have a long ride on the W line. The 16L gives
us a quick way to travel on this side of town. Having to stop every single stop and not
having any other option really affects all our riders and all the transit oriented development
along the route. It’s hard to retain that ridership when it takes too long, people aren’t
going to ride it. If the shortage is done will they come back? What about the 16L only
certain trips or times of day would come to Golden. We have the ridership in Golden, we

Rob Reed - Councilman of Golden
Thank you for hearing all our thoughts. We completed a transportation master plan, a
study in that plan was the number of people who come during the day and those who go
to work. Numbers are through the roof. A large number of those folks relay on those
services. It’s better to have service that is less time on the bus and less frequency. Our
residents are ok with that. Make sure it’s reliable and that it goes where it needs to go in a
reasonable time. Thank you for your time and for coming out to Golden.

JJ – Councilwomen of Golden
Golden residents really value our transit options, Golden is committed to viable RTD, we
know the concerns of operators and budget, Golden has done a lot of items to increase
ridership. We are doing everything we can in Golden to increase ridership including dense
development. I have letters from people who couldn’t come tonight. It’s also about the
environment too. The change in fare zone would help ridership, we do believe that Golden
being the only stop on the W – Line, being higher, we would love to have a conversation
about the fares. These are our residents we want more transit. We would love to stay
engaged and how to do this better.

Ian Chase (written comment):

If the 16L must be cut, please add option to 16 that skips the Decatur Station stop. This stop
adds 5 to 10 minutes to the ride.
Douglas Sexton:

Why the 99L when it has people riding it? When we are waiting for the 99L at Federal Center
Station and a train pulls up, people will wait for the 99L and not take the train, even when it’s 0
degrees out. The train takes an extra 45 minutes. Passengers would rather get in their own car
than get on the train; that’s how inconvenient the train is. It stops everywhere. Why not switch
the tracks closer to 16th and California so it’s closer to that side of town? Why not reduce the
amount of stops?
April Davis:

I take the 99L to Civic Center. My friend got on the W while I waited for the late 99L bus. I got
to work barely on time, at 7:35. She didn’t get in until after 8; she left on the 6:20 W line and
got there after 8. If I take the W Line I have to leave my house before 6 a.m., take the train
which takes 40 minutes, and take the MallRide up. I have to walk to 12th and Sherman. My
work starts at 7:30; leaving before 6 a.m. and getting home makes a 12-hour day for me. I
have meals to make, and to make conferences and concerts and sports. I understand that you
might have to get rid of the 99L; maybe cut it back. I can’t take the Route 87. That’s 15

I’m here for the 99L, and I wrote something up. Hello, RTD, and thanks for the great bus
drivers! I am hoping you will (??) buses everyday; get rid of the buses it will be hard for those
who have glasses; the route plans will change; thank you for listening; we have a blind person
who needs that route.
Amanda Horvath

I’m in Director Lewis’ district downtown but I’ve been making the reverse commute since a year
ago. There were three different routes and they were reduced down to one. Here we are again
talking with you about the same route. I felt the first time that it made sense to consolidate.
Generally most people can make it work. For a lot of people riding the bus, it’s not convenient
to take the W Line. Some of these route options perplexed us. Did RTD look at leaving that one
route with buses that are deadheading? Add that one extra tour; already existing route that
picks up and goes; if there is a contingency. The other point: We have a nice regional bus.
Does it make sense to use a smaller bus, to reduce costs? I feel like I’m being punished for
being a person who lives downtown, walks to everything I like to do and is environmentally
conscious. I don’t have a car. RTD is my only way to get to work.
Sophy Chhun

The W line estimates seem generous; there are first-mile, last-mile obstacle going both ways.
That’s two hours; the 99L is convenient. On the occasions I took the W I was able to use B
Cycle. Now the city has eliminated that. The 16 and 16L are both up for elimination, and the
only option I have is the W because of the last options. We are hearing you that there’s an
operator shortage; we wanted to make our voice heard as well.
Crystal Brysky (sp)

For working hours, the 87L would be a great option, but there are timing issues. The 16 and
the W Line are not great alternatives.
Eric Perry

Keep the 16 along Simms. People where I live use it.
Joe Goil (sp)

There’s a petition to keep 99L. How much will it weigh on your decision? Other services are
seeing the same competition. My wife signed it (the petition) because she depends on me to
get home. Is there a monetary solution to driver shortage? I have a solution. Hire part-time
people. What about a job share?
Rebecca Long

Are the proposed cuts temporary? Have you guys considered running the 99L at different
points? Are they going to create five-day cuts? I’m a 16L rider at Simms and Colfax and take
the 16L downtown. The W sucks. One hour and 15 minutes is not a good option.

I’m hearing that the 99L has the ridership, but that there are concerns about subsidies. Are
they a factor?

13.B.b

This is all about quality of life. We’ve made a life here from Federal Center to Civic Center.
Without that, I’m questioning why I’m living here. None of these work for me. I took the
previous iteration of the 99L. What I see is a pamphlet full of alternatives, none of which work
for me. Open us the mountain buses to take us downtown. It’s all about quality of life. You’re
stripping that from us.
Not sure of name:

For me, this boils down to convenience, and not doing three or four transfers. I bought a house
near Federal Center; 24-28 minutes; not an apples to apples comparison; never made decision
to take W again; ridership is high on the 99L. Three hundred per bus is good ridership. It’s a
strategic approach if it’s a numbers game.
Not sure of name:

With the elimination of the 16L, what would the frequency of the 16 go to? The W is not a good
option for Federal to Civic. There are 11 trips between Federal Center and Civic. If you cut that
in half during peak, that should make a big impact. I work for the state. You’re hurting public
service workers.
Not sure of name:

A ton of us ride the 99L, and close to half, if not more, live further south and get on the 99L. I
will not ride the W.
Not sure of name:

Instead of getting rid of 16L, cut it from (???). It’s going to hurt all the people who ride it; from
Simms to Federal Center; don’t like have service gaps like that; work to amend as quickly as
possible.
Not sure of name:

When you make cuts, you project fewer riders systemwide. At a point where Denver is growing,
it is strange that RTD is making cuts with growth. How would it benefit me to get from Alameda
and Garrison to Civic Center?

Dean Simpson

Lynn McLerran was there to express her concern about the 157 route being eliminated
because there are no alternatives for those trying to get to Buckley Air Force Base.
Emphasized the route’s importance for veterans and those with special needs that rely on
the service. She advocated for some sort of alternative, like a FlexRide or bringing the
route 10 back to a former routing that included the base.
Betsy Oudenhoven is the President of the Community College of Aurora. She was there to
represent the students and staff and expressed her concern with all of the service changes
impacting Aurora and reiterated many of the points outlined in the letters she sent to RTD.
Pointed out that many of the students are transit dependent and rely on RTD services to
get to campus. Unlike other schools, there are fewer transit routes and these service
changes impact some students’ only option to get to campus. Students face significant
first mile/last mile issues already. The school offers an affordable education for Aurora
residents and Aurora is growing, so cutting service seems contradictory to the growth for
the area. The school is also a feeder for DPS and Aurora Public Schools and are able to
tour the transit options as an asset to get to campus. Though the R Line is new, they see
it as a real opportunity to connect their students to campus and to the rest of the area.
See written statement/letter for further comments.
Amy Schouten was concerned about all the proposed changes that impact Aurora. As a
nurse at National Jewish, she’s concerned about patients’ abilities to get to a from their
appointments, sees the R Line as a major connector since it serves the Anschutz Medical
Campus, cutting it will make it harder for patients that need to get to the hospitals. She
also expressed safety concerns for her daughter that works downtown at night, not
enough lighting or security presence. She was also very disappointed to hear about the
proposed cut of the RunRide, concerned about the environmental impact and the added
congestion. Said she probably would not have signed up to run the Bolder Boulder if she
had known that service was going to be cut.
Watik Aleem identified himself as the Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee in Aurora
and read the written statement/talking points provided by the City of Aurora/Mayor’s
Office.
George Adams who is the Director of the Department of Planning and Development for the
City of Aurora. He read from a written statement. Values the partnership between the City
of Aurora and RTD, which lead to the R Line being built, which was a huge investment
that has spurred a lot of development and new infrastructure. Stated there’s more coming,
including the new pedestrian bridge at Nine Mile Station, and thousands of residential and
commercial units. There has been a 6.2% increase in ridership on the R Line in 2019.
Aurora has done what RTD asked and has built transit-oriented development. Aurora also
has a high percentage of transit-dependent residents. Stated Aurora is seeing the highest
percentage of service cuts, which is not equal and inequitable.
Cheri Dosh was there representing the Community College of Aurora’s Student
Government and read a written statement submitted by the organization.

Mike Coffman, Mayor of Aurora stated that the proposed cuts will have a chilling effect on
development on Aurora. Reducing the R Line to every 30 minutes will make it much less
convenient for passengers and will cause a further drop in ridership. The 157 route is the
only option for those looking to get to Buckley Air Force Base, is the only route that’s up
for total elimination. The 153 services a lot of the local schools, so will greatly impact
students in the area. Mentioned he was late because he was speaking at the RTD board
meeting earlier, where he also stated that these cuts are unfair to Aurora as they
disproportionately impact the area. The cuts are short-sided and a result of poor planning.
RTD will continue to suffer if these cuts are made as ridership will continue to decrease.
Has anyone evaluated what the projected decrease in ridership will be? See letter to the
editor and letter to RTD for more comments.
Art Mendoza lives at Heather Gardens and knows that he and other residents are
concerned about the proposed cuts and feels they will be greatly impacted. However, he
feels that many of RTD’s issues are a management problem and wanted to know how
those problems are being addressed. Does not see the inability to get enough drivers as a
ridership problem, yet the riders are the ones who suffer. Wants to hear how management
is changing first. Happy to help as he has degrees in management. RTD needs to set up
new personnel policies. Feels the service cuts are premature and that telling people now
when they’re supposed to go into effect in May is not enough notice.
Gaye Hoffman wanted to echo that she agrees that the operator shortage is a
management issue and wants answers about what is being done.
Shawna McCowan works for Aurora Public Schools and does mobility travel training for
students with disabilities. These cuts will have huge impacts on her students. The school
she works at is right off the route 157, where all the students have disabilities, what are
they supposed to do? She’s on the bus every day, she knows the system. She explained
all the daily issues that her students have utilizing RTD services each day including missed
connections, dropped trips, lack of communication about changes, etc. What about school
trips for the 157? There needs to be a compromise or more give and take.
Mike Roberts has worked with mobility organizations most of his life. Feels RTD lacks
accessibility and reliability which leads to falling ridership. There are too many loopholes
and exceptions in the way service is run now. His father was a bus instructor and has said
that lots of people want to come to work for RTD, but no one wants to stay.
Kevin Hougen is the President of the Aurora Chamber of Commerce. He fought for the R
Line when it started. Aurora is the fastest growing community. Buckley Air Force Base is
poised to be the first Space Force Base in the country, which could make it the hottest
growing business area. Emphasized Aurora as and economic powerhouse due to the
increase in jobs, development, institutions, etc. Aurora is the future. “[Aurora Chamber of
Commerce’s] credibility is on the line” in regard to the R Line. Pointed out how divers
Aurora is. Claimed Aurora doesn’t get the same quality of service as the rest of the
District, citing that the R line is the only line that doesn’t go downtown. Has RTD

Shelia Johnson was wondering how many zones the R Line is in and if the ridership issue
could be attributed to the cost to ride? She takes the H Line every day to get to work (and
then makes a couple of transfers once she gets downtown), but the R was a good back up
to have, especially with the increase in dropped trips.
Paolo Solorzano stated that the operator shortage has been the narrative for years and at
this point it’s just words. Concerned about leadership, has reached out to board members
and some have stopped them to ask contacting them or have not responded at all. Cited
facts and figures from the employee survey supporting his concern about RTD leadership.
Worried about all the lawsuits and how much those costs are impacting RTD service.
Stated that tax payers already paid for A Line and N Line though contractors, right? Feels
there should be more transparency and that there is currently no accountability. Mentioned
that the state legislature now wants to get involved as a result. Feels that the most
vulnerable populations will be impacted by the proposed changes. Wanted to know more
about the GPS issues on vehicles and why Next Ride hasn’t been working.
Jaia Lovett lives in Aurora, attends Metro and has two jobs, she relies on RTD to get to
work. Worried about the proposed R & H Line cuts as those are her life lines. Also has
safety concerns when riding the system at night, especially as a young woman.
John Parks is a real estate agent in Aurora. Told a story of a recent experience to
demonstrate how competitive the real estate market is in the area. Feels that the R Line
have been a huge boon to the local real estate business. Concerned about the impact R
Line cuts would have. He’s encouraging real estate brokers to apply to be bus drivers to
help solve this issue and because a lot of brokers don’t actually make that much money in
real estate.
Tom Worker-Braddock was a transit planner for a while. He suggested that RTD look into
different ridership standards for the R Line since it’s the only line that does not go into
downtown and therefore serves a different purpose.
Kenyon Moon stated that he only uses the H Line to go downtown, but “no man is an
island” and therefore something that impacts those in his community impacts him too.
Would be open to cutting the H Line to three trains an hour instead of four if it meant
saving the R Line frequency some. Also suggested that maybe other lines could be cut this
way to make it more equal. Feels the cuts will encourage more people to get into their
cars, which is concerning for environmental reasons. Had questions about why certain
routes are being truncated, as he feels it makes the system more confusing to use.
Huiliang Liu is the transportation planner for the City of Aurora. He cited a recent TRP
report that found that high frequency and reliable service are the major factors in

considered disruptive technologies and their impact? Said RTD should reconsider equality.
Asked if there was an opportunity for RTD to hire temporary drivers or “prodrivers.” Is
there an opportunity to tap into the military or veteran population as there is a high
concentration of such a population in Aurora?

Stacey Craig has been an RTD light rail operator for two years. Wanted to know what
measures are being taken to retain her and fellow operators as only 3 of the 12 people
that she went through training with made it through probation (including her).Worried how
cuts will impact operator’s abilities to get to and from work and to make relief. Explained
how she works 60 hours a week, 6 days a week and that doesn’t include her commute
time. Says she doesn’t get to see her grandchildren. Explained how the working hours can
be tough, but also the way they are treated by passengers makes their jobs very difficult
and causes safety concerns.
Trevor Vaughn commutes from Arvada to Aurora. Feels that the cuts are not equal. Stated
his frustration with the connection time between the A Line and the R Line. This is not
what voters voted for when they voted for FasTracks.
(?) final speaker of the night did not introduce himself, but he was sitting with other folks
from the Community College of Aurora. Stated these cuts will have a huge impact, mostly
on Aurora. What is RTD doing to hire more operators? Can this decision be put off as we
wait to see if the increased hiring helps improve the problem? Why must riders suffer
when operations/management aren’t?

2. Why can’t we simply pay more to attract and retain bus operators?
3. He wanted to know if a driver refuses to work when mandated, will he or she be
fired?
4. Is our service reduction just a cover to reduce or costs?
After his questions were answered, he stated that he thinks it’s stupid to fire drivers for
refusing to work when mandated and he thinks we should keep our special services like
the “Run Ride” and the “Broncos Ride”.

attracting choice riders and so, making cuts to the R Line will further deter choice riders to
use the system and current choice riders will opt to drive instead.

Victor Valks – Victor has participated in the Boulder Boulder for 18 years and has used our
Run Ride service for almost all of those races. He says the Run Ride brings a wide cross
section of society together for a great event. When considering whether to cancel to Run
Ride, RTD should consider how many cars would be put back on the road, as many race
participants will have to drive themselves to the event. He said he would be more than
willing to pay double the current fare just to keep the Run Ride and he thinks many more
would be willing to pay more as well. He wants RTD to consider other alternatives before
cutting the Run Ride.

Last fall, husband and her moved to a place near a light rail station, chose to be near a
403 stop. It’s 4/10 of a mile away and doesn’t have a car. Walks to the bus stop, bus to
light rail then to downtown. Same coming home. Next ride works for the most part for a
bus coming in the morning. As long as there is some kind of comprise for the Wildcat
portion, 1.7 miles is the next closest stop and I wouldn’t like walking that. 3.5 miles
would be what I would walking daily after the changes, and it’s not possible to walk that
with snow. For everyone who isn’t here, we need that service on wildcat. The brochures
on the light rail, list it as Lucent Blvd not Wildcat, they do not list the impacted routes.
The buses don’t have these brochures on them and the people on the bus may not have
social media or a computer and don’t have this information. It’s not accessible to them.
You are eliminating access to school, to jobs, to medical care, shopping and many other
things. I ask that you seriously consider finding some compromise for who will be deserted
in that part of HR.
Fionna Sigalla
HR pays 10 million a year in sales tax, you have been letting down the team and haven’t
given HR its money’s worth. Can’t park at Mineral station because there isn’t enough
parking. Now you’re cutting us off from the 403 and service. I pointed out there is a hill
from the 403 to the 402. You can come walk and choose which bus stop you would want
to walk to with this change. The R line is the fastest route to the A-line for us and not
going downtown. Going through Mineral you can’t get parking and it’s a longer route to
the airport. The light rail is so expensive that the subsidy on the R line is tremendous. The
safety and security you mention is tone deaf to this community, because cutting the 403
will leave us in the dark. (Response given)
William Mitchell
I agree with her, parking at Mineral is horrible, last two times I had to drive back home and
have my wife drive me to the light rail station. Not extending it to HR is crazy when you
extend it to Lone Tree, that was a slap in the face. In 2017, I was called to an incident

Thank you have for having this today, I ride the 403, I am happy with that, but I’m upset

I don’t take the 403 right now, I live off wildcat, the 402L is close to me and a mile away.
I thought about the 401 down wildcat, would that be possible? I was trying to think of
different ways to shorten that but still cover wildcat. Was hoping the 403 could cover
wildcat, but you need the 403 there to cover that extension. But if the 401 continued
onto wildcat that would work. (Response given) Followup, from what I heard, the numbers
for the minimum, you need one more rider per hour, and is that the line you have? We are

Ron Winberg
My daughter is here, this means a lot to her. There are some older people who are going
to rely on the bus when the new senior citizen center comes in. There’s a lot of them
concerned. I have 10 pages of notes, but with light rail first, approx. 15 years ago we
joined the tax district, it was 10-12 years then to get this SW extension, now it’s another
20 years until, what? 2040? We are paying about 10 million from HR, to RTD. There is a
parking lot at Mineral, it’s muddy, lack of security, lighting, there’s no parking at 7:30 in
the morning, some keep driving up to other stations to park, those are all full, until they
are downtown. When I went to a show downtown everything ran just fine, the D-line ran
mostly empty that night, if we are doing this proposal every 3 times a year, why is that
happening and why wasn’t that evaluated. I suggest that when they find a permanent
CEO from outside, anyone from RTD shouldn’t have that job, I don’t blame director’s
because I’ve been on boards. I’m ticked that we don’t have light rail. Back to
management, things change, I go back 30 years, heard a lot of BS. I would like to see the
D line stay. There are times when we take the light rail at Broadways station, there aren’t
walls to protect from weather, there’s an issue with safety. Making a train switch is a big
deal for the elderly especially if they have canes or walkers. I don’t think C has to be 15
min it could be 20 or 30. We waited for the mall ride, waited for 40 min. then two
showed up back to back. Everything isn’t perfect, it would be really nice for some of you
to experience what I experience. If seniors don’t feel safe on the train, it’s an issue, it’s a
feeling. Even if it was once an hour.
403 – there’s been half a dozen proposals. Please come up with something that doesn’t
blow us in the wind without the 403. What if I cut out at the town center instead of
continuing east, a circulator with the 401 and the 403 or a mix of them. We are here to
save the 403.
About the Rockies ride, if you get off one end of the bus station, some elevators or
escalators don’t work, older couples have to carry their luggage and find a way to get to
the A-line. Maybe there’s a way to improve movement like a moving sidewalk. People
need to get to their line in a reasonable amount of time.
Max Allred
I am a student at STEM and ride the 403, I live on wildcat, some students have to walk.
And sometimes it’s not easy for them to take the light rail. If you discontinue it those
students won’t have a way to get home. I have been on buses that have been completely
full. For younger kids there should be a way for kids to sit down and not stand up on the
bus. It’s more an issue trying to get home from STEM. They can’t make it home without
the 403. I could make it if you extend the 401.

Complaint about convenience around the D and F line. You are abandoning the theatre,
because of the ridership on weekends. I was on the train at 10:30 in the morning. There
were people on the train going to the show. I don’t think RTD looks at times of events.
The F-Line on a Friday the f line ends before the shows end. The C train shows up, there’s
no place to get on. I won’t use the RTD service because it takes to long. If I miss the train
from the theatre then I will have to wait for 30 min. On the website says that the
MallShuttle will be every 15 minutes. It says that on the website.

Comments about what I’ve been listening to, the impression is that you finally decide to
get out of this mess. It was ok, what’s the easiest to do, let’s look at these thresholds, we
will just eliminate the 403 and not look at the other routes that have better ridership. You
didn’t have any thought other than eliminating it until you heard here tonight that there are
other options. Would it have better use of time to have the meetings first before making a
decision? Perhaps change all three routes to make it convenient for the 96,000 people in
HR. Maybe do something with all 3 routes. I have lived here for 5 years, and if I drive
around I can follow the bus and see where they stop. The buses don’t hit a lot of the
places and people have to walk. I would hope that I don’t have to go that far to reach a
bus. Maybe increase where it’s going and not have to run every 15 minutes. If we knew
the bus would come close to the house every 30 min. Maybe then the ridership then
would go up and the subsidy would go down. Looks like we are getting over 3 million
dollar service when we are paying 10 million. Last week at the delegate meeting you
didn’t know the HR community was putting in 10 million to RTD.
Unnamed Participant – Taxes coming from the community, is that per capital because
Denver has more people and will pay more.
Unnamed Participant - The app doesn’t list all the stops, you have to go to google maps.
So it will not give you all the stops.
Unnamed Participant - Do you want to come walk with me because google said it’s over a
mile to go to the stop. This would give me a two hour commute. My point is that you say
these changes have alternatives that are close by, but they are not.
Unnamed Participant – Alternative routes, there are no alternative routes. There are none.
In our area, that is not an alternative route. Some people walk a mile or two to get to
wildcat. There are a couple of stops that show up some don’t. We should have some other
town session about these arterial routes, I live off Benefer. It’s a long walk. Why people
don’t see the stop? We are complex here in HR. We don’t have a spokesperson who
would represent us. We represent ourselves. We could use benches and shelters. When
metro district when they push the snow over, people have a hard time to get to the stop.

can’t really use the 401 because it goes through the other neighborhood. That would be
my argument for keeping that. Riding the 0 bus the last run is 12:45 am maybe the last
run could be until 8pm? I catch the first bus at 4:54 in the morning. A lot of homeless
people are on the bus. They get stranded down here for a couple of hours. Maybe if you
cut the service on that, that would prevent them from coming down here because they
want to ride back to downtown for free. Just maybe cut the 0 back? (Response given)
There are lot of homeless coming down here.

Some of these discussions are similar to other meetings, I work at Anchutz, my husband
applied to RTD. He got no response from RTD. Now he’s been driving for RTD for a month
and a half. There is an issue with your hiring. The 403, the stop is right behind my house,
it would affect me. It’s drastic to cut it all together, maybe less on weekends, or just
every half hour. The 401 would it go to Lincoln with a new plan? I am confused.
(Response given) Nothing would go to Lincoln then? I learned about FlexRide just recent
and didn’t know what it was. They told me about the app, the FlexRide is convenient.
Lower your prices. Getting anywhere is expensive. No single trains? At 11pm at night you
have trains running then with no people on them. You would have less maintenance if
some trains weren’t out there when ridership is low. It could save maintenance. The single
train for the R line is a really bad idea. There is only so much space for bikes. The R line is
the step child here for the whole network. You need to make a deal with UC health.
Student and faculty. We get zero help. Anchutz doesn’t get a pass. No one gets a dime.
RTD says for an ECOpass it has to be everybody or nobody. Make it attractive for people
to ride it. I would volunteer to advertise it. I have turned over 6 people to ride the train.
The drivers, there is a shuttle from Anchutz to the train. We are getting out of the shuttle
and the driver takes off. One time there was a thunderstorm. When the shuttle shows up
the train takes off. This happens during a thunder storm. The train should wait for us. That
turns people off. It’s disgraceful and a lack of respect. Your respond is that they are on
schedule, we don’t want to be struck by lightning. They need to work on that. People are
literally running for the train and the train takes off. If we could just come to an
agreement with some help. Talk to the school and the hospital. There are going to be more
people with a new building on the campus. Keep that in mind. So if I have a cane, I don’t
buy that they are on a tight schedule when the operators have to put out a ramp and get
passengers on. The R line is important, for the people at Anchutz, we don’t get any help.
Unnamed Participant - My son is at the school of deaf and blind learning to be an

this was going to happen maybe we should have saw this coming. We will work on
increasing the ridership.

The 403, I’ve been here for 15 years and it’s the reason why I moved to HR. We planned
it around the light rail before Lincoln station. We since moved 2 miles down the road
because now there’s a stop to catch the 403. There are two hospitals that the other
routes don’t cover. There are 2 high schools and 2 middle schools, senior centers. Even if
you did expand the 401, it takes forever, it helps but it won’t be the best. So even if it’s
not heavily used for patients there are people on it, I use it 5 days a weeks to downtown. I
use it heavily, I would have to jump on my bike, to get to town center then to light rail to
get to downtown. It’s dark out right now to and from work there’s a safety concern. I
would hate to see it go away. There are people who use it. I use my pass to scan and I
get a red light, don’t know if I’m being counted or not which could be why ridreship says
it’s down. Other people take 403 to get to 402L.
Ginger Thayer
D line, on the weekends, eliminating it on the weekends, especially on summer, with all
the events happening downtown. Now I have to take a shuttle when I get downtown. I
have been stranded downtown before with no train. How do I know what train is going to
come through. Every time I have gotten on the D line, it fills up to standing room only. If I
have to make my way to union station then come back up on a shuttle, is there a
guarantee? Is that train going to be there for me to pick me up? What happens if it doesn’t
show up, how do I get back to Mineral Station? There is no shelter there. All this time,
nothing has been done about it that people are stuck at the elements. You have 3 pieces
of plexiglass, and your feet are wet and stuck out in the weather.
Unnamed Participant - Is the 403, there are not enough people, why not downsize that
number of buses? A smaller bus. (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - Any thought about ticket turn styles to make sure people are paying
and not getting a free ride? And thoughts on getting rent a cops?
Unnamed Participant - How long does that train supposed to sit there when waiting for
another train? Sometimes you miss the train. I don’t think some operators know that and
some people don’t know. Train connections, can we encourage passenger-driver
communication so we know why we are sitting and waiting?
Audry Elling
Thank you for taking 2 hours to listen to us and have us here. I love the light rail when I
am able to find a parking spot. I don’t mind changing a train. I know it’s a pain. I don’t
mind if that’s how it has to work. I have a question, help us figure a work around, for the
Bolder Boulder bus, what are we going to do, we are registered now, what can we do? I
have used that bus, it’s a wonderful invention. A whole pile of us will be there. Maybe
every 30 min instead of every 15 min? (Response) I will get there an hour early, if you cut

I’m willing to compromise a whole lot. Please help.

Sarah Clark
I rely on the 403 for my son to get to Mountain Ridge. Traffic in and out of the middle
school/high school is awful. Perhaps you could partner with that school to advertise RTD
to students along Broadway. This could help people feel comfortable using RTD for other
uses. Access to public transportation is key for, thriving community, reducing carbon
emissions, equity for people to access work, school, etc. Thank you for hosting and
problem solving!

B. Wilson
Suggested circulator dedicated to HRC area. What are plans to accommodate Sterling
Ranch community needs? RTD Must push forward future plans to extend D and C south to
Town Center area.

Justin Schmitz
The discontinued service of bus route 403 removes a critical east-west bus service
connecting communities in the south metro area of Denver, including Littleton, Highlands
Ranch, and Lone Tree. The removal of this service will reduce access to services for
transit dependent citizens in our community and eliminate bus access to the light rail
connections, directly increasing the number of people who will need to drive and part to
access the light rail. This critical connection should be maintained as part of the transit
system within Littleton, HR, and the city of Lone Tree. All bus service from the southern
end of Lone Tree including Ridgegate communities and including employment, retail, and
entertainment centers.

WRITTEN COMMENTS

13.B.b

Amy Tisdale claimed that a special event service has a very different impact than daily
commute routes. She said she was stunned when she saw that RunRide might be
discontinued. She used to live close enough to walk to the Bolder Boulder, but not
anymore. She has no idea how to get there if the bus is discontinued. She picks up the
bus on the diagonal, and the huge mess of buses is indicative of how much they are being
used. She is very proud of the event and transit usage. She said she is happy that RTD
supports the event and the removal of cars from the road. Director Lubow indicated that
the board is working with schedulers to figure out some sort of solution. Amy then
explained the driver shortage issue. Amy later asked if there are is anything citizens can do
to help RTD get out of driver shortage.
Audrey DeBarros thanked the directors for their presence. She wanted to echo Amy’s
request to not cut RunRide service. She claimed it is too late to change the event
organization. She asked if RTD could increase the fare for the service. She requested that
the JUMP not have reduced frequency. She claimed this would diminish regional transit
options and would reduce overall ridership on the route.

Brett O’Sullivan was upset with the Saturday change to the LD, but understands the issue
of the operator shortage. He inquired about the cost difference between a 40 foot fixed
route vehicle and potential smaller vehicles. He indicated that he had a difficult time
verifying that the meeting was happening – website needs to be improved.
June Maginnes said that the LD paper schedule is wrong in so many ways. She inquired
about the 6:15am trip. She claims that the LD2 bus has not been stopping at US 287 and
Empire – could possibly be that stop issue that we’ve been experiencing so far. She stated
that the website does not indicate LD1/2/3 on the overall LD schedule. She said that the
LD1 being repurposed for the apartment complex near Exempla means that there are now
shelters along 287 that are not being served. She claims that we have eliminated the most
popular commuter times – 4:15 and 4:20 – from Union to Longmont. 5:35am trip should
either be an LD2, but should double check the boardings near the apartment complex.
Jeremiah Sjoberg asked what “midday service” means. He indicated that the more cuts
made to the JUMP means less and less ridership. He indicated that dDecreased frequency
makes it a much less appealing option. He would also like to take the 208, but claims that
connections are very hard to make.
Brian Graham thanked RTD staff for being here. He said that he in general opposes cuts,
but especially the midday cuts to the JUMP. More cuts to midday mean that fewer people
will ride due to an hour long wait if they miss a bus, he stated. He inquired about what
“temporary changes” actually means. He claims that temporary May cuts mean that
routes/trips have been reduced for May but not re-implemented for August.

chance of LD1 5pm trip being reinstated. After Nataly indicated that we’ve been running
the 6:15am trip on special order, and that the 5pm northbound LD1 trip would be
reinstated in May, he seemed very satisfied and said the public meeting very well.

13.B.b

Kevin Mooney stated that Lafayette PnR is a mess. Nataly informed him that the process
to remodel and improve the area is underway. He stated that the apartment complex being
built in the area makes it even more of a mess. He wanted to know who was responsible
for updating the timetables at shelters. He inquired as to who is responsible for clearing
snow at DBS. He asked if there are there any plans for improving DBS. He asked when
construction of Boulder Canyon would be complete. He complained that LD1 stops near
apartment complex are awful for ADA passengers.
Deb Fahey indicated that the issue of transportation is not only RTD-based, but state and
nationwide. She elaborated on local and regional partnerships working to improve
transportation options in the region.

Glenda Richey
Been riding for 42 years, moved to the area when it was just stop signs. It really affects
me greatly if we lose our buses. The 116X we are charged $200 a month. That’s more
than my house property tax a year. Eliminating the morning bus, I don’t ride it because I
have options but I ride it if weather is bad. There are about 30 people on the third bus, 15
people on the last bus. That’s quite a bit of money that you would be giving up. The
evening would impact me more, and would make me decide if I am going to ride anymore.
I catch the 5:25 back home. If the 6:15 is eliminated I won’t have a ride home any more.
Traffic on C470 and severe weather is bad. We will be stranded if we don’t have a bus to
bring us back home. If the bus were free that would be different. I’m paying more than
most people being a regional bus. If we don’t have any options after 5:25 pm or if they
are late or don’t show up. How do we get home? How am I trust a bus to get home from
work. That’s my concern. The 100L was eliminated, the only other bus down Kipling and
Belleview is the 99L if you eliminate that we have nothing. We pay taxes and $200 a
month. It’s not that we aren’t paying, it concerns me that this whole area’s option are
being eliminated. I have options right now, on the 99L and 116X. There was a blizzard and
didn’t want my daughter to pick me up, I walked 2.5miles home during that bad weather. I
can’t do that anymore. I hope we keep something. Light Rail isn’t an option, I have tried it

Katie Boyd does not like the reduction of the JUMP service. She claims that she is a big
climate change advocate and wants to increase transit options to help fight that issue. She
wants RTD to think of more ways to incentivize transit ridership. She wants to buy a
house in Lafayette, but indicated that it is difficult when they don’t know what’s going to
happen with transit in the area. She thanked us all at the end of the meeting.

and between the fights, drunks, and they all get to ride free at the stations because they
get to hop off and on. The more money you pay the less you get it seems. There are a lot
of people on the 99L. I have a flex pass, when I get on the bus the bus operator doesn’t
count me. How are you to know I am getting counted? We also have someone who is in a
wheelchair riding the 5:25 bus. I’m concerned about him. (Responses given). It’s different
when you’re 20 miles from home and that’s different than taking a 0 when it comes every
15 min.
Question to citizens about 99L boarding: Where do you board for the 99L?
One person boards at Ken Caryl PnR and one person catches it at Fed Center. If the 99L
was eliminated, I would go to Mineral or Englewood.
Glenda Richey
RTD proposed eliminating 116X years ago, it was gone and we got it back. If it’s gone it
will add so many cars on the road from west of Kipling. I can’t take an early bus. There
was times when there were no surplus buses because they were all out. Some people left
taking Uber. People out here really do ride the bus.
Hailey Tatum
I am new to the area, moved here for work. Work downtown close to civic center. We
were able to bike to work every day even in winter. Carbon footprint was low and that’s
important. In the last year, we’ve wanted to settle down and we are engineers we live out
in Lakewood and love where we live for our family and dogs. We have a good alternative
out here. Having a low carbon footprint, avoiding parking downtown because it’s
expensive. The solution was to ride the bus. The 99L is the only option for me to get to
civic center. I am driving to Fed Center when he can drive to Denver West for work. The
buses seem pretty well attended. We would have considered a better location if we knew
about these proposal and the cuts. We support alternative transportation. I hope to make
an impact with my voice. I have considered the W-Line but it does drop me off at union
station and I work at Civic center. My commute is one hour door to door and I don’t want
to extend that.
Ruth Bruski
My husband and I commute to downtown every day. We take the 116X. It’s disheartening
that the whole bus is being eliminated. My husband is one who rides that bus. If he was to
do an alternative, Mineral and Littleton have no parking. It would take another 25 min to
drive to Englewood. If there was another option to get anywhere we would. I work close
to civic center station, some buses go in every 5-7 minutes. I am for the life balance of
these drivers and know one under this stress. It’s only 8 runs a day, and it affects this
whole area. For my family it affects us.
Proposed question of combining the last two trips (most people agree that would help) of
the morning trips and the evening trips.
Unnamed Participant - This would help the bus, the first bus comes out here and then it
goes back downtown and there’s only one driver who can actually do that.

Unnamed Participant - What would the cause of the problem, why do we have this shortage
of driver? Do we know? (Response given)

Unnamed Participant - At Civic Center you see a lot of stuff, this one homeless guy got a

from them? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - If the drivers are mandated, at 69% where are you trying to bring it
down to? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - For the 99L, that line in the evening, it snakes around Civic Center.
There are a lot of people who ride that bus every day. And probably some from 116X now
ride that because our price for that bus went up. (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - Alternatives, one for me is the 16L but that one is also proposed for
elimination. But if that goes away, what would I do? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - It’s like you raised the prices and the cut service, now expect us to
ride the bus. What have you done to address the issue to keeping operator’s? (Response
given)
Unnamed Participant - What about the relationship about the 2020 census and that people
need to participate? Is there a correlation with that and the number of people who live
here? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - 99L is my concern, getting to Civic Center by 6am. I take multiple
routes to get to work including the light rail as it’s an option. My experience is we have
our stories and the operators are doing their best. I want to take the bus as much as I can.
(Response given)
Unnamed Participant - 99L, if cancelled, then could the 116X stop at the Fed Center. So
that way there some service down here. There doesn’t seem to be any replacement for
this. I board the bus at the PnR down here. How long would this be temporarily cut? With
the cuts happening, how many buses would be coming down to Ken Caryl PnR?
(Response given)
Unnamed Participant - If we would have a slew of operator’s would this still be an issue and
would our bus be cut. (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - Are you looking to cut the 116X entirely? If that gets cut then there’s
no service down here. Don’t get rid of the 116X because I would have no service at all.

Carl McEncroe shared that he rides the 99L. Over the past two years riders in the area
have seen reductions in service previously provided by the EX and CS. He noted that
with the proposed elimination of the 99L RTD was proposing routes 87L, 116X and W
Line for substitute service. Route 116X goes down Quincy Avenue and is far from the
west side of town, route 87L picks up at Hampden and Wadsworth and is substantially
southeast from the mountain communities and the W Line to Union Station to then catch
the Free Mall or Metro Ride takes one hour fifteen minutes versus the current thirty three
minutes. He stated that people that ride the 99L are commuters and alternate routes more
than double the commute time. He is fortunate that he could pay for parking but many
riders cannot and a three hour commute seems extreme.
Faye Russell agreed that the 99L was more feasible in terms of time compared to the
suggested options. She was really concerned with discontinuation of the route 99 on
Saturday as she really relies on that route in bad weather or if her car is not working. She
noted Sunday service was eliminated several years ago. She does not take the Saturday
99 regularly but relies on it being an option.
Zachary Burchfield said he is concerned about people with disabilities and low incomes
having access to transportation. He shared that he has an eye condition and cannot drive
nor has the luxury of paying for Lyft or Uber. He wondered why there are not H Line
trains running to Peoria Station during rush hour. He also expressed concerns about
access to Buckley Air Force base for pharmacy and grocery services if route 157 is
cancelled.

happen with transit in the area. She thanked us all at the end of the meeting.

Cliff Andersen noted that while there are some ridership issues the main issues seem to be
workforce. He wondered why there was such a difficulty and if it was related to hiring or
retaining. If it is related to retaining operators he wondered why RTD was not just hiring
more operators to help with mandating. He also wondered if the legalization of marijuana
had an impact on hiring. He noted that RTD said this was not a budget problem, there
was plenty of money to pay operators, but last year millions had to be cut from the budget
and the Board hired a new temporary director at significantly more than the last GM. He
expressed concern that the Director of CDOT makes significantly less and hiring a
temporary director at such a high salary will lead the next permanent GM to expect
similar. He thinks RTD is getting taken and the public is getting it in the shorts.
Wendy Matthews expressed an overall concern with the way the budget is handled as 2/3
of it is spent on non-transportation related expenses. She feels that is a lot of resources
that could be dedicated to transportation. She said she does not see anyone looking at
efficiencies. Buses downtown stop at every stop and there are routes that go through
downtown that no one board. She suggested that RTD look at the frequency of the
FreeMetro Ride and that perhaps it should coincide with the frequencies of the trains, such
as operating every 15 minutes. She stated that with cutting buses north of the Wheat
Ridge Ward Road Park-n-Ride the only way for people living that direction was for them to
drive. She thinks the only thing that was evaluated was ridership and not if this was the
best places for buses to go.
Lisa Cook stated the possibility that the RunRide may not be here this Memorial Day
strikes fear in her heart. She would happily pay twice as much if it gives the operators a
bonus. She said she would be grateful if there was a way to keep the service. She also
expressed concern that a lot of kids took the route 32 to Wheat Ridge High School and
suggested that RTD look to keep a morning and afternoon stop.
Irene Rael shared that she moved a couple years ago to Arvada and chose the area
because there was a bus half-a-block away and the train would be coming soon. Now
that the train was open the 72L was gone and she has to walk ¾ of a mile now to catch a
bus. She said that is fine if the weather is good but the last few weeks she had to ride
with her son, meaning she gets to the train at six and does not work until nine. She
expressed concern that now the route 125 was going to be cut in her area and she does
not know what she will do as she does not have a vehicle. She stated there were a lot of
people grumbling when the 72L was cancelled and with eliminating the route 125 she
worries about parking, especially with the housing being constructed around the Park-nRide.
Debbie Poland noted that she works at 16th and Welton and when she leaves work the 90
second intervals for the Mall Shuttle do not happen. She said she can walk to Union
Station and not see a single Mall Shuttle going her direction but will see 6 to 8 heading to
Civic Center. She stated that when buses do come you cannot get on as people are
packed like sardines. She noted that when the route 0 used to go down Welton she
would take it a lot but now it was rerouted. She asked if a request to please move away

Faye Russell shared that she was considering a job near the Applejack Shopping Center
but when she inquired how feasible it would be to get there on the weekend she was told
it would take two hours. She knows that RTD cannot cover everything but this should be
more doable from where she lives.
Cliff Andersen inquired if security for drivers was also a factor that was impacting operator
retention as he was hearing that on a Facebook page.
Faye Russell noted that there have been several shootings around light rail stations and
there should be more security late at night.
Debbie Shipley expressed concern about people at Union Station sleeping in stairwells and
making it difficult for passengers to get inside from the trains. She suggested a spotlight
or playing classical music. She said there are no security guards in sight when she is
there. She also wondered why only one set of doors opened when the G Line train comes
into the station and then the other open about 45 seconds later.

Zachary Burchfield shared his concerns for accessibility when it snows for people in
wheelchairs or blind people. He said it piles up at stops and is very unsafe. He also
wondered why the light rail stations were not designed with winter in mind.
John Girand noted that 69% of bus operators are mandated and asked what the
anticipated percentage would be if the service changes are adopted. He believes this
metric is important to have when the changes are presented to the board.
Irene Rael wondered if there was a way to balance operators working long days so they
could still get two days off.
Debbie Poland hoped that RTD was utilizing part time operators.

design of Union Station as a terminus doesn’t work for us at all. Under the best scenario it
will be 45 min each way. That’s 1.5 hours a day. That’s 7.5 hours a week. I’ve done this
commute for 25 years. This service I rely upon, this is the second time this is happening.

We are still dependent on a bus. The Conifer bus in the morning goes to the Fed Center
then the garage then does it in reverse for the evening. (Response given) This one run in
the morning and one run in the evening, how does this affect cutting out a neighborhood.
Our drivers prefer this it’s best for them, you still have the bus going up to Conifer. The
7am, you don’t have another load of people coming down from Conifer. For me, it’s a
total disruption for my lifestyle. We may need a ballot initiative to remove FastTracks, this
FastTracks was supposed to not affect bus service.
Marjory Devries
32 bus, it wasn’t going to be eliminated, and that it’s going to be modified. (Response
given) Start with eliminating the non-rush hour, it comes every hour, a year ago they
added service on the weekdays, for half hour in the morning and the afternoon, the people
that live on 22nd, and around park Ave, use it to get to school, the doctors, the hospitals,
you have eliminated the 28 to go downtown on the weekends, if the 32 goes, then there’s
nothing on 22nd ave. There are lots of people there that don’t have cars. It’s not just me
going to the zoo all the time, the staff there uses it too. Our CEO also takes it west. I see
him a lot on that bus. It’s not a good idea to get rid of this. It’s a mile walk to get to
Colorado Blvd or Josephine. I would end up taking 3 buses to get home instead of one.
The mayor didn’t have as much bond money as we requested. His emphasis was mobility
and accessibility, that’s what he wanted to focus on. I ride with people who get off 17th,
they come from all over who ride the bus. You can’t tell them to take the Route 20 then
walk a mile. The parking at the zoo and museum is very tight. Once they open the golf
course they might have more parking but it’s all overflow.
Joy Ravenel
I am visually impaired, I rely on RTD to get around I ride the 99L, live in cap hill, and work
in the Fed Center. I sometimes ride the 16 and the W is a two hour commute. I don’t want
to do access a ride I want this to be as normal as possible for me. I don’t want you to take
this bus away. I do the Bolder Boulder every year. I know there are 50,000 people who
use it and I see those buses packed and people are standing even on the 60 foot accordion
buses. If you take away the buses then my normal commute will get harder to live my life.
(Response given for RunRide) But the RunRide would get me to the starting line those
other buses don’t get me there. I know a lot of other people won’t like that route, and
roads are closed off up there. I am bringing this to your attention that there are a lot of us
who are racers who like to get the starting line.
Sean Lusten
I catch the transit to school every day, my main concern is with changing the bus times.
When I go to the bus stop, I catch the bus to take me to campus, earlier than I need to I
am not confident that the other ones will come. One of my friends has to catch the 15L,
rerouting the 5:20 to make it to work. There are shortages, but I get that. The changes
that you guys are making, how much can you guarantee that the rides are going to
happen, ARE going to happen? (Response given)

August, did research online before moving here from the country. Reason for moving to
Cap Hill was for the express bus to get to work and I don’t have to take a transfer. It’s
only 20-25 minutes to take the 99L. It’s the most Ideal for me to go to work. It’s only one
route. I have to make sure I don’t miss it. I would have to ride the W which is a long way
for me or the 16 which is 2 hours or more for me a day. (Response given) How long would
it take with that suggestion you gave me, over an hour? You guys are taking away the
Federal Center station stops. That’s eliminating one of my options, so I would have to take
the W. I have taken the 16, it’s either not shown up or it’s late.
Jared Miller
I am supporting the 16L or not supporting the removal, I live on the west side taking it 5
days a week. I have a question, are there any number for what that bus serves and what
the ridership is? I would echo the other peoples’ concerns. The 16 takes twice as long if
not longer. The 16L it’s the most efficient for going downtown to Golden. This change
would add an hour to my day so, another 7 hours a week. I work on the other side of
downtown the W would take too long. You call it a duplicate route, but it doesn’t stop at
the rec center or the Decatur Station. I would like to share that there was another person
at the other meeting and I’ve been sharing pictures about how busy the buses are. I don’t
know if you factor in the stress that will add to the 16. I don’t know if this is a well
thought out move there is a lot of time that the 16 or the 16L cover at the same times.
Maybe stager the 16 and the 16L, it will offer different options for this corridor. I don’t
know if that map has been done but you should be able to tweak it to where you have
less drivers. This seems like a premature move.
Sarah Miller
I am married, we ride the bus together in the morning working downtown. I have 6
coworkers at work on my floor that take the 16L. There are so many people that will be
affected cutting this route. The 16 will be packed. Everyone gets on the 16L. No one
wants to take the slower bus. You are cutting an efficient route. You are going to drive
people away from the bus. It’s not always a pleasant ride, but we deal with it. You are
taking away from peoples’ time from their family or what they enjoy. There are buses that
run to Boulder from 10 min every day. I feel like the west side is being targeted. Are those
cuts affecting the FF. I don’t see those on the list. Boulder seems to be getting some sort
of treatment.
Daniel Anderson
My wife and I depend on the 16L, we live across the street. We go downtown for doctors
appts or going out and having fun. We don’t like the 16 because it sits at Decatur Fed for
5 minutes waiting just sitting there, no one getting on. If you do take out the 16L, my
wife is in a wheel chair, it’s going to be more compact. There are times where we had to
wait for other busses because there are too many wheelchairs on the bus. It’s not fair to
us. It’s going to make it harder for us. Maybe reducing the hours, maybe that will help the
operator problem. It affects us trying to get downtown for appts. That’s hard on us.

Representing as a SW resident, D, C, and 32. For the zoo as well. The impacts of those
routes, and the accessibility of the other route being a mile away. The population, or
tourists, and residents in the area. The 1.1 mile walk to other routes is really tough for our
residents. If the 32 is down, it’s quite a walk, I have done it myself. This will be
detrimental to us, there were 32,000 people at the zoo during the free day. Our staff, 60
staff ride that route frequently, I do have an hour commute good for reading. It’s
detrimental for us for it to stop downtown. It affects the lead building and emissions that
the city is trying to achieve. Thank you for having this meeting. (Response given) I
understand that it’s tough to hire people out there.
Tim Clarkin
I ride the 99L, reverse commute. When I moved here there was the option of taking
transit, I moved from Galveston TX and there’s not much transit there. I’m impressed
about the app you guys have. It told me about the 99L. Other systems tell me to take the
10 or the W and takes me over an hour to get to my work. I can leave right now at 7 and
make it to my desk get there at 7:30. There are tons of people who ride that bus. It’s a
really good route. It’s once each way. You have a dedicated ridership. Last year you
brought this up but you kept it. There’s opportunity to grow, there’s a lot of people at the
Fed Center. The alternate routes come from Littleton to Civic Center. The W is very slow,
too many stops and curves, it takes too long.
Jaime Torres

Concern of the discount pass. I got it because I’m low income. I do need that reduction.
When January came for me to pay cash on the bus I wasn’t able to. I don’t have another
way to get my riding pass, I don’t have the ability to do that. I don’t have a credit card to
buy tickets online with that. Other people who are low income they can’t do that. I would

32 and the 16L. They are thinking of eliminating them on Sundays. I’ve been riding 20
years, especially the last 9 years. I’ve rode it less and less only when I have to. They
eliminate it on Sundays and it’s bad enough on Sundays when it runs once an hour I won’t
walk to the 28 and might to the 38. The biggest problem is that they cut, cut, cut and
they spend billions on transit. The dumbest thing is that it passes the Decatur Station and
can’t make a connection. I don’t take the 16 because it’s too slow. I don’t go west. They
lose on revenue for that but I don’t take the 31 either. The 15 and 15L at Larmier, I see
countless 15L go by and they are empty. During rush hour it might be different. That’s a
lot of operators and gas being used. The 32 drivers are very, very nice they know me. One
time I had an operator that didn’t speak English for me to communicate to him to know
what other bus I need to take to transfer. But the 32 is closest to my house, they took
away some stops which is good.

116X, if the last one 6:10, would appreciate not moving the 5:25 further out, there are parents who try
to get back to the area to attend school functions. Some parents took Uber to get to these events. I
don’t want to stay downtown until 6. Traffic is worse coming this way. The 99L, the options, not all the
buses go to the Civic Center and back. Out here that’s our other alternative. We have a lot of workers
that go downtown and need those options. I didn’t know the 99L existed. It just goes up and down
Kipling to the Fed Center, I have never seen anyone on the 99 on Saturdays. People who use the 99 on
the weekdays aren’t using it on the weekends, why not eliminate the weekends to keep the 99L for
those who get downtown. (2 people state they ride the 99L both hop on off Kipling) I have taken the W‐
line, it had 2 cars, during something at the Pepsi Center, Mile High Station, and the colleges, we were
arm to arm touching, when people go up to the Fed Center, the door opens, and this one man picked up
his bike and threw it on the sidewalk out of the car. It’s so dangerous. That’s why I quite riding the W‐
line with all those events. The colleges on the route, there’s a lot of people on the route. (Response

The D line, if you want to go downtown, transfer to the H line, but they aren’t coordinated, or go to
union station to catch the mall ride. It’s saying, ok, you live out here, don’t go downtown because we
are going to make it hard on you. You should interval C and D, it doesn’t have to be 15 min. One
shouldn’t go away. (Response given) I would disagree with those numbers. If you want to go downtown,
you change trains at I‐25, that’s your answer. I don’t know about those numbers with the Avs, and the
Nuggets not playing during the summer. So your answer is to change trains to go downtown.

Jennifer MoreIand
I recognize the time away from family, I appreciate the time you are taking to do this. I appreciate the
operators and the work they are doing. I think they aren’t paid enough so I think them. I ride the 116X,
this is a service with the latest trip being cut, it erodes into the rider who isn’t just going to and from
work. It’s not about providing service to what is typical for those for work but those who also have to do
family care, care for the elderly. The 116X should actually be expanded. I can barely get my daughter to
school. It’s impossible to get family members to where they need to be or to get to work. This falls on
different types of workers. It’s about equity and not just commuters. I want to stress the broncos ride, It
is convenient, and so much more user friendly. To take my daughter downtown there and all the people
it’s frightening, for anyone else it’s scary and not family friendly. Think of the people who is young who
should have a good experience. And those who have family, traveling with family, please think of them.
These other events should be helping you out Bolder Boulder, the stadium, and this all helps the
environment. I have chosen to live without a car as much as possible, to cut service it’s really
challenging. Please keep everything possible with the 116X and the broncos ride. Please keep it all in

116X, I live in the weber hall neighborhood, I have school aged children and doesn’t start until 7:30. It’s
hard to find a bus before 7. Eliminating the last trip, you preventing anyone, to get kids out the door, or
high school students to get to school, I can’t get the kids out the door on time sometimes. And the D
line, you can’t get a parking spot, Englewood is the next available place. I don’t know how early you’re
suppose to get to the Mineral station to get a spot, I don’t have a parking pass for work. If I don’t have
th 116X at a time I can take my kids to school, if the Englewood development happens, you might not
have enough people to ride the D line in the future. I would encourage that for the D line, there were
multiple shows and the conventions center area, there was a mess, lots of people down there. There are
a lot of people traveling with children who have reservations about taking the train. There’s also the
need to address the VMT in the area and the emissions from cars. It’s more efficient to put people on
buses but it doesn’t work if the bus doesn’t service your needs. Getting people out of cars reduces our
emissions and reliance on cars. You are eliminating people in my demographic to ride this service.

John –
About the D line on the weekend you can transfer to the H line but you’ll be waiting for that transfer,
the need for going to union station will end when the events end, and the summer time is when people
want to go downtown for the weekend. The needs will be greater in the center of downtown than the
Nuggets game or the Aves game (Response given) on the 32, it will be discontinued east of downtown so
going to the zoo will be gone, the 28 is suggested to take but that will be a mile to get to the museum or
the zoo. If you’re an elderly person or in a wheelchair this will be difficult.

D –line, cutting it of the weekend, how do us black folks get to downtown to get to church in the Welton
area. The W line when you get to Union Station, there are drug addicts down there and it’s very scary
there on the weekends, the bathrooms are full with drug addicts on the weekend, You need to check
this out before you all do this. Why does Union Station close? It’s closed on the weekend. The security
there tells us they have nothing to do with the bus. In the mornings you have hundreds of people there
in the morning sleeping. It’s embarrassing especially when you have tourists coming to town. (Response
given) OK, how do we get to church on Sunday, the L line doesn’t do anything, The L line is a waste of
time, we don’t know why you all did that. It only goes three blocks. The 15/15L that is a waste of drivers,
I ride that too. I have 4 15s and 3 15Ls and you say you have no drivers, I don’t know if the schedule
changed but they are never on time. People still wait for the bus. Why do you all have that 15l going
through that construction, can’t it go another block. It’s time consuming from Anschutz, to Colorado it’s
an hour and a half, they are all ended up in construction. Why can’t they go around? (Response given) Is
it true that the board of directors don’t ride the public transportation like we all do? (Response given)

Have you all done a study on 87L, and I ride it every morning, you barely have 10 people and that is
really wrong. They might be state employees. I ride the 87L, why do we have 15 buses on Federal and 1
on Wadsworth. You have been saying these issues for 5 year, you have more than 5 buses on Federal.
We only have 1 76, you are leaving us on the curb. I ride the light rail, when it snows we don’t have any

I ride the D line for 15 years, I know the 116 very well. I take the 77 across town and the flex ride. I use
the next ride a lot to see where the bus is. I highly recommend you put a notification when you cancel a
route especially the train. Sometimes, I have waited so long because the H was cut, the D was cut. You
guys do know ahead of time, for the trains, it would be helpful to know this ahead of time. (Response
given) The notifications at the station shows the trains are coming but they don’t come. (Response
given) So I ride the flex ride that replaced the 85 going this way, I can’t track the flex ride. I don’t know
where they are, how can I see them? The thing for new riders, they don’t know about this feature.

despite being a Parker resident. Please explain how this can happen.
Ron Springsteen said he has the same question as Claudia: who makes these RTD
boundary decisions?
David Casiano is concerned about the welfare of RTD operators after hearing about
mandating. RTD’s job is supposed to be to move people around, what is the plan if RTD
doesn’t get enough drivers? What is RTD doing to address the budget? Please walk us
through your process.
Mike Roberts noted that it seems like adding more operators would solve a lot of the
current RTD issues. Does this mean that a lot of these proposed route cuts would be
temporary? Once RTD gets the operators, will the routes all be brought back? And has
RTD thought about advertising the R Line to the public? We need to get the volume of
people of I-25; it takes his wife two hours to go only six miles by car on I-25. Get the
work out to the public that it will benefit them to take transit. People have to get to work
on Sundays, too, so consider that when cutting Sunday service. Mike has concerns about
the bus stops on Parker Rd between Dartmouth Ave and Peoria St: people cut cross Parker
Rd during rush hour instead of walking all the way down to the crosswalks since it’s a
pretty far walk. Can RTD move the bus stops closer to the crosswalks so people aren’t
tempted to cross traffic? He asks that RTD look into this as it is a safety concern. He’s
heard that other places have provided a breakdown of what each route costs per rider –
can we do something like that here? That seems like it would be a useful tool and maybe
get more people on FlexRide instead of fixed route service. There’s a whole society of
people who depend on FlexRide, and if they can’t get their ride even one day, it really
impacts their life. RTD should hire more part-time workers.
Tom Graves came to this meeting to voice support for the RunRide for the Bolder Boulder
event. Please think carefully about this decision, it’s the only way may people can get to
this event.
Kimetha King rides the 99L and has been riding it for years. She also rides the 483. The
proposed discontinuation of the 99L will add considerable time to her commute. Can this
route be merged with another route from Federal Center? Kimetha has tried using Parker
FlexRide, but wasn’t a good option for her.

Dennis Huspeni serves on the Board of Downtown Parker Business Alliance. They are
looking to start a trolley service for downtown, does RTD have a grant or something to get
them started?
Tom Blach Rides the P Route, and uses RTD services regularly. He thinks RTD is great,
and would like some ridership data to get the word out there.
Inger Pippen has participated in the Bolder Boulder for 24 years and has taken the RunRide
every single year. The timing of this cut is bad, maybe this cancellation could be made
next year so that participants can plan for alternative transportation.
Erin Madigan is concerned about proposed discontinuation of the BroncosRide. This service
keeps intoxicated people off the road, and it’s only a few times a year – why would RTD
eliminate this?
Omar Castillo is the Vice Chair of the Parker Area Chamber of Commerce. Parker pays $11
million to RTD, where is that money going? What is RTD doing to bring more work force to
Parker?
Cheryl Poage came after the meeting while members of the public were mingling with RTD
employees, she thought this was an open house event from 6-8:00 pm. Can RTD expect
an increase in service any time soon? We need get workers in and out of Parker to get
more ridership. RTD needs to reach out to out of state tech schools and trade schools for
mechanics and drivers. What is our opinion of the proposed state bill?

Kit Summers would like to know if ridership information is available to the public. Is there
a breakdown of ridership for every stop and every station? Kit noted that he doesn’t see
the Flatiron Flyer up for any reductions of service, does RTD really have the funds to run
the FF as frequently as it currently does?

Re: Service Cuts
Date: February 11, 2020

Thank you for your service and the efforts to expand transportation options through our district. With a large and diverse
region, this job is not easy.
In regards to proposed Temporary Service Reductions, Boulder Transportation Connections wishes to share our comments.

Dear Members of the RTD Board:

We are asking you to reconsider the suspension of the RunRide Service. The Bolder Boulder is held on Memorial
Day when existing service is already reduced. With a difference in location for the race start and the race finish,
the RunRide provides a valuable asset, simplifying the trip for users. Park and Rides throughout the area, such as
the Niwot Park and Ride, are overflowing on the morning of Memorial Day. A positive experience with the
RunRide can encourage a person to consider RTD for other trips, including their work commute.
As to the reduction on the 236, we agree that this route has been underutilized and hope that the future brings
more direct service between Boulder Junction and Denver. We encourage RTD to apply some of the savings from
service cuts to allow other operators to provide service from Boulder Junction.
Route 206 is an example of a route that serves a great need. We hope that RTD continues to study and explore
options for how best to serve these neighborhoods. BTC believes that South Boulder residents need and deserve
more direct access to their desired destinations. The number of transfers required from South Boulder typically
makes transit far less time efficient. When routes are returned after the temporary reductions, we hope to see
more options for people in South Boulder, around 55th Street, and from Boulder Junction.
Jump service has been identified via the NAMS study as an area needing heightened service. This corridor is
slated for BRT service. Cutting the service, which is intended to grow in the future, is a backward step.
Lastly, we are very concerned about reduction made to the Y service, the only bus option for the residents of
Lyons. This area would likely see higher transit usage if transit options were more frequent and thus more
reliable. Lyons could also be receiving weekend service to assist service workers, get people to and from outdoor
opportunities, and support transit dependent users. If service to Lyons is cut, the funds should be returned to
the community to support other options including transportation vouchers.

RTD Board, thank you for your consideration and thank you again for providing a safe, reliable and cost‐effective service
throughout our district.

Shelley Cook
Regional Transportation District
1600 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear Shelley,
I am writing to ask for your consideration of the pending decision to decrease service levels at Nine Mile
Station on the R Line. For over 8 years, Mile High Development and Koelbel and Company have been
working together in a joint venture with the City of Aurora and the Aurora Urban Renewal Authority to
redevelop an important 22 acre site, the former Regatta Plaza Shopping Center, now re‐branded as The
Point at Nine Mile Station. This important commercial node at the intersection of I‐225 and Parker Road
will soon have a pedestrian/bike bridge connecting it to Nine Mile Station and providing valuable
ridership to RTD for the R Line, all at no cost to RTD, as the funding will come from a DRCOG/FTA grant
with local matching funds from the City of Aurora and our Point Metropolitan District.
Cutting back on the frequency of service at this time will have a negative impact on the R Line and the
entire I‐225 corridor, which will affect ridership negatively in both the northbound transit service to
Fitzsimons and DIA, as well as Westbound traffic to The Denver Tech Center and Downtown.
I urge you to reconsider any service cuts to the R Line and Nine Mile Station, and appreciate your
consideration of the relevant facts/impacts stated above.
Best regards,

George Thorn

Re:

Regional Transportation District (RTD) of Denver Board of Directors
Proposed May 2020 Service Changes

The Boulder Chamber offers its input regarding the service changes proposed for May 2020. First off, we’d like to
thank you for holding your District O meeting at the Boulder Chamber, and we are reflecting the comment we
provided on the evening of February 19.
Do not cut the RunRide in 2020 and work to maintain the service for the future
As stated at the meeting on February 19 in Boulder, it is critical that the RunRide service the Bolder Boulder on May
25, 2020 for this year’s event. There is simply not enough time to address the congestion that will occur in our region
due to over 50,000 runners, family and friends that attend our city’s traditional Memorial Day event. The RTD Board’s
decision to cut this service a week before the event would have a tremendous negative impact on our regional
roadways and on our local streets. There is simply no time to develop another plan to mitigate the traffic if the RTD
Board decides to cancel this service 8 days before the event. It would be a high-profile regional issue that the RTD
Board of Directors can mitigate by maintaining the service for 2020. We urge you to work directly with the Bolder
Boulder organizers to develop a creative plan and partnership for continuing the service for 2021 and into the future.
Maintain current service levels of the JUMP on State Highway 7
The Boulder Chamber strongly encourages you to maintain service levels of the JUMP on SH 7. We emphasized this
message, as part of the Northwest Chamber Alliance (NWCA), a regional coalition of seven chambers of commerce in
the northwest Denver metro area. The NWCA signed the SH 7 Coalition’s letter to RTD along with the University of
Colorado, our local governments and TMO’s from our region. The proposed service reduction impacts the reliability of
service, diminishing the level of ridership rather than building it, for a corridor that is envisioned to grow into a highquality regional BRT route in the future.
Seek strategic partnerships to provide desired service to meet regional demand
In order to provide special services and to fulfill other route demands, we encourage RTD to contract with our local
partners at Via Mobility, Boulder Transportation Connections, the City of Boulder and Boulder County to develop
agreements and partnerships for providing service in our region that RTD cannot currently fulfill due to driver
shortages.
Thank you for your effort to address the overall challenge of providing transit service to the entire Denver metro
region. The issues we highlighted above should be considered very carefully as they are critical to our regional
economic vitality.
Sincerely,

January 13th, 2020

Dear Ms. Menten,

We understand that the proposed changes RTD is considering would eliminate the in May 2020,
after a name change from the 100L to 99L in January 2020. This change will significantly impact
our family, as well as the 569 daily riders who primarily get to work on the 100L/99L. We will
not have any other viable transit options, and will therefore no longer buy passes and ride RTD
to work.
We understand that RTD is facing significant driver shortages and budget shortfalls, and we
understand the necessity of address these issues. However, we foresee that RTD will lose
significant ridership by cutting this line in exchange for limited savings in driver staff hours.
Riders will be forced to drive instead of seeking alternative service in “connections to Federal
Center Regional service and West Corridor Light Rail,” as RTD suggests, since there are not
equivalent or similar transit options to the 100L/99L route.
The main impetuous for reducing service is to reduce staff hours due to ongoing driver shortages.
RTD cites specifically for this route that service on the 100L/99L is being discontinued due to
duplicate services available with the W line or other “Regional service” from Federal Center
Station. The W line is not a viable alternative for either of us. It would approximately double our
community times when compared with service on the 100L/99L. For example, to get to Alex’s
office during typical commuting time (8:00am departure on a work day) takes 28 minutes on the
100L/99L and 1 hour and 1 minute on the W Line (57 minutes if he adds a transfer to another
bus from the W line). See Google transit planning screenshot at the end of this letter. There do
not appear to be any other viable regional lines available from Federal Center Station that
compare to the 100L/99L route during average morning and evening transit times that we can
see. Please note: We couldn’t find any alternate routes on RTD’s Trip Planner tool because the
top 4 recommended trip options are all the 99L.
We expect that we are not in the minority – there is a reason why 569 riders choose to take the
100L/99L daily, when the W line is concurrently available. This proposed change is one of the
highest number of daily riders impacted by any of RTD’s proposed service changes. If it’s truly
the case that other riders, like us, do not see any other viable transit options if the 100L/99L is
discontinued, this service change will have the largest impact of any of RTD’s proposed changes
on RTD’s ridership. We expect that many riders will begin driving to work, as we will have to,
thus adding more congestion and pollution to the Denver area, and slowing RTD drivers and
other cars on the roads.

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B [Revision 1] (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

We are a couple who live in Lakewood - Ward 4 and we take the 100L/99L bus to work
downtown nearly every day. The convenience of this line, and the fact that both of us can take it
to our offices downtown to avoid driving, are main reasons why we bought our house near the
Federal Center Station.

Since the 100L/99L has limited service into Denver in the morning and out of Denver in the
evening, eliminating a line with high ridership and limited driver hours seems an imprudent cut
to make.

Packet Pg. 231

13.B.b

We understand that RTD has difficult choices to make, and we understand that considerations
around equity, geographic distribution, route length, and other factors must come into play. We
have ideas for solutions if RTD is willing to discuss them, such as adjusting the line to run from
Federal Center Station to Civic Center Station only, further cutting back on hours for the
100L/99L to only the most high-demand routes, increasing fares for limited stop busses, or
combining service with the CV/CS or EV/ES/EX bus routes. We are happy to discuss these
options.
Please continue to engage riders to ensure that RTD is making the right decisions, even if they
are tough decisions. Thanks for your attention on this matter. Additionally, please find a petition
that aims to express the widespread support and necessity of this line among its
riders: https://www.change.org/p/save99l.

Dear RTD Board of Directors,
Thank you for your service to the residents of Denver and the region. We write
in response to the recently proposed service cuts and the impact these changes
could have on vulnerable residents inside and beyond Denver, and on the
overall health and viability of RTD’s transit system. We understand an operator
shortage is driving the immediate proposal. And we appreciate the need to
right-size service to match the operator resources available, but we disagree
with the approach proposed. In addition to concerns about the overall
approach, this letter also outlines our opposition to the specific cuts proposed
to the 16L and the 153/Chambers Road routes.
We recognize the severe fiscal constraints RTD operates under and would first
and foremost welcome the opportunity to partner with transit providers like
RTD in any and all conversations about expanding investment in transit
operations at the regional, state or federal levels. We feel that our region is at a
disadvantage compared to other states that invest more heavily in urban transit
operations than the State of Colorado. We recognize that the prospects for
additional funding at the state and federal levels are challenging, so we’ve
identified new, local funding for mobility - including transit - in many of our
individual or collective lists of priorities. While funding alone cannot eliminate
the shortage of operators dominating the current conversation, we believe it is
a critical backdrop that has impacted the overall situation RTD finds itself in
today.
On the proposed approach’s reliance on reducing service levels on many lines,
we start from the evidence-based premise that frequent and efficient service is
critical to ensuring ridership. RTD participated in discussions hosted by Denver
during the development of our Denver Moves Transit plan in 2017-2019, where
we explored national best practices on modern bus service systems. Faster
service on better routed lines to get people where they are going, in contrast to
the RTD model with a proliferation of routes that require downtown transfers
and varying frequency rates, only a small percentage of which are at the high
frequencies that attract riders, and with them, fare revenue. Both the Denver
Moves Transit Plan and the Mayor’s Mobility Action Plan call for adoption of
these best practices in our region.

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B [Revision 1] (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

January 31, 2020

We are grateful that RTD has agreed to study these kind of large-scale shifts in service levels and routing
through Reimagine RTD, and we believe the most effective way to address the operator shortages and
challenges faced by the agency would be to expedite that process and implement modern, best

Packet Pg. 358

13.B.b

In contrast, evidence would indicate that every service cut in frequency will further propel a downward
spiral of reduced ridership, perhaps solving a short-term challenge of operator shortages, but creating a
much bigger, longer term challenge of even lower ridership, reduced fare revenue, and further eroded
public confidence in transit as a viable alternative. As we found in Denver Moves Transit: “local transit
does not provide the frequent, connected, and reliable service Denver needs to meet the city’s mobility
needs both now and in the future.” The underlying value behind this concern is reinforced regionally in
Metro Vison 2040 which calls for greater reliability, expanded service, and coverage. Erosion of service
frequency only moves us further, not closer, to the goals of Denver and the region to increase transit trips
through more reliable and efficient service.
Where service cuts must be made, ridership and racial/economic equity should be priority criteria for RTD
when considering service triage. In spite of the shortcomings in the current system, Denver is proud that
we’ve maintained the ridership we have, in part because we’ve invested heavily in infrastructure and
land use planning to leverage RTD’s stations and corridors in ways that prioritize and promote ridership.
We urge RTD to consider local government investments and alignments like these when making any
service decisions.
We also urge RTD to consider the potential disparate racial and economic impacts that could result from
proposed cuts. In addition to our land use and investment alignments, Denver is also home to a large
share of the region’s transit-dependent individuals and households, most of whom are low-income and a
disproportionate share of which are individuals of color.
Both of these factors, focused/aligned land-use and racial and economic equity, are reasons why we
urge the RTD board to reject cuts to the 16L along West Colfax. Denver and Lakewood have worked
together to build density and ridership along West Colfax, and while we recognize the West Line is an
important transit option that catalyzed this focus, today we recognize that local and express bus service
on Colfax is just as critical, and rail several blocks south of the corridor is not a substitute for express bus
service for all riders:
• The 16L is just under half the cost of rail, making it an important option for low-income riders.
• At places along the rail line, steep hills and other geographic barriers make access difficult,
especially for older adults or those with disabilities, compared to accessing the bus on relatively
flat Colfax.
• The 16L serves 22 different census tracts. More than half of these census tracts are home to a
population of African American, Hispanic, or Asian residents, with 27% of these tracts being
home to a majority of people of color. Furthermore, census data points to a high percentage of
people with disabilities within the line's service area.
More than 2,000 riders a day would be negatively impacted by longer or more costly commutes, an
unacceptably high impact compared to other regular routes being explored for reductions on the list. The
agency’s assumptions from the early 2000s about bus service being replaced by rail have been disproved
by thousands of riders per day, and we urge RTD to not only reject this cut now, but to acknowledge the
evidence justifying the long-term operation of the 16L for the foreseeable future.

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B [Revision 1] (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

practice routing and service levels ASAP. There is reason to believe that doing so could help us move
even more passengers, perhaps on fewer/better designed routes, improving efficiency without sacrificing
ridership.

Packet Pg. 359

We also urge RTD to reject the frequency cuts proposed for the 153/Chamber Road bus line. Prior cuts
already reduced service in this area to levels where it now takes residents of far NE Denver, two-thirds of
whom are individuals of color, multiple stops to reach the economic opportunity and services along our
Aurora border as well as in Denver. Though the route does not directly touch the City and County of
Denver, these residents depend on the 153 to reach other lines. Reducing service any further would
essentially eliminate transit as a viable option for an entire, growing area of the region that is home to
many seniors and individuals of color.
Further, while the service cuts have been described as “temporary” there has been no clarity on how long
that would last, and given other constraints, we are deeply concerned about the prospects of recovering
any services lost. We suggest any cuts be made with a sunset provision where service is automatically
restored at a date certain absent affirmative action to continue them, to ensure the agency remains
focused on finding long term solutions that do not rely on sub-optimal service levels indefinitely.
We recognize that RTD faces real challenges. Almost half of the service cuts proposed will impact lines
running through Denver, serving our residents and visitors, and as described above we are concerned
about the diminishing returns and long-term negative impacts of this approach overall compared to a
route/frequency revamp. But we have intentionally not asked you to reject every service cut proposed in
our jurisdiction, in the interests of geographic equity we recognize some reductions in Denver may be
necessary. But we urge you to ensure that geographic equity is not done at the expense of racial and
income inequality, disproportionately impacting transit-dependent riders and/or communities.
We look forward to staying engaged with you on this and future topics.
Respectfully,
The Members of Denver City Council

Denver Federal Center Today

The DFC and its surrounding neighborhoods is a popular destination for Denver and Lakewood residents
going to/from work, St. Anthony’s Hospital, and surrounding businesses and retail. Given the desire by all
parties to reduce its environmental impact, the growing Denver metro population, and job growth (and
subsequent parking shortage) at the DFC, there is a strong need to reliably connect the DFC with the
eastern half of downtown and Capitol Hill, Denver’s densest residential neighborhood.

Just as Metro Denver historically was known as a magnet for the baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964),
the region is now a choice location for the millennials (born between 1981 and 1997). The millennials are the
largest population group in Metro Denver, totaling nearly 891,500 people in 2015 and representing 24 percent of
the regionʼs total population. While the generation X (821,500 population) and baby boomers (813,200
population) dominate those working today, the millennials are making their mark and represent the largest
component of the potential labor force. Demographic shifts related to both the millennial and baby boomer
generations are changing the face of Metro Denver, which has implications for future labor force growth patterns,
consumer spending patterns, and residential real estate needs. As a result, the need to understand the millennial
population is critically important to Metro Denverʼs economic future.
Since many of Metro Denverʼs key competitors are also experiencing rapid millennial growth, it is important to
place Metro Denver into context. Therefore, this report compares various millennial data such as population,
migration, labor force, unemployment rates, and workplace dynamics for Metro Denver with its top eight national
economic development competitors, consisting of the following metropolitan areas:


Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, Georgia



Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, Arizona



Austin-Round Rock, Texas



Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, Oregon-Washington



Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, Texas



Salt Lake City, Utah



Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, Texas



Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, Washington

Data for the next closest geography is used when metropolitan area data is not available. In these cases, Colorado
is compared with the following competitor states: Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Washington.
Metro Denver is about 350 miles west of the geographic center of the continental U.S. and is just east of the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains. There are four metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) located within the Metro
Denver and Northern Colorado region (“Metro Denver MSAs”): the one-county Boulder MSA (Boulder County), the
one-county Fort Collins MSA (Larimer County), the one-county Greeley MSA (Weld County), and the 10-county
Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSA (Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, Clear Creek, Denver, Douglas, Elbert, Gilpin,
Jefferson, and Park Counties). This report generally focuses on a nine-county subset of the four MSAs that consists
of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, Larimer, and Weld Counties, referred to as
“Metro Denver.” In some cases, the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood MSA and the Boulder MSA (“Denver-Boulder
MSAs”) are combined due to data availability.

The millennial population, which includes individuals born between 1981 and 1997, represents over one quarter of
the nationʼs population, reaching over 75.4 million people in 2015. According to Pew Research, the millennial
population overtook the baby boomer population (born between 1946 and 1964) of 74.9 million as the largest
living population in 2015 and generation X (born between 1965 and 1980) is projected to surpass the baby
boomers in population by 2028. The group stated that the millennial generation continues to grow with young
immigrants, while the baby boomer generation declines as the number of deaths exceeds the number of older
immigrants arriving to the U.S. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that the millennials are more diverse than the
previous generations, with 44.2 percent being part of a minority race or ethnic group.

Colorado Population
Colorado has experienced strong population
growth over the past few years, reaching
nearly 5.5 million people in 2015. The state
recorded the second-fastest population
growth of the 50 states in 2015, adding nearly
101,000 people. In 2015, Coloradoʼs
population was the third-smallest population
of its six main competitor states, only larger
than Utah (3 million) and Oregon (4 million).
Between 2010 and 2015, Coloradoʼs
population increased 8.1 percent or over
408,300 people. Of Coloradoʼs competitor
states, Texas (+8.8 percent) was the only state
to record stronger population growth
between 2010 and 2015.
The next generation (born after 1997), millennials, and generation X in Colorado recorded population gains for all
years from 2011 to 2015, while the baby boomer and silent generation populations recorded losses. Of the
generational groups that had a population increase in Colorado between 2014 and 2015, millennials accounted
for nearly 35 percent of the total increase, rising 10 percentage points from the 2011 portion of 24.5 percent.
Compared with the competitor states, Coloradoʼs millennial growth share was the largest of the group, with
portions ranging from 10.9 percent in Georgia to 26.4 percent in Washington.
Coloradoʼs millennial population neared 1.4
million people in 2015, the fifth-largest
absolute share of millennials of the
competitor states. Millennial populations in
the competitor states ranged from 781,800 in
Utah to 6.8 million in Texas. Between 2010
and 2015, Colorado added about 156,500
millennials to the state, the second-largest
absolute increase of the competitor states
with Texas leading the pack adding over
468,300 people. Coloradoʼs millennial
population reported increasing growth rates
during the five-year period and had the

MILLENNIAL POPULATION OVERVIEW

Coloradoʼs millennial population represented
24 percent of the stateʼs total population
between 2010 and 2014 and increased slightly
to 25 percent in 2015. The next generation
increased from 18 percent of the population
in 2010 to 23 percent in 2015, while
generation X fell slightly from 22 percent in
2010 to 21 percent in 2015. The baby
boomers represented 23 percent of the stateʼs
total population in 2015, down 2 percentage
points from 2010. Utah had the largest
portion of millennials in 2015, reaching 26
percent, while Arizona had the smallest
portion at 23 percent. Utah also reported the
largest portion of next-generation individuals
at 30 percent and the smallest portion of baby
boomers at 17 percent. Oregon recorded the largest concentration of baby boomers of the competitor states,
with 25 percent of the stateʼs population.

Metro Denver Population
Metro Denver is an attractive location for millennials, bolstered by a vibrant job market, high quality of life, and
convenient transportation options. Numerous studies have ranked Metro Denver as one of the top locations for
millennials:


Money magazine stated Denver was a “mecca for millennials”;



Denver ranked third for attracting the most millennials moving from another city by the 2016 Mayflower
Mover Study;



Forbes ranked Denver as the seventh-best city for millennials (ages 25-34) out of 25 major cities in 2015;



Denver ranked the seventh-best city for educated millennials by the American Institute for Economic
Research;



Forbes ranked Metro Denver seventh among metro areas that are magnets for millennials in 2014;



Boulder ranked among the top-seven-best metro areas for millennials in 2014, according to The Cheat Sheet;



Denver was ranked the eighth-most perfect city by millennials in a survey by ABODO; and



Realtor.com ranked Denver ninth among the top cities where millennials are most likely to purchase a home in
2016.

The millennial population in Metro Denver totaled nearly 891,500 people in 2015 and represented 24 percent of
the regionʼs total population. Further, Metro Denver millennials represented about 66 percent of the millennial
population across Colorado in 2015, but only accounted for 47 percent of the 2015 millennial population growth
in the state.

fastest millennial growth rates of the competitor states. Colorado recorded over-the-year increases in the
millennial population of 2 percent in 2011 and 2012 before increasing 2.4 percent in 2013 and 2.6 percent in 2014.
The millennial population increased 3.4 percent in 2015, nearly double the pace of any of the competitors.

Metro Denver has recorded variable growth in its millennial population over the past 16 years. In 2000, millennials
were between three and 19 years of age. Between 1999 and 2000, the millennial population increased 3.5 percent
or about 23,200 people. This increase was prior to the 2001 recession when the regionʼs economy was strong and

the growth was likely attributed to children
relocating to the state with their families due
to their young age. After 2000, the millennial
growth rate slowed to 2.5 percent in 2001, 1.2
percent in 2002, and remained below 1
percent until 2006 when growth started to
accelerate. Between 2006 and 2009, millennial
population growth averaged 1.4 percent per
year. The millennial population in Metro
Denver increased significantly between 2009
and 2010. Millennials would have been
between the ages of 13 and 29, with the
middle of the group being 21 years of age
and reaching college graduation age. The
millennial population in Metro Denver rose
nearly 4 percent in 2010, the strongest growth recorded for the generation during the period. In 2010, the Great
Recession hit its peak in Metro Denver with employment at its lowest and unemployment at its peak.
During recessionary periods, it is typical for workers who have lost their jobs to go back to school and retrain and
for currently enrolled students to extend their education. It is likely that the millennials who graduated from
college at the peak of the recession went on to higher education and millennial professionals went back to school
for additional certifications or an advanced degree. Metro Denverʼs many community college and university
options, as well at its quality of life, could have attracted millennials at the time. In the yearʼs following the Great
Recession, the millennial generation increased an average of 2.2 percent per year, reaching 2.5 percent in 2014
and 2.4 percent in 2015.
The millennial population in Metro Denver is
expected to maintain its strong presence in
the coming years. The population is projected
to remain at about 24 percent of the regionʼs
total population through 2025 before slowly
declining to 23 percent by 2035 and 21
percent by 2040. Millennials are expected to
reach their largest absolute total in 2040 at
1.15 million people in Metro Denver, but are
projected to begin contracting toward 1.12
million in 2050, as the oldest millennials will
be 69 years of age. The baby boomers are
projected to represent 19 percent of the
Metro Denver population in 2020 before
declining to 4 percent in 2050. Generation X is
expected to represent 21 percent of the population in 2020, but slowly decline to 12 percent in 2050.

Migration Activity
Net migration, or the number of people
moving in minus the people moving out, is an
indicator of the attractiveness of an area and strong net migration will increase the demand for jobs, housing, and
resources. From 2014 to 2015, 67 percent of Coloradoʼs population growth was attributed to net migration. In
comparison, Oregon had the highest portion of net migration of the competitor states at 74 percent, while Utah
had the lowest portion at 31 percent. Arizona (+64 percent), Texas (+55 percent), and Georgia (+54 percent) all
had positive net migration, but at lower rates than Colorado.

Austin (40,710 people).

The American Community Survey estimated the geographic mobility of individuals that are one year and older
based on whether they lived in the same house last year, same county, same state, different state, or moved
abroad. This information is used to estimate the movement of individuals by age from outside of the state to the
metropolitan area, and is referred to as in-migration.
In 2014, nearly 52 percent of total inmigration to the Metro Denver MSAs was
millennials, the largest portion of all
generational groups. The 2014 millennial inmigration level was roughly 2 percentage
points higher than the 2013 level of about 50
percent. Among the competitor areas, Salt
Lake City and Seattle recorded similar levels of
millennial in-migration, while Phoenix
recorded the lowest level of millennial inmigration in 2014. Phoenix recorded the
smallest decline in millennial migration
between 2013 and 2014, falling from 38
percent of in-migrants in 2013 to 35 percent

MILLENNIAL EMPLOYMENT OVERVIEW

Colorado Employment
Coloradoʼs high quality of life, strong job market, and thriving economic environment continue to attract young,
skilled workers to the state. Of Coloradoʼs employment base of 2.8 million workers in 2015, millennials
represented the largest share with 35.9 percent, followed by generation X (34.7 percent) and baby boomers (27
percent). The share of the stateʼs millennial labor force has grown over the past 16 years as millennials began
entering the workforce during this period.
The share of the millennial labor force in
Colorado grew from 5.3 percent in 2000 to
35.9 percent in 2015, while the share of the
stateʼs generation X labor force has remained
relatively consistent over the 16-year period.
As baby boomers began to retire out of the
labor force during this period, their overall
share of the labor force decreased from 46.2
percent in 2000 to 27 percent in 2015.
Between 2000 and 2015, Coloradoʼs millennial
labor force grew at an annual average rate of
15.2 percent, compared with 13.6 percent
nationally. The stateʼs generation X grew at a
smaller 0.8 percent, while the stateʼs baby
boomer labor force posted a negative growth
rate over this time (-2.2 percent). The trends across all generational groups are expected to continue as millennials
continue aging into the labor force, generation X will remain steady since these individuals are at their prime
working age, and baby boomers will continue aging out of the labor force and into retirement.
Among the stateʼs competitors, Colorado had the fourth-highest share of millennial workers in 2015. Georgia had
the smallest share of its labor force comprised
of millennials (35 percent), while Utah had the
highest share (42.4 percent). Similar to
Colorado, the share of each of the competitor
states millennial labor force grew over the past
16 years. Between 2000 and 2015, Colorado
reported the fastest growth in its millennial
labor force (15.2 percent), while Oregon
reported the slowest growth (13.2 percent).
The labor force participation rate, or the
percentage of the population that is either
employed or actively seeking work, varies
among generational groups. Among the three
generational groups, generation X has had the
highest labor force participation rates in

Metro Denver Economic Development Corp. | September 2016

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B [Revision 1] (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the millennial generation will make up 40 percent of the national
workforce by 2020 and 75 percent of the global workforce by 2030. The labor force is rapidly changing with
10,000 millennials turning 21 years of age each day in the United States and half of them already labor force
participants. Like the nation, Colorado will face a changing generational composition in its workforce over the next
two decades.

MILLENNIAL EMPLOYMENT OVERVIEW

Utah has generally had the highest millennial
labor force participation rates among the
competitor states, reaching a peak of 73.9
percent in 2006 compared with 73.3 percent
in 2015. While labor force participation rates
waivered during the Great Recession, the rate
increased in all states except Oregon from
2010 to 2015. Four of the seven states were
above the national millennial labor force
participation rate for 2015, while Arizona,
Texas, and Georgia were below the national
rate. Over the past 16 years, Georgia has
generally had the lowest millennial labor force
participation rates among the competitor
states.
Over the past 16 years, Colorado has generally had the highest generation X labor force participation rates of the
competitor states, while Arizona has had the lowest. In 2015, Colorado, Utah, and Washington were the only states
to report higher generation X labor force participation rates than the U.S.
The labor force participation rate among baby boomers has generally decreased for all competitor states over the
past 16 years. Arizona has generally had the lowest baby boomer labor force participation rates of the competitor
states. However, Georgia recorded the lowest baby boomer labor force participation rate of the competitor states
in 2015, reaching 51.7 percent. Colorado and Utah have generally had the highest labor force participation rates
among baby boomers. In 2015, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and Washington all had baby boomer labor force
participation rates that were higher than the U.S. rate of 54.3 percent.
As companies increased their staffing levels,
Coloradoʼs unemployment rates among all
generation groups have steadily declined. In
2015, the stateʼs unemployment rate among
all generation groups remained below the
national level. Baby boomers (3.2 percent) and
generation X (3.5 percent) registered the
lowest unemployment rates in 2015, while
millennials reported the highest
unemployment rate. Coloradoʼs millennial
unemployment rate fell faster than the
national average, reaching 5 percent in
2015—the lowest level over the last 16 years.
During the peak of the recession in 2010,
Coloradoʼs millennial unemployment rate
reached 12.6 percent. The stateʼs millennial

Colorado since 2000. Generation Xʼs labor force participation rate peaked in 2008 at 86 percent and fell 2.2
percentage points to 83.8 percent in 2015. The millennials have had the lowest labor force participation rate over
the past 16 years; however, the rate has increased from 55.8 percent in 2000 to a record 72.7 percent in 2015 as
this generational group has entered the workforce over this period. The number of workers approaching
retirement age has increased and as a result, the labor force participation rate for baby boomers has decreased
from 84.6 percent in 2000 to 57.5 percent in 2015.

13.B.b

unemployment rate has remained below the national level since 2005. Further, Coloradoʼs millennial
unemployment rate of 5 percent in 2015 was 2.8 percentage points below the national average. Both generation X
and baby boomers followed a similar trend, reaching their unemployment peaks in 2010. Coloradoʼs generation X
unemployment rate has remained below the national level since 2000, while the stateʼs baby boomer
unemployment rate has fluctuated above and below the national level over the last 16 years. In 2015, the stateʼs
generation X (3.5 percent) and baby boomer (3.2 percent) unemployment rates were blow the national averages
of 4 percent and 3.8 percent, respectively.
The generational composition of Coloradoʼs unemployed workers has changed over the last 16 years. Between
2000 and 2003, generation X generally represented the largest share of the unemployed. As millennials entered
the workforce, the generational composition of Coloradoʼs unemployed shifted. In 2004, millennials represented
the largest share of Coloradoʼs unemployed with 32.1 percent and grew to nearly 46 percent in 2015. In 2015,
generation X represented nearly 31 percent of the total unemployed workers and baby boomers represented the
smallest share with 22.4 percent.
Of Coloradoʼs competitors, Arizona and
Georgia reported millennial unemployment
rates that were above the national rate in
2015. At the peak of the recession in 2010,
Georgia and Washington reported the highest
millennial unemployment rates. The recovery
from such high unemployment rates has
taken longer than areas that peaked at lower
unemployment rates like Utah, which peaked
at 11.9 percent in 2010. Texas reported a
millennial unemployment rate of 6.4 percent
in 2015, about 1.4 percentage points higher
than Colorado. Texas and Colorado followed
similar paths of millennial unemployment
between 2008 and 2015, putting them on similar recovery paths.

Metro Denver Employment
Just as Metro Denver historically was known as a magnet for the baby boomers, the region is now a choice
location for millennial job seekers. Of the 2 million jobs in Metro Denver, 32.5 percent are held by millennials and
nearly two-thirds are held by generation X
(44.4 percent) and baby boomers (21.1
percent).
Among the competitor areas, Metro Denver
had the sixth-highest proportion of jobs held
by millennials, the fifth-highest proportion of
jobs held by generation X, and the secondhighest proportion of jobs held by baby
boomers in 2016. Salt Lake City had the
highest share of jobs held by millennials (38.2
percent) and the smallest shares of both
generation X jobs (41 percent) and baby
boomer jobs (18 percent). Portland had the
smallest proportion of millennial jobs (31.4

Nearly 62 percent of millennials in Metro
Denver predominantly work in four sectors
consisting of leisure and hospitality,
professional and business services, wholesale
and retail trade, and government. The largest
employment sector for millennials is leisure
and hospitality representing roughly 17
percent of total employment, compared with
7.1 percent for generation X and 6.3 percent
for baby boomers. Many of these millennial
workers are also in school and in recent years,
millennials have enrolled in colleges and
universities at historically high levels. About
40 percent of 18 to 24 year olds are currently
enrolled in institutions across the nation.
Additionally, students and young adults who move directly to the workforce rather than attending college are
more likely to work in positions that require less training.

WORKPLACE DYNAMICS
The millennial population has workplace ideals and demands that stray from previous norms, which are leading to
alterations in the workplace environment. Most significantly, there has been a rise in entrepreneurship, increased
desire for telecommuting and a collaborative work environment, and other employment amenities.

The increase in the unemployment rate for
millennials during the peak of the Great
Recession contributed to increases in
entrepreneurship. The number of millennial
entrepreneurs in the Denver-Boulder MSAs
increased 5 percent in 2009, the largest overthe-year increase since millennials began
entering the workforce. In 2013, the baby
boomers, generation X, and millennials each
represented nearly one-third of the DenverBoulder MSAsʼ entrepreneurs total. The
generational composition of entrepreneurs
has changed over the last two decades. The
share of baby boomer entrepreneurs declined
from 57 percent in 1996 to 31 percent in
2013. Unlike the baby boomer entrepreneurs,
the share of generation X entrepreneurs
increased in the Denver-Boulder MSAs from
24 percent in 1996 to 35 percent in 2013. The
share of millennial entrepreneurs in the
Denver-Boulder MSAs increased from 2
percent in 2000 to 34 percent in 2013.
Metro Denverʼs innovative ecosystem and
growing startup hub supports the increasing
share of millennial entrepreneurs. The regionʼs
collaborative culture, high quality of life,
numerous coworking and shared workspaces,
and strong job growth are magnets for
millennial startups and entrepreneurs alike.
Moneyrates.com ranked Denver among the “10 Best Cities for Young Entrepreneurs” in 2016. Thumbtack ranked
Boulder as the third-best city in the nation for millennial entrepreneurs in 2015. Further, Metro Denver ranked
among the top-five cities for young entrepreneurs by NerdWallet in 2016.
The Kauffman Index: Startup Activity, which is a broader measure of entrepreneurial activity, ranked the DenverAurora MSA fifth-highest for startup activity among the 40 largest metro areas in 2015 with 370 people out of
100,000 adults becoming entrepreneurs each month. Among the competitor areas, Austin had the highest startup
activity, followed by Houston (eighth), Atlanta (13th), Phoenix (14th), Dallas (15th), Seattle (16th), and Portland
(26th). Salt Lake City was not included in the list. Austin also had the highest startup density among the
competitor areas with 180.8 startups less than a year old, followed by Denver (177.8), Seattle (167.9), Portland
(165.8), Atlanta (154.5), Dallas (142.5), Houston (136.9), and Phoenix (127.5).

WORKPLACE DYNAMICS
Travel to Work Patterns

According to the latest U.S. Census Bureau
data, millennials in Metro Denver MSAs are
embracing a range of alternate modes of
transportation, including public transportation
and walking. In 2014, 70.8 percent of the
youngest working millennials ages 16 to 24
drove alone compared with 77.7 percent of
baby boomers in Metro Denver MSAs. The
other competitor areas followed this same
trend of a smaller percentage of millennials
driving alone than baby boomers.
Millennials represent a higher percentage of
commuters in Metro Denver MSAs who take
public transportation (5.5 percent) or walk to
work (5.5 percent), compared with generation
X and baby boomers. All of the competitor
areas followed this same trend, with Portland
(17.3 percent) and Seattle (17.9 percent)
representing the highest proportion of
millennials that take public transportation or
walk to work. Dallas had the smallest share of
millennials that took public transportation (1.9
percent) or walked to work (2.8 percent).
The share of millennial commuters working at
home in Metro Denver MSAs increased from
1.6 percent in 2007 to 3.2 percent in 2014.
Among the competitor areas, Metro Denver
MSAs had the second-highest share of
millennial commuters working at home in
2014. Seattle had the highest concentration at 3.4 percent and Dallas had the lowest share at 1.4 percent. Baby
boomers working from home in Metro Denver MSAs represented the largest share (9.8 percent) of the working
from home population in 2014. Similar to Metro Denver MSAs, baby boomers represented the largest share of the
working from home population among all competitor areas in 2014. The share of baby boomers working from
home in Metro Denver MSAs increased from 9.5 percent in 2007 to 9.8 percent in 2014.

Coworking

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B [Revision 1] (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

Millennials are changing the way that they travel to work, primarily motivated by environmental and health
concerns. Additionally, workplace flexibility and work/life balance have become an important focus for working
people over the last decade, particularly millennials. New mobile technologies and expanded broadband access
have provided increased productivity, and the ability to telework, or work at home.

Millennials are also driving the shift towards coworking spaces and working collaboratively, as they prefer work
environments with greater flexibility, added amenities, and scalability. Coworking, a type of shared workplace, is
an emerging model that provides many of the amenities of traditional offices but with a greater emphasis on
designing space that creates a community and an experience for users. Further, coworking spaces offer the

opportunity to work with a variety of like-minded people with complementary skill sets in an environment that
promotes innovation and creativity. According to The Instant Group, coworking has grown more than 10 percent
across the nation and combination centers offering both executive suites and coworking spaces expanded nearly
13 percent between 2014 and 2015. The increase in centers offering some form of coworking is four times that of
conventional executive suites, which have increased by a smaller 3.4 percent over the same period. The concept is
gaining significant traction around the nation and in Metro Denver, which is home to more than 522,000 square
feet of coworking space.
According to The Instant Group, 47 coworking centers were established in Denver in 2015. Denver joined eight of
the nine competitor areas on a list of cities with the most coworking spaces. Salt Lake City was not included in the
list. Among the competitor areas, Atlanta has the largest number of coworking spaces—totaling 90—while
Portland is home to the smallest number of coworking spaces with 10. Colorado had fourth-highest number of
coworking spaces (118), increasing 1.3 percent between 2014 and 2015. Utah had the fastest coworking center
growth between 2014 and 2015, rising 13.6 percent. In 2015, Texas and Arizona were home to the greatest
number of coworking spaces, totaling 299 and 127, respectively.

Metro Denverʼs millennial population, which includes individuals born between 1981 and 1997, totaled nearly
891,500 people in 2015 and represented 24 percent of the regionʼs total population. The millennial population in
Metro Denver is expected to maintain its strong presence in the coming years. The population is projected to
remain at about 24 percent of the regionʼs total population through 2025 before slowly declining to 23 percent by
2035 and 21 percent by 2040. Millennials are expected to reach their largest absolute total in 2040 at 1.15 million
people in Metro Denver. In 2014, nearly 52 percent of total in-migration to the Metro Denver MSAs was
millennials, the largest portion of all generational groups.
Metro Denver is an attractive location for millennial job seekers. Of the 2 million jobs in Metro Denver, 32.5
percent are held by millennials and nearly two-thirds are held by generation X (44.4 percent) and baby boomers
(21.1 percent). Nearly 62 percent of millennials in Metro Denver predominantly work in four sectors consisting of
leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, wholesale and retail trade, and government. The
industry composition varies by the age of the millennials. Nearly 71 percent of total employment for younger
millennials ages 19 to 24 in the region is concentrated in leisure and hospitality, wholesale and retail trade,
government, and professional and business services. The largest employment sector for younger millennials is
leisure and hospitality (24.6 percent), while the professional and business services represents the largest
employment sector for older millennials (18.1 percent) ages 25 to 34.
The millennial population has workplace ideals and demands that stray from previous norms, which are leading to
alterations in the workplace environment. In 2013, the baby boomers, generation X, and millennials each
represented nearly one-third of the Denver-Boulder MSAsʼ entrepreneurs total. The share of millennial
entrepreneurs in the Denver-Boulder MSAs increased from 2 percent in 2000 to 34 percent in 2013. Millennials are
also changing the way that they travel to work, primarily motivated by environmental and health concerns. This
generational group is also driving the shift towards coworking spaces and working collaboratively, as they prefer
work environments with greater flexibility, added amenities, and scalability.
Just as Metro Denver historically was known as a magnet for the baby boomers, the region is now a choice
location for the millennials and will continue to attract millennials in the coming years. Metro Denverʼs high quality
of life, strong job market, and thriving economic environment continue to draw young, skilled workers to the
region. Millennials are making their mark on the workplace today and currently represent the largest component
of the potential labor force. Despite variances, Metro Denverʼs competitor areas are generally experiencing a
similar boom in their millennial population and workforce. Demographic shifts related to both the millennial and
baby boomer generations are changing the face of Metro Denver and the other competitor areas alike, which has
implications for future labor force growth patterns, consumer spending patterns, and residential real estate needs.
As a result, the millennial population is critically important to Metro Denver and the competitor areasʼ economic
futures.

Tradition

From: Laurel McKown Alternative Transportation Coordinator
Regarding: Proposed Schedule changes to RTD routes

My name is Laurel McKown and I have been the Eco pass coordinator at the
Hotel Boulderado since the fall of 1991. I have encouraged all 200 + employees
in our.organization to use the RTD bus system to commute to work.

t
t,

I

I am very upset that RTD is considering decreasing seruice on several bus routes.

l, like many Boulder employees do not live in Boulder. I live in Lyons and have taken the
Y bus since the late 1980's. I take the bus 5 days a week. Several other employees also take

the y bus.

Currently there are 3 buses in the morning from Lyons to Boulder and 3 return buses in the late
afternoon and early evening returning from Boulder to Lyons.

l
I

Your proposal to eliminate more than half of them is not fair to the commuters and students who rely
on the bus system to get to work or school. Most of the riders didn't even know RTD was considering a
slash in the scheduling. There are no notification signs in the bus.

Another bus route, the JUMP is another route that many of our employees use and it is another bus on
the list that will have service cut.
The bus makes it possible for people to get to work. As an employer, it is a challenge to find staff. We
can raise the minimum wage, but if people don't have a way to get to work, they can't take the job. The
bus system is one asset that we can offer to employees so that they can get to and from work.

Specifically, the ECO PASS program is a great incentive to employees. But, again, if there is no bus, they

can't continue to work. Not everyone drives, has a car or wants to contribute to the congestion and
emissions problems.
Once bus routes are eliminated, it is hard to get the ridership back. People move on to other things.
and those employees are lost.

Affordable housing has been pushed in Lyons. lt would be imperative that Lyons has a good bus
schedule to support this.

RE: Proposed RTD Service Reduction of the R Line and bus routes 153 and 157
Dear RTD Board Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Directors, and Interim GM and CEO Paul Ballard,
As the voice of the business community in the Eastern Metro Area, as well as a strong community
supporter, The Chamber opposes cuts being proposed for the R Line and bus routes 153 and 157 for
the following reasons:
• Transit Oriented Development (TOD) continues to grow at each light rail station with
commercial and retail space, as well as multi-family residential homes, which will continue
to increase ridership on the R Line
• The R Line is the only light rail serving the Anschutz Medical Campus schools and hospitals,
the Fitzsimons Innovation Community, and the Rocky Mountain VA Regional Medical
Center – with more than 30,000 employees and tens of thousands of daily visitors
• The Community College of Aurora has nearly 9,000 students attending on a full or part-time
basis, and 700 employees. The rail and bus route cuts will severely impact students and
employees
• Light rail stations in Aurora are within a half mile of 108,000 members of the community
that are low income, elderly, young, or minority residents, with bus routes 153 and 157
serving many additional residents. The proposed reductions will negatively impact these
populations and their ability to get to jobs, school, healthcare, shopping, etc.
In addition to the significant investment in TOD along the R Line, and the transit needs of the
businesses and populations it serves, it just doesn’t make sense to cut service to the only line with an
increase (6.2 percent) in ridership. In addition, the R Line is the most direct rail connection to the A
Line and DEN for the eastern and southeastern metro area, and therefore needs to be consistent with
the A Line’s frequency.
We are aware that overall Light Rail Transit declined 2.9 percent for 2019, and that RTD is currently
challenged with operator shortages. However, given that the R Line and Bus Routes 153 and 157 not
only serve a large population, but have seen an increase in ridership in the last year, The Aurora
Chamber of Commerce is requesting that the RTD Board of Directors reconsider the reduction in
service for the R Line and Bus Routes 153 and 157.
Community and business momentum in Aurora is highly supportive of the creation of enhanced
transit connections between all communities throughout the metro area – and believe that reduction
in service to these vital transportation sources in Aurora will be economically detrimental, as well as
a hardship and disservice to those who rely on consistent and timely public transportation.

Re: Proposed May 2020 Service Reductions
Dear Mr. Ballard:
Here at the City of Lafayette, we have been following the RTD operator shortage, the related negative impacts on
service delivery, and the resulting May 2020 service reduction plan. The RTD proposed service reduction plan calls
for the discontinuation of six bus routes, service reductions for nineteen bus routes, service reductions for four light
rail lines, and the end of Sports Ride services across the district.
Specific to Lafayette, this service reduction plan would reduce service to the Jump which currently provides service .
between Downtown Boulder and Lafayette and Erie via Arapahoe Road on SH 7. Proposed midday frequency
reductions, from 30 to 60 minute frequencies would compromise route service design and diminish regional travel
options and route ridership.
Rapid growth along SH 7 is generating significant increases in traffic and travel times which will only be exacerbated
by new developments such as Nine Mile Corner located along the Jump route at the critical intersection of Arapahoe
Road and US 287. Communities along the corridor have been actively investing in multi-modal planning with COOT
and RTD since the completion of the RTD Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS) in 2014, which identified SH 7 as a
potential Bus Rapid Transit Corridor (BRT). The Jump local service is envisioned to grow into this regional BRT,
therefore the proposed service reductions would undermine our multi-jurisdictional efforts.
We understand that the service reduction plan is a draft and the final plan may be adjusted after RTD staff and Board
of Directors revi~w of related public comments. We request that this proposal to reduce service to the Jump route not
be implemented.
Thank you fo r your consideration of our concerns. We appreciate our on-going partnership with RTD and welcome an
opportunity to further discuss solutions to best serve our Community's growing transit needs.
Sincerely,

RE: May 2020 JUMP Service Reductions

The following members of the State Highway 7 Coalition including Boulder County, City & County of
Broomfield, Town of Erie, City of Lafayette, the Northwest Chamber Alliance, University of Colorado
Boulder and our two TMO's Commuting Solutions and Smart Commute Metro-North are concerned
about the reduction of the JUMP service.
The JUMP currently provides service between Downtown Boulder and Lafayette/Erie via Arapahoe
Road. This local service is envisioned to grow into a high-quality regional Bus Rapid Transit service
along SH-7, Arapahoe Road and Baseline by extending the JUMP transit service to eastern Erie, City
& County of Broomfield, Thornton, Adams County, and Brighton.
Along with RTD and CDOT, the communities along the corridor have been actively investing in
planning a robust multi-modal corridor since the completion of RTD' Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS) in 2014, which identified SH-7 as a potential Bus Rapid Transit Corridor. The work includes
the completion of two Planning & Environmental Linkage studies (2014 & 2018) spanning from 75th
Street in Boulder County to US85 in Brighton, as well as City of Boulder's East Arapahoe
Transportation Plan (2018), I-25/SH-7 Mobility Hub Concept Design (CDOT 2018), SH-7 Bus Rapid
Transit Feasibility Study (2019), and SH-7 Station Area Design (2019).
The SH-7 Coalition rejects RTD's categorization of the JUMP service reduction as "permanent," rather
it should be noted that the mid-day service does not meet current performance standards. The SH-7
corridor between Boulder and Brighton is one of the major east/west regional arterials in the North
Denver Metro Region. It is anticipated that by 2040 there will be 56,000 new residents and 38,000
new jobs on the corridor for a total of approximately 94,000 new residents and employees traveling
on the corridor, a 44% increase from 2015 population and jobs. Rapid growth along the corridor that
was previously undeveloped is generating significant increases in travel along the corridor, resulting
in the need for reliable multi-modal options.
The proposed service reductions would further reduce the reliability of the service and diminish
ridership rather than build it. The SH-7 Coalition is actively working to build a new transit experience
along this critical east/west corridor in the North Denver Metro connecting Brighton to Boulder and
would like to work with RTD to identify partnerships to grow JUMP ridership and ultimately extend
service east to Broomfield, Thornton, Adams County, and Brighton rather than reduce service as
proposed.
Sincerely,
Members of the State Highway 7 Coalition

RE: May 2020 JUMP Service Reductions

The following members of the State Highway 7 Coalition including Boulder County, City & County of
Broomfield, Town of Erie, City of Lafayette, the Northwest Chamber Alliance, University of Colorado
Boulder and our two TMO's Commuting Solutions and Smart Commute Metro-North are concerned
about the reduction of the JUMP service.
The JUMP currently provides service between Downtown Boulder and Lafayette/Erie via Arapahoe
Road. This local service is envisioned to grow into a high-quality regional Bus Rapid Transit service
along SH-7, Arapahoe Road and Baseline by extending the JUMP transit service to eastern Erie, City
& County of Broomfield, Thornton, Adams County, and Brighton.
Along with RTD and CDOT, the communities along the corridor have been actively investing in
planning a robust multi-modal corridor since the completion of RTD' Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS) in 2014, which identified SH-7 as a potential Bus Rapid Transit Corridor. The work includes
the completion of two Planning & Environmental Linkage studies (2014 & 2018) spanning from 75th
Street in Boulder County to US85 in Brighton, as well as City of Boulder's East Arapahoe
Transportation Plan (2018), I-25/SH-7 Mobility Hub Concept Design (CDOT 2018), SH-7 Bus Rapid
Transit Feasibility Study (2019), and SH-7 Station Area Design (2019).
The SH-7 Coalition rejects RTD's categorization of the JUMP service reduction as "permanent," rather
it should be noted that the mid-day service does not meet current performance standards. The SH-7
corridor between Boulder and Brighton is one of the major east/west regional arterials in the North
Denver Metro Region. It is anticipated that by 2040 there will be 56,000 new residents and 38,000
new jobs on the corridor for a total of approximately 94,000 new residents and employees traveling
on the corridor, a 44% increase from 2015 population and jobs. Rapid growth along the corridor that
was previously undeveloped is generating significant increases in travel along the corridor, resulting
in the need for reliable multi-modal options.
The proposed service reductions would further reduce the reliability of the service and diminish
ridership rather than build it. The SH-7 Coalition is actively working to build a new transit experience
along this critical east/west corridor in the North Denver Metro connecting Brighton to Boulder and
would like to work with RTD to identify partnerships to grow JUMP ridership and ultimately extend
service east to Broomfield, Thornton, Adams County, and Brighton rather than reduce service as
proposed.
