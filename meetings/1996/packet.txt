Two Processes Board Members Go
through Annually:
1. Goal Setting
“The process of identifying the critical priorities/focus of the GM (i.e.
Agency) for the following year”
–

Goals are established during the annual strategic planning session in
March for the next year (i.e. goals established in 2014 are for 2015)
These goals become the GM Task goals for his performance review
These goals are used to drive the budget for the following year (i.e.
2015)
GM Goals consists of Core Goals and Task Goals

–
–
–
•

Core Goals-Core goals relate to the job description and generally do not
change from year to year.
• Task Goals-Comes from the top priorities voted on at the strategic planning
session and reflects as the tactical plans for the General Manager
• SMART-Goals should be Specific, Measurable, Aligned, Realistic and Timely
(EX: 90% of the bridges and tunnels for North metro will be ready by 3rd quarter,
2015)

Performance Management (Evaluation)
2. Performance Management
“Performance management (evaluation) is the process of
evaluating how well the agency (i.e GM) did on the goals that
were established for him in a particular year.”
– Generally the GM goals cascade out to the rest of the organization (i.e.
FasTracks related goals to AGM of Capital Programs)
– 2014 Goals are set in 2013 but evaluated in 2014
– Two Components for Performance Management:
A. Semi-annual Surveys (April/Oct)-These surveys provides periodic
updates on the agency activities and progress as it relates to moving
forward on the goals. They provide a chance for correction should the
agency or performance is off-course. The focus areas relate to
attributes or subsets of the goals. (see mapping example)
•
•

Surveys sent 2x a year (April/May)
Surveys consists of several questions that roll up into attributes that relate to the goals.
