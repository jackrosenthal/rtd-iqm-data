Subject:

Award of Contract for On-Vehicle Advertising
(Paratransit Fleet)

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the General Manager or his
designee be authorized to enter into a contract with ZoZo Group, LLC of Denver for the sale and
installation of exterior advertising on ADA paratransit vehicles for the two and one-half year period July
1, 2015 through December 31, 2017 with two one-year options for 2018 and 2019. Under the terms of
the recommended action, ZoZo Group, LLC would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum guarantee of
$45,000 in 2015, $200,000 in 2016 and $210,000 in 2017 or 2) sixty percent of net sales, whichever
is greater.
BACKGROUND
On August 20, 2014, a Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued soliciting proposals for the sale and
installation of exterior and interior advertising on RTD vehicles. Responses to the RFP were due on
September 25, 2014. This RFP offered proposers the option to submit for one or any of three sections:
1) bus, light rail and commuter rail; 2) ADA paratransit vehicles and 3) other in-vehicle advertising
opportunities. Three responses were received for section 1, and one response was received for each of
section 2 and section 3. The recommendation pertains to section 2) ADA paratransit vehicle advertising.
DISCUSSION
The response for the ADA paratransit section of the RFP was received from ZoZo Outdoor. ZoZo
Outdoor is a sales subsidiary of Denver-based ZoZo Group, LLC – a certified small-, women- and
minority-owned business. To effectively launch and then maintain advertising placements on RTD’s
paratransit fleet, ZoZo Group, LLC is partnering with Main Street Outdoor (located in Broomfield, CO)
and Signarama Colorado (a small, women-owned business in Longmont, CO). Main Street Outdoor
provides 30+ years of marketing research and analysis, contact with media buyers, promotional
companies and prospective advertising clients. Signarama is a full-service production sign subcontractor capable of producing high-quality vinyl ads for direct application to vehicles.
Staff reviewed the proposal for compliance with a set of four minimum qualifications; 1) experience of
firm; 2) onsite key personnel experience; 3) sales history; and 4) financial responsibility. ZoZo Group,
LLC was deemed to have met the minimum qualifications as outlined in the RFP. ZoZo’s proposal was
then evaluated on the merit of the revenue proposal, which factored both a minimum annual guarantee
and percentage of net sales.
ZoZo Group, LLC’s proposal provides a source of revenue to RTD from a source which has not been
accessed prior. The proposed revenue is scaled over the first six months to accommodate the launch of
a new program and provide ZoZo Group, LLC with time to enter the market, solicit advertising customers
and build a base of advertising operations prior to initiating payments to RTD.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
ZoZo Group’s financial proposal provides a minimum guarantee of $45,000 in 2015, $200,000 in 2016
and $210,000 in 2017 or 60 percent of net sales, whichever is greater. Because this is a new revenue
stream for RTD, staff is recommending that the contract be awarded to ZoZo Group.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Award a contract to ZoZo Group, LLC of Denver for the two and one-half year period July 1, 2015
through December 31, 2017 for the exclusive sale of exterior advertising on RTD paratransit
vehicles. Under the terms of this alternative, ZoZo Group would remit to RTD either 1) a minimum
guarantee of $45,000 in 2015, $200,000 in 2016 and $210,000 in 2017 or 2) 60 percent of net
sales, whichever is greater. This is the staff recommendation.
2. Do not award a contract to ZoZo Group, LLC. This alternative is not recommended because the
contract amount proposed by ZoZo Group is new revenue for RTD, the proposal was received
through a competitive RFP process, and there is no indication that a higher revenue figure could be
obtained.

Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the recommended fare policy changes, as outlined in Attachment A, to take effect beginning
January 1, 2016.
BACKGROUND
In early 2014, RTD staff kicked off an extensive Fare Study including a multidisciplinary task force and a
consultant team led by national leaders in fare policy at CH2M HILL. The objective for the fare study
task force was to determine how to simplify RTD’s fare policies in an equitable and cost-effective
manner to better meet the needs of the District and its customers moving forward. There were five main
goals that the recommendation should achieve: be understandable, be implementable, be equitable,
achieve revenue levels set out in the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) and facilitate the integration of the
2016 rail and BRT projects.
RTD is unique among transit providers in that its service area covers a very large geographic area and
provides a diverse range of services to meet unique transportation needs for different areas of the
District. This has resulted in fare policies that are somewhat complicated to serve all of the different
service types. RTD has not changed fares since 2011 and has not made significant changes in the fare
structure in close to a decade. Therefore, a full fare study looking at ways to simplify the current fare
policies was a large undertaking that required input from the task force, the consultant team and the
RTD passengers.
Two rounds of preliminary outreach were conducted prior to developing a final recommendation. The
intent was to separate the study into three phases: structure, level and pass programs. The first round
of public outreach was targeted at problem identification to determine what issues exist with the current
policies. The next round of outreach was focused on getting feedback on potential structure options
without providing information on what the corresponding fare levels would be. Passengers made it clear
they were unable to provide meaningful feedback on fare structure options without understanding the
corresponding fare levels. As such, the first two phases of the study were combined and this
recommendation includes both changes in the fare structure and levels.
DISCUSSION
At the February 10, 2015 Operations and Customer Service Committee, RTD staff presented the
recommendation they planned to take to the public for formal feedback. That recommendation included
the elimination of fares zones and transfers and also included a general fare increase. The transfers were
proposed to be replaced with a day pass priced equivalent to a round trip.
Sixteen public hearings were held during March and April and information about the proposed changes
was provided on the RTD website. Customers had the opportunity to comment on the proposal at the

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.2

public hearings, via the website, or via a phone line and comment cards. A summary of participation and
the results of that outreach are summarized in Attachment B. An online survey was also available for
passengers to provide feedback to staff on the recommendation as well as to comment on the tradeoff
between service reductions and fare increases. Over 1,000 individuals responded to that survey and in
general the results are consistent with previous findings that customers prefer a fare increase as
compared to a reduction in service.
Many individuals that commented during the hearings and on the website indicated that proposing both
a significant fare structure change and an increase in fare levels at the same time was confusing. And,
not surprisingly, many of the comments focused on the hardship that will be brought upon with a fare
increase especially for low-income individuals, who rely the most on transit. However, many individuals
were able to provide insightful comments regarding the fare structure that were instrumental in helping
staff to refine the recommendation.
The introduction of a day pass priced at a round trip and available on board the bus received very
positive feedback. This will allow passengers to have the flexibility to make multiple trips on RTD in a
given day without paying more than they would for one round trip. However, a few individuals
expressed a desire to have the flexibility to make only one trip in a day that requires transfers without
having to pay double the fare. The revised recommendation includes the ability to get a transfer if a
passenger pays using a smart card once they are available. This will provide flexibility for passengers to
determine the best option for their travel on any given day.
One of the other major comments from the public outreach was that it did not seem equitable among
modes to allow all rail trips to be equivalent to a Local bus fare but still have Express and Regional bus
fares. As such, the recommendation has been modified to include two fare levels for both bus and rail.
The rail zone structure has been simplified from four to three zones and is shown in Attachment A. The
Express and Regional fare categories have been consolidated into one category to be referred to as
“Regional”. Simplified fare matrix tables have been developed for all bus routes that will be in the
Regional category, which will allow passengers taking short trips on Regional routes to pay a Local fare.
There were also multiple comments regarding the increase on Access-a-Ride fares being too high since
they are priced at twice the comparable cash fare. The proposal has been modified to set the Access-aRide fare at twice the proposed smart card “stored value” fare instead of the regular cash fare. At this
time and into the foreseeable future, Access-a-Ride vehicles are not equipped to accept smart cards so
this will provide the same discount level to those passengers that they would be able to get if they could
pay with stored value.
As required by FTA for all fare changes, a Title VI equity analysis has been completed for the fare
changes outlined in Attachment A. No Title VI equity concerns were found with the recommended
changes per the RTD Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy. A summary of
the key findings are included in Attachment C. The equity analysis is currently under FTA review for
technical assistance to ensure the analysis methodology is compliant with FTA guidelines. Note that an
additional equity analysis will be required for the full implementation of smart card, including an
evaluation of the access to the retail distribution network.
The next phase of the study is to evaluate pass programs including low-income programs and Eco and
CollegePass programs. Further Title VI equity analysis will be required during this phase for pass
programs. This recommendation does not include any changes to current pass program pricing. During
the public feedback period, RTD heard from an organized coalition of the Mile High Connects Affordable
Fares Task Force requesting RTD to implement a widely available low-income discount fare. During the

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.2

next phase RTD will continue to collaborate with this group and other interested stakeholders on two
initiatives: 1. Determine how best to streamline RTD’s existing Non-Profit Agency Reduced Fare Program
and 2. Evaluate the feasibility and timeline for implementing a fiscally sustainable low-income discount
program.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The fare policy changes outlined in Attachment A are forecast to generate enough revenue to meet the
$131.3 million revenue target identified for 2016 in the 2014 Board adopted Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP).
These projections assume a price increase in EcoPass and CollegePass pricing in accordance with current
policies. This proposal would result in an approximately 12 to 13 percent increase in contract pricing per
the current agreements. A full evaluation of pass programs including the financial impacts of changes to
EcoPass, CollegePass and the non-profit agency program will be completed during the next phase that is
already underway and expected to continue in the next several months.
ALTERNATIVES
1) Adopt the proposed 2016 fare policy changes as recommended in Attachment A. This is the
recommended alternative.
2) Adopt alternative fare policy changes for 2016. This is not recommended as an extensive
analysis was conducted to develop these policies that will both simplify the current fare structure
and achieve the SBP revenue targets.
3) Do not adopt any fare policy changes for 2016. This is not recommended as our current policies
do not achieve the SBP revenue targets and would require reductions in service levels. In
addition, the current policies will be difficult to implement with the opening of the new services in
2016.

AIRPORT SERVICE (SKYRIDE) FOR CHILDREN
Preliminary Recommendation: Eliminate the current policy of allowing free trips on SkyRide
for children 15 and under (up to 3 children) when accompanied by an adult fare-paying
passenger. Apply current children fare policies to the Airport service so children age 5 and
under ride for free while children 6-18 would pay the half fare student rate consistent with
other RTD services.
Final Recommendation: No changes from preliminary recommendation.
SENIORRIDE FARES
Preliminary Recommendation: Maintain the current fare policies that the fares on
SeniorRide and the SeniorShopper services correlate with the half fare discount on regular
compare fixed route cash fares.
Final Recommendation: No changes from preliminary recommendation.
SPECIAL SERVICE FARES
Preliminary Recommendation: Continue the current policy of pricing special services
(BroncosRide, RockiesRide, etc) equivalent to the prevailing fare of the comparable fixed
route service (Local, Express, Regional) serving similar locations. This approach continues
to comply with the FTA charter regulations.
Final Recommendation: No changes from preliminary recommendation.
BUS FARE STRUCTURE
Preliminary Recommendation: Maintain Local, Express and Regional bus fare levels.
Require all passengers on Regional bus routes to pay the Regional fare.
Final Recommendation: Consolidate the Express and Regional fare levels and set price
equivalent to the proposed Express fare level. Refer to the consolidated fare category as
Regional. Allow passengers to pay a Local fare on short trips on Regional routes.

Fare increases would disproportionately affect people with disabilities, seniors, lowincome riders and other vulnerable populations relying on the RTD system.
If these proposed fare changes are approved, RTD will have the highest Local bus
fare in the country.
Please round fares to $2.50 and $5; no one carries dimes.
RTD should increase ridership to get more revenue instead of raising fares.
RTD should implement a low-income fare like Seattle’s.
Proposed monthly pass increases are too high.
Raise EcoPass prices to offset other fare increases.
Day passes are a good idea.
There should be creative and innovative solutions to allow RTD to provide the same
service levels without fare increases.
RTD should not increase fares without a 50 percent discount fare and pass program
for low-income riders who have income less than 150 percent of the federal
poverty level.
AARP is concerned about a fare increase for individuals between the ages of 50
and 64 who do not qualify for the senior discount and low-income members.
There is inconsistency in the percentage increases of different fares.
The fare proposal disproportionately affects Denver County residents who are
transit dependent.
Medicaid should be included as an eligibility option of the half-fare discount and not
just Medicare.

RTD is a public entity and should not have nonprofits bear the financial
responsibility of providing discounted fares for low-income individuals.
People riding the light rail in multiple zones will get a decrease in fares and people
in Denver are getting an increase.
RTD should continue its dialogue with the Mile High Connects coalition to develop a
solution for this complex low-income pass issue.
The current schedule has a tight turnaround between the end of the public
comment period and the final staff recommendation presentation to the Board,
which is unfair to the public.
RTD should consider a 10-ride day pass book.
Access-a-Ride passengers should not have to pay double the regular fare.
RTD should consider eliminating the Express fare category and putting Express
buses into the Regional category to further simplify its structure.
The proposal unfairly benefits those who are financially well-off.
RTD should figure out an opportunity to charge for parking at stations.
RTD should consider charging more for the airport trip so tourists contribute more.
RTD should consider turnstiles or a better way to enforce rail fares.
I don’t understand why Denver still uses paper transfers.
The proposed airport fares are too high.
BRT should be priced by where you get on, regardless of where you get off or
which route a passenger is taking.
Higher fares will force people to drive, which will have a negative impact on the
environment.
Flattening rail fares is not equitable (not distance-based).
Misuse of transfers has caused a lot of problems.
Disparate fares for rail and buses are not equitable (local for rail, regional for bus).
EcoPasses should be available for individual purchase.
Transfer elimination discriminates against one-way riders.
DIA workers should have access to an affordable fare.
CU-Boulder believes there are more equitable ways for RTD to reach its revenue
targets.
The Boulder Chamber of Commerce supports the position statement of the U.S. 36
Mayors and Commissioners Coalition and 36 Commuting Solutions.
The Boulder Chamber of Commerce concurs with the City of Boulder: Investment in
the U.S. 36 BRT project should include equitable fares, which should apply across
the system regardless of whether people are served by train or BRT.
The Boulder City Manager supports the points made in the city’s letter to RTD and
the comments provided by the U.S. 36 Mayors and Commissioners coalition and 36
Commuting Solutions.
Executive director of Boulder Transportation Connections calls on RTD to price U.S.
36 fares the same to match proposed rates on rail corridors.

The 33 percent increase, from $79 to $104, for a monthly pass is unfair compared
to the 16 percent increase from $2.25 to $2.60 for a one-way local cash fare.
RTD should implement parking fees at all park-n-rides instead of raising fares.
People understand distance-based fares; charge more the farther you travel,
including DIA, except for airport employees.
RTD should offer a discounted, summer family pass so people can get to
entertainment venues.
I would like to see RTD offer an affordable monthly pass for Access-a-Ride users.
Mile High Connects Executive Director Dace West says: How can you hear this kind
of testimony and philosophically say there’s no space in giving deeper, fuller
consideration to what affordability can really mean for RTD’s biggest customer
base, low-income riders. West encourages RTD to take the feedback from these
public hearings in a really serious, thoughtful and meaningful way and to dig a little
deeper to get to some of the solutions folks have been talking about.

Summary of Comments—Phone Comment Line
RTD received 57 phone messages about the Fare Study. Affordability and equity drew the
most interest with 41 comments. People also asked RTD not to eliminate transfers (8);
said airport fares would be too high for DIA employees (6); and opposed the elimination of

1.B.2.a

The recommended fare changes did not result in any Title VI equity concerns per the RTD
Board adopted Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Policy which states that the
impacts of a change in fares on low-income and minority riders should be within plus or
minus five percent when compared to all riders. To complete the fare equity analysis, the
average fare per trip was calculated for each type of fare media for all RTD passengers
(overall population) and those average fares were compared to the average fares for lowincome and minority riders. The equity analysis is under FTA review for technical
assistance to ensure the analysis methodology is compliant with FTA guidelines. The key
findings are described below and a table showing a summary of the results is also
provided.
1. When viewing the fare change from a total system perspective, the average fare for
the proposed change for the overall riders is $2.74, for low-income riders it is $2.72
(one percent lower), and for minority riders it is $2.81 (three percent higher).
2. As a whole, low-income and minority populations experienced a 14 percent increase in
their average fare per trip, compared with a 13 percent increase experienced by the
overall rider population.
3. Low-income riders experienced slightly smaller increase in some fare categories (Cash
and Day Pass Discount) which account for about 16 percent of the low-income
population. Minority riders experience slightly smaller increases in one fare category
(Cash Full Fare) which accounts for 7 percent of the minority population. In all cases,
differences of the increases are within 1-2 percent of the overall population’s average
fare.
4. Twenty-four percent of minority riders experience the same increase as the overall rider
population. About 56 percent of low-Income populations experience the same increase
as the overall rider population.
5. Minority riders experience slightly higher increases in some fare categories (Stored
Value, Day Pass and Monthly pass) than overall riders, which accounts for 61 percent
of the minority population. In these cases, the differences are within 1-4 percent of the
overall population’s average fare.
6. As highlighted in dark red the table below, two fare categories resulted in the overall
riders experiencing a much better outcome than minority populations.
a. Stored Value Discount fares resulted in a nine percent decrease for overall
riders, but a one percent decrease for minority populations. However, this is not
considered to be a concern since this is for a very small percentage of the
population (0.4% or 123,500 riders).
b. Day Pass Discount resulted in a nine percent higher fare under the proposal, but
the minority population’s average fare was 15 percent higher. This impact is

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: May 19, 2015

Subject:

Proposed August 2015 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two proposals implementing service at new facilities slated to be open in time for the August service
change. Boulder Junction at Depot Square (33rd – Pearl Street) is scheduled to be opened with
accompanied changes to existing route services: HX and S. Central Park Station Bus Plaza and park-nRide will replace the existing Stapleton park-n-Ride with accompanied changes to existing route services:
28, 38, 40, 43, 65, 73, 88, 89, 105, and AS. We will monitor customer response to the implementation
of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future
service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

1.C.1.a

Route 1 – West 1st Avenue
An all-day vehicle is proposed to be added to Route 1, due to the proposal on the Route
26, which results in a break of the interline between Route 1 and 26. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $165,300 annualized.
Route 1W – West 1st Avenue
In conjunction with the discontinuance of the Route 9 school tripper, it is proposed to
reroute Route 1W to operate on Knox Ct between 6th Ave and 10th Ave, 10th Ave between
Knox Ct and Decatur St, and Decatur St between 8th Ave and 10th Ave. The remaining
route will be unchanged. Route 1W will be scheduled to arrive at West High School at
7:20am and depart at 3:40pm. Anticipated cost estimated to be $2,600 annualized.
Route 3L – East Alameda Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/ North Pecos
It is proposed to realign Route 6 to stay on Navajo St between 32nd Ave and 34th Ave.
Drainage has been improved in this area and the street is no longer a hazard in freezing
temperatures. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 8 – North Broadway / Huron
It is proposed to return the southbound terminal of Route 8 to 13th/Welton during weekday
evenings and on weekends. It is also proposed to discontinue Route 8 service to Denver
Water, with all trips terminating at 13th/Welton. Service to Denver Water is proposed to be
provided by an improved Route 34 (proposed Route 33). Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $31,000 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue the Route 9 school tripper starting at
Lakewood-Wadsworth Station at 6:22am. Cost savings are estimated to be $13,000
annualized.
Route 9 - West 10th Avenue
Route 26 – West 26th Avenue
Route 28 – 28th Avenue
Route 76 _ Wadsworth Crosstown
This proposal recombines Routes 26 and 28 at Wadsworth Boulevard. Additionally, the
western terminus for the Route 9 would be moved from the Lakewood-Wadsworth Station

Route 0 – South Broadway
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve connections with Routes 15 and 16
during late night periods in the Downtown area. No cost impacts are anticipated.

1.C.1.a

Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 12 – Downing/North Washington
Discontinue 6:07pm southbound trip from Corona/Colfax to Englewood Station. Trip
averages between 8-14 boardings per hour. This proposal reduces frequency south of
Colfax from every 15 to every 30 minutes between 6:00pm and 6:30pm. A reroute
northbound buses to remain on Downing Street at the 30th & Downing LRT Station is also
proposed. The northbound stop at 29th Avenue is very convenient to the station platform.
This proposal reduces travel time by approximately 3 minutes and eliminates a very
difficult left turn from California Street onto Downing. Anticipated cost savings are
estimated to be $8,200 annualized.
Route 15 – East Colfax
Route 15L – East Colfax Limited
Route 20 – 20th Avenue
Discontinue Route 15 deviation into the Anschutz Medical Campus.
Route
averages approximately one boarding or alighting per trip on weekdays, and only one
boarding or alighting for every 3 bus trips weekends. Route 20 will continue to provide
direct campus service (see below).
Discontinue Route 15 deviation south of Colfax via Sable, 13th Avenue, and
Chambers Road. Area is well served by Route 15L on Sable and Route 153 on Chambers
Road. Also discontinue loop via Chambers, 17th Avenue, and Jasper Street.
Extend Route 15 directly east on Colfax Avenue, continuing east to Himalaya
Street, replacing Route 15L Tower Road branch. Route 15 service to Tower Road will
include Saturday/Sunday/holidays, as elimination of deviations should allow this extension
at no additional operating cost. (Note: Saturday service will be every 15 minutes as far
east as Billings Street, then every 30 minutes to Tower Road. Sunday/holiday service will
be every 30 minutes).
Route 15L Tower Road branch trips will be cut back to terminate/originate at
Colfax/Billings (East Metro Garage). Service east of Sable Blvd. is replaced by extended
Route 15. Current Route 15L service to Centrepoint & Sable will remain unchanged.
Extend Route 20 from 16th/Aurora Court adjacent to University of Colorado
Hospital to Colfax/Billings. Provides direct connection between the hospital and upcoming
R-Line Light Rail service at the Colfax Station.

to 14th and Zephyr. Additional Sunday service is proposed to be added to Route 76 to
maintain an appropriate service frequency along Wadsworth Boulevard in Lakewood.
Anticipated net cost savings is estimated to be $195,000 annualized

1.C.1.a

Reroute eastbound Route 20 trips coming from Lakewood to use Market Street
instead of Wazee Street, between Auraria Parkway and 17th Street. Provides faster
travel time for most riders while still providing good access to Lower Downtown.

Overall project cost:
Weekdays = $51,700 annualized
Saturdays = $25,280 annualized (for Route 20)
Sundays/holidays = $28,200 annualized (for Route 20)
Total = $105,180
Route 21 – Evans Avenue
To provide more direct service, it is proposed to reroute Route 21 onto Jewell Ave
between Federal Blvd and Sheridan Blvd. Additionally, Route 21 would be rerouted to use
Monroe Street (3 blocks west of Colorado Blvd.) instead of Colorado Boulevard, between
Evans Avenue and Buchtel Drive. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 27 – Yale Avenue
It is proposed to reroute Route 27 in Englewood to serve The Foundry development north
of Dartmouth Ave and west of Elati St. Regular service will be discontinued on Broadway
between Yale Ave and Englewood Pkwy and between Broadway and Inca St. Selected
trips from Porter and Craig hospitals will remain on Englewood Pkwy. Service from Yale
Ave & Broadway will then operate on Yale Ave, Elati St, Bates Ave, Galapago St,
Dartmouth Ave, and Inca St. Service to Englewood Station will be maintained.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 30 – South Federal
It is proposed to move the Route 30 school trippers operating between Sheridan Blvd and
Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride to become part of Route 51. These trips will now
start and end at Dartmouth/Lamar. The afternoon school tripper is proposed to end at
Alameda. The morning school tripper is proposed to start at Alameda. Cost impacts
anticipated to be an estimated $2,580 annualized.
Route 30L – Federal Boulevard Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost impact anticipated.
Route 31 – Federal Boulevard
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed during the early morning and late night periods
to better coordinate connections with Route 16. It is proposed to move the afternoon
northbound school tripper to start at Federal/Evans at 3:21pm from 3:17pm.

Routes 8 and 34 it is proposed to restructure Route 34 as Route 33 to operate as a bidirectional loop serving the destinations on the current Route 34, Denver Water, the Sun
Valley neighborhood, Decatur-Federal Station, and Colfax at Auraria Station. From
Alameda Station, Route 33 clockwise is proposed to operate on Virginia Ave, Bannock St,
Alameda Ave, Platte River Dr, Bayaud Ave, Tejon St, 2nd Ave, Bryant St, 7th Ave, Canosa
Ct, 8th Ave, Decatur St, Holden Pl, Federal Blvd, Colfax Ave, Mariposa St, 13th Ave,
Quivas St, 12th Ave, through Denver Water, Seminole Rd, Osage St, 3rd Ave, Galapago St,
Ellsworth Ave, and Cherokee St. Counter-clockwise would operate on the same streets in
reverse order, except for using Howard Pl between Federal Blvd and Decatur St. Service is
proposed every 45 minutes, peak hours only. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated
$93,000 annualized.
Route 36Ltd – Fort Logan: Minor schedule adjustments
Route 36L – Fort Logan Limited
This proposal re-aligns the service in the downtown area to be routed along Stout Street in
the place of Welton Street, but utilizes the same terminal at 22nd Champa. This new
alignment should provide more consistent operation of this service, thereby improving ontime performance. No cost anticipated.
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Blvd./Gateway
Improve weekday peak period frequency east of Montbello Park-n-Ride to Airport & 40th
Park-n-Ride from every 30 to every 15 minutes, 6:00-8:30am and 3:00-6:00pm. Results
in better load distribution, allows elimination of Route 43/65 school trippers east of
Stapleton Park-n-Ride (at substantial savings).
Cost anticipated to be an estimated $31,000 annualized.
Route 50 – Lakes Crosstown
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to improve on-time performance. No cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard
It is proposed to move the Route 30 school trippers operating between Sheridan Blvd and
Wadsworth & Hampden Park-n-Ride to become part of Route 51. These trips will now
start and end at Dartmouth/Lamar. Minor schedule adjustments are proposed.
No cost impacts are anticipated.

Route 66 – Arapahoe Road
The first Saturday/Sunday/holiday morning westbound trip, presently originating at
Arapahoe Station at 6:33am, would be extended to instead originate at Arapahoe Crossing
at 6:07am under this proposal. Anticipated cost is estimated to be $7,250 annualized.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown

Route 79L – South Quebec Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance issues, no cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 80– 80th Avenue Crosstown
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance issues, no cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale Limited
Minor schedule adjustments are proposed to address on-time performance issues, no cost
impacts are anticipated.
Route 85 – Chatfield Avenue
Due to few through riders, it is proposed to create Route 85 consisting of the parts of
Route 401 west of Mineral Station. Span of service, frequency, and trips will remain
unchanged. This will provide clarity to where buses are traveling and allow better
monitoring of the route. No cost impacts are anticipated.
Route 100 – Kipling Street
Due to low ridership, it is proposed to discontinue the Route 100 school tripper starting at
Federal Center Station at 3:23 pm. Minor schedule adjustments are proposed. Cost
savings is estimated to be $12,600 annualized.

Route 52 – West 52nd Avenue / South Bannock
It is proposed to reroute Route 52 to stay on Navajo St between 32nd Ave and 34th Ave.
Drainage has been improved in this area and the street is no longer a hazard in freezing
temperatures. Minor schedule adjustments are also proposed. No anticipated cost impacts.

Route 120 – 120th Avenue
This proposal increases the morning and evening peak frequency on weekdays from hourly
to service every 30 minutes between US 36 Broomfield and Wagon Road Park-n-Ride.
Current ridership performance on this service ranges from 16 to 30 passengers per hour
during the peak period in the segment to be improved and 16.6 passengers per hour
overall. Anticipated cost is estimated to be $62,000 annualized.
Route 131 – Iliff Avenue
Add later morning westbound trips, arriving Nine Mile Station at 9:43am and 10:13am.
Also add earlier afternoon trips eastbound from Nine Mile Station at 2:26pm and 2:56pm.
providing service for school dismissal times, especially Rangeview High School.
Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $8,300 annualized.
Route 225/225D/225E – Boulder/Broomfield via Baseline & US 287
It is proposed to add one west-bound short-turn trip, in the AM peak at about 8:30am in
order to alleviate the overloads and pass-ups caused due to ridership from the homeless
shelter in addition to CU ridership. Trip would start at Baseline Road/Manhattan Road.
Anticipated cost impact is estimated to be $5,200 annualized.
Route 401 – Highlands Ranch/Mineral
Due to few through riders, it is proposed to split Route 401 at Mineral Station. The
western portion will become Route 85 and the eastern portion will remain Route 401.
Span of service, frequency, and trips will remain unchanged. This will provide clarity to
where buses are traveling and allow better monitoring of the route. Minor schedule
adjustments are proposed. No anticipated cost impacts.
Route AA – Wagon Road/DIA
This proposal matches weekend trip times to weekday trip times to allow for schedule
consistency for customers. No anticipated cost impacts.
Route B – Boulder/Denver
Schedule adjustments are proposed, due to the progression of US 36 HOV construction
resulting in reduced running time. No anticipated cost impacts.
Belmar Call-n-Ride
The Belmar Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line.
The Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm. The Call-n-Ride has not met
the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The Call-n-Ride currently has one all
day bus, 5:30am – 7:00pm and one peak bus, 6:00am-9:00am and 3:00pm – 6:00pm. It
is recommended to discontinue the peak bus. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$82,038 in annual costs, which include fuel.

Golden Call-n-Ride
The Golden Call-n-Ride began operating in April 2013 with the opening of the West Line
under a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality Improvement Grant (CMAQ) sponsored by the
City of Golden, the Colorado School of Mines and the RTD. The Call-n-Ride operates one
vehicle as a Flex Route and two vehicles as a non-flex route Call-n-Ride on weekdays. The
Call-n-Ride operates Monday-Friday 5:30am – 8:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 11:00pm.
On Saturday, the Call-n-Ride operates one vehicle as a Call-n-Ride. The Saturday Call-nRide has not met the RTD Service Standard of three boarding per hour. The hours
between 7:00pm and 11:00pm carry less than one customer per hour. This
recommendation is to end the service day at 7:00pm. Anticipated savings are estimated to
be $11,152 in annual costs, which include fuel.
Route HX – 28th Street/Civic Center
With the opening of Boulder Junction at Depot Square Transit Center, it is proposed to
extend route HX into the new facility, from its current terminal at Pearl Street/29th Street.
No cost impacts are anticipated.
Light Rail: E Line – Lincoln/Union Station
It is proposed to add one train in each direction in the AM and PM peak periods (7:24 AM
northbound from Lincoln Station, 7:14 AM southbound from Union Station, 5:09 PM northbound
from Lincoln Station, and 4:28 PM southbound from Union Station). This continues to assist
with increasing ridership demand to/from Union Station and W Line transfers as well as increased
school ridership in the fall. This proposal also advances the eventual goal of 15-minute E Line
frequencies in the entire AM and PM peak periods. Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be
$189,000 annualized.
Light Rail: E Line and F Line
It is proposed to adjust late morning pullins and early afternoon pullouts to provide more efficient
service between Lincoln Station and downtown. This proposal has marginal impacts to
passengers; service levels would remain the same. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.
Light Rail: H Line – Nine Mile/Downtown
It is proposed to discontinue the 2:18 AM southbound trip from downtown on late Friday and
Saturday nights. This trip was added in August 2014 as a “clean up” trip through downtown
after the other late night trains, but has resulted in comparatively lower ridership than its D Line
and E Line counterpart trips. Approximately 34 boardings would be affected that would need to
take a train approximately 10 minutes earlier. The northbound trip from 1:36 AM between Nine
Mile and I-25 & Broadway Station would be retained. Anticipated savings are estimated to be
$30,500 annualized.

South Jeffco Call-n-Ride
The South Jeffco Call-n-Ride began operating in January 2012.
The Call-n-Ride was
funded under a Job Access Reverse Commute grant. The Call-n-Ride operates MondayFriday 5:30am – 10:00pm and Saturdays 8:00am – 10:00pm. The weekday Call-n-Ride
operates with four peak vehicles. One vehicle operates a flex route to Lockheed Martin
operating two trips in the am and two in the pm. This flex route has not met the RTD
Service Standard of three boardings per hour. This recommendation is to discontinue the
Lockheed Martin Flex route and move the resources to the weekday Call-n-Ride service.
With these additional resources, changes will be made to the weekday service delivery
model in order to make the weekday Call-n-Ride a more reliable service to the customer.
The Way To Go program will look at providing a vanpool as an alternative for the Lockheed
Martin customers. No anticipated cost impact.
School Service
Implement seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F.
