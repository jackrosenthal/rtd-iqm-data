## II. Discuss Current Executive Director Job Description/Possible Updates

Committee Chair Tobiassen provided the initial review of the agenda. Interim General Manager Genova indicated that we have a number of retirees including Marla Lien we are awaiting to see if any of them plan to be present.

Motion:              Chair Tobiassen made the motion to approve the discussion of Paula Perdue’s retirement and determining next steps in moving the process forward in finding a replacement.

Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Chair Tobiassen said he would like to set up the guiding principles in supporting the Board office and in finding a suitable replacement for Paula Perdue.  Chair indicated that he would like this to be a quick turnaround and that the process be inclusive and transparent.  He asked Barbara McManus to send an electronic copy of the current job description to all Board members for review and comments should be forwarded to the Chair for further discussion.

Director Deadwyler asked if there would be a committee appointed to engage in the process.  Chair Tobiassen said the full Board elected the executive committee and he felt they would be the best choice as the hiring committee with the idea that all Directors would weigh in on the process as we move forward.

Director Hoy asked if there would be an advantage to utilize RTD Senior Leadership, Interim General Manager Genova as well as Barbara McManus and Erin Klaas in a supporting role.

Director Francone asked what the actual reporting structure was for the Executive Director.  Chair Tobiassen said the Executive Director actually reports to the Chair of the Board and the Board office team was managed by the Board of Directors through the Chair as well.

Director Anderson said she believed that the Executive Director and the Board office team should not report to the Board but should report to Dave Genova.  Director Sisk was in agreement

Chair Tobiassen said the task of hiring the Board staff was a Board responsibility and he would not be making any changes in that structure.  He also reminded all that we do utilize the hiring process used by the Agency.

Director Deadwyler said this team has been treated like step children and she has fought to give them respect.  They deserve the best and we need to get them the support they need and make them feel more inclusive.

Director Francone asked if there was a way to expedite the process as she knows there have been challenges in getting and retaining temporary help.  Barbara McManus said the agency has allowed us to go out of contract and utilize additional temporary agencies to find candidates with the skill set needed.  She also explained the job market as a whole in Denver is a challenge and unemployment is very low so we have quite a lot of competition.

Interim General Manager Genova agreed that they would like to see more integration of the Board office team to the agency.  Interim General Manager Genova said he recognizes the work the Board office does, which is why he presented them with an Outstanding Team Achievement award last year at the employee recognition event in 2015.

Director Deadwyler said now is our chance to make an impact and implement some needed changes.

Chair Tobiassen asked that the Board members work together on the Executive Director job description as a team.  He said we are just at the starting point but sees this process moving fairly quickly with the confidence that the Board office operations will maintain continuity of service to the Board.  Director Deadwyler asked that the full Board be sent the current job description for review and suggested meeting weekly to get the ball rolling and get to the end point as soon as possible.

Director Archuleta asked how quickly we think we can get the process completed.  Chair Tobiassen said he thought 2 weeks to pull together the new job description for approval before we start the process with HR.

Director Deadwyler asked if we could find someone to do the minutes, perhaps the IGM’s assistant or perhaps having a facilitator to help in the process.

Chair Tobiassen outlined some of the process in working to fill the position.  He indicated once the job description was put together we would need to decide some of the following:

- Recruit internally and/or extend to an external search.

- How long to advertise the position

- What criteria do we utilize in eliminating candidates

- The interview process

Director Deadwyler suggested the Executive committee make the recommendation to have the process completed in 45 days.

Chair Tobiassen recommended that Barbara McManus be appointed as Acting Executive Director and Erin Klaas be appointed Acting Board Office Administrator until the recruitment process is completed and we have an active replacement.
