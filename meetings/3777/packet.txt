STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) and
annual budget. The provision of the Forecast Model Report is followed by a presentation to the Board by
CU Leeds.
DISCUSSION
The March 2025 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2026-2030 FYFF. The September
2025 sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2026 Proposed Budget. The attached March
2025 Forecast Model Report reflects a change from the September 2024 forecast in RTD’s sales and
use taxes as follows:

Forecasts may be too high or too low, reflecting uncertainty in the
economy.
Forecasts are generated from theoretically sound economic relations,
modeled with state-of-the-art methods of modern econometric time

BRD forecasts do not incorporate “add factors” or other subjective
adjustments of model forecasts.
BRD is independent from RTD with no political or financial stake in the

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Economic growth softened in 2024, but when examining GDP, income, and employment, the
economy remained on a stable footing. National GDP grew 2.8% for the year, and at an annualized
rate of 2.3% in Q4 2024. National employment increased by 2.1 million jobs in 2024, up 1.3%;
personal income rose 5.4%; inflation increased 2.9% for the full year; and the Fed cut the federal
funds rate by 100 basis points (1%). Consumption cooled in Colorado, and RTD recorded a flattening
of sales and use tax collections that are likely to persist in 2025 before beginning to rebound in 2026.
The 2025 economic outlook is clouded by uncertainty around the impacts of tariffs, a federal
restructuring, interest rates, and inflation, leading to an expectation of slower economic growth in
2025 and 2026.
Figure 1

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
by age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•

•
•

Economic measurement largely reflects history—activity that has already occurred. GDP is
reported through Q4 2024; personal income is available through January 2025; and
employment, inflation, and retail sales are available through February 2025. While so much
attention has been on the impact of tariffs and the federal structuring, few economic
datapoints have had time to measure the effects. Some leading, but imperfect, indicators
include consumer and business confidence surveys, the equity markets, surveys of
purchasing managers, building permits, and others.
Inflation remained below 3% in the second half of the year, and full-year price growth came
in just under 3% (2.9%).
Other economic conditions continue to indicate expansion: GDP, employment, wages,
personal income, consumption, and retail sales.

Executive Summary

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•
•

Based on Moody’s Analytics’ S2 scenarios, real (inflation-adjusted) GDP is projected to
increase 0.9% in 2025. National retail sales are projected to grow 0.9% in 2025.
Nationally and locally, employment continued to post new record levels in 2024 and the
start of 2025, albeit at slowing rates. Colorado employment growth slowed to 1.1% in 2024,
ranking the state 15th nationally.

RTD sales and use tax revenue declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but grew
19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022. Revenue growth slowed in 2023 to 0.3%, to total $858.1
million, and declined by a small margin in 2024 (-0.1%, -721,777) due to a decrease in use
taxes. Revenue is projected to decrease in 2025 by 0.7% then return to growth of 2.8% in
2026.
The Q3 and Q4 2024 revenue was squarely within the confidence bound presented in
September 2024.
Colorado employment is projected to post flat-to-modest growth in 2025 and 2026 under
the modeled scenario. Personal income continues to grow moderately for the next two
years but underperforms inflation.
Indicating loosening in the tight labor market, the national unemployment rate was 4.1% in
February 2025, remaining at or above 4% for 10 consecutive months. The unemployment
rate in Colorado was 4.7% in January 2025.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The 67% upperand lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind economic conditions that
pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast. The mean forecast for 2025 of
$851 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $797 million on the low side and
$903 million for the upper bound. The mean forecast for 2026 is $875 million, with a lower
bound of $800 million and an upper bound of $947 million.
Notable local headwinds include slow net migration; high office vacancy and commercial
real estate loans coming due in 2025, which eventually will result in markdowns for regional
banks; household credit delinquencies; and depleted housing savings. Macroeconomic
headwinds include tariffs, the federal restructuring, immigration policy, and consumer
confidence.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 81
times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.83%.
RTD Government Relations did not report pending or recently enacted legislation that would
have a direct impact on RTD sales and use tax collection as of March 20, 2025.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

•

•

•

•
•

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
The BRD selected the Moody’s S2 scenario as the underlying macroeconomic condition
applied to the RTD baseline forecast. This scenario is constructed with a 75% probability that
the economy performs better and a 25% probability that it performs worse. The research
team believed this scenario more adequately captures some of the present economic
uncertainty and risks than Moody’s Baseline scenario.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 26.6%
between 2024 and 2030, reaching $1.1 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon. The
March 2025 medium-term forecast is lower than the September 2024 forecast.
A more optimistic scenario, under which the national economy experiences faster growth,
yields cumulative revenues 2.7% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon, and the 2030 total is 1.4% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 3.6% below the baseline scenario.
Climate change is a direct assumption within the Moody’s Analytics scenario. According to
Moody’s, “The baseline forecast includes climate change assumptions that are consistent
with a weighted average of the assumptions underpinning a range of scenarios, including
those from the Network for Greening the Financial System.”

Long-Term Outlook
•

•
•

After average annual revenue growth rates of 4.9% for the 10-year period ending in 2025 (in
current, nominal dollars), revenue projections for the next three decades average 2.9%
(2026–2035), 2.5% (2036–2045), and 3.2% (2046–2055); the 30-year average is 2.9% (2026–
2055).
The long-term forecast generally moderated in the March 2025 update.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since the project’s inception, the
BRD research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
For this update, RTD revenue data was available through January 2025; state retail sales and state
taxable sales were available through December 2024; and District taxable sales were available
through December 2024. Data after these dates represent forecasts. Revenue from medical and
retail marijuana sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were necessary to
accommodate the gap year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections caused by
Senate Bill 17-267. As such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax revenues
excluding retail marijuana taxes. Therefore, these data are actual RTD taxable sales excluding
marijuana sales. However, the forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the forecasts of
RTD retail marijuana revenues. This construction was necessary to produce a series without the
discontinuity over the period from July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable revenue
forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. The category was merged with All Other General
Merchandise Stores in 2022. This broader category represented 8.5% of the total sales taxes
collected in 2023.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2024), medium term (2030), and long term (2055).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% in 2021 and 13% in 2022, but revenue growth slowed sharply in 2023 (0.3%) and
2024 (-0.8%). Growth is expected to remain stagnant in 2025 with a decline of 0.7%, before returning
to growth of 2.8% in 2026.
All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in March 2024, with much of the data current through Q4 2024. RTD revenue data were
provided through January 2025, and state retail sales and taxable sales data were current through
December 2024. Some data have a longer lag (e.g., state GDP is available through Q3 2024). All
reported data after these dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the S2 Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show an economy that continues to grow, with
the exception of stagnant job growth in 2025. The rising unemployment rate signals a loosening
labor market, with the rate rising from 3.2% in 2023 to 3.9% in 2024, 5% in 2025, and 5.8% in 2026.
Personal income grows at a decreasing rate, slowing from 5.1% in 2023 to 4.9% in 2024, 3.6% in
2025, and 2.4% in 2026. While the state recorded nominal and real (inflation-adjusted) income
growth in 2024, rising inflation will erode real growth in personal income in the short term. The
Denver-Aurora-Lakewood consumer price index is projected to re-accelerate in 2025 and remain
elevated in 2026. (A longer note about inflation can be found in Appendix A.)

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in
2021 and 13.7% in 2022. District taxable retail sales slowed rapidly to 1% in 2023 and 0.5% in 2024.

Short-Term Forecasts

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Sales tax revenues change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020; rebounding 19.8% in 2021 and 13.2% in
2022; and slowing to 0.8% in 2023 and 0.4% in 2024. Revenue is projected to fall 1.1% in 2025
before increasing 1.9% in 2026. Note that the model uses RTD sales tax revenue (less marijuana
revenue) to impute taxable retail sales in the seven-county RTD district because retail marijuana is
no longer assessed at the 2.9% retail sales tax rate for the state. However, retail marijuana is taxed
1% for the special districts, leading to a difference in taxable sales and sales taxes.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district,
but those purchasing taxable goods outside the district, are required to pay a use tax on these
purchases at the same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in
2015, but increased 7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and
20.4% in 2020. Use taxes rebounded in 2021 and 2022, increasing 17% and 9.7%, but fell 5.8% in
2023 and 7% in 2024. The forecast calls for a rebound in 2025 (6.1%) and 2026 (15.5%). The volatility
of use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data. The rebound in use tax revenue likely
reflects modeled growth off the much smaller base of activity recorded for the past two years, but
there remain downside risks to equipment, vehicles, and building that could suppress growth.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2025. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $797 million and as
high as $903 million for 2025. The 2025 lower and upper bounds range –6.4% to +6.1% relative to
the medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2026 with greater uncertainty. The 2026
upper- and lower-bound estimates are -8.6% and +8.3% different than the medium baseline
forecast, showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic
that revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

Medium-Term Forecasts
Summary: The BRD short-term forecasting model is extended to produce forecasts over the time
horizon through 2030. Using different assumptions about the future course of the national economy,
three alternative projections are derived from the same equation specifications. Under the baseline
scenario, which leverages the S2 scenario from Moody’s Analytics, RTD total tax revenues are
projected to grow by 26.6% from the end of 2024 to 2030.
Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (6 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 28.4% increase from

2024-2030. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
through 2025, then converges. In the second alternative, in which the economy grows more slowly in
the short run, there is a 25.2% increase between 2024 and 2030, with slower growth recorded
through 2027. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2024 to 2030 illustrate the impact of
slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces cumulative (2024-2030)
revenue $159 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic scenario produces cumulative
revenue $210 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative scenarios allow for a reasonable
degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy and may be taken as plausible
bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2030. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The RTD baseline scenario was constructed using the Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 2 – Downside –
75th Percentile.” Moody’s S2 is constructed with a 75% probability that the economy performs
better and a 25% probability that it performs worse.
Scenario S2 presents a downside economic forecast with a 25% probability, characterized by several
key risks: worsened impacts from Trump-era tariffs and deportations causing inflation to rise in Q2
2025; credit-sensitive spending significantly weakened by elevated interest rates; a collapse of the
Hamas-Israel ceasefire and prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict; and China potentially blocking the
Taiwan Strait, impacting semiconductor supplies and triggering broader conflict and decreased
consumer/business confidence. These factors combine to cause a mild recession (1% peak-to-trough
decline) beginning in Q2 2025, lasting three quarters. Unemployment peaks at 7.1% in Q1 2026, and
the stock market falls 20% between Q1 2024 and Q4 2025. European economic decline hurts US
exports and corporate earnings. Although the Fed initially eases monetary policy, rising inflation
leads to rate hikes before resuming easing in Q3 2025. Fiscal policy largely mirrors the baseline but
features new tariffs, freezing non-defense spending, and a higher budget deficit (-7.6% in FY2025).
The economy recovers to full employment by Q2 2027, but real GDP remains below the baseline
indefinitely due to reduced business investment and lower productivity.

In this scenario, real GDP is expected to grow 0.9% in 2025 and 0.5% in 2026. Inflation rose 4.1% in
2023 and 3% in 2024. The CPI is projected to increase 3.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026. Employment is
projected to pull back slightly in 2025 and 2026 in this blended scenario.

RTD use tax revenue fell 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020 but rebounded 17% in 2021 and 9.7% in
2022. Use taxes decreased in 2023 by 5.8% and in 2024 by 7%, illustrating the volatility of this series.
An increase of 6.1% is projected in 2025, followed by 15.5% growth in 2026. Simple average growth
of 7% is projected over the medium-term forecast horizon through 2030. With 90% of RTD tax
revenues coming from sales taxes, the yearly changes in total revenues closely track those for
sales tax revenues.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 26.6% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2024 to 2030. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
The RTD Optimistic Scenario was constructed using Moody’s “Baseline Forecast”. There is a 50%
probability that the economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform.
Weaker near-term growth is expected due to policy uncertainty, but a stronger recovery is
anticipated for 2027. Monetary policy assumes the Fed will gradually lower interest rates to 3% by
late 2026. The 10-year Treasury yield is expected to average 4.4% in Q1 2025, declining to 4% by
2030. Global oil prices are lower, while U.S. natural gas prices are higher than expected. Tariff
assumptions have worsened due to increased tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico.
Federal employment is projected to decline by about 10% in 2025. The recent banking failures are
not seen as a systemic threat. Key risks include persistent inflation and job growth leading to
slower-than-expected interest rate cuts or rate hikes by the Fed; geopolitical instability affecting oil
prices and consumer confidence; unanticipated financial system weaknesses; and a potential wageprice spiral.
Real GDP grows 1.9% in 2025 and 1.7% in 2026. The unemployment rate increases to an average of
4.1% in 2025 and 4.3% in 2026. Retail sales are projected to grow 4% in 2025 and 2.9% in 2026 in
this scenario.

In this optimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues reach $1.1 billion in 2030, which is 1.4% above the
medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields revenue growth rates faster than
the baseline projections early in the forecast. Total revenues grow by 28.4% between 2024 and
2030. Cumulative revenues from 2024-2030 are 2.7%, or $159 million above the baseline scenario.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside” is constructed with a 90% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. Scenario S3 depicts a
severe downside economic forecast driven by significantly worse-than-expected consequences from
federal policies, leading to accelerating inflation. Elevated interest rates further weaken spending,
and the Fed raises rates in response. Geopolitical risks (prolonged Ukraine war, Hamas-Israel
conflict, potential China-Taiwan conflict) exacerbate the situation. In this scenario, the economy falls
into recession in 2025, with unemployment peaking at 8.3% in 2026. European economic weakness
and retaliatory tariffs compound the problem, causing a 35% stock market drop. The economy
begins to recover in early 2026 but doesn't reach full employment until Q1 2030. Fiscal policy largely
mirrors the baseline, but the larger deficit (-8.1% in FY2025) adds to uncertainty. The Fed initially
eases monetary policy but raises rates again due to inflation before resuming easing as the recession
persists. Real GDP remains below baseline levels indefinitely due to reduced investment and lower
productivity.
Real GDP is flat in 2025 and falls 0.7% in 2026 before returning to annual growth.

In this pessimistic scenario, total RTD tax revenues grow to nearly $1.1 billion in 2030, which is 1.1%
below the medium forecast under the baseline scenario. This scenario yields growth rates lower
than the baseline scenario from 2025-2027 (negative revenue growth through 2026), then faster
growth rates that exceed the baseline projections through 2030. Total revenues grow by 25.2%
between 2024 and 2030. Cumulative revenues from 2024-2030 are 3.6% below, or $210 million
lower than, the baseline scenario.

Summary across the Three Scenarios
In the baseline scenario, RTD revenue grows 26.6% to $1.09 billion in the medium term (through
2030). The pessimistic scenario presents slower growth early in the forecast horizon, followed by
faster growth, growing to $1.07 billion by 2030, netting 25.2% growth over the period. The
optimistic scenario records growth that results in an increase of 28.4% over the period, to $1.1
billion, outperforming growth early in the forecast horizon.
The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 2.5% in 2030, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 6.2% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

The baseline scenario presents the BRD’s most likely forecast for RTD tax revenues through 2030.
During this period, the economy faces short-term volatility that impacts RTD revenue. After 2025,
RTD revenue is expected to record moderate growth, achieving an overall increase of 26.6%
between 2024 and 2030, increasing to $1.1 billion in 2030.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: The March 2025 long-term forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the
forecast horizon, which slows in the final decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax
revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are projected to grow by 2.9% per year on average, while
the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is 0.5%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2026–2035, 2036–2045, and 2046–2055.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline
from 46.2% in 2010 to 43.9% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output
between now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 44.8% by 2055.
However, total population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real
output growth rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2016–2025 and from 2036–
2045. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2055.

The BRD’s projected rates of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next two
decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 0.6% average growth and the
Moody’s model projects 2% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales (Tables 23 and 24 report
rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).
Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

after 2030.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounded for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in

Forecast Evaluation
Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through January 2025, allowing for error
evaluation through the second quarter of 2024. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have
been above the actual revenue 81 times and below the actual revenue 94 times, and a simple
average of the error has been -0.83%, with a 4.4% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue
swings during and following the pandemic recession). The September 2024 forecast for Q3 and Q4
2024 were high by 3.4% and 0.9%, respectively, illustrating the slowdown in Colorado ahead of the
national retail environment. The 2025 and 2026 forecast was revised down in March 2025, as was
the medium-term forecast. There is no comparison for the 30-year forecast since the forecast
horizon was extended to 2055 in this update (previously 2050); however, the long-term forecast has
generally moderated.

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2025-2026), medium term (2030), and long term (2055). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office (SCO). The SDO forecasts are available through 2050, so the BRD create a univariate model to
extend state population by age five more years through 2055.Colorado economy forecasts are
derived from updated specifications of the Colorado Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left-hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the righthand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b
RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right-hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables (the @SEAS( ) terms), but only 3 of these were found to
have statistically significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the
other key variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore, the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts
in these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model

previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two
terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such
as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s forecasts of
national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term Colorado Economy
Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national variables for the longterm forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for converting forecasts of
real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation had an impact on the RTD forecast. The real-dollar RTD forecast is constructed as
nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous decade, the

inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually. Market disruptions and supply-chain
discord create additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. While price growth improved,
prices were stuck between 3% and 4% for 13 consecutive months before dropping below 3% in July
2024. Prices grew 2.8% year-over-year in February 2025.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual U.S. inflation that rose to 8% in 2022, 4.1% in
2023, and 2.9% in 2024; and a Denver metro area inflation rate of 8% in 2022, 5.2% in 2023, and
2.3% in 2024.
The medium-term inflation rate (consumer price index) is generated by the model. This is an
informational number, and is not a driving variable within the RTD revenue forecast. It is constructed
at a high level (overall price growth, not by component) using the relationships between local and
national inflation. It should be noted that for 11 of the past 15 years, the Denver MSA has recorded
higher rates of growth in prices than the national average, the MSA tied the national rate one year,
and had lower inflation three years (including in 2024). The housing component of CPI represents
45.1% of the basket of goods and services in the inflation measurement, and the Denver-AuroraLakewood region recorded 0.0% growth in housing inflation in January 2025 (compared to 3.9%
growth in the U.S. City Average). Confirming these local housing cost trends, the Federal Housing
Finance Agency’s All-Transactions Index ranked Colorado 47th in the country for home price growth
of 3.4% year-over-year in Q4 2024, lagging much of the country. In a March 18, 2025 article by
CoStar, the Denver MSA measured among the bottom of the major markets for multifamily rent
growth, recording 3.2% rent declines year-over-year.1 Likewise, the Apartment Association of Metro
Denver’s report shows rent compression in Q4 2024.2 Thus, if rents and home prices are softer in the
Denver MSA and the state than they are nationally, it is logical that the Denver MSA inflation could
remain below the national rate for longer than the model is estimating.

The Input Data—Sources and Description
This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.
National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these
indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.
Some key national indicators are:
•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The national and Colorado sales values are not seasonally
adjusted, and the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized to
show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at the
same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level of
trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2023, the opposite
was true.

The BRD team will continue to monitor the situation and may adjust expected inflation when
sufficient evidence emerges to suggest changing inflation expectations.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

•

National Income: U.S. GDP, personal income, and disposable income serve as common
indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters the
equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures allocated to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of
goods and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI
component that fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail
sales. This variable is included in the current specification of some equations in the
forecasting model. The CPI is also used to convert between nominal and real values of
personal income and retail sales.

•

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.
•

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag in the Quarterly
Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.
We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).
In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modeled and forecasted
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.

Because the survey only asks for total wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the
month, we cannot see an alternative method for obtaining monthly data by county. This
survey solicits information from the employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence,
so some wages leak out of the Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of
Colorado are sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources:

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework

However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.3 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting longterm economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:
•

•

•

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working-age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and is
negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,

Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.

1.C.1.b

•

which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working-age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
20555. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2024–2030 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2024 are
historical observations, while data from 2025 to 2055 represent forecasts.
The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.
National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. However, differences in population growth rates and age distribution
for the nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical
levels. The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income
growth in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing

growth of this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth
in Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and consequently, RTD taxable sales. On the other
hand, moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable
sales, offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other
sales and tax revenue variables.

Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and, therefore,
in sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.
Figure 11

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI
data are available, these may be less reliable than the national data due to smaller samples in the
price surveys.

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of the Economy

Summary: The U.S. economy showed resilience in 2024, but uncertainty looms as tariff policy
changes and geopolitical shifts threaten growth. Colorado added 33,500 jobs in 2024—the lowest
annual job growth in 20 years, excluding the Great Recession and COVID pandemic. Meanwhile, the
state's unemployment rate remains elevated. Colorado real GDP increased 1.7% year-over-year in Q3
2024, and at an annualized rate of 3.4% from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024.
Gross Domestic Product
National real GDP increased 2.8% in 2024, with real GDP increasing at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate (SAAR) of 2.3% in Q4 2024, down from 3.1% in Q3 2024. Personal consumption expenditures
showed resiliency, increasing by 4.2% in Q4 2024 and 3.7% in Q3 2024. Gross private domestic
investment fell 5.7% in Q4, the first decline since Q1 2023. Government consumption remained
generally strong in 2024; however, the trade deficit has been elevated in recent quarters. Real GDP
is expected to modestly increase in 2024 and 2025. In Q3 2024 (newest available data), Colorado’s
real GDP increased at an annualized rate of 3.4% quarter-over-quarter (ranked 20th) and 1.7% yearover-year (ranked 38th).
Figure 18: United States Real Gross Domestic Product

Confidence
National consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, has generally been rising
since hitting a low in July 2022, despite consumer confidence becoming more volatile in 2024 and
the start of 2025. In February 2025, the index was 6.5 points lower than in February 2024, and fell 7
points month-over-month, the largest since august 2021. This is the third consecutive month of
decline, with the index nearing the July 2022 valley. Concerns about inflation remain, particularly

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

regarding food and gas prices. Respondents also noted concern about the labor market situation,
depletion of personal savings, and politics. The Mountain Region index remained above the national
index, but it also is generally more volatile than the national index.

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims totaled 220,000 the week March 8, 2025, 8,000 jobs higher than the
same period in 2024. National continued claims were up year-over-year. National federal (UCFE)
claims are elevated from the prior year. The 3,214 initial jobless claims in Colorado filed the week
ending March 8, 2025, were up 23.2%% year-over-year. Continued claims in the state also rose yearover-year, up 4.8%, and was 39.7% above the all-time average.

continued to add jobs in 2023, adding an average of 216,000 jobs per month, which segued into
slower growth to start 2024—an average of 167,700 jobs were added per month through 2024.

The national unemployment rate increased from 3.9% in February 2024 to 4.1% in February 2025,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate in Colorado increased to 4.7% in
January 2025, ranking 44th in the nation. The rate increased from 3.8% in January 2024.
Colorado added 33,500 jobs in 2024—the lowest annual job growth outside of the Great Recession
and COVID pandemic since 2004. The number of jobs in Colorado totaled almost 3 million. The state
is projected to add another 36,700 jobs in 2025, according to the Colorado Business Economic
Outlook.

By industry in Colorado, the most jobs added in January 2025 are in Government, Education and
Health Services, and Trade, Transportation and Utilities. By rate of change, the fastest pace of
growth is observed in Government, Education and Health Services, and Mining and Logging.

National job openings are down the past year, totaling 7.5 million openings in December 2024, a
year-over-year decrease of 12.5%. Colorado’s job openings rate of 4.1%, tied for the 6th lowest in the
nation in December 2024. The state reportedly had 128,000 job openings and 150,190 unemployed
individuals in December, resulting in a ratio of 0.85 job openings per unemployed person in the
state, lower than the ratio of 1.1 in the nation over the same period.

Real Estate
Residential real estate price growth has slowed in Colorado in recent months. The most recent data
from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show that home prices in

all of Colorado’s MSAs increased year-over-year, all but two decreased in their quarter-over-quarter
price changes.

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado’s value of construction decreased 12% year-over-year in January 2025. The
greatest decrease was recorded in the non-residential sector.

Building permit activity in Colorado continued on a slowing trajectory, decreasing 16.7% year-overyear in January 2025. The recent slowdown is largely attributed to a decline in multifamily
construction activity.

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

Scenario S4 presents the most severe downside economic outlook (4% probability), featuring
significantly worse-than-expected negative impacts from federal policies and the resulting in sharply
higher inflation. Despite a weakening economy, the Fed raises interest rates in response to inflation
in Q2 2025. Ongoing geopolitical instability (Ukraine war, Hamas-Israel conflict, potential ChinaTaiwan conflict) further weakens the economy. A severe recession begins in Q2 2025, with a
cumulative 4.4% GDP decline through Q2 2026 and unemployment peaking at 9.3% in Q1 2027.
European economic contraction and retaliatory tariffs exacerbate the downturn, causing a 44% stock
market drop. Fiscal policy largely mirrors the baseline but results in a substantially higher deficit (8.6% in FY2025) due to lower tax revenues, despite increased tariff revenue. The Fed initially eases
monetary policy but is forced to raise rates again due to inflation before resuming easing as the
recession deepens. Real GDP remains permanently below baseline levels due to decreased
investment and lower productivity.
Annual real GDP falls 0.2% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026 before rebounding in 2027; the medium-term
average is 1.4%. The unemployment rate increases to an average of 6.6% in 2025 and 9.1% in 2026.
Retail sales turn negative in 2025 before returning to moderate growth.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue falls in 2025 (1.2 %) and 2026 (1.8%) before returning to
growth. After 2026, growth ranges between 4.6% and 7.8% in the medium-term horizon.

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled, “S4:
Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96% Percentile”, which is constructed with a 96% probability
that the economy will outperform this projection and a 4% probability that the economy will
underperform.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025 Fiscal Policy

April 8, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
April 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the modified 2025 Fiscal Policy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Fiscal Policy establishes the financial control framework and governance of the Agency financial
resources for that year. Staff presents the proposed Fiscal Policy annually for the Board’s consideration
for the upcoming fiscal year. Once approved by the Board of Directors, it may be amended by the Board
at any time.
Proposed changes to the Fiscal Policy are recommended to the Board to address current and emerging
issues including those that result from regulatory, compliance, legislative, audit, Board-directed, fiscal
sustainability, best practices or other requisite sources.
The most recent modification to the Fiscal Policy was approved by the Board on October 22, 2024, for
the 2025 fiscal year. That Board-approved 2025 Fiscal Policy included provisions to address potential
financial impacts resulting from annual revenue growth limitations from the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights
(TABOR) to certain RTD revenues beginning in 2025. Under TABOR, approximately 50% of RTD’s
revenues would be subject to revenue growth limitations in which collections that exceed the sum of the
Denver-Aurora-Lakewood Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate plus the net change in District
property construction would be required to be returned to District taxpayers each year.
Proposed modifications to the 2025 Fiscal Policy were presented to the Finance and Planning Committee
as a discussion item during the March 12, 2025, meeting. No additional proposed modifications have
been made for this recommended action.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this Recommended Action is to modify the 2025 Fiscal Policy to address the passage of
Ballot Measure 7A, which was approved by District voters on General Election Day, November 5, 2024.
Ballot Measure 7A asked voters to allow RTD to be exempt from TABOR revenue growth limitations in
perpetuity. This ballot measure was approved by voters with 69% in favor of passage.

Packet Pg. 75

1.D.1

As a result of the passage of Ballot Measure 7A, certain provisions in the 2025 Fiscal Policy that were
implemented to address TABOR revenue growth limitations may now be removed since they are no
longer applicable.
Attached is a modified 2025 Fiscal Policy with red-line corrections displaying the changes recommended
for approval as well as a clean final copy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this 2025 Fiscal Policy modification.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy Amendment

April 8, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
On February 23, 2021, the Board of Directors approved RTD’s first Equitable Transit-Oriented
Development (TOD) Policy (eTOD Policy). The objective of the eTOD Policy is to encourage affordable
housing on RTD real property at and along high-frequency transit stations and corridors. Successful
implementation of the Policy will increase ridership through transit-supportive land use, generate revenue
through joint development on RTD real property, and enhance community relationships. Staff currently
use the eTOD Policy to coordinate with state and local agencies, negotiate with developers, and reduce
administrative, acquisition, and construction costs in order to reduce overall development costs and help
enable affordable housing.
The State of Colorado established RTD to promote the public health, safety, convenience, economy, and
welfare of residents in the region and the state. Housing and transportation typically are the highest
costs in a household’s budget, affecting the vitality of household economy and welfare. Reducing
housing and transportation costs allows households to save for their health, safety, and convenience.
As a property owner, RTD has a unique opportunity to address the intent of its enabling legislation by
helping to create affordable housing on agency property, not only to address rising costs of living but
also to encourage transit use. Were RTD to encourage only market-rate development, it might lose the
opportunity to maximize ridership and satisfy the agency’s intent and mission. While RTD’s land holdings
suitable for joint development may barely make a dent in the region’s housing affordability problem, RTD
can be part of the solution and set an example for how to encourage affordable housing and increase
ridership at the same time.
RTD Equitable Transit-Oriented Development Policy (2021)
The eTOD Policy is composed of five elements that together promote affordability in joint development
projects to reflect RTD’s aforementioned policies and abilities and build on best practices from peer
agencies:
Affordability Goal – 35% of units portfolio-wide
2. Parking Replacement – Transit customer parking to be provided as needed
1.

Packet Pg. 89

1.E.1

3. Shared Parking – RTD to consider the possibility of parking being shared between transit
customers and other users
4. Expedited Administrating – RTD to waive internal processing and development review fees where
appropriate and maximize efficiency when reviewing proposals for affordable housing
5. Negotiated Land Price – The eTOD Policy currently permits RTD to negotiate land price or ground
lease rate based on the developer’s inclusion of income-restricted units and other benefits to
RTD. However, when the eTOD Policy was approved in 2021, RTD was required by statute to
receive fair market value for its land. This element is the central subject of the discussion below
DISCUSSION
In April 2024, the Colorado legislature passed Senate Bill 24-214 (SB214), which removed the
requirement that RTD receive fair market value when disposing of its land from the RTD statute.
Specifically, §32-9-119.8(3), C.R.S., as amended by SB214 now states:
“Any person obtaining the use of any portion of a transfer facility ... for the provision of
residential uses or other uses shall be required to compensate the district by payment of
rent at fair market value, or, at the discretion of the district, by the provision of services or
capital improvements to facilities used in transit services, alone or in combination with
rental payments, such that the total benefit to the district is not less than the fair market
rental value of the property used by the person.”
With this statutory change, RTD now retains the discretion to determine the ground lease rent or sale
price of its property, provided the agency meets all other parcel-specific requirements (i.e., Federal
Transit Administration requirements, public financing requirements, deed restrictions, etc.). The eTOD
Policy indicates that RTD can negotiate price when a project will generate affordable housing or other
benefits to RTD, but the policy includes no other guidance. This lack of guidance creates uncertainty and
inefficiency for all parties involved in disposition decisions, including the developers who propose
projects, staff who review them, and the Board of Directors who make final decisions on the lease and
sale of valuable property. TOD staff intend to return to the Finance and Planning Committee on May 13,
2025, with a recommended action amending the 2021 eTOD Policy to include guidelines for the sale
and lease price for RTD real property when development of that property includes affordable housing.
Amending the eTOD Policy to define how and when RTD will allow reductions in purchase price or rent
will create a fair and predictable playing field for developers and guide RTD staff as they prepare for
Board of Directors decision-making. TOD staff engaged in numerous conversations through the fall of
2024 with regional housing agencies, jurisdiction planning and housing staff, real estate consultants, and
affordable housing developers to assess current needs and requirements in the affordable housing
market. The clear consensus among these varied groups is that the need for housing, and particularly
affordable housing, in the Denver region is enormous, but the costs are very high, and the financial
support and available subsidies are severely limited. The TOD group’s contacts agreed that land costs
are an important piece of the financing puzzle. If RTD is willing to reduce land costs, such lower costs
will reduce a barrier to affordable housing construction on RTD property.

Packet Pg. 90

1.E.1

However, in every conversation, partners emphasized that to be successful, RTD’s methods for reducing
costs must be simple, allow flexibility, and rely on the requirements and compliance standards of
existing sources of financing. Assembling the funding to build and sustain an affordable housing project
is extremely complicated. Banks, local jurisdictions, the State of Colorado, the Colorado Housing and
Finance Administration (CHFA), private foundations and others all have different, and sometimes
competing, requirements. Rather than create a framework that adds to the complexity of these
precarious housing deals, it is in the agency’s best interests to firmly and simply state its needs and
preferences within existing funding requirements. The above funders also all have stringent affordability
and background check requirements. RTD should rely on those funders’ combined experience and
internal underwriting rather than creating and managing RTD’s own compliance structure.
In addition to meeting with regional partners, TOD staff also researched the policies and best practices
of transit agencies across the country. As shown in the table in the attached presentation, each agency
offers or does not offer reductions according to its unique political, real estate, and statutory
environment.
Accordingly, various factors inform an RTD property price/rent reduction policy. First, as noted earlier,
RTD now has the statutory ability to sell or lease land according to its own internal policy. Second, the
housing need in the Denver region is great and subsidies are limited. That said, RTD is a transit agency,
not a housing agency, and its land was purchased with taxpayer funds for transit purposes. However,
RTD is committed to the region’s economic and social welfare, both in statute and in practice. Next,
RTD property is dominated by active Park-n-Rides, some of which are a productive means of connecting
customers to the transit system, but some of which would create more ridership if developed as
affordable housing. Unlike transit agencies in other major cities, RTD property is neither valuable nor
plentiful enough to meaningfully affect the agency’s budget. And lastly, by Board policy, revenues from
land dispositions (both lease and sale) are deposited in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
Considering local partners’ counsel for simplicity and flexibility, the wide range of national transit agency
policies, and RTD’s unique economic, political, and regional situation; TOD staff suggest the following
balanced approach to land price/rent reductions for affordable housing:
•

•

If developers can demonstrate a financial gap, RTD will permit a 30% reduction in land price or
rent if projects provide at least 50% of units to households making up to 60% of Area Median
Income (AMI)
o RTD may permit other discounts (either higher or lower) for projects with alternative
affordability programs, as determined by staff with input from local and/or state housing
officials
o No more than a 50% discount will be applied for any given project
RTD values the following:
o Mixed-income projects
o Maximizing allowable density
o Large unit sizes

Packet Pg. 91

1.E.1

This framework for reducing land price/rent sets a standard reduction of 30% if developers meet a
baseline affordability requirement of 50% of units making up to 60% of AMI. (For more information on
AMI, see the attached presentation.) Developers can then align their early-stage projects to this
benchmark. As developer project details are determined, developers may find the project works better
with less or more affordability. RTD can then adjust the reduction up or down accordingly with a clear
maximum discount of 50% off fair market rent. The language above also offers three values that are
consistent with regional needs: mixed-income, maximum density under zoning, and large unit sizes (i.e.,
three or more bedrooms). Developers who conform with those values would be most likely to achieve
the maximum allowable discount. The suggested policy language also begins with the requirement that
developers demonstrate a financial gap; as such, if affordable housing can be financed on RTD property
without a reduction in land price/rent, RTD will not provide a reduction.
As the landowner, transit provider, taxpayer-funded political subdivision, and partner in the region’s
economic and social health, RTD must balance its fiduciary duties and operational responsibilities with
the state’s needs for housing. Setting clear, straightforward guidelines for land price/rent reductions will
create predictability for affordable housing developers, direction for RTD staff, and a baseline for Board
of Directors decision-making, while also providing meaningful assistance to affordable housing projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This amendment has no direct financial impact. Existing resolutions require that financial implications be
considered as part of any Board or staff decision related to TOD projects; these decisions are made on a
case-by-case basis.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Planning and Risk Assessment Relative to Federal Funding
Opportunities

April 8, 2025

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Brenden Morgan, Acting Chief Financial Officer
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD is a direct recipient of federal grant funding from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). RTD is
also periodically a recipient of grant funding from other sources such as the Department of Homeland
Security and some State of Colorado grant programs.
Grants are primarily administered by the awarding agency on a reimbursement basis, meaning that
grants that have been awarded to RTD are drawn after eligible expenditures are incurred rather than RTD
receiving the funding in advance of expenditures.
Types of federal grant programs that RTD typically participates in are:
•

•
•

Urbanized Area Formula Funding (Section 5307): provides formula grant funding for transit capital,
operating assistance and transportation-related planning in urbanized areas resulting from formulaic
apportionments based on information filed with the FTA’s National Transit Database (NTD)
Capital Investment Grants (Section 5309): provide discretionary grant funding for transit capital
investments that may be awarded funding that meet a unique set of individual grant requirements
Bus and Bus Facilities Formula Program (Section 5339): provides formula grant funding to replace,
rehabilitate, and purchase buses and related equipment as well as bus-related facilities

DISCUSSION
This discussion item is intended to provide information regarding RTD’s formula fund and competitive
grants, the status of open RTD grants and available information regarding potential impacts to current
and future grant funding resulting from ongoing federal funding changes.
RTD’s largest recurring grant funding source is FTA Section 5307 preventive maintenance grants, which
approximate $150 million annually or 15% of recurring revenues. RTD also is periodically awarded
Section 5339 grants, which approximate $4-6 million annually for buses, bus-related equipment, and bus
facilities.

Packet Pg. 112

1.E.2

RTD also periodically applies for competitive grants awarded for specific programs and capital projects.
RTD only applies for these grants in instances when they are strategically advantageous to RTD and
when those expenditures have been planned as part of RTD’s financial planning process.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Federal grant funding will be available through the end of the current federal fiscal year ending
September 30, 2025. However, at this time, future federal grant funding levels for RTD are unclear.
