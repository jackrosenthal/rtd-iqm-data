BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Employee Survey Results and Data Evaluation

July 1, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan) was approved by the Board on August 10, 2021. The
Strategic Plan establishes the agency’s four Strategic Priorities, which serve as the functional pillars
used to plan, develop, evaluate, and measure the agency’s overall performance.
To assess the agency’s progress regarding the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership, annual
employee surveys are conducted to discern employees’ opinions, perceptions, and attitudes and to gain
a deeper understanding of employee perspectives and focus areas for improvement. The first employee
survey developed to garner information regarding the Strategic Plan metrics was conducted in 2022. In
order to measure employee sentiment against the baseline data garnered in 2022, the survey instrument
was only nominally revised 2023 and again in 2024. Staff anticipates that a more substantively revised
survey instrument will be used during the Spring 2025 survey period.
DISCUSSION
In keeping with the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership, during the Performance Committee
meeting scheduled for Monday, July 1, 2024, staff will present information related to the responses to
the 2024 Employee Ownership survey.
The 2024 employee survey was held over a three-week period, from April 15 through May 13, to
coincide with frontline represented employees’ work shift selection related to the May 2024 service
change. To encourage participation, 19 in-person events were held at nine different facilities. Employees
were able to complete the survey at events using a tablet or a printed survey or online via the
SurveyMonkey survey platform. Printed copies of the survey were also available at all operations and
maintenance facilities for the duration of the survey period.
The survey included questions related to employees’ jobs, employees’ likelihood of recommending RTD
as a place of employment, and satisfaction with a variety of factors ranging from internal services,
management, supervision, Strategic Plan alignment and career development.

1.C.1

In 2024, 36% of employees (1,056 out of 2,958 total employees) participated in the 2024 survey. This
represents a decline from the impressive 47% response rate (1,259 out of 2,686 employees) in 2023
but is similar to the 37% response rate (930 out of 2,505 employees) seen in 2022.
Employee Net Promoter Score
One indicator staff has used to gauge employee satisfaction is the Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS).
Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric that is commonly used to measure customer satisfaction in the
private sector. From that model, eNPS has been adapted to gauge employee satisfaction using responses
on a scale from 0-10 to the question, “How likely are you to recommend working at RTD to friends or
family?” Those responding 0-6 are considered detractors, 7-8 are passives, and 9-10 are promoters. The
percentage of detractors is subtracted from the percentage of promoters resulting in the eNPS,
measured on a scale of -100 to 100. The eNPS for 2024 is -2.
Staff recognizes the limitations of eNPS in garnering overall employee satisfaction, especially in relation
to the specificity of the question and unique circumstances surrounding recommending particular
employment opportunities to friends and family.
Composite Index Score
A second high-level indicator was introduced in 2023 to provide a more accurate representation of
overall employee satisfaction. The Employee Ownership composite index score (index score) is a metric
developed to gauge responses to a series of survey prompts to assess factors associated with employee
sentiment regarding their work environment overall. The index score represents an average of the
“agree” and “strongly agree” responses to six survey prompts related to employees’ feelings of
engagement, support and safety:
•
•
•
•
•
•

I understand how my performance is linked to the success of the organization
I feel physically safe in my work environment from equipment-related failures, injuries or other
workplace hazards
My supervisor is invested in my growth and success
I feel comfortable taking risks, expressing ideas and concerns, speaking up with questions and
admitting mistakes
I have the resources to successfully perform my duties
I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment

The agency-wide index score for 2024 is 74%, up from 62% in 2023.
Positive/Negative Response Prompts
Included in the survey were 17 prompts designed to measure employee sentiment regarding a variety of
measures. The prompts were worded in the affirmative, and a favorable response to a given prompt is
considered as “agree” or “strongly agree” for assessment purposes.
Average responses to each of the 17 prompts improved year over year between 2023 and 2024. These
gains indicate general satisfaction among employees, which sentiment is at odds with the eNPS for

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

2024 of -2. As such, staff recognizes that eNPS may not be the appropriate metric to gauge progress
related to the Strategic Priority of Employee Ownership.
Among the most notable increases year over year in favorable responses:
•

The response with the most favorability among employees was to the statement, “My supervisor
treats me with respect.” Among all employees, 88% agreed or strongly agreed with this
statement, an increase of 5% from 2023.

•

The largest year-over-year improvement in 2024 can be seen in employees’ responses to the
statement, “I feel that I am safe from crime in the work environment;” 66% of employees agreed
or strongly agreed that they felt safe in the work environment, as compared to 45% in 2023, a
21% increase. While this response garnered the lowest favorability among the 17 prompts in
2024, the significant improvement over 2023 is encouraging, indicating that efforts related to the
Welcoming Transit Environment Strategic Initiative are having a noticeable positive impact.

•

The second largest year-over-year improvement related to support and opportunities for
professional development; 74% agreed or strongly agreed that they felt supported in this area in
2024 compared to 57% in 2023.

•

Year-over-year gains of 15% were realized in responses to the following prompts:
o I understand RTD’s mission and vision
o I feel my perspective is invited and valued, even it if differs from that of my supervisor or
leadership
o I am adequately informed about agency news, projects, and initiatives
o I am provided the tools I need to grow my career

Responses Related to Strategic Initiatives
Leveraging data garnered through Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Employee Ownership
surveys, staff held strategy sessions held in late 2022 and throughout 2023 to develop tactics to
improve agency performance. These tactics were distilled into three overarching Strategic Initiatives for
2023 and 2024, Back to Basics, People Power, and Welcoming Transit Environment. For the
performance period commencing September 1, 2023, and concluding June 30, 2024, each nonrepresented employee was required to develop and strive to achieve “stretch” goals developed using the
SMART framework and based on the Strategic Initiatives.
Responses to certain survey questions highlight the efficacy of the Strategic Initiatives in improving
success outcomes, as depicted in the presentation that accompanies this report.
Key Takeaways
In analyzing the response data, staff has identified several key takeaways:
• Favorable responses to survey prompts increased year over year, significantly so in many areas
• Given the favorability of the responses, and given that eNPS has essentially remained flat over

Packet Pg. 5

1.C.1

•
•

the same time period, staff is assessing whether eNPS is an accurate measurement of employee
satisfaction
An analysis of key drivers highlights areas of opportunity to further enhance Employee Ownership
There is a noticeable correlation between employees’ years of tenure and their job satisfaction

Next Steps
The results of the employee survey are influencing and informing workplans throughout the agency that
support three initiatives, Back to Basics, People Power and Welcoming Transit Environment, which stem
from the agency’s four strategic priorities. Staff will leverage the survey responses to modify work plans
associated the strategic initiatives as appropriate.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.
