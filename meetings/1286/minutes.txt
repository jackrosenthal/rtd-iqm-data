is the second year of a Board approved 5-year period of performance with an
additional one-year option to extend the period of performance available as
needed. Due to the complexity and changing conditions of the project, each
year’s scope of work and fee are reviewed and negotiated annually.
The
Request for Proposal (RFP) required eight (8) percent Disadvantaged Business
Enterprise (DBE) participation. Kenn Hardin, Business Opportunity & Outreach

in this second-year. The contract value for subsequent years will be determined
based upon RTD’s need for services.

II.

Pricing Results – Sales Tax Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2010A – Terry Howerter
gave this update. On November 17, 2009, the Board of Directors approved Resolution
20 authorizing the reissuance of certain bonds. The 2010 refunding bonds have been
issued which resulted in a savings of $1.734 million (3.5393%) which meets the
requirements for refunding. Closing on these bonds occurred on January 5, 2010.

III. 2010 Audit Schedule – The schedule was included in the Board packet. It is designed to
pick up the audits that were omitted last year as a result of the staff reduction. There
were no questions from the Committee. Chair Tayer expressed his gratitude to Mr.
Holmes for reaching out to the Committee and seeking the Board’s input on the initial list
and noted that throughout the year staff would be looking for Board input. Mr. Holmes
said he would appreciate input throughout the year and input for the 2011 schedule as
well.
IV. November 2009 Financial Status – Robert Merriman gave this update. November 2009
sales and use tax was up 3% over November 2008, this could be the vendor allowance.
The last time we saw an increase of a month over the prior year month was August
2008. Year to date 2009 run rate is -11.4% from 2008. Anticipate completing the year
-10.4% from the prior year. Ridership remains down in all classes of service at this time.
The District’s expenses are within budget.
Director Martinez asked about the ridership trends, 2009 is running below 2008 and
even 2007. Are there other reasons for this besides unemployment and gas prices? Mr.
Merriman responded that the bottom line of the analysis and this is going back over a
ten year history there is a strong correlation between employment and ridership. He
anticipates when unemployment decreases, ridership will go up.

Director Martinez wanted to know if ridership is going down faster on bus or rail or is it
about equal. Mr. Merriman responded that he would need to get back to the Committee
on the specifics of the decline and that rail did not become a negative number until after
we began seeing it in our major bus categories.
Director Martinez had a question about fare revenue. It is higher than 2008 and 2009
actual yet ridership is significantly lower. Why is the revenue so much higher? Staff
response that the fare increase that went into effect January 1, 2009. Director Martinez
responded that if this was so, the trending should have better correlated and it did not.
Could there be other factors?
There was some discussion on the graphs in the financial packet. Staff will get back to
the Committee on this next month.
Director Christopher spoke in regards to ridership being down.
General Manager
Washington shared and article with the Board on ridership being down nationally. RTD is
doing much better than other agencies like Chicago, San Francisco, and New York. So
much of our ridership is the commute to work each day that the explanation about
employment makes sense.
Director Martinez said that parking costs are high and some employers are taking away
that benefit and supplementing with transit passes.

February 2, 2010.
