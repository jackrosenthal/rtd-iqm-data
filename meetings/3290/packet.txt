BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Rail Repair Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
January 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
January 25, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $589,000 from the Unrestricted Fund balance
to the 2022 General Fund budget for the 20th and Welton rail replacement project (project).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Central Corridor rail line running from 30th•Downing Station to I-25•Broadway Station was
completed in 1994. The portion of the corridor near the 20th St.•Welton Station was identified by the
Capital Programs department as an area in need of critical rail remediation due to rail and concrete wear.
In August 2020, a fire occurred in a cable vault near the 20th St.•Welton Station, severely damaging
the cables supplying power for rail service. Maintenance of Way teams were able to restore power in the
short-term to maintain service delivery, though the interim repairs do not provide system redundancy
should a subsequent event occur.
The project fully restores the rail system power supply system.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Unexpended budgeted dollars in FY2021 were reverted to the Unrestricted Fund in FY2022 absent a
carryforward appropriation. Due to unanticipated delays, a project carryforward in the amount of
$589,000 for the procurement of items needed for the project was not included in the 2022 Budget
appropriation, as those items were initially expected to be purchased and received in FY2021. This
budget transfer restores the unexpended funding to the project as originally intended.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.
