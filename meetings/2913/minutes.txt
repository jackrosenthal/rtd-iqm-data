B. Recommended Actions

• Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all
documents necessary to amend the contract with Cambridge Systematics for
on-call travel modeling services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount
by $1,300,000 to a total of $1,800,000. Funding for 2019 work orders to be
issued under this contract is included in the 2019 amended expense budget
in the specific projects for which the work orders will be issued. Funding for
future work orders would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial
Plan in future projects.
This action addresses three of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
Motion:

Director Catlin made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the October 29, 2019 Board
Meeting.
Director Whitmore seconded the motion.
