Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with
Cambridge Systematics for on-call travel modeling services to increase the contract not-to-exceed
amount by $1,300,000 to a total of $1,800,000. Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this
contract is included in the 2019 amended expense budget in the specific projects for which the work
orders will be issued. Funding for future work orders would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term
Financial Plan in future projects.
This action addresses three of the General Manager’s goals for 2019:
Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods
BACKGROUND
In August 2018, RTD awarded a contract to Cambridge Systematics to perform travel modeling on
an as-needed basis. The contract was awarded for three years, with two one-year renewable options
at RTD’s sole discretion, and a contract not-to-exceed amount of $500,000. The contractor
performs work when required due to limitations of RTD resources and/or expertise for the particular
task and time. Work is being performed in the context of RTD internal planning studies and RTD
budget development and contract analysis.
DISCUSSION
RTD uses travel modeling and ridership forecasting to support many of its planning efforts and
capital projects. RTD has three ongoing efforts for which we plan to utilize support from Cambridge
Systematics:
1. Update RTD’s existing travel models. Travel models are used to develop ridership forecasts and
related data for decision-making. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) requires recipients of
Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to regularly update travel models for the projects
receiving grants. RTD makes use of three travel models:
a. A traditional four-step model originally developed by DRCOG called Compass
b. A state-of-the-art tour-based model developed by DRCOG called Focus
c. A transit ridership forecasting model developed by FTA called Simplified Trips-on-Project
Software (STOPS)

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

2. Update RTD’s operating and maintenance (O&M) cost model. The current model was developed
in 2011, and it will need to be refined and enhanced to be used for the fiscal sustainability task
of the Reimagine RTD project.
3. Provide ridership forecasting services for Reimagine RTD. That planning effort will require
ridership forecasting for numerous transit alternatives to develop ridership and related data for
decision-making. Focus travel model updates are necessary in conjunction with developing
ridership forecasts for Reimagine RTD. Newer, more up-to-date socioeconomic data from DRCOG
will need to be reflected in the Reimagine RTD model runs. Additional consultant resources are
necessary to complete this process.
To date, RTD has issued two work orders under this contract for a total value of $324,162, leaving
$175,838 for additional work orders. Staff estimates the cost of the three work orders identified
above at $655,000, which exceeds the balance currently available under the contract. Funding for
the three work orders is included in the 2019 expense budget previously approved by the Board of
Directors.
In addition to the three specific work orders identified above, staff has identified a potential need for
ridership forecasting for additional projects over the remaining two year term of the initial contract.
These potential projects, estimated to cost up to $820,838, include the following:



Ridership forecasting as necessary for FasTracks unfinished corridors
Ridership forecasting for BRT corridors
- Identified in the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS)
- SH-119
- Identified in the Regional BRT Feasibility Study




Ridership forecasting for East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Miscellaneous ridership forecasting with RTD’s partner agencies such as the City and County of
Denver
Additional travel model updates, such as the parking cost model that is used within the travel
model



The additional $820,838 requested for future work orders would cover any potential needs for ridership
forecasting for these projects. The future work orders would be executed after Board consideration and
approval of the 2020 expense budget.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this contract is included in the 2019 amended expense
budget in the specific projects for which the work orders will be issued. Funding for future work orders
would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan in future projects.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute
all documents necessary to amend the contract with Cambridge Systematics for on-call travel
modeling services to increase the contract not-to-exceed amount by $1,300,000 to a total of
$1,800,000. Funding for 2019 work orders to be issued under this contract is included in the
2019 Amended expense budget in the specific projects for which the work orders will be issued.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Funding for future work orders would be included in the 2020-2025 Mid-Term Financial Plan in
future projects.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it will delay the
completion of travel modeling for Reimagine RTD, Focus travel model calibration, and the O&M
cost model update.

Information

BACKGROUND
In June 2019, staff presented to the Board of Directors the draft “FasTracks Initial Unfinished Corridors
Report” (the Report). Since that time, the Board, staff and interested stakeholders have engaged in
dialogue regarding the opportunities, options and constraints identified in the Report. Staff have also
advanced work regarding the Funding, Finance and Revenue Options that were presented in summary
form in the Report. In response to a request from the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee
Chair, Director Lubow, staff is providing the Board with the attached matrix to further the dialogue and
provide more information regarding these options.
DISCUSSION:
The attached document provides, in matrix format, a list of all the identified options, with a:




description of each option;
brief discussion of the authority needed, if any;
listing, by entity (RTD, State, Federal, Voter) of which entity(ies) would need to authorize the
option, if any; and
general indication of the potential financial impact of each option.

At the Committee meeting, staff intends to review the format and approach presented in the attachment
with the Board and will be prepared to answer questions.
