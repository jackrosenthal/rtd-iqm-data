GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

X.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.
Approval of General Manager’s 2010 Goals
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General
Manager’s goals for 2010.
B.

Approval of General Manager’s 2011 Goals
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance
Management Committee that the Board of Directors approve the General
Manager’s goals for 2011.

C.

Resolution No.___, Series 2010A and 2010B Certificates of Participation
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”),
authorizing the execution and delivery of an annually renewable Lease Purchase
Agreement (the “Lease”) with RTD Asset Acquisition Authority (the
“Corporation”) and related documents pursuant to which there will be executed
and delivered Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2010A and Taxable
Certificates of Participation (Direct Pay Build America Bonds), Series 2010B
(collectively, the “COPs”).

D.

Resolution No.___, Series 2010A and 2010B Sales Tax Revenue Bonds
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”),
authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District Tax-Exempt Sales Tax
Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2010A and Regional Transportation
District, Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Project) (Direct Pay Build
America Bonds), Series 2010B (collectively, the “Bonds”).

E.

Salaried Employee Insured Benefits
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the 2011 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Budget
and authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement with the Insurance
Carriers.
The 2011 Salaried Employee Insured Benefits Budget is $7,194,130. The
District’s expected cost for 2011 is $6,784,179. It is important to note,
however, that our 2010 actual expense is coming in below 2009 actual by 6.53%. This is due to the success of the 2010 implementation of the Cigna selffunded options and the carrier change for the District’s life/disability coverage.
This is a significant achievement considering that the medical trend for employersponsored group plans has been estimated to increase from 7% - 11% each year.

F.

Free Rides for Members of the Military
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that free
rides on RTD for active duty members of the United States Military should be
extended from the presently approved date of December 31, 2010 to December

31, 2011. Utilization has been minimal to date and this extension will have a
minimal impact on RTD.
XI.

H.

Approval of January 2011 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the January 9, 2011 Service Change package as
