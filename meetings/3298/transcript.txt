Miss McManus, I believe I see one person in the queue, but can you help me confirm?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. I see Molly McKinley.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Our first speaker is Miss McKinley. Please go ahead, Miss McKinley

MOLLY MCKINLEY: Great. Good evening, Board members, and thanks for holding public comment
during this committee meeting. I think this is my first committee meeting comment since you adopted the
policy, so thank you so much for doing that.
My name is Molly McKinley and I'm here on behalf of the Denver Streets Partnership. Although we'll be
submitting some formal feedback, I just wanted to briefly give a comment about the system optimization
plan, since I saw that you'll be discussing it this evening.
Just given RTD's current funding and labor limitations we're really glad that RTD has undertaken the SOP
and we really believe that the guiding principles are the right ones. Given RTD's current limitations, we
believe that this is really the right decision making philosophy and we support the adoption of this plan.
You know, we know that this is really tough times and this is going to be uncomfortable, and not everyone
is going to be served. As a transit advocate, it is not what I want to see, for us to be looking five years
ahead and be returning to 85% percent of pre-pandemic service.
But hard times call for hard decisions. And I hope that you can make a hard decision and make these
tough choices with these priorities in mind, but also really think about, how do we get out of this situation?
We're calling on state leaders, local leaders, federal leaders, pretty much anyone who has a budget to be
thinking about how we fund public transit. Public transit is so key to so many of our goals and so many of
the needs of our communities. So we really have to be thinking about how do we expand the pie of
funding that's available instead of just trying to split a tiny sliver of pie between so many different needs of
our communities.
So I just wanted to share that today. And you'll, of course be hearing from us and our coalition partners
more. But I don't envy you in this position, of course. As decision makers, this is really tough times. But I
just want to thank you and hope that you will take this opportunity to really prioritize equity and the most
transit dependent folks. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much for your comments, Miss McKinley.
Miss McManus, is there anyone else in the queue?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I see no one else in the queue. And there were no comments that were sent to
the email box regarding this meeting.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Miss McManus. With no other participants in the queue, we will go ahead
and close the public comment period at this time.
In our information from external entities section, there is no information this month to be provided, so we
will move on to recommended actions. We have three recommended actions on the agenda this evening.
Our first recommended action is financial advisor contract extension. This is for the Board of Directors to
authorize a contract extension with Hilltop Securities, also known as Hilltop, for financial advisory
services, which will extend the performance period through January 2023.

Do we have a motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
KATE WILLIAMS: Second.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
ERIK DAVIDSON: I hear Director Catlin as the mover. I heard second with Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Can I second, since I'm not formally on the committee?
BOBBY DISHELL: Second, Director Dishell.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Oh, thank you very much. I-- used to the committees of the whole still. We'll have the
second as Director Dishell.
I would ask Mr. Doug McLeod, our Chief Financial Officer, to present any pertinent information regarding
the action. Noting that the action was included in the packet and Directors have had time to ask questions
of staff offline, please raise your virtual hand and be recognized to speak when Mr. McLeod concludes his
presentation. MacLeod.
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you, Mr. Chair. And yes, this is seeking Board approval to extend the contract
with Hilltop Securities as our financial advisor for one year. Currently, SEC requirements require
governmental agencies to retain a financial advisor for transactions and to make recommendations on
debt primarily. We would like to come to the Board probably in the month of March, to the Finance
Committee first, to propose refinancing of some certificates of participation, which we anticipate under
current market conditions could potentially save $100 million in interest expense. Hence, the reason for
trying to extend this contract with Hilltop. We'd like to get that transaction going as quickly as possible.
And that concludes my comments, Mr. Chair. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. MacLeod. At this time, I'll ask any Directors who would like to speak to
please raise your virtual hand.
Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Thanks so much. And thanks, Mr. MacLeod, for the presentation. I know that this was
included in the 2022 budget, but could you refresh my memory. What is that line item amount in the 2022
budget, the cost of extending this an extra year?
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you for that question. This is Doug MacLeod. So we actually have Hilltop on an
annual retainer. So the cost of that annual retainer is $120,000 per year to provide advice. Typically with
a transaction, they charge-- so if we go through with a COP financing, for instance, in March, their charge
would be approximately $30,000 to assist in coordinating with bond counsel, disclosure counsel,

continuing disclosure, dissemination, et cetera. So we feel like it is included in the budget and we feel like
it is a good deal for RTD.
BOBBY DISHELL: Great. And do we have sort of unlimited contract extensions? How is that structure set
up?
DOUG MACLEOD: We do not. And in fact, we had two options under this contract, which expired at the
end of January. One was to go to request for proposals, put it out for a competitive bid process, or to
renew. And we're recommending to renew with Hilltop, just because of the urgency with rising interest
rates and trying to lock in the interest savings on these particular bond issues-- excuse me, COP issues.
BOBBY DISHELL: Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Great. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. Will you be going out for new proposals this year?
ERIK DAVIDSON: Mr. MacLeod, you're on you're on mute at the moment.
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Apologize. We would like to extend the contract for a full year.
The contract currently expired in January. We'd like to extend it through January of 2023, at which point
we would go out for a request for proposals.
BOB BROOM: Yeah, but I guess the question is, do we go out this fall, so that you'll have a smooth
transition? Or will it be a hurry up job in January if there's something that needs to be done?
DOUG MACLEOD: That's definitely a good question. We would definitely prepare the proposal in
advance, so that we would have a seamless transition if a new proposer was selected through that
process. So yes, we would go out this fall with a procurement.
BOB BROOM: Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Director Broom. Thank you, Mr. MacLeod. Any further questions from
Directors?
Great. Well, I'd just like to say thank you to Mr. MacLeod. It makes sense. We've got some things in flight
right now and pretty exciting opportunity for some substantial savings. So thank you for working that so
hard.
I'll go ahead and call for the vote. We'll ask, are there any no votes on this action? Hearing none, we'll call
that seven ayes, and the motion unanimously passes.
Directors, please place your phones and computers back on mute and we'll move on to our second
recommended action. This is insurance payment budget transfer. This is for the Board of Directors to

approve a budget transfer of $795,857 from the unrestricted fund balance to insurance expense for
insurance premiums paid to insurers.
Do we have a motion?
SHELLEY COOK: So moved, Shelley Cook.
BOBBY DISHELL: Second, Dishell.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Director Cook is the motion. Second, Director Dishell. I'll go ahead and again pass the
baton off to Chief Financial Officer Doug MacLeod for a brief presentation pertinent to the motion.
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you, Chair Davidson. Just to summarize what we're asking the Board to
approve, we entered an OCIP insurance program, an owner controlled insurance program, for the build of
the N line. That's common practice with large construction projects in which the agency obtains the
insurance. We have the purchasing power to get the insurance for all the contractors. And so under that
OCIP plan, several insurers participated in that ownership coverage during the construction period of the
N line.
What's common also with insurers is they quote an insurance premium at the beginning of a project, then
they come back and they do an audit towards the end of the project to make sure they charge the correct
premium. So what occurred with this particular transaction is during that audit, Zurich Insurance
determined that they had undercharged premiums by $795,000. On the other hand, there were other
insurers involved in that OCIP coverage that overcharged RTD.
So in order to pay Zurich the additional premiums, we would like to get Board approval to make this
budget transfer. Once we make those payments, RTD will then receive the refund of $940,000. So the net
impact to RTD is a positive $144,000.
And that concludes my comments, Chair Davidson. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Mr. MacLeod. Any questions from Directors at this time
Thank you very much. Hearing none, we'll go ahead and call for the vote. Again, I will ask are there any
no votes on this action?
Excellent. Hearing none, we'll call that seven ayes, zero nos and no abstentions. And the motion passes
unanimously.
We have one other recommended action this evening. Our third recommended action is the salaried
trustee appointments. This is for the Board of Directors to approve a resolution reappointing Bill Van
Meter Assistant, General Manager Planning, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, appointing Leo Reilly
Chief Administration Officer to a term expiring December 31, 2023, and appointing Kent Enright Manager
Labor Relations to a term beginning April 1, 2022 and expiring December 31, 2022, as trustees for the

salaried employee defined benefit pension plan, also referred to as the pension plan, and salaried
employee defined contribution retirement plan, also referred to as the DC plan.
Do we have a motion?
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Director Catlin.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Second from Treasurer Whitmore.
Again, I would ask Mr. MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer, to present any additional information regarding
this motion.
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think the only thing to add to your comments is that one of the
positions is being filled because we have a vacancy. Derek Black left the organization. He's no longer
available for the trust. Bill Van Meter's term expired at the end of last year. We'd like to extend that. And
then we have a current trustee, Sylvia Francis, who will be retiring on April 1, and we'd like to
preemptively fill that position when she does leave. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. MacLeod. We'll go into discussion and questions. And I will
first go to Second Vice Chair Caitlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I am in support of this motion, but primarily, we had our trustees
meeting this afternoon. And without these vacancies being filled, if we had had one absent member we
would not have had a quorum. So it's really difficult, if there's something going on, for this limited number
of people to take any action. So I would just encourage approval of this motion. Thank you very much.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you very much. Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. How were the people selected for these positions?
DEBRA JOHNSON: Mr. Chair, if I may speak to that.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Please, Ms. Johnson. Thank you.
DEBRA JOHNSON: So thank you very much. Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO. And Director
Broom, thank you very much for the question in which you posed. As it stipulates, we need to have an
individual that is in the former pension plan. And that is Bill Van Meter, because he is one of the long-term
employees that is an active member. As it relates to the defined contribution plan for non-represented
salary employees, Kent Enright, who is being appointed, serves as the Manager of Employee and Labor
Relations underneath the auspices of the Human Resources division within Administration.

Recognizing that this is a defined benefit, it makes no sense to have people with the subject matter
expertise and the acumen to be suited to be in the position. Recognizing as well that Leah Riley is our
Chief Administrative Officer and has auspices over Administration that includes Human Resources, and
to the points that I just raised as it related to Mr. Enright, it makes both sense to have people that are
knowledgeable about the benefits in which we provide to our employees. So that is the manner in which
these individuals have been identified to serve on the pension committee.
BOB BROOM: Thank you. Did you make the selections or did the senior leadership team participate in
the selections?
DEBRA JOHNSON: So that was made in conjunction, I had a conversation with Mr. MacLeod and other-Mr. MacLeod and Miss Riley. And Mr. MacLeod, if you want to expound further to validate my response
going forward that it wasn't made in a vacuum, I would appreciate that. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Any comments from MacLeod, Miss Riley?
Great. Director Broom, does that answer your question?
BOB BROOM: Yes, it does. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Johnson.
Any further questions or discussion from the Board? Yes, Director Dishell.
BOBBY DISHELL: Thanks, Director Davidson. Are either of these plans the plans in which our frontline
employees participate in? I don't think so. I just wanted to confirm [INAUDIBLE].
DOUG MACLEOD: Mr. Chair.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Yes. Please go ahead.
DOUG MACLEOD: Thank you. This is Doug MacLeod. No, they do not. These are the salaried employee
trusts only. There's a separate defined benefit pension plan for the represented employees.
BOBBY DISHELL: Great. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. Further questions, discussion?
With that, I'll go ahead and call for the vote. Are there any no votes on this action? Great. Hearing none,
once again we'll call this seven ayes, passing the motion unanimously.
That concludes our recommended actions this evening. Thank you, Mr. MacLeod, for going through all of
those. And we're going to go into the discussion items.

We have one discussion item on the agenda this evening. It is the Reimagine RTD System Optimization
Plan discussion, also known as the SOP. At this time, I would ask our CEO and General Manager, Miss
Debra Johnson, to please present any information that she has prepared.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Well, thank you very kindly, Chair Davidson. Good evening to you and Board
members and to all those that are virtually assembled. I am Debra Johnson, General Manager and CEO.
During the January 25, 2022 Board meeting during Other Matters, several Directors commented on the
system optimizations plan public outreach efforts. As a gentle reminder, the system optimization plan, or
what we're referring to as the SOP, is a near-term planning initiative intended to help address current
transit service delivery needs, including, but not limited to, such considerations as service characteristics,
including fixed and flex route, local, limited, and express service, appropriate vehicle types, including low
and zero emission vehicles, adjustments to running times, departure times, location, transfer times, and
stop spacing to improve schedule adherence and customer satisfaction, and service standards, just to
name a few.
This undertaking is known as a comprehensive operational analysis with looks at short- and long-term
needs to optimize a transit network and is customarily performed every five to seven years and refreshed
with the aforementioned cadence. The mobility plan for the future is the long-term counterpart to this
agency's SOP, meaning a decades long plan to address needs 30 years out. Hence, it is imperative to
take into consideration matters such as land use, economic development, and climate action plans in
order to coincide with regional planning efforts.
With that background, the concerns expressed at the January 25 meeting were the one-month window for
gathering feedback was possibly not long enough, given the project's multi-year scope, and many of the
customers and communities who could be impacted by route changes resulting from the SOP
implementation were probably not aware that the comment period is currently open.
During the course of that January 25 Board meeting, I committed to the Board that I, in consultation with
staff, would review the feasibility of extending the public feedback window by one month, until March 9,
2022, as well as enhancing the visibility of the public outreach effort to stakeholders and customers alike.
As noted previously, the current consultant contract is scheduled to expire March 31, 2022.
Staff is currently engaging with the consultant regarding a potential extension and scope modification.
Should staff be successful in negotiating an extension and scope change, it is anticipated that additional
cost to address these modifications will reach a few hundred thousand dollars. With a one-month
extension of the SOP feedback window, staff estimates that the consulting contract will need to be
extended a minimum of 90 days. This extension reflects the additional time to conduct expanded
outreach beyond the current scope and the analysis of additional comments regarding potential SOP
changes. Additionally, the contract extension impacts the schedule for the mobility for the future, since the
SOP informs the recommendations for this effort.
As I previously stated, an extension would also result in additional project costs. Staff is preparing an
estimate of the budget impacts and I will inform the Board when that information is available. In response

to the Board members' request for additional outreach, I propose the following, to provide collateral
material regarding the SOP on revenue vehicles to inform customers and encourage additional feedback,
two, to conduct supplementary service sector meetings with stakeholders to discuss the comments
received and the potential to address those comments. Reason being, we don't want to leave anything to
interpretation and think that's vital to understand the pain points which have been expressed.
Third, to continue to seek feedback from customers through a variety of means, including advertising,
through the media, special meetings with community-based organizations, and the promotion of online
engagement. Four, to potentially conduct additional public meetings that could be promoted through
social media, radio ads, specifically as we talk about different demographics, Spanish radio, for example,
and other means with targeted outreach for multicultural communities. And five, to continue to meet with
stakeholders as necessary to discuss their questions and concerns related to the draft SOP.
As a recap, outreach efforts to date have resulted in 28 meetings with customer and stakeholder groups
since December of 2021, extensive media coverage in the Denver Post, online, and through other
sources, the distribution of read and ride pamphlets, i.e. our newsletter containing information on the SOP
to over 25,000 recipients, and over 500 written comments garnered through meetings and through the
online tool. I would note that over 80% of the feedback has been focused on the desire for new or
expanded service.
In closing, I want to ensure all are aware that the public comment period will remain open until
Wednesday, March 9, 2022, and the project team will update the website banner, or more specifically,
Media Relations, this evening, and with the other channels as expediently as possible. Further, I will keep
the Board apprised of the potential scope modification and time extension to the existing contract.
And with that, Mr. Chair, I conclude my remarks. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, CEO and General Manager Johnson. Very much appreciate the
presentation. Any questions, discussion, comments from Directors? Yes, Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Thank you very much for the for the extension and the specifics about the
outreach that you're going to undertake. I really appreciate that. And recognize too that, to the extent
we're moving that particular goalpost back, that it does impact on other aspects of the Reimagine
phasing.
But one thing that Molly McKinley said tonight struck me. And that was, you know, here we are, we've got
to adopt a plan that isn't what we aspire for it to be, and we also need to be thinking about how we get out
of this situation. That, as I understand it, falls to the second half of Reimagine. And to the extent that's
true, I would hope we can be engaged on that and see some of that in this time frame, as we're
considering the SOP, because I can consider it best when I'm looking at the whole of our service plan for
the future.

So anyway, I would just say that. First of all, thank you, and the specifics are great. And then secondly, I
would hope we in the Board can remain engaged in a way that is probably more, I don't know, more
visible in this coming phase than we have been for the prior phase. I'm just seeking that assurance.
DEBRA JOHNSON: Mr. Chair, if I may address the Director. So Director Cook, thank you very much for
your comments. And that would be the intent. I'd be remiss to state that we have to work with our
consultant as it relates to the scope, and I don't want to speak outside of our procurement practices. But
your comments haven't fallen upon deaf ears, since, as we move forward, that would be optimally the
intent, but we also have to ensure that we are adhering to the intent of the contract, and, if need be, then
perhaps we may have to pivot as we go forward, recognizing the intent of what the mobility plan for the
future consist of. And that's long-term versus the immediate short-term needs and trying to meld those
together.
I want to be careful with my words, but I hear you. And we will try in earnest. And if that's something
different, then, as I said, we will come back and apprise, once we're able to work with the consultant to
determine what that scope could possibly look like. So thank you very kindly.
That's the best assurance I can give at this juncture. I'm speaking in ambiguity.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. Thank you, Miss Johnson. Thank you, Director Cook. First Vice Chair
Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you very much. And thank you, Ms. Johnson. I just wanted to say, we've had
a two or three conversations about some of this and I really appreciate the direction you're going. You
mentioned that the mobility plan for the future will be looking at land use, economic development, and
climate action plans. And I do hope we can meld those in some way with the SOP and have those affect
our five-year view as well. So I appreciate what you're doing. Thanks.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you. Other questions, comments from members of the committee?
Great. Well, I just would like to echo the thank you, Ms. Johnson. I really appreciate it. I know many of us
on the committee and on the Board have heard a lot of feedback from customers and stakeholders, and a
lot certainly centered around economic development plans and climate action plans. I think some of the
trade-offs and very much appreciate the work that you've done in short order here to figure out how to get
these things all aligned and also look at what might be possible from a time standpoint. And certainly, the
five tangible next steps very much appreciated. So thank you.
DEBRA JOHNSON: So Mr. Chair, If I may. I just want to recognize the efforts of our staff, recognizing that
this has been ongoing since 2019 and I came into the organization. I want to say publicly I appreciate
their efforts. And while we may be pivoting, that doesn't diminish the work that they've done. There's quite
a different ways of doing COAs, comprehensive operation analyses. And I'd be remiss not to
acknowledge their efforts and their willingness to lean in when we had a conversation about what we may
do to take a different look at how we can move forward.

So I want to thank specifically Mr. Van Meter, Bill Sirois, and Brian Welch. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Thank you, Miss Johnson, for those comments. Yeah, certainly a big lift right now. As
Miss McKinley pointed out it's a hard time to trade-off. So yeah, lots of work going into all this. Thank you.
With that, that's the end of our discussion item section. Are there any other matters to come before this
committee for discussion this evening? Seeing none, in a moment the Directors will meet in executive
session to receive legal advice in relation to the collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated
Transit Union Local 1001. Please note that the committee will reconvene in open session after the
executive session ends with no further business on the agenda.
I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session, pursuant to Section 24-6-402(4)(b) to receive
legal advice and Section 24-6-402(4)(e) for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject
to negotiations regarding the successor collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 1001. So do I have a motion? And it looks like I actually, I'll move to Director Tisdale, you
have your hand raised.
DOUG TISDALE: I do. I was going to wait until after the motion, Mr. Chairman. I have a procedural
question specifically. We're convened as a meeting of the Finance Committee, which does not include the
entire Board. We are about to convene into an executive session with the intention to have the entire
Board participate in that executive session. And I think it might be worthwhile to have the motion indicate
that it relates to the entire Board and not merely to the members of the executive committee. Thank you.
ERIK DAVIDSON: General Counsel Snyder, would you like to advise or comment on that matter?
MELANIE SNYDER: Thank you, Mr. Chair. I think the motion is appropriate the way that it was read, or
the language of the motion, we haven't actually had a motion yet. But yes, we will note for the record that
all Directors are present and they will be participating in the executive session.
ERIK DAVIDSON: Excellent. Thank you very much. And prior to discussion, let me first see if there is a
motion to enter executive session.
LYNN GUISSINGER: So moved.
BOBBY DISHELL: Or second, either way.
ERIK DAVIDSON: OK, I have the movement with Director Guissinger and the second, Director Dishell. Is
there any discussion, further discussion regarding the movement into executive session? Seeing no
further discussion, would all those entitled to participate in the executive session please move into the
other meeting instance at this time?

DOUG MACLEOD: Hi, y'all.
PEGGY CATLIN: So for some reason, I'm getting a message that the host has stopped my video.
KATE WILLIAMS: He doesn't want to see you anymore, Director Catlin.
DOUG MACLEOD: There you go. Now, hold for a few more directors here from the committee.
In a couple of minutes here-- so we're going to go ahead. The committee will now come back to order at
7:14 PM Mountain Standard Time. Thank you to everyone on the line for your patience.
We're going to go ahead and move on. There's no further business here for the committee. So the next
meeting date for the Finance and Planning Committee will be Tuesday, March 8, 2022.
With that, seeing no further discussion, we will adjourn the Finance and Planning Committee at 7:15 PM.
Thank you, everybody.
SHELLEY COOK: Thank you.
BOB BROOM: Good night.
SHELLEY COOK: Night. Thank you.
