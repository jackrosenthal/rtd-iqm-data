BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Financial Advisor Contract Extension

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize a contract extension with Hilltop Securities (Hilltop) for financial
advisory services, which will extend the performance period through January 2023.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Under rules imposed by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2014 and as required by the 2010
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, governmental agencies that wish to have
open and productive conversations with investment banks must retain a municipal advisor, a qualified
financial professional such as an investment banker or financial consultant who provides counsel for
financial transactions such as bond offerings.
The municipal advisor must be registered with the SEC and must have a fiduciary responsibility to the
governmental agency.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
RTD is contracted with Hilltop to provide municipal advisory services. Hilltop has provided required
advisory services for myriad bond and certificate of participation (COP) issuances and refinancings for
the agency, coordinated with RTD’s credit rating agencies, and performed several ancillary advisory
services such as financial evaluation of unsolicited proposals.
The current contract with Hilltop expires in March 2022. By adopting this recommended action, the
Board authorizes a one-year extension of the contract that would allow Hilltop to assist with a timesensitive refinancing of 2013 and 2014 series COPs to realize significant interest savings. This
refinancing is time-sensitive due to call provisions as well as the potential for reduced interest savings
from a refinancing delay with the anticipated rise in long-term interest rates in 2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Insurance Payment Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $795,857 from the Unrestricted Fund balance
to insurance expense for insurance premiums paid to insurers.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD entered insurance contracts with Zurich Insurance (Zurich) to provide an Owner Controlled
Insurance Program (OCIP) during construction of the N Line to provide insurance coverage for the
agency’s contractors. Providing OCIP during construction is a common practice.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priority of Financial Success.
Insurance contract premiums are quoted and priced based on certain assumptions at the beginning of the
insurance contract period. Insurers will often perform an audit of the coverages at a later time to ensure
the premiums are adequate for the insurance being provided.
Zurich performed an audit of the N Line OCIP coverages and determined in late 2021 that the premiums
paid by RTD needed to be increased by $795,857. It was also determined that Zurich and Marsh USA
(Marsh), the agency’s insurance broker, collectively owed a refund to RTD of $639,824 and $300,825,
respectively, for a total refund of $940,649 for certain coverages that were overcharged.
The combined financial impact to RTD is a net return of premiums of $144,792; however, Zurich and
Marsh must first receive the $795,857 in underpaid premiums before refunding the $940,649 to RTD.
In order to adhere to RTD’s budgetary controls to appropriate the $795,857 payment to Zurich, a budget
transfer must be completed. Following payment by RTD of the $795,857, Zurich and Marsh will then
send payment of $940,649 to RTD.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this action item will be a net return of premiums to RTD of $144,792.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Salaried Trustee Appointments

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
February 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve Resolution No. ______, Series of 2022, reappointing Bill Van Meter,
Assistant General Manager, Planning, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, appointing Leah Riley,
Chief Administration Officer, to a term expiring December 31, 2023, and appointing Kent Enwright,
Manager, Labor Relations, to a term beginning April 1, 2022 and expiring December 31, 2022, as
Trustees for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit Pension Plan (pension plan) and Salaried Employee
Defined Contribution Retirement Plan (DC plan).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 min
BACKGROUND
On January 8, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 001, Series of 2008 (Resolution No.
001), which established a committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried Employee
Pension Trust Fund, and the Finance Chair (i.e., the Chair of the Finance Administration and Audit
Committee as it existed at that time) to screen applications from prospective pension and DC plan
trustees from among “the middle management salaried employee class and the senior management
salaried employee class and…[to] bring recommendations back to the Board.”
As a revision to the process established in Resolution No. 001, the Board adopted Resolution No. 27,
Series of 2010, which stated that, “for reappointment of Trustees who have served satisfactorily and in
whose education the Trusts have made substantial investments, it is not necessary to seek applications
for renewal, and instead the application process established by the Board in 2008 would be used on
those occasions when the Board finds it necessary or appropriate to appoint new salaried Trustees to
the Trusts.”
On May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008, Series of 2016 (Resolution No. 008), the RTD Board of
Directors amended the Defined Benefit Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Retirement Trust
(Trusts, collectively) to remove the “senior” and “middle” management distinction established in
Resolution No. 001. Instead, Resolution No. 008 authorized the Board to appoint two employee trustees
who participate in the pension plan and two who participate in the DC plan, as well as two Directors
appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to
serve as the same trustees on both trusts.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to meet the Strategic
Priorities of Financial Success and Employee Ownership.
The appointments and reappointment are as follows:

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan Discussion

Committee Meeting Date:
February 8, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Reimagine RTD is multi-year process to look at what is next for the agency. There are two key elements
to the planning effort; the System Optimization Plan (SOP) is focused on a redesign of RTD transit
service over the next five years, while the Mobility Plan for the Future is focused on how the agency
needs to grow and evolve between now and 2050.
DISCUSSION
During the Board Meeting held on January 25, 2022, during Other Matters, Director Cook raised a
concern pertaining to the SOP outreach schedule. The GM/CEO committed to conferring with the project
team and the Contracts and Procurement Division to discern what adjustments could be made to
accommodate this request.
The GM/CEO will provide an oral status report on contracting provisions and scheduling to address this
matter.
