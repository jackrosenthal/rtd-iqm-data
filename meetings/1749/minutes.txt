It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the

contract amendment is provided by a grant from the US Department of
Homeland Security.
David Genova, Assistant General Manager Security, Safety, and Facilities,
introduced this action. There was funding left over after the original
proposals came in to put video recorders on the mall shuttle so this action
item is to amend the contract to purchase 50 more digital video units to
replace older units that are failing.
Director Ruchman asked how much of the fleet has video recorders. David
Genova responded that about 2/3 of the fleet has video. All new buses are
ordered with video systems factory installed.
The prototype for the first mall shuttle has been installed and will be on the
streets shortly. Director McMullen asked how quickly tape incidents can be
pulled. David Genova responded that the new units have a wi-fi unit and can

the purchase of these buses is available in the 2007 amended capital and
expense budget.
Motion:

Director Elfenbein made a
motion for full approval
before the Board at the
September 25, 2007 Board
Meeting.

Second:

Director Daly
seconded the motion.

Discussion: Cal Marsella reviewed the hybrid bus study handout. The
handout is available for review in the Operations/Customer Services
Committee Meeting Minutes Notebook. In summary, the hybrids get better
fuel mileage than diesel buses. This District has had good maintenance
experience, good driver and customer acceptance with the hybrid buses.
The difficulty with the hybrids is that the capital costs does not outweigh the
savings in fuel and maintenance.
Director Yamrick mentioned apprehension on the part of the Executive
Committee as there is a strong desire among the Board to pursue greener
options.
Dean Shaklee, General Superintendent Maintenance, spoke to the emissions
on the current buses. Current District buses are running very clean; 2005
and 2006 engines meet 2007 standards.
Director McMullen, is there substantial saving in ordering these buses now?
Bruce Abel said that if we do not move forward by December, 2007, the
cost of these vehicles will go up.
Director Daly asked who would get the buses. Dean Shaklee responded that
it will be dispersed throughout the contractors and the District.
Director Ruchman asked what the price would be if we don’t use the option.
John Davis, Senior Operations Budget Analyst, said the price increase could
be as much as 10% per model.

Approval to Move Proposed January 2008 Service Changes to Public Hearing
It is recommended by the Operations Committee that the Board of Directors
approve moving the proposed January 13, 2008 Service Changes on to
public review and comment.
Bill Porter gave a brief overview of the January 2008 Service Changes. Most
of the changes are designed to reduce some of the budget deficits.
Highlights of the changes are listed below:
Route 56- elimination, this route serves the CU Medical Center which is
rapidly decreasing with the move to the Fitzsimons campus.
206/209 – elimination of weekend service
465 – Change frequency on Saturdays to hourly instead of every 30
minutes.
P – Eliminate trips to Franktown, and originate all trips from the Pinery
U – Pine Junction to Tech Center, ridership is very low. Cancel the last
morning and last p.m. trip
326/327 – running time problems so some adjustments are being done.
Canceling Pine Junction park-n-Ride and changing these trips all to Mountain
View park-n-Ride. Save $200,000 just in maintenance costs. Save $2
million long term over having to construct a park-n-Ride. Can add a trip on
the Route C in the morning. Route C is on the verge of overloading. The
District does not own the pine Junction park-n-Ride, it is owned by CDOT.
Service Enhancements
Route 16 – over 6,000 boardings on a typical Saturday. Would like to
implement a 16 LTD on Saturdays. 16 LTD would be a 30 minute service.
Cal Marsella asked about the late night service on the Route 16. Bill Porter
responded that he has an interim report on the late night routes that he will
issue to the Board.
Cal Marsella also asked about Green Valley Ranch service on behalf of
Director Chris Martinez. Bill Porter responded that the Route 43 serves
Green Valley and it was originally requested not to run service after 7 p.m.

Electronic Bus Information Sign Placement/ Update on Light Rail signage – CoChair McMullen expressed concern about electronic bus information sign
placement at Southmoor station. Rick Clarke, Senior Program Manager,
FasTracks Implementation, said he would inspect the station and report back.

full or open. Lloyd Mack, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations, said he
would follow up on the signage at Nine Mile.
Rick Clarke apologized for the light rail signs not working. Progress is being
made. Tests were conducted and did not meet the district’s criteria for

with incorrect information. Rick Clarke will report back on progress at the next
Committee meeting.
