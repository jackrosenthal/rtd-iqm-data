include itemized receipts. This has been stated several times and also
memos sent out to this effect.
Chairperson Martinez inquired about the rail station sponsorship. Cal
Marsella shared this had been discussed a couple of years ago and had been
turned down by the Board.
Director Ruchman asked about the status of the Champions of Transit award
and that he had gotten feedback that indicates our process is broken.
Chairperson Martinez apologized and indicated that we would make revisions
to this process such that in the March 27 Board meeting, these Champions
will be recognized for their contribution in a public setting. Subsequent type
recognitions will be handled as part of the Board meeting where they can be
recognized in public.
In the April/May study session, further discussion will occur on the process
to handle these type awards.
