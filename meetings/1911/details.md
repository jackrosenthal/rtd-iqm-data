#### 1. State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $112,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.

Motion:               Director Lasater made the motion to move this item to the May 27, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the motion.

Discussion:  Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, encouraged a yes vote from the Directors, noting how pleased Staff is with the work Jenifer Brandeberry and Julie McKenna provide for and on behalf of RTD.

Director Tobiassen agreed with Sherry Ellebracht’s comments.  He commended Megan Gilchrest, Executive Assistant for BMPA, for her prompt and at times off-hours communication with the Directors.

Director Folska described BMPA as outstanding, incredibly professional and articulate.  She is pleased with their representation and their availability to the Directors.

Committee Chair Daly declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. State Legislative Update - Brandeberry~McKenna

Julie McKenna thanked the Directors for their kind words and for allowing their firm to represent RTD at the Capitol.  Jenifer Brandeberry was in attendance but left early due to a prior commitment.

Julie McKenna noted that BMPA’s efforts during this session focused on educating legislators on RTD’s work.  The Senate Transportation Chair, the Hon. Nancy Todd, requested a tour of Denver Union Station (DUS), the I-225 corridor, and the DIA construction for her committee members.  Some Congress members were briefed on the Northwest Area Mobility Study.  There is interest from other Congress members to attend tours and/or future briefings.

She pointed out a few bills that were of special interest to RTD:

- Senate Bill 197 was created out of concerns over the US 36 Public Private Partnership (P3) and public input process.  The bill would require Senate approval for certain contracts over 35 years including contingency provisions.  A number of entities expressed their concern over the constraints proposed by the bill and pointed to RTD and its success with P3 as an example of the collaboration potential.  The bill passed the legislature.  The next step is for Gov. Hickenlooper to sign or veto.

- House Bill 1152, regarding passive surveillance records, passed.  The original bill prohibited record retention beyond 6 months.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, provided amended language allowing record retention for criminal proceedings, felony issues, etc.

Three other bills dealing with construction defects were introduced during the last months of the session.  The goal was to address the lack of owner occupied housing at TOD sites. None of them passed. Julie McKenna pointed out they may be reintroduced during the next session.

##### a. 2014 RTD End of Session Report Final

#### 2. Federal Update - Patton Boggs

Michael Dino, Senior Policy Advisor for Patton Boggs, congratulated RTD on the success of the DUS Grand Opening.  He updated the Board on two pieces of legislation introduced in Washington, D.C.:

- On May 12, 2014 the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee introduced their version of the Transportation Reauthorization bill.  Their focus is on freight regulations as well as programs with regional and national significance (in 2005 DUS received $50 million through such programs).  They continue to support the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA).  It is in RTD’s interest to monitor the Banking and Finance Committees and their response to this bill.

- Two weeks ago the White House introduced their version of the Transportation Reauthorization bill. It includes funding Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), workforce development, and the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program.

Michael Dino added there may not be further activity during the rest of the session.  The Transportation Reauthorization Bill may see a one year extension as parties figure out how to continue to fund it.

Director Tobiassen thanked Patton Boggs for the successful trip in March to the APTA Legislative Conference in Washington, D.C. and for their part on the DUS project.

Director Walker noted that Canada recently tightened their requirements for freight trains carrying oil.  He asked if Patton Boggs could foresee any repercussions in our country, specifically for RTD.  Michael Dino said that both the Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration are under some scrutiny.  He projects there may be some tightening of regulations though the specifics are yet to be determined.

Director Folska thanked Patton Boggs for their work with RTD.

Phil Washington, General Manager, noted that the Secretary of Transportation’s office called him on May 12, 2014 to apologize for Secretary Anthony Foxx’s last minute cancellation to the DUS Grand Opening.  Phil Washington said he extended an invitation to Secretary Foxx to visit at a later date and reiterated RTD’s desire for the TIGER grants.

Sherry Ellebracht pointed out it was Patton Bogg’s idea to hold the P3 roundtables the morning of the DUS Grand Opening. Their collaboration assured the sessions included the right speakers.

Committee Chair Daly noted the Highway Trust Fund is running out of funds and asked if there has been any discussion on how to keep the fund solvent.  Michael Dino said there is some discussion but he doesn’t foresee any conclusion to the conversation as it would involve a tax conversation during an election year.

#### 3. Local Government Update

Sherry Ellebracht gave the Local Government update on behalf of Roger Sherman of CRL.  CRL was logistically involved in the DUS Gala held on May 8, 2014.  They are working closely with BMPA during the closing days of the Legislative Session.  CRL will attend the Colorado Municipal League and Citizen’s Climate Lobby conferences during the summer to network on behalf of RTD.  They are closely watching Senate Bill 197.

### D. Other Matters

Director Tobiassen noted that three Directors are going to Washington D.C. in June for the Accelerate Colorado Conference.  They will meet with Federal Legislators and will communicate the Board’s message, stressing the desire for the TIGER grants.

Director Rivera-Malpiede thanked Staff and everyone who worked on the DUS Grand Opening and Gala logistics.  She shared she has received feedback from constituents and from people across the country who were able to participate via the live stream video.

Phil Washington mentioned DUS had a few logistical adjustments over the first few days of operations but overall is running great.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Daly adjourned the meeting at 9:11 P.M.
