Committee Meeting Date:
2026 GM-CEO Short-term Goals

July 7, 2025
Board Meeting Date:
July 29, 2025

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve, pursuant to the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) performance
framework adopted in January 2024 in alignment with the Board’s employment agreement with the
GM/CEO, the proposed short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 1,
2026, and continuing through November 8, 2026.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Guzman, Chair, Performance Committee
Debra A. Johnson, GM/CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the performance assessment framework adopted by the Board during the monthly Board
meeting held on January 30, 2024, the Board is responsible for motivating, assessing, and rewarding
the agency’s GM/CEO in relation to short-term and long-term performance. The GM/CEO’s short-term
performance has been assessed on an annual basis.
The attainment of short-term goals directly tied to agency Strategic Initiatives is a critical element of the
GM/CEO’s annual performance, as is performance related to core job duties and values.
On December 4, 2023, the Board adopted a fifth amendment to the contract to adjust the Board’s
annual deadline to adopt the goals and metrics upon which the GM/CEO will be evaluated in the coming
year from December 31 to January 31.
On December 10, 2024, the Board adopted an eighth amendment to the contract, which included the
following terms, among other provisions:
•

•

For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for an increase to the Adjusted Base Salary between 1 and 7% as set
by the Board
By January 31 each year, after consultation with GM/CEO Johnson, the Board must adopt the
Agency Values, Short-term Goals, and performance assessment outcome ratings with
corresponding point distribution for Core/Base Job performance, demonstration of Agency Values,

and Attainment of Short-term Goals and associated Adjusted Base Salary percentage increase for
which GM/CEO Johnson is eligible for that year’s performance period
Beginning January 1, 2025, the Board must meet with GM/CEO Johnson each quarter to discuss
her performance, including her progress toward the Short-term Goals
For the annual performance periods beginning January 1, 2025, and through the Term Extension,
GM/CEO Johnson is not eligible for a Cost-of-Living Adjustment; however, the Board will
endeavor to continue to be guided by the total compensation principles in the Compensation
Philosophy

In May 2025, upon request from Chair Bouquet, the Board Office solicited from Board members their
feedback regarding their thoughts on potential agency priorities for the short-term planning horizon.
During the Board’s retreat held on Saturday, June 7, 2025, the Board and GM/CEO Johnson discussed
several themes derived from the feedback garnered, which subsequently informed the short-term goals
identified in this Recommended Action.
DISCUSSION
In alignment with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success, the purpose of this Recommended Action is to align the committee
around the proposed short-term SMART goals for the performance period commencing January 1, 2026,
and continuing through November 8, 2026 (2025-26 performance period).
The proposed goals for the 2025-26 performance period are as follows:
Short-term Goal 1 – Customer Experience/Welcoming Transit Environment: No later than
October 2, 2026, increase overall customer satisfaction by 5% for both RTD’s fixed-route bus
service and fixed-route rail service (33% of goal); to increase favorable customer survey
responses by 5% from CY2025 to CY2026 in relation to survey questions pertaining to
customers’ perception of feeling safe and secure aboard light rail vehicles (33% of goal); to
develop and launch by June 30, 2026, a mystery transit customer program to evaluate and
enhance elements of the overall customer experience utilizing transit, including but not limited
to service quality, employee courtesy, accuracy of information provided, and vehicle
cleanliness and to provide at least three months of baseline performance data with respect to
these criteria (33% of goal).
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to consistently deliver high-quality customer service
and improve performance metrics related to overall customer satisfaction as well as to promote a
welcoming transit environment.
According to customer survey data garnered in April 2025, overall satisfaction with RTD’s service
delivery stood at 76% for bus and 75% for combined rail service. Paratransit service received very high
customer satisfaction ratings, 86% and 96% for Access-a-Ride and Access-on-Demand, respectively.
Leveraging data from the 2025 Customer Excellence survey for fixed-route services, 69% of light rail
customers reported feeling safe and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024. A key

Packet Pg. 4

driver analysis of the survey responses identified perception of personal security aboard light rail vehicles
as a key opportunity area to increase overall satisfaction with RTD’s services.
In comparison, a significantly higher proportion of commuter rail customers, 82%, reported feeling safe
and secure while aboard rail vehicles, up from 62% in 2024, indicating that prior efforts to create and
maintain a welcoming transit environment have yielded significant improvements.
RTD has historically leveraged customer and community surveys to garner qualitative data related to
customer-facing aspects of service delivery. Mystery customer programs in the public transit space
typically gauge elements such as service quality, safety, cleanliness, and efficiency of the transportation
system objectively from a customer’s perspective.
Short-term Goal 2 – Ridership: To increase systemwide boardings by 3% from the period
commencing October 1, 2025, and continuing through September 30, 2026.
Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to improve performance metrics tied to community
perceptions of the value RTD provides to the Denver metro region and of RTD’s provision of service to
major activity centers, as well as the State’s visionary ridership increase goal of 6%.
RTD continues to optimize service levels and is incrementally approaching the level of service delivery
contemplated in the System Optimization Plan (SOP), with a planning horizon running 2022-2027.
Annual boardings totaled 65,230,065 in 2024, a slight increase from the 65,175,290 boardings seen in
2023. The Board has established a 2025 short-term performance goal for the GM/CEO to increase
boardings by 3% from the period commencing October 1, 2024, and ending September 30, 2025. The
goal for the 2025-26 performance period builds upon the GM/CEO’s performance goal related to
increased ridership for the performance period commencing January 28, 2025, and continuing through
October 15, 2025.
Short-term Goal 3 – Reliability: No later than October 1, 2026, to complete rail reconstruction
work within budget for the rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street
intersection and the Denver Convention Center (50% of goal); to achieve 98% systemwide
service availability for bus, light rail, commuter rail, and complementary paratransit modes
(50% of goal).

Background: This goal aligns with agency efforts to enhance system reliability and to improve
performance metrics related to service delivery.
The Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project commenced construction in 2024. Phases 2-4 of the project
are anticipated to recommence in Q1 2025, with related rail reconstruction work taking place
commencing September 2025 for the Kalamath light rail segment. Phase 3 of the project involves the
rail segment between the West Colfax Avenue and 7th Street intersection and the Denver Convention

Center. Note that the agency announced at the inception of the project in 2024 that the numbering of
Phases 2 through 4 was not intended to imply the order in which the phases would be completed.
Maintaining assets in a state of good repair is critical to ensuring consistent, frequent, reliable service.
Service availability is the percentage of trips operated as compared to trips scheduled. Maintaining a high
level of service availability across the transit network ensures customers have reliable access to key
activity centers, such as places of employment, schools, medical facilities, and leisure and entertainment
destinations.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Recommended Action; funding to support strategies
and initiatives to produce the outcomes identified herein will be included in the 2026 Proposed Budget.
