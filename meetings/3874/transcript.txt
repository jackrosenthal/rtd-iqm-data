SPEAKER 1: Perfect. With 14 present and 1 absent, we do have a quorum. Please note that the special
Board meeting does not have a section for public comment. This afternoon, however, the public can still
offer comments by email or participating in person or by participating remotely during the regular
scheduled January 28 Board meeting, which will commence at 5:30 PM after this meeting. In a moment,
the Board will meet in executive session regarding the successor collective bargaining agreement with
the amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001.
I'd like to amend the motion to move into executive session to state that the special Board meeting will be
deemed adjourned after it adjourns into the executive session for public transparency. This means that
once the Board moves into Executive session, the main meeting will be adjourned. For anyone who might
be in the room or remote, the regular scheduled January Board meeting will occur after this meeting with
an anticipated start time of 5:30. So please know that we will be back.
I'll now entertain a motion to move into executive session to discuss the following-CHRIS NICHOLSON: So moved.
SPEAKER 1: Well, let me actually say it. To discuss the following-- pursuant to 24-6-402b CRS to receive
legal advice and 24-6-402e CRS for determining positions relevant to matters that may be subject to
negotiations regarding the successor collective bargaining agreement with the Amalgamated Transit
Union Local 1001, or ATU, do I have a motion?
CHRIS NICHOLSON: So moved.
SPEAKER 1: I have Secretary Nicholson.
JOYANN RUSCHA: Second.
SPEAKER 1: Do I have a second?
JOYANN RUSCHA: Second, Ruscha.
SPEAKER 1: Ruscha, thank you. Yes, for the state of the record, do say your last name. That would
greatly help. Is there any discussion whether there is anyone opposed to the motion? Seeing none, for all
those who are expected to attend, would you please stay seated? And for everyone else, would you
please vacate the room at this time and take all your belongings with you?
