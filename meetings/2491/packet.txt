Project Justification Criteria Key Features
• Mobility Improvements: total linked trips on the
project
• Environmental Benefits: reduction in vehicle miles
traveled
• Congestion Relief: number of new transit trips
• Cost-Effectiveness: capital and operating* costs per
trip (*O&M not included in Small Starts)
• Economic Development: transit supportive plans
and policies
• Land Use: Legally binding affordability restricted
housing; existing corridor and station character

Local Financial Commitment Key Criteria
• Current Financial Condition (fleet age; bond
ratings; ratio of assets to liabilities; service history)
• Commitment of Funds (committed vs. budgeted vs.
planned; private contributions)(applies to both capital
and ongoing operations + maintenance)
• Financial Capacity and Reasonableness of
Assumptions (assumptions compared to history;
reasonableness of cost estimates; state of good
repair; ability to withstand shortfalls or
overruns)(applies to both capital and ongoing
operations + maintenance)

Local Financial Commitment Criteria
(50 percent of overall rating)
• Current Condition (of the agency) (25% of
financial rating): All four projects likely to
receive a rating of Medium (consistent with
Southeast Rail Extension).
• Commitment of Funds (for the project) (25%
of financial rating): All four projects likely to receive
a rating of Low. RTD does not have capital and operating
funds committed or budgeted for these projects. This
rating could be raised (with 3rd party funding) by
committing or budgeting 10, 30, 50, or 75 percent of the
non-Federal funding (SERE rating was Medium-High).

Local Financial Commitment Criteria
(50 percent of overall rating)
• Reasonableness of the Financial Plan (for
the project) (50%): All four projects likely to
receive a rating of Low. RTD cannot currently
identify access to funds necessary to cover
capital and operating cost increases or capital
and operating funding shortfalls related to
these projects. This rating could be raised by
identifying 10, 15, 25, or 50 percent of the
funds (from 3rd parties) necessary to cover cost
increases or funding shortfalls. SERE received a
rating of Medium-High.

1.C.2.a

Local Financial Commitment Criteria
• Conclusion on Financial Commitment:
These four projects would not achieve a
Medium rating based on current and
anticipated RTD financial projections and
forecasts. Significant RTD and non-RTD
sources would need to be committed and
budgeted to raise the rating above Low. (SERE
received an overall Financial rating of High due to
significant non-5309 overmatch by RTD and
stakeholders).

1.C.2.a

Conclusions Regarding New and Small Starts
• Only one project, Central Rail Extension, is
likely to achieve a Medium rating for Project
Justification Criteria.
• None of the projects, absent significant
financial movement, are likely to receive a
Medium rating for Financial Commitment.
• For these reasons, none of the four projects is
a candidate to enter Project Development in
the foreseeable future without significant
external resources and commitments.

1.C.2.a

Moving These Projects Forward
• While not eligible for Federal Capital
Investment Grant funds, other strategies will
continue to be explored
• Any successful funding strategy likely to
include significant non-RTD funds
• RTD has previously used non-Federal funds to
initiate FasTracks project construction (I-225;
North Metro)
• Additional information will be presented with
the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation
