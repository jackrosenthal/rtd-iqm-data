2.1.a

NOTE: All of the information and assumptions below are pre-COVID-19 and are
subject to change.
Purpose
To provide the Board with preliminary information regarding the Mid-Term Financial Plan and
Long-Range Plan. This information will also be used to inform the System Optimization Plan
that is scheduled to be completed and presented to the Board for approval this year.
You have received two documents: Base/ FasTracks Cash Flow for 2021-2026 and the RTD
Asset Management Plan.
RTD Asset Management Plan
This plan has been under development for the last 5 years. We are using the plan for purposes
of determining what funding is required to keep RTD’s assets in a State of Good Repair (SOGR).
The plan has been a multi-year effort between the Asset Management Division and all of the
Asset Stewards from around the District.
Pages 1-6 detail the assets that are recommended for funding each year based on the asset
class strategy for each asset. The first 6 pages represent the base system and each page is
divided between Capital asset requirements and Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
requirements. This information has not been modified based on funding availability.
Base/FasTracks Cash Flow for 2021-2016
The first page is the cash flow for the Base system (2021-2026) and the second page is the cash
flow for FasTracks (2021-2026.)
This format has been modified from the normal Mid-Term format based on previous feedback
from the Board regarding ability to determine what funds are available, what has to be paid,
and what the Board has discretion to fund.
Base System Cash Flow:
Line 1: Fare box revenue based on 2020 estimates. Includes an assumption of a fare rate
increase in both 2022 and 2025.
Line 2: Estimated reduction in fare box revenue due to the May 2020 service changes approved
by the RTD Board of Directors on March 24, 2020.
Line 3: Other operating revenue such as advertising and local service buy-ups.

Narrative for Potential Financial Scenarios for System Optimization

2.1.a

Line 4: Total operating revenue to include fare box revenues and other operating revenue.

Line 6: Grants based on 2020 appropriations
Line 7: This was excluded from this analysis
Line 8: This is only applicable to FasTracks
Line 9: This revenue is lumped in with other operating revenue in 2021-2025 Mid-Term
financial plan but is broken out in 2026 and beyond – it includes lease, rental, and
miscellaneous income
Line 10: Total non-operating revenue
Line 11: Total operating and non-operating revenue combined. This is the amount of total
funds available for distribution
Line 12: These are the payment on the outstanding T-Rex Bonds. These bonds will be paid off
in 2024. After these bonds are paid off, RTD will be subject to TABOR spending
limitations on the Base System
Line13: These are the payments due on the COPs in the base system. COPs were issued
routinely for bus and light rail vehicle purchases prior to 2017.
Line 15: There are no other financing payments on the base system.
Line 16: This is the sum of revenue bond payments, COPs, and savings.
Line 17: These are the funds that RTD has available to spend on operations, projects, and
assets.
Line 18: Operating and Maintenance costs taken from 2020 budget and inflated by CPI. In
2020, we reduced Administration costs by approximately 10%. These costs are not
restored in 2021.
Line 19: We have deducted the May 2020 service changes as approved by the RTD Board of
Directors on March 24, 2020. This assumes that these reductions would be permanent
beginning in 2021. Note that these 2021 reductions mean that the financially
constrained Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan will be predicated upon an
optimized system with fewer revenue service hours than we current provide. This
would have been the case even without the recent COVID-19 service reductions. The
financially unconstrained System Optimization Plan provides an opportunity for
additional service hours.
Line 20: We have estimated that we need to adjust costs downward by an additional amount
to be able to fund reserves, projects, and assets.

Line 5: Sales and Use tax – Based on September 2019 forecast

2.1.a

Line 22: Staff has assumed a contribution of $3 million to the reserve funds to try to maintain
and equivalence of 6 weeks of operating funds. This is less than the 3 months required
by Board policy.
Line 23: Funds available after deducting debt, operations & maintenance, and contribution to
reserves.
Line 24: RTD has made a verbal commitment to contributing $30 million to the SH 119 BRT
project in 2023. The difference between the $33 million listed and the $30 million
commitment is inflation.
Line 25: If buses are purchased for the SH 119 project, there is not sufficient room in any of
RTD’s facilities to house additional buses. Staff put a placeholder in the Mid-Term
Financial Plan several years ago to try to address this issue. There is a timing problem.
With the facility money not being available until 2025, a new facility will not be available
until 2027 or 2028. We have included in the scope of work for the Mobility Plan for the
Future the need to look at all of our facilities and reexamine location, capacity, and
technology. This is the only funding for facilities in the Mid-Term or Long-Range
Financial plan at this time.
Line 26: RTD would like to purchase some of the Burnham yard land to improve train
movements in the downtown corridor. We originally had the funds programmed in
2018 but currently CDOT is in negotiations to purchase the land from the railroad. We
have been told by CDOT that they wouldn’t be ready to discuss the land purchase with
us until the 2022 timeframe.
Line 27: We have pulled these electric bus purchases out of the Asset Management list because
we received two grants for these buses and infrastructure. One is a federal grant and
one is from the Volkswagen settlement.
Line 28: We have set aside funds for project and programs that are non-asset related. This
amount is very small and most likely will not come close to addressing the needs but this
is the recommendation for now.
Line 29: We looked at the Asset Management Plan list and were able to fund 70% of the list.
RTD should be funding between 80% and 90% of the list so assets don’t fall into a state
of disrepair, however funding is not available to achieve that level.
Line 30: The sum of lines 24 through 29.
Line 31: Line 23 – Line 30. This line is negative in year 2021 and 2022.

Line 21: The total of lines 18-20.

This means we cannot fund even 70% of the asset list until 2026. We are projecting by the end
of 2026 we will have a balance of $55 million. We need to have these funds available to
be able to balance between 2026 and 2050.

FasTracks Cash Flow 2021-2026

Line 1: Fare box revenue based on 2020 estimates. Includes an assumption of a fare rate
increase in both 2022 and 2025.
Line 2: Estimated reduction in fare box revenue due to the May 2020 service changes approved
by the RTD Board of Directors on March 24, 2020.
Line 3: Other operating revenue such as advertising and local service buy-ups.
Line 4: Total operating revenue to include fare box revenues and other operating revenue.
Line 5: Sales and Use tax – Based on September 2019 forecast
Line 6: Operating grants are assumed to start in 2022 based on federal guidelines
Line 7: This was excluded from this analysis
Line 8: There are no contributions in 2021-2026
Line 9: There is no other Non-Operating Revenue in 2021-2026
Line 10: Total non-operating revenue
Line 11: Total operating and non-operating revenue combined. This is the amount of total
funds available for distribution
Line 12: These are payments on outstanding bonds
Line13: These are the payments due on the COPs in the base system. COPs were issued
routinely for rail vehicle purchases prior to 2017.
Line 15: This is payments on the TABOR portion of the DTP payment and the TIFIA loan
Line 16: This is the sum of revenue bond payments, COPs, and savings.
Line 17: These are the funds that RTD has available to spend on operations, projects, and
assets.
Line 18: Operating and Maintenance costs taken from 2020 budget and inflated by CPI. In
2020, we reduced Administration costs by approximately 10%. These costs are not
restored in 2021.

2.1.a

Line 19: These costs include expenses related to FasTracks operations that are not allocated to
operations of specific corridors, including project closeout, ongoing engineering
support, Civic Center building rent, financial advisory services, and similar costs.
Line 20: We have deducted the May 2020 service changes as approved by the RTD Board of
Directors on March 24, 2020. This assumes that these reductions would be permanent
beginning in 2021. Note that these 2021 reductions mean that the financially
constrained Reimagine RTD System Optimization Plan will be predicated upon an
optimized system with fewer revenue service hours than we current provide. This
would have been the case even without the recent COVID-19 service reductions. The
financially unconstrained System Optimization Plan provides an opportunity for
additional service hours.
Line 21: We have estimated that we need to adjust costs downward by an additional amount
to be able to fund reserves, projects, and assets.
Line 22: The total of lines 18-20.
Line 23: The is the contribution from enhanced bus service that was capped in 2012 by the
Board of the Directors
Line 24: The FISA currently has a balance of $92.1 million as of year-end 2019. In order to
balance FasTracks these funds are being drawn down between 2021 and 2025.
Line 25: These are the Board Appropriated Reserve, Capital Acquisition Reserve, and the
Operating Reserve for FasTracks, and are set at three months of operating expenses.
Line 26: Total of lines 23-25.
Line 27: Funds available after deducting debt, operations & maintenance, and contribution to
reserves.
Line 28 and 29: Future commitments but not funded in 2021-2026
Line 30: Line reserved for future vehicle replacements in 2027-2050
Line 31: We looked at the Asset Management Plan list and were able to fund 70% of the list.
RTD should be funding between 80% and 90% of the list so assets don’t fall into a state
of disrepair, however funding is not available to achieve that level.
Line 32: The sum of lines 28 through 31
Line 33: Line 27 less Line 32
Line 34: Balances in years 2021 –2024. Is short $10 million in 2025 but has a surplus going into
2027 which is needed to balance future years.
