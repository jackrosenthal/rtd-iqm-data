BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

July 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to accept into the records the Regional Transportation District’s Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report, which includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2023.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required by
the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2023 and 2022 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Recommended Action.

Chair Davidson, Board Members and RTD service area residents,
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all information
presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these representations,
management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is designed both
to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile sufficient, reliable
information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The cost
of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive framework of internal
controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute assurance that the financial
statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General Manager and CEO, I assert
that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is complete and reliable in all
material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2023, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of this report in the Financial Section.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.

REGIONAL TRANSPORATION DISTRICT
Introduction
December 31, 2023 and 2022

1.C.1.a

GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
RTD provides public transportation services to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County of
Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.1 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that is elected directly by a constituency
to serve four-year staggered terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents
per director district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the
agency’s annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert
with local, state, and federal agencies.
In 2023, RTD employed 2,815 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing 1,660 individuals. Besides
its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding
purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood,
and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All RTD
departments are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager and CEO
on or before August of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests as the

starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then presents
this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15. The Board of
Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a final budget
no later than December 31.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplementary Information
Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region, which is considered as the Denver metropolitan area. It is
the most populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in
the Denver Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse
mix of industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a
geographic balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2024 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy is stable. Although economic activity has remained fairly steady while persistent inflation
exceeding historical averages and a tight labor market are expected to continue to present
challenges.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for the Denver Metro Area:

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local
governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District
exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31, 2005. On
November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from TABOR’s revenue and
spending limitations for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of
the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding for which full defeasance will occur in November 2024 which will result in

Introduction

1.C.1.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORATION DISTRICT
Introduction
December 31, 2023 and 2022

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% for the Base System to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the
FasTracks transit improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any
revenue and spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income
generated by the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital
improvements included in the FasTracks program. After the FasTracks debt is repaid in 2050,
the District’s 0.4% sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit
system financed through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire beginning in
2051.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement forecasting plan for RTD including both
the Base System and FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation
planning program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG), the Metropolitan Planning Organization. While the MTFP is developed
separately for the Base System and FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium
and long-range Financial Plan which includes the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial
information forms the basis for the development of RTD’s annual budget. In October 2023, the
Board of Directors approved the 2024-2029 MTFP.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
initiatives and activities, and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with RTD’s 20212026 Strategic Plan.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management.

9
Packet Pg. 13

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

approximately 50% of RTD’s revenues being subject to TABOR growth limitations beginning in
2025.

1.C.1.a

As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to
evaluate RTD’s compliance. RTD’s single audit for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 found
no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.
Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its Base System and FasTracks sales
and use taxes. Base System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors
Service as “Aa1”, by Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
FasTracks Bonds that are secured by a first lien on the Districts 0.4% sales tax and a subordinate
lien on the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard and
Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
cash and liquidity tier investments for the year was 5.1%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability, and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $424,000 per person and
$1,195,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute for
claims arising on or after January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention for worker’s compensation
claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered by purchased insurance up
to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a commuter rail railroad
liability policy of $323,000,000 to cover the cap on damages set by federal law; a Commercial
Crime Policy with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for Commercial Driver’s License (CDL)

Testing Performance Bond; $4,000,000 Workers’ Compensation Bond; fiduciary coverage on the

maintains a Public Official Bond for 15 officials totaling $150,000, Commercial General Liability
covering Employment Practices Liability and Police Activity Liability, $10,000,000 as well
$23,703,600 per occurrence for LRV-only damage resulting from a derailment.

OTHER INFORMATION
Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. RTD will submit its 2023 Report for award
of this Certificate.
To receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must publish
an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the contents
of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy both GAAP and
applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements, hence the impending
submittal.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each member of the department for their
contributions. Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its governance.

Sincerely,

Debra A. Johnson
General Manager and CEO

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of
Regional Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 and
the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements,
as listed in the table of contents.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
respective financial position of the enterprise fund and aggregate remaining fund information of Regional
Transportation District as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the respective changes in its financial position
and, where applicable, its cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation,
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not
a guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from
fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,

substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a

error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include
examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information
and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide
us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.
Other Supplementary Information
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise Regional Transportation District's basic financial statements. The supplementary information, as
identified in the table of contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of
the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and
relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements.
The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial
statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial
statements themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the supplementary information is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report.
The other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in RTD’s financial position. It should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of
dollars.
Financial Highlights
Following the COVID-19 Pandemic as well as completion of several transit service expansionary projects,
RTD has undertaken several initiatives such as implementation of a System Optimization Plan and the 20212026 Strategic Plan. Strategic Priorities encapsulated within the Strategic Plan include RTD providing
Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership and Financial Success. Strategic Initiatives
created from the Strategic Priorities include a focus on providing a Welcoming Transit Environment, People
Power and Back to Basics as RTD continues to migrate from completion of the large FasTracks expansionary
projects to redirecting additional efforts to operations and maintenance.
Inflation and supply chain issues continue to be challenging for RTD and mitigation efforts through
contractual arrangements have avoided any material disruptions while also supporting budget certainty.
Public Transit services are highly dependent on people power and significant efforts have been undertaken
to shore-up chronic front-line staffing shortfalls which have been endemic throughout the industry.
Focusing on people power has resulted in steady improvements in reducing vacancies while mitigating
service disruptions. RTD has also implemented significant improvements to enhance personal security for
employees and customers which has proven challenging in the past due to societal issues. RTD has
expanded its transit police force and outreach efforts while reducing reliance on contracted security services.
Several debt refinancings for interest savings over recent years has reduced debt service requirements. In
addition, the remaining open pension plan was closed to new employees in January 2023 and replaced by
a defined contribution plan. An 18-month fare study and equity analysis was undertaken to respond to
stakeholder feedback which emphasized fare affordability, fare system simplicity and equity. Modifications
to RTD’s fare structure resulting from this study were implemented in January 2024. Each of these items
have resulted in significant improvements while also reducing financial risk and improving RTD’s financial
results and position.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,577,526 and $3,558,484, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2023, was $566,708 compared to $480,405 in 2022. RTD’s
2023 unrestricted net position was positively impacted by positive cash flows resulting from efficient
expenditures in alignment with the Strategic Plan, reduced debt service, improved investment returns and
cash funding for state of good repair needs while year-over-year revenue remained flat.
The net position of RTD increased by $19,042 (0.5%) during the current year compared to an increase of
$96,068 (2.8%) in the previous year. The increase in 2023 resulted from the aforementioned efforts while
2022 was positively impacted by final draws from COVID-19 federal grant relief apportionments.
RTD is heavily reliant on sales and use tax collections. Collections in 2023 were flat compared to 2022;
however, improvements in investment returns and additional grant revenue collections assisted in offsetting
increases in expenditures. Transit boarding decreases during COVID-19 and shifting travel patterns have

RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were flat in
2023 compared to 2022 which was expected after a significant recovery in collections following the economic
recovery from COVID-19 impacts. A portion of RTD’s revenue collections will be subject to TABOR revenue
growth limitations beginning in 2025 and RTD is undertaking efforts to diversify its revenue portfolio while
also seeking options to mitigate potential impacts of TABOR.
For 2023, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $1,052,717 compared to a loss of $971,674 for 2022. The increase in operating loss for
2023 was primarily due to increased operating expenses from restored services, contractual wage increases,
increased contracted services costs and recognition of additional expenses associated with retirement plans.
RTD anticipates operating losses each year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use
tax, grant revenues and other miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $125,292 (4.2%) and decreased $223,814 (6.9%) in 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Outstanding debt decreased in 2023 and 2022 due to payment of outstanding principal
balances through scheduled debt service and refinancing of certain outstanding obligations for interest
savings and reduction of outstanding principal.
Capital grants and local contributions increased $38,035 (241.1%) in 2023 after decreasing $1,523 (8.9%)
in 2022. The increase in 2023 was a result of reconciling remaining, outstanding expenditures and drawing
grant funding under the FasTracks project as it winds down to completion.
Grant operating assistance decreased $72,554 (23.6%) in 2023 as COVID-19 relief apportionments have
ended. Grant operating assistance increased $7,990 (2.7%) in 2022 due to continued COVD-19 federal
assistance. This federal COVID-19 relief funding was 100% drawn at the end of 2023 and no additional
similar COVID-19 operating assistance grants are anticipated.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $238,499 (4.0%) in 2023 and decreased $337,952
(5.4%) in 2022 primarily due to depreciation.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net

24
Packet Pg. 28

resulted in only 5% of fare revenue as a total of all revenues. This has not contributed to unexpected
financial constraints and requires no significant financial adjustments since fares have historically comprised
a relatively small percentage of revenue.

1.C.1.a

position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital
grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and a 0.4%
sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax was used to fund the FasTracks build-out program and
provide funding for operation and maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced
transit services in the District. Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local
financial assistance, investment income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

In 2023, current assets increased by $84,656 (9.61%) primarily due to increased outstanding grants
receivable due to reconciliation of outstanding expenditures remaining on the FasTracks project as well as
improved returns on investments.
In 2023, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $238,499 (4%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $230,255 (5.6%) in 2023 primarily due to reduction of debt
through refinancings for interest savings.
The net position of RTD increased by $19,042 (.5%) during 2023 compared to an increase of $96,068
(2.8%) in the previous year. The lower increase in 2023 was due to sales tax revenues leveling out and the
expiration of federal funding related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in addition to increases in net pension

The information contained in the following condensed information tables is used as the basis for the revenue
and expense discussion surrounding RTD’s activities for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, 2022
and 2021.

1.C.1.a

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 4.9% of total revenues in 2023 and 5.8% in 2022,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares decreased by $11,758 (15.6%) in 2023 compared
to a decrease of $3,631 (4.6%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was due to the Zero Fare for Better
Air program which allowed customers to use RTD services with no fare for two months in 2023 and one
month in 2022 through a state sponsored grant program, leading to state grant funding received to replace
the lost fare revenue and recognized as grant revenue. Ridership remained relatively flat in both years and
no fare changes were enacted.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.1% and 0.2% of total revenues in
2023 and 2022. Advertising and other income decreased $1,188 (43.9%) in 2023 compared to a decrease
of $1,490 (35.5%) in 2022. The decreases in both years were primarily due to the advertising contract
being treated as a lease under GASB 87 and the associated revenue being reclassified to nonoperating
income.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 66.6% and 66.3% of RTD’s total revenues in 2023 and
2022, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated combined 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the
District. Sales and use tax increased $2,987 (0.3%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $98,172 (13.0%)
The accelerated growth in spending experienced in 2022 slowed significantly in 2023, leading to a minimal
increase in sales and use tax revenues.
Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 18.2% and 23.8% of total revenues
in 2023 and 2022. Grant operating assistance decreased $72,554 (23.6%) in 2023 compared to an increase
of $98,172 (13.0%) in 2022. The increase in 2022 resulted from drawing remaining outstanding grant
apportionments awarded to RTD for COVID relief. The 2023 decrease occurred due to the exhaustion of
the additional COVID relief grant funding during 2022.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 4.5% and -0.1% of total revenues in 2023 and 2022.
Investment income increased $59,115 (5,890.3%) in 2023 compared to a decrease of $3,405 (-141.8%) in
2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from increased investable funds combined with higher fixed income
yields. The decrease in 2022 resulted from mark-to-market adjustments with rising interest rates.

1.C.1.a

Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.4% and 2.7% of total revenues in
2023 and 2022. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income decreased $16,835 (1.4%) in 2023 compared to an increase
of $22,372 (186.5%) in 2022. The increase in 2022 was primarily due to the receipt of a returned credit
risk premium associated with a prior year federal loan culminating in a decrease in 2023 due to the onetime occurrence of this receipt.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 4.2% and 1.2%
of total revenues in 2023 and 2022. Capital grants and local contributions increased $38,035 (243.1%) in
2023 and decreased $1,523 (-8.9%) in 2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from final reconciliation and
closure of grants remaining from the FasTracks expansion program while the decrease in 2022 resulted due
to a timing issue as grant close-outs were finalized.

Salaries and wages – Other than depreciation, salary and wage expense is the largest expense category
accounting for 19.7% and 19.1.% of the total RTD expenses in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Salary and
wage expenses increased by $21,921 (9.6%) in 2023 compared to a increase of $42,248 (22.8%) in 2022.
The increase in both years was primarily due to contracted wage increase and inflationary adjustments.
Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 8.9% and 8.8% of total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Fringe
benefits increased by $8,641 (8.2%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $44,166 (72.9%) in 2021.
Increases are primarily tied to wages through payroll taxes in addition to inflationary increases for benefits
such as health and welfare. In addition, the large increase in 2022 was due to recognition of higher pension
liabilities resulting from investment market underperformance.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 4.2% of the total
expenses in 2023 and 3.7% in 2022. Materials and supplies expenses increased $9,708 (22.2%) in 2023
compared to an increase of $4,251 (10.7%) in 2022. The increase in both years primarily resulted from
higher-than-normal inflation and supply-chain constraints.
Services – Services expense accounted for 7.7% of total expenses in 2023 and 6.9% 2022. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense increased
$14,707 (17.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $8,305 (11.2%) in 2022. The higher increase in 2022
resulted from restoration of some service and both years incurred increases due to inflation.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.5% of total expenses in both 2023 and 2022. Utilities expense includes
electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction power for
rail lines. Utilities expense increased $1,109 (6.0%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $922 (5.3%) in
2022. These increases are primarily the result of inflationary pressures rather than changes in volume of
utilities consumed.

1.C.1.a

Insurance – Insurance accounted for 1.1% of total expenses in both 2023 and 2022. Insurance expense
includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as the
premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance expense
increased $928 (7.0%) in 2023 and increased $3,117 (30.8%) in 2022. The increase in 2023 resulted from
adverse claims experience while the increase in 2022 was due to state increases in the caps for liability,
higher worker’s compensation reserves and restoration of some service.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 17.6% and
16.4% of the total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for Bus, Commuter Rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs increased $27,333 (13.9%) in 2023 and increased $21,269 (12.2%) in 2022. The
increase in 2023 was driven by expiration of certain large, fixed route contracts with inflationary increases
included in the new contracts. The increase in 2022 was due to some restoration of service and contractual
increases.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.2% and 0.1% of total expenses in
2023 and 2022, respectively. Leases and rentals expense increased $952 (61.8%) in 2023 compared to a
decrease of $103 (-6.3%) in 2022. This category of expense is relatively immaterial and tends to fluctuate
with vacancy changes.
Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.3% of total expenses in 2023 and 2022. Miscellaneous expenses
increased $1,135 (34.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $1,050 (47.4%) in 2022. This category
includes additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 26.8% and 30.0% of the total expenses
in 2023 and 2022, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense decreased
$18,337 (5.1%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $15,040 (4.4%) in 2022. The decrease in 2023 primarily
resulted from certain assets reaching full depreciation while the increase in 2022 was due to recognition of
amortization expenses related to GASB 87.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 10.6% and 11.6% of the total expenses
in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest expense decreased $3,729 (2.7%) in 2023 and decreased $15,759
(10.2%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances resulting from
paying down principal as well as refinancing of debt for interest savings.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.4% and 0.6% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Other expenses
increased $11,995 (232.7%) in 2023 and decreased $1,667 (24.6%) in 2022. The changes in both years
resulted from activity related to retirement of capital assets.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include land and right-of-way, buildings and improvements,
leasehold improvements, revenue and non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of

accumulated depreciation in 2023 was $5,726,641 compared to $5,965,140 in 2022. The decrease in capital
assets in 2023 was $238,499 (4.0%) compared to a decrease of $337,952 (5.4%) in 2022. The decrease
in both years was due to additional accumulated depreciation.

Outstanding debt – Outstanding debt includes sales tax revenue bonds, certificates of participation, a
purchase and assignment agreement and a lease liability as a result of the implementation of Government
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement 87. The 2023 outstanding debt was $2,884,276 compared
to $3,009,568 in 2022. Outstanding debt decreased by $125,291 (4.2%) in 2023 and decreased by $223,814
(6.9%) in 2022. The decrease in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt with the
outstanding debt in both years also decreasing due to the completion of several refinancings for interest
savings.
Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by pledged future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue
bonds were $2,292,445 and $2,360,680 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The sales tax
revenue bonds decreased $68,235 (2.8%) in 2023 compared to an increase of $303,805 (14.8%) in 2022.
The decrease in 2023 was the result of the issuance of Series 2023A bonds, the proceeds from which were
used to refinance other debt issuances for interest savings. The increase in 2022 was a result of the
issuance of taxable (convertible to tax-exempt) Series 2022AB bonds, the proceeds from which were used
to refinance other debt issuances for interest savings.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations
issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation and component unit of
RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as its
own debt. Certificates outstanding were $377,596 and $453,994 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $76,398 (16.8%) in 2023 compared to a decrease of
$501,788 (52.5%) in 2022. The decrease in both years is due to payment of outstanding principal and
refinancings for interest savings.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2023 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 69.9% and 66.2% of the total revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2023 sales and use taxes increased 0.3% from the prior year indicating a
slowdown and recessionary pressure experienced in the local Denver economy compared to the substantial
increases seen 2022.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 5.8% of total revenues in both 2023 and 2022. Passenger fare collections decreased in both
years due to planned programs to require no fares from customers during certain periods of each year.
Lost fare revenue due to these programs was replaced with Colorado state grants in both years.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 18.2% and 23.8% of total revenues in 2023
and 2022, respectively. These grant apportionments primarily result from information provided by transit
agencies to the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) National Transit Database (NTD). This funding was
larger in 2022 due to additional COVID relief grants.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)
NOTE A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a State Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to
implement by March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at
least 20% of RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended
requiring RTD to increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003,
the Bill was amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated
by private transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a
system under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager and CEO appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority
serves as a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14), as
amended, which provides guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the
primary government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the
underlying financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component
unit in RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. No
financial activity occurred during 2023 or 2022, and no separately audited financial
statements were prepared either year, for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried
Pension Plan and RTD Salaried 401(a) Retirement Plan meet these fiduciary criteria and has

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)
included the financial activity of each in 2023 and 2022 in the financial statement section of
this report.

The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

3. Basis of Accounting

1.C.1.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Accounts receivables are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other contractual
arrangements including unspent bond proceeds.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata shares of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD as of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively was $134,609
and $138,337.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years

1.C.1.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be recognized
as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net assets that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket books and day pass
tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Stored value sales are evaluated for
revenue recognition at the time services are performed. Sales of college-based passes,
which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as unearned revenue
then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount recognized
determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters covered.
Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31 of a given
year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of
each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of months of
the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on net taxable
sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use inside the
District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series
2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A, 2021B, 2022A,
2022B and 2023A bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of
debt service. Sales and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of

1.C.1.a

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,609,347 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year were $111,745 and pledged revenues received were $858,133.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by the State of Colorado through
the Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue
grants to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $39,216 and $12,490 in 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $234,488 and $307,042 in 2023 and
2022, respectively. Other contributed revenue was $14,465 and $3,156 in 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
RTD was awarded additional COVID-19 relief funding of $53,241 through the American
Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) Additional Assistance in July 2022. These funds were expended
and drawn in 2023.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate
measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.
17. Pensions
For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT

December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years after 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Leases-GASB 87
RTD is a lessee for noncancellable leases of land, office space and equipment. RTD
recognizes a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset (lease asset) in the
statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease liability at the present
value of payments expected to be made during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
liability is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments made. The lease asset is
initially measured as the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for lease payments
made at or before the lease commencement date, plus certain initial direct costs.
Subsequently, the lease asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over its useful life.
Key estimates and judgments related to leases include how RTD determines (1) the
discount rate it uses to discount the expected lease payments to present value, (2) lease
term, and (3) lease payments.
•

•

RTD uses the interest rate charged by the lessor as the discount rate. When
the interest rate charged by the lessor is not provided, RTD generally uses its
estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease payments
included in the measurement of the lease liability are composed of fixed
payments and purchase option price that RTD is reasonably certain to exercise.

RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease asset and liability if certain changes occur that are expected
to significantly affect the amount of the lease liability.
Lease assets are reported with other capital assets and lease liabilities are reported with
the short-term portion combined with long-term debt and the long-term portion is stated
separately on the statement of net position. RTD is a lessor for noncancellable leases of
buildings, land, office space, parking space and use of RTD physical resources for
advertising space. RTD recognizes a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources in
the statement of net position.
At the commencement of a lease, RTD initially measures the lease receivable at the present
value of payments expected to be received during the lease term. Subsequently, the lease
receivable is reduced by the principal portion of lease payments received. The deferred
inflow of resources is initially measured as the initial amount of the lease receivable,
adjusted for lease payments received at or before the lease commencement date.

Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Key estimates and judgments include how RTD determines the discount rate it uses to
discount the expected lease receipts to present value, lease term, and lease receipts.
•

•

RTD uses the actual rate charged to lessees as the discount rate for leases.
When the interest rate charged to lessees is not provided, RTD generally uses
its estimated incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for leases.
The lease term includes the noncancellable period of the lease. Lease receipts
included in the measurement of the lease receivable is composed of fixed
payments from the lessee.

RTD monitors changes in circumstances that would require a remeasurement of its lease
and will remeasure the lease receivable and deferred inflows of resources if certain
changes occur that are expected to significantly affect the amount of the lease receivable.
20. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 100
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB
Statement No. 100, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which enhances
the accounting and financial reporting requirements for accounting changes and
error corrections. The provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's financial
statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.

GASB 101
In June 2022, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB
Statement No. 101, Compensated Absences, which updates the recognition and
measurement guidance for compensated absences under a unified model. This
statement requires that liabilities for compensated absences be recognized for
leave that has not been used and leave that has been used but not yet paid in
cash or settled through noncash means and establishes guidance for measuring a
liability for leave that has not been used. It also updates disclosure requirements
for compensated absences. The provisions of this statement are effective for RTD's
financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2024.

GASB 102
In December 2023, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 102, Certain Risk Disclosures, which requires a government to
assess whether a concentration or constraint makes the primary government or
other reporting units that report a liability for revenue debt vulnerable to the risk
of a substantial impact. It also requires a government to assess whether an event
or events associated with a concentration or constraint that could cause the
substantial impact have occurred, have begun to occur, or are more likely than not
to occur within 12 months of the date of the financial statements are issued. If
certain criteria are met for a concentration or constraint, disclosures are required

53

Packet Pg. 57

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

Subsequently, the deferred inflow of resources is recognized as revenue over the life of the
lease term.

Statement No. 103, Financial Reporting Model Improvements. This statement
establishes new accounting and financial reporting requirements, or modifies
existing requirements, related to:
• Managements’ discussion and analysis
• Unusual or infrequent items
• Presentations of the proprietary fund statements of revenues, expenses,
and changes in fund net position
• Information about major component units in basic financial statements
• Budgetary comparison information
• Financial trends information in the statistical section
The provisions of this statement are effective for the RTD’s financial statements
ending December 31, 2026.

NOTE B – DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS
Deposits
RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA). Under
this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with pledged
collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or held in
escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by rule and
regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository and held
in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be held is clearly
identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of public deposits
accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public depository has the right
at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained or pledged and is always
entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $6,454 and $13,436
collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department or agent
but not in RTD’s name.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

Fiduciary fund investments of $195,235 and $169,980 at December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, consist of a broad spectrum of individual holdings of cash and cash equivalents,
equity mutual funds and fixed income mutual funds. Because these investments are primarily
mutual funds consisting of multiple investments and contain equity investments, credit ratings
of the underlying portfolios are not available.

Concentration of Credit Risk
Enterprise Funds
It is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment funds
shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a
specific maturity, a specific issue, or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the
portfolio should, however, be flexible depending upon the outlook for the economy and the
securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2023, RTD followed these limits. As of December 31, 2022,
RTD was following limitations set out in RTD’s previous investment policy limitations.

1 In the event that one or more nationally recognized statistical rating agency rates such agency obligations below

the highest rating category, but no lower than one of the two highest rating categories, RTD’s funds may continue to
be invested in agencies if such investments satisfy the requirements of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) which limits the maturity
from the date of settlement to three years, provided that the book value limits of CRS 24.75.601.1 (m) (II) shall not
apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in
agencies, with any more than 25% being invested in any one agency.

Proceeds from the issuance of RTD’s obligations are invested in accordance with legal
documentation governing the transaction, notwithstanding any provisions of RTD’s investment
policy to the contrary, and do not fall within the maximum exposure limits listed above.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, RTD had $121,248 and $139,765 of cash and investments
that were restricted under the provisions of bond agreements.

Fair Value Measurements
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
can access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ),
Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.
Examples include investment manager pricing for private placement, private equities and hedge
funds.

(1) Real estate investment trusts invest primarily in commercial and residential real estate. The fund focuses on
properties with high quality physical improvements, stabilized occupancies and competitive positions within their
markets that produce a relatively high level of current income combined with moderate appreciation potential.
(2) The common collective trusts measured at the NAV invest primarily in asset-backed securities, corporate bonds,
U.S. government agency securities and foreign common stocks. The investment objectives include matching the
return of the Barclay’s Aggregate Bond Index through investment in substantially all of the bonds contained in that
index and matching the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index (Net) benchmark.

Investments in Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share
RTD holds shares or interests in investment companies where the fair value of in the
investments is measured on a recurring basis using net asset value per share (or its
equivalent) of the investment companies as a practical expedient.
RTD’s investments in the Colorado Local Government Liquid Asset Trust (COLOTRUST)
are measured at the net asset value method. There are no unfunded commitments, the
redemption frequency is daily, and there is no redemption notice period. RTD’s
investment in COLOTRUST was $43,473 and $42,215 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively.
Investments in Entities That Calculate Amortized Cost
RTD’s investment in Colorado Statewide Investment Pool (CSIP) is measured at amortized cost
and, therefore, is not categorized in a level. The trust is similar to a money market fund, with
each share valued at $1.00. RTD’s investment in CSIP was $33,603 and $31,910 as of December
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

2022AB and 2023A are secured by a pledge of future sales and use tax revenues. These taxsecured future liabilities of $3,609,347 remain outstanding through 2050. The pledged revenue

The sales tax bonds are secured by RTD’s 1.0% sales and use tax for which debt service payments
are withheld by a trustee from the monthly remittance prior to the Colorado Department of
Revenue remitting such taxes to RTD. Withholdings are equivalent to a proportionate monthly
amount of the annual principal and semi-annual interest payments and are held by the trustee
until such debt service payments are satisfied.
Certificates are issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation
and component unit of RTD. The Authority issued Certificates with the proceeds used to acquire
certain equipment, facilities, and infrastructure to be used by RTD as well as for construction of
the North Metro (N Line) commuter rail line. RTD leases the equipment acquired and elements
constructed with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate master lease purchase
agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates and the capital
lease agreements as its own obligations.

65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after attaining age 50. The ATU Plan was
subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011, for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, their beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus interest.
Prior to 2023, upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will
be paid in a lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary. One June 2, 2023, the Board
of Trustees agreed that the death benefit will no longer be paid out of the Pension Plan. This
benefit shall be paid pursuant to the ATU Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust effective January
1, 2023.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided they have worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An individual
will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social Security
Administration. Effective January 1, 2011, the years of credited service needed to qualify for a
disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided they had worked for
at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if they have worked for at least 20 years in covered employment and
terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more years
of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after age

Contribution (ARC) is less than 11.0% of payroll, pension benefits would be restored in a certain
priority order.
On February 11, 2022, the Regional Transportation District and the Amalgamated Transit Union,
Local 1001, signed a Memorandum of Understanding where the parties agreed “the Employer is
obligated to pay benefits to eligible participants and beneficiaries pursuant to the Pension Plan
for as long as any such individual remains entitled to benefits under the terms of the Plan.”

The plan closed to new hires effective January 1, 2023. Employer
contribution rates are based on a CBA. Effective January 1, 2022, RTD
is contributing 15% of pay and members will contribute 5% of pay.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a Single Discount Rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
6.50%; the municipal bond rate is 4.05% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than
the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”); and the resulting Single
Discount Rate is 6.50%.
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate would be equal to the actuarially
determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those assumptions, the
pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future
benefit payments of current plan members.

Single discount rate is 6.50%

The rate of investment return on the market values of assets during the 2022 measurement
period was -11.59%. the rate of investment return on the actuarial value of assets was 5.06%,
which led to a $5,100 loss primarily due to worse than assumed investment experience.
The plan had a gain of $2,400 due to removal of the funeral benefit from the Pension Plan. The
plan had a loss of $14,400 under liabilities due to higher-than-expected salary increases for
continuing active members.

Contributions
Contributions are made in accordance with the CBA. The plan had contributions during the
measurement year of $176,239, including a one-time, lump sum payment of $160,000 in May
2022 following signing of the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement. Employer
contributions were increased to 15% as part of the new CBA from previous 13% contribution.
Employee contributions remain at 5%. RTD has included the full amount of the actuarially
determined net pension liability in accordance with financial reporting requirements. RTD is
current in making all required contributions under the CBA.

Pension Expense and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources

Salaried Pension Plan - Defined Benefit (2023)
Plan Description
The Regional Transportation District Salaried Employees’ Pension Plan provides coverage for all
full-time salaried employees who were hired prior to January 1, 2008. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Benesys.

Benefits Provided
Normal retirement eligibility age is 65 with five years of credited service; monthly benefit 2.5%
of average final compensation times credited service. Early retirement age is 55 with five years
of credited service, the monthly benefit if one retires or terminates from active status on or after
age 55 is reduced 1/30 for each year less than age 60. If the employee terminates from active
status prior to age 55, the normal retirement benefit is reduced 1/15 for each year between ages
60 and 65 and 1/30 for each year less than age 60.
The disability provisions apply to fully vested participants who are totally and permanently
disabled and entitled to a Social Security disability award. The payout amount is the unreduced
accrued normal pension retirement, payable upon approval for Social Security disability.
Termination eligibility is five years of credited service, otherwise a lump sum payment will be
made equal to the present value of the age 65 accrued benefits payable in lieu of all other
benefits.
Forms of annuity payments for normal retirement are 50% joint and survivor if married, otherwise
retirement benefits are for a single annuity with no survivor option. Optional forms of retirement
benefits are 25%, 50%, 66-2/3% or 100% joint and survivor annuity with five-year or ten-year
certain and life annuity.
Credited service is one year for each calendar year of 1,000 hours of service (except years and
completed months in the year of transfer). Credited service applies to vesting and service for
retirement benefit eligibility. Average final compensation is the average of the participant's
highest consecutive 36 months of compensation in the last 120 months of credited service
immediately preceding the calendar month in which retirement occurs. Compensation excludes
bonuses, severance pay, long-term disability pay and other extra compensation paid in the fiscal

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the RTD’s salaried employees’ base compensation. Due to the decreasing active
population and resulting reduction in future expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding
policy effective January 1, 2013, where the recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1
million is made to the Trust each year. This funding policy was established with the goal of
achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032; however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board
adopted a new funding policy effective in 2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed
for an amount to be contributed to keep the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations
from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended
contribution can fluctuate annually due to such factors as projected total base compensation,
investment results, and retirement patterns of participants. RTD contributed $15 million in 2023
and $8.4 million in 2022.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with a date of January 1,
2022 using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the
measurement with a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2022:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment Rate of Return

2.75%
3.70% – 6.45%, age-based
7.00%, net of investment expenses

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of December 31, 2022 (for disclosure purposes for the Fiscal Year
Ending December 31, 2023) are summarized in the following table and reflect assumed long-term
expected real rates of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the disclosure is based:

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2023 and 2022 (Dollars in Thousands)

The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the net pension liability as of December 31, 2023 calculated using
the discount rate of 7.00%, as well as the net pension liability if it were calculated using a
discount rate that is 1 percentage point lower or 1 percentage point higher than the current
rate:

Employer contributions after the measurement date of $15,000 will be recognized as a reduction
of the net pension liability in the year ended December 31, 2023. Other amounts reported as
deferred outflow of resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions will be
recognized in pension expense as follows:

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a
building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return are
developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2022, are summarized in the following data and

RTD Plan – 401(a) Defined Contribution
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008 for which RTD
currently contributes the board approved 9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions
totaled $7,813 and $7,191 in 2023 and 2022, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to
this plan. Membership was 849 and 710 active employees in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
RTD/ATU 1001 401(a) Defined Contribution Plan and 457 (b) Deferred Compensation
Plan
This plan became available for new members of ATU 1001 hired on or after January 1, 2023.
Eligible employees include any newly hired member of the ATU who are 19 years old in addition
to Part Time Retirees (as defined in the CBA). Eligibility for the 457 (b) plan begins on the first
day of the month following completion of election form for Pre-tax and/or Roth contributions to
the Plan. Eligibility for the 401(a) Plan begins on the employee’s date of hire or immediately for
Part-Time Retirees. Contributions under the 457 (b) Plan can be made by the employee up to
the applicable annual IRS limits, including catch-up and Roth (after-tax) Contributions. RTD will

For the year ended 2022 the employer recognized pension expense of $3,196. The employer
reported deferred outflows and inflows of resources related to pensions from the following
resources:

make a Non-Elective Contribution each pay period to the 401(a) Plan equal to 9% of each eligible
employees per-pay-period Compensation. Employee contributions (Pre-tax and/or Roth
Contributions) to the 457(b) plan will be matched by RTD equal to 100% up to 5% of the
employee’s per-pay-period compensation. Employees are always fully vested under the 457(b)
plan. Under the ATU 401(a) plan, 20% vesting will occur for each full year of completed service,
with 100% vesting occurring after five years of completed service, upon attaining age of 65, or
upon death or disability. Part-time Retirees are fully always vested. 2023 contributions by RTD
under the 401(a) plan were $896. RTD made an additional match of $281 to the 457(b) plan.
Employee contributions during 2023 to the 457(b) plan were $315. As of December 31, 2023,
there were 369 employees participating in the plan.
Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971 between Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Local 1001 and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver, through
July 3, 1974 and RTD thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division, employees of
other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The Trust
agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as there
continues to be a CBA between the ATU and RTD.
The Trust provides health benefits (hospital, medical, dental, vision, life and short-term disability)
for represented employees of RTD and certain officers of the ATU and health care benefits for
retired employees who actively worked 600 hours or more per quarter. The Trust is funded
through contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan
contributions is set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $26,524 and $23,877 for the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for
felonious assault for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and
short-term disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include
financial information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the
Trust: RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado
80014-2602.
Other Post Employment Benefits
Prior to the closure of the ATU 1001 Pension plan to new hires beginning January 1, 2023 there
was a $2 funeral benefit paid to survivors of retirees when they die. To ensure this benefit
continues to be available to all ATU members, regardless of their hire date, trustees of the plan
voted in 2023 to move this benefit out of the pension plan and into the Health and Welfare plan
discussed above. After an actuarial review, RTD has determined that the net OPEB liability is not
material and therefore did not apply the provisions of GASB 74 or 75.
RTD Employees Deferred Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees (with the
exception below) and permits them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years.
Under the terms of the Plan, the unearned compensation is available to participants upon
termination, retirement, death or in the event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial
hardship. RTD makes no contributions to this plan as contributions are voluntarily made by RTD

Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
As of December 31, 2023, RTD had a commitment to provide $65,637 in matching funds in order
to receive $142,018 in future federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of fixed route services not to exceed 58% as required by state law. As of December 31,
2023, 55.28% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors operating
under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD was mandated to
provide complementary paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed
route system. This service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation service.
Customers eligible for Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an
RTD fixed route. Since September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with the ADA
requirement to provide complementary paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to
use the fixed route system.
Future Commitments under Construction Contracts
RTD has no individual material commitments under construction contracts but will continue to
incur construction costs related to maintaining infrastructure in a state of good repair in
accordance with standards of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. Many infrastructure
assets will begin to reach the end of their useful life benchmarks indicating a need for repair and
replacement; however, specific commitments have not yet been entered.

The projected amounts include an estimation for certain future inflation indexes as required by
the concessionaire agreement. These inflation indexes will be adjusted annually as projects are
revised.

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Company, Inc. (Mansfield) for diesel fuel for buses. The contract
is structured as a single year contract. RTD estimates 2024 usage of approximately 6.5 million
gallons: 3.90 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 2.60 million gallons of RTD’s private contractors’
usage.
The estimated locked-in price commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2024 is for 6.5 million
gallons of diesel fuel for both RTD and private contractors at $2.9894 per gallon or $19,431.

Contingencies

RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
reviews by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). Although the outcome of any such review
cannot be predicted, it is management’s opinion these reviews will not result in liabilities to such
an extent that they would materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance
RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported
when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. In addition, RTD offers a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee
benefits program in which costs are recognized as they are incurred.
RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018, and
before January 1, 2022. For claims that arise on or after January 1, 2022, RTD’s liability is limited
to $424 per person and $1,195 per occurrence.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims more
than $2,000. The number of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

Federal Grants

RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management Division determines incurred claims by investigating
the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement
of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and worker’s
compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to several pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims, or
labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
In 2018, Denver Transit Partners, LLC (DTP), RTD’s concessionaire for its Eagle P3 Project, filed
a lawsuit asserting force majeure and change in law claims and damages of approximately $111
million against RTD. DTP claimed that the Colorado Public Utilities Commission and/or the Federal
Railroad Administration created new interpretations of existing regulations and that DTP was
therefore entitled to risk allocation in its favor of costs incurred. A four-week bench trial on the
claims began on September 21, 2020. On February 10, 2023, the court issued its Findings of Fact,
Conclusions of Law and Order for Entry of Judgment finding in favor of RTD on DTP’s above
claims. DTP filed its notice of appeal on March 30, 2023. Briefing in the Colorado Court of Appeals
was completed on January 23, 2024, and oral argument was held on April 16, 2024. DTP also
filed a bill of costs against RTD as the prevailing party on RTD’s counterclaims for approximately
$2.2 million, which costs were denied by the court. On May 9, the Colorado Court of Appeals
issued its opinion affirming the District Court’s judgement in RTD’s favor, agreeing that regulators
applied existing law and no change in law occurred. In response to the May 9 decision by the
Colorado Court of Appeals, DTP filed a petition for a rehearing on May 22, 2024. The court’s
response to the latest petition has not been issued as of the date of this report.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR rebates under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss, and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the General Manager and CEO submits to the Board of
Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, which must also approve subsequent amendments not delegated under the authority
of the General Manager and CEO. In the absence of such budget adoption and appropriation by
the Board of Directors, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures in the new fiscal year
that are limited to 90% of the prior year’s approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget
transfers authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain transfers within the budget
as delegated by the Board of Directors.

there was $232,774 of unused 2023 capital appropriations approved for carryover into 2024.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDING AND DEBT LIMITATIONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.
On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the
voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in Amendment 1 for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast and
Southwest Corridor light rail projects or to operate such projects for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.

Attachment: 2023 ACFR (4956 : 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual
revenue and expenses is as follows:

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit

97

Packet Pg. 101

improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid in 2050, RTD’s 0.4% sales and
use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through
FasTracks.
Beginning in 2025, RTD’s revenues, with exception of federal funding and the 0.4% sales and
use tax, will be subject to annual growth limitations constrained by the local Consumer Price
Index (CPI) plus the change in property tax assessments due to new construction. It is estimated
that approximately 50% of total revenues will be subject to this provision. RTD is undertaking
measures to mitigate, to the extent possible, any adverse impacts these growth limitations will
have on funding.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Following an 18-month fare study and equity analysis, RTD implemented certain changes to its
fare structure effective at the beginning of 2024 to simplify the fare structure, reduce fares, and
ensure equity. Because fare revenue comprises a relatively small proportion of total revenues,
RTD does not anticipate these changes to have a material impact to its ability to fund necessary
expenditures and has budgeted accordingly.
On Wednesday, February 14, 2024, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE)
held an election to determine whether eligible Transit Police Officers and Corporals employed by
RTD would be represented by the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #72 (FOP 72) for purposes of
collective bargaining. On Thursday, February 15, 2024, RTD’s General Counsel’s office received
formal notification of the election’s results from CDLE staff, which certified that the eligible voters
elected to form a Collective Bargaining Unit. RTD Labor Relations staff with support from RTD
Police Department command staff are working collectively with the FOP 72 to negotiate and
implement this first-time collective bargaining agreement.
On May 9, 2024, RTD received notice of the court’s decision in response to RTD’s concessionaire,
Denver Transit Partners’ (DTP’s), appeal of the February 10, 2023 Findings of Fact, Conclusions
of Law and Order for Entry of Judgement finding in favor of RTD. The Colorado Court of Appeals
issued its opinion affirming the District Court’s judgement in RTD’s favor, agreeing that regulators
applied existing law and no change in law occurred. In response the court’s May 9, 2024 decision,
DTP filed a petition of rehearing on May 22, 2024. The court has not responded to this petition
as of the date of this report.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Internal Audit Update

July 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Internal Audit Function Charter requires that:
•

•

The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) prepares and distributes written reports upon the conclusion of
each internal audit engagement at least quarterly. Internal audit results must also be
communicated to the Audit Committee at least quarterly.
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings
and recommendations. All significant findings remain in an open issues file until cleared.

On May 31, 2023, the Board approved the Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan which
recommended audits to be undertaken through the end of 2024. Each proposed audit had been selected
in response to the results of the enterprise risk assessment.
DISCUSSION
This Discussion Item includes presentation materials to provide the Audit Committee with status updates
regarding completed audits and associated follow-up activities, audits in process and planned audits
during 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this Discussion Item.

Report Rating Definitions

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

Priority of Internal Audit Report Observations

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
• Significant financial impact for location/site audited
• Prevalence of issues or exceptions
• Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
• Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
• Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
• Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.

Internal Audit Observations and Recommendations
Observation 1
Observation Title:
Police Software System Limitations

Risk Rating:
High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The systems currently in place are not an effective tool, as they lack functionality, capabilities, and reporting. The
systems are not user friendly and do not meet user requirements and/or expectations. Due to the system limitations, the
Transit Police Department (RTD-PD) does not have the ability or cannot easily measure and evaluate the performance of
the agency through key performance indicators.
Some systems limitations noted as part of the review are the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dispatchers are unable to sort the calls for service (CFS) received by the police dispatch center based on priority
level within the existing Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD).
Exported data within CAD does not include critical information such as priority level.
Key Performance Indicators such as call time, average hold time, average answer time, phone call volume are
unable to be tracked, measured, or analyzed using the current phone system (Avaya).
Call volume by sector or district map overlays cannot be obtained.
Change logs noting when a change was made and who made the change are difficult to obtain within CAD.
Automated system notifications for overdue Incident Reports do not exist in the existing Record Management
System (RMS).

Cause:
This is due to the current CAD/RMS systems being outdated and unable to meet the current needs and expectations of
the Transit Police Department.
Risks:
Lack of advanced reporting and data analysis capabilities hinders the ability of the RTD-PD to measure, track, and
communicate performance, identify trends, allocate resources effectively, and make informed decisions.
Poorly designed or outdated software may lead to frustration among users, including dispatchers, police officers, and
administrative staff which could impact morale, productivity, and retention rates.

Recommendation:
Management should consider replacing the current Police Software Systems suite with a fully integrated, modern, and
robust system that will meet the data, operational, and tactical needs of the Transit Police Department.

Management Action Plan:
eForce system (the current CAD/RMS suite provider) replacement has been underway since September 2022. The status
of this project included a Request for Proposal (RFP) that was closed on April 29, 2024, with four submissions received.
As of June 2024, an RTD multi-disciplinary review team conducted proposal evaluations and have narrowed the potential
vendor list to two software providers. Once a vendor is selected, contract negotiations will begin, and it is anticipated that
a project kick-off will occur in July 2024, and system setup and training is projected to occur across 12-18 months.
Dispatchers are unable to sort the calls for service (CFS) received in the police dispatch center based on priority level
within the existing Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD). The requirements for the upgraded system will have the capabilities
to export data, to include categorizing critical information and listing calls for service by priority levels, providing
management with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as call time, average hold time, average answer time, phone
call volume, and Transit Watch App utilization. The Records Management System (RMS) will also be updated to provide
individualized updates via email to police supervisors that notify them when incident reports are overdue, allowing for
more accountability and compliance standards when assisting the RTD Governance Division when they request
documents responsive to the Colorado Open Records Act.
Responsibility:
Michelle Lawrence, Manager, 911 Operations, Transit Police Department

Observation Title:

Risk Rating:

Written Security Incident Reports

High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the selected 25 samples of Incident Reports disclosed the following:
•

•
•
•

Ten Incident Reports were not completed by the Assigned Officer (RTD Police Officer or Transit Security Officer)
within the required timelines.
 Eight of the 10 were not completed by Transit Security Officers.
 Two of the 10 were not completed by RTD Police Officers.
Nine Incident Reports were not approved by the Supervisor in a timely manner.
 Seven of the nine were not approved timely by a Transit Security Supervisor.
 Two of the 10 were not approved timely by an RTD Police Supervisor.
One Incident Report completed by a Transit Security Officer did not document the details or facts of the incident.
One Incident Report completed by a RTD Police Officer noted the incorrect classification of the incident.

Cause:
This is due to high turnover with contracted transit security officers and the workload of RTD Police Officers as the
agency continues grow through the hiring and training of new police officers. The current RMS system does not
differentiate between report submissions entered by RTD-PD and contracted security officers.
Risks:
Failure to submit and approve Incident Reports in a timely manner will result in inaccurate National Incident-Based
Reporting System (NIBRS) daily, weekly, monthly, etc., reporting as late submissions/approvals of reports are not
captured in the most current and accurate total on the NIBRS Report.
Failure to classify incidents appropriately and document key facts and details in the Incident Report may also increase the
risk of incomplete or inaccurate reporting.
Recommendation:
Management should enforce the proper completion and timely submission for Incident Reports. Management should
consider training RTD Police Officers and Transit Security Officers on the Report Preparation Policy to reinforce when an
Incident Report should be completed, who is responsible for completing the report, key elements of the incident to
document and timeline for completing, submitting, and approving the report.
Management should establish a process to identify and follow-up on outstanding incident reports at the end of each shift.
Management Action Plan:
RTD-PD currently allows contracted security officers to author police incident reports, and their entries (or lack thereof)
have traditionally represented most delinquent reports. To reduce the number of delinquent reports, sworn officers and
security officers are now required to submit any daily (outstanding) reports to their direct supervisors before the end of
their respective shifts. As the RTD-PD transitions away from security officers towards the expansion of internal police
officer FTEs, delinquencies should be reduced in scale as the number of contacts security personnel makes regarding calls
of service related to security incidents will decrease. The goal of this shift is to professionalize the Department pursuant
to 2022 APTA recommendations and as that occurs a significant portion overall security duty will be restricted to sworn

officers who are more likely to remain as RTD employees, and who are more likely to submit criminal related reports in
the prescribed timely manner.
The Department is also in the procurement process to obtain a new and enhanced CAD/RMS system, that includes preprogrammed checks and balances that ensure reports are classified correctly and approved in a timely manner. When this
system is fully implemented, RTD police officers will complete reports, automatically make digital notification to their
respective supervisor, who will then be responsible to review and approve report narratives for accuracy, completeness,
and NIBRs coding.

Observation 3
Observation Title:
Weekly National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Reporting

Risk Rating:
High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the NIBRS Reports for the selected 25 samples of security incidents disclosed the following:
•
•

Eleven security incidents were not included in the NIBRS Reports due to late submissions or approvals of the
written Incident Report by the responding officer and their respective supervisor.
Two security incidents were not included in the NIBRS Reports due to incomplete mapping compatibility between
NIBRS and the eForce RMS product.

While RTD is not required to file NIBRS reports with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the agency collects, and
reports security incidents based on the same NIBRS reporting format used by law enforcement agencies throughout the
country.
Cause:
This was due to Incident Reports not being completed in a timely manner (before the end of a work shift) by the
assigned/investigating officers (RTD Police Officers or Contracted Security Officers) and security incident classifications
within RMS are unable to be placed on map overlays that correspond to a respective NIBRS classification.
Risks:
Failure to capture all reported/security incidents could lead to distrust and an unacceptable level of service to the
customer, relating to the misallocation of resources, compromised safety measures and difficulty in identifying trends and
patterns that are critical to decision making.
Recommendation:
Management should enforce the proper completion and timely submission for Incident Reports. Management should
consider training RTD Police Officers and Contracted Security Officers on the Report Preparation Policy to reinforce when
an Incident Report should be completed, who is responsible for completing the report, what key elements of the incident
should be documented, and the timeline for completing and submitting the report to the applicable supervisor for prompt
approval.
Management should consider reviewing the incident classifications within RMS before the end of the shift to ensure all
incident classifications are mapped to a NIBRS classification.
Management Action Plan:
Per a policy update dated on March 21, 2024, reports must be finished by the end of an officer's shift, unless explicit and
documented permission is given by a supervisor to delay submission. Examples of that type occur when a lower priority
reportable incident occurs late in a shift prompting the officer to request permission from a supervisor to delay
submission of the report until their next shift, in lieu of being authorized overtime. There is a separate protection in place
that ensures all reports are submitted by the end of officers’ -four-day work week regardless of supervisory approval
status. Patrol sergeants approve reports in the same timely manner, and their respective commanders are required to
conduct random audits so incident reports are completed in accordance with report submission policy.

the eForce mapping protocols and the corrected information are now available for future review. The second sample that
was not captured in the current eForce mapping system required will be added by eForce to update the list of
classifications. In the future, as different classifications are added, updated, or even deleted in the mapping system, the
Crime Data Analyst, eForce staff, project manager, and whichever vendor is selected as the new CAD/RMS suite, will
ensure that any mapping overlays are updated (and reflective) of all ongoing classifications.
RTD-PDis utilizing the FBI National Incident Based reporting (NIBRS) to achieve compliance with other police agencies
within the United States and in the 40 cities and eight counties that we serve. All related criminal data documented within
RTD jurisdiction are placed within the predetermined Class A and Class B categories as established by NIBRS ensures
reporting consistency and limits the possibility of human error. In fact, the Department is currently researching the
viability of a new Commander position whose responsibility will extend to quality assurance duties that provide an
additional layer of accountability and transparency to the organization.

Observation 4
Observation Title:
Security Risk Assessment

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
A Security Risk Assessment is not being conducted to evaluate the agency’s transit system susceptibility to security
threats, to identify vulnerabilities, and potential consequences. A Security Risk Assessment would assist in the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Understanding how to identify and assess threats to the agency’s transit system.
Recognizing vulnerabilities to the agency’s transit system that may increase the likelihood of a security threat.
Measuring the value of the likelihood of an event against the severity or consequences of the defined security
risks.
Providing a basis to allocate resources appropriately within the agency.
Providing a consistent and repeatable methodology to base security recommendations and allocate resources.

Cause:
This is due to a lack of a formalized risk assessment program.
Risks:
Lack of a Security Risk Assessment may increase the risk of being more vulnerable to various uncertainties and security
threats.
Recommendation:
Management should consider completing a Security Risk Assessment to determine the exposure of the agency’s transit
system and to reduce or mitigate security risk. The Security Risk Assessment should include all transit modes, assets, and
facilities to allow for the identification of potential threats, vulnerabilities and consequences to the agency’s transit
systems and its properties. The Security Risk Assessment should be conducted and updated annually to confirm security
risks are adequately addressed and sufficient resources are allocated to reduce the risks.
Management Action Plan:
The agency will work to update the Emergency Operations Plan on an annual basis. RTD-PD will continue to coordinate
with local police department agencies, FBI, TSA, and Department of Homeland Security to assist with determining
possible risk assessments, as well as incorporate information from the RTD Safety Division on Hazardous Risk
Assessments for properties and facilities.
The agency, in coordination with Human Resources, the Safety Division and Bus Operations, will assess the Emergency
Management Division to optimize cross-departmental resources allow for responsibilities to be separated to specific
functions and locations and provide accountability to personnel to conduct exercises to determine proper mitigation of
risks.

Observation Title:
Security Incident Reporting Procedures

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Documented policies or procedures do not exist for creating the Daily 24-Hour Reported Criminal Incident Reports or
the Weekly National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Reports. The reports are manually compiled by one
individual based on data exported from the eForce Records Management System (RMS).
Cause:
This is due to a lack of standard operating procedures across the agency.
Risks:
Failure to establish procedures could lead to inefficiencies and lack of consistency when compiling the reports as well
as lost knowledge if changes in personnel occur.
Recommendation:
Management should consider developing procedures outlining the steps to create the Daily 24-Hour Reported
Criminal Report and the NIBRS Report. The procedure should encompass the following areas: report parameters,
extraction of data from RMS and CAD, security incident classifications and exclusion methodology and the
compilation of reported incidents into the appropriate categories on the NIBRS report.
Management Action Plan:
The new software for CAD/RMS will be capable of generating reports upon request, and unlike today, RTD police
officers will be able to access raw data within the program to determine where and when criminal incidents
occurring within their assigned sectors and conduct evidence-based link analysis on those who do so. Commanders
will also be able to utilize the upgraded report management system to determine the severity level of criminal
incidents and to deploy resources based upon the patterns observed within their areas of responsibility. This
upgraded ability will provide context and allow for better analysis of data and allows command staff to assign
officers in static locations, to maintain high police officer visibility, to identify community policing gaps, and help us
to deter criminal and unhealthy behaviors. The data can be used to determine future annual staffing projections
with increased accuracy, and to narrow requests for budget and full-time employee (FTE) resources pursuant to
actual workload.
The data will also be used to maintain compliance with reporting assaults on transit workers, a requirement for
entities receiving tax dollars that are entered into the National Transit Database (NTD), as well as any other
regulatory reporting required in relation to security incidents.

Security Incident Reporting to Senior Management

Risk Rating:

Management.
Risks:
Lack of reporting to Senior Management limits their ability to effectively manage operations, mitigate risks, and align
departmental efforts with agency’s goals.
Recommendation:
Management should consider assessing and identifying the reporting requirements necessary to furnish Senior
Management with succinct and relevant information pertaining to security incidents.
Management Action Plan:
Leadership team members can request and receive all non-sensitive/unclassified data related to criminal incidents. Police
personnel have been working closely with department managers to formulate a reporting system that accurately captures
the requests based on reporting to such agencies as FRA, FTA, NTD and PUC, and reduces unnecessary complications
relating to the various definitions that relate to those reports.
Once the new police CAD/RMS software suite is implemented, online reporting will be available on the portal for
Departmental leaders to have immediate access to data related to security incidents. This data will also be compiled by
sector and placed on the RTD-PD webpage, so that customers and employees can access criminal statistics based on
location within the RTD service area.
Responsibility:
Steven Martingano, Deputy Chief of Police, Transit Police Department
Target Date:
Implementation of new CAD/RMS in 2026

Observation 7
Observation Title:
Dispatch Calls

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of the 25 selected samples of dispatcher calls disclosed the following:
•
•

Four did not have a Priority assigned within the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system.
One did not have the correct disposition status of REPORT DUE within the CAD system.

Cause:
The CAD system automatically assigns the priority of a call based on the call type. Not all call types within the CAD
system were associated with a priority resulting in no priority being assigned.
The incorrect disposition status was due to dispatcher error and/or training issue.
Risks:
Failure to assign priority to calls could lead to non-urgent incidents taking precedence over life-threatening incidents.
Failure to assign appropriate disposition status could lead to Responding Officers not completing the written Incident
Report and the security incident not being captured in the aggregated security incident reporting.
Recommendation:
Management resolved the issue of priorities not being assigned to calls within CAD by June 2023 through the “priority
assignment” project.
Management should consider a refresher training for dispatchers to review the disposition status types and when each
status should be used.
Management Action Plan:
All Call Types in the CAD system have a priority assigned (since June 2023)
CAD Lesson Plan from initial training, which includes dispositions and other pre-defined fields, will be distributed to all
personnel via PowerDMS.
A staffing analysis should be conducted to determine the appropriate workload-based staffing level required to
adequately receive incoming calls, dispatch information to responding officers, and that facilitates proper documentation
of information within the CAD system. Since achieving full staffing has been a Herculean effort since 2022, to solve the
staffing problem requires a One RTD-type coordinated effort; success will require leveraging the procurement process in
conjunction with RTD Finance and Human Resources to contract with a firm that professionally evaluate whether RTD-PD
should request proposals from companies that specialize in providing privatized employee staffing for difficult positions
like Telecommunications Officers (TCOs) or others specializing in this field of study.
The staffing analysis will explore the ability to combine the current two police communications dispatch centers and
should evaluate the viability of also consolidating RTD dispatch centers for train, light rail, and bus, into a designated
central location within a secured facility. If the latter option is pursued, it allows for all communication resources to be in
one place, more quickly exchange emergency information, and to decrease responsive time to incidents involving RTD
vehicles, properties, customers, trespassers, and employees.

Observation 7
The staffing analysis will also be used to provide the most economical solution to RTD, in determining if it more fiscally
responsible to hire internal police communication dispatchers or to have the police communications center be staffed by a
contractor that specializes in this field of work.

Appendix 2: Report Rating Definitions
Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location, process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures.
The design and effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were
isolated and/or minor, and departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have
certain deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls, which should be improved.
Some departures from leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or
efficiency improvement or for improved financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and
the design or effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures
from leading practice may be present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not
corrected, the company can be exposed to loss or financial misstatement.

Appendix 3: Priority of Observation Ratings

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) on the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremedied previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues) or result in instances of policy and regulatory
non-compliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority/
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings were identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for
business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or
are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact on the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
