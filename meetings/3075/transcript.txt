Special Board Meeting_
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, if I could have all Board Members come back to their seats.
I'd like to call the Special Board Meeting to order.
[BELL DINGS]
Sorry, I don't have a gavel. I Just have a bell. Yeah, it's a nice sound. Thank you. All right, this
evening, we have a recommended action. The recommended action is the selection of the finalists
for the Interim GM position. The selection committee of the whole for the Interim General
Manager selection committee presents to the Board a motion to approve as finalists for the Interim
General Manager position the following individuals identified by the selection committee during
a Special Board Meeting held on January 9, 2020. And all five candidates will move forward as
finalists if this recommended action passes. Do I have-DOUG TISDALE: So moved.
XLAUDIA FOLSKA: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.
DOUG TISDALE: And I'd like to speak to the motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Tisdale?
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much. It is appropriate to note for the sake of the record and
for the public that we were presented with an outstanding collection of candidates. And in support
of that proposition, the board I submit is well advised at this time to move all five forward, who
will be named immediately following a vote if the vote is successful.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: And Madam Chair, if I may, I would like to concur with Director Tisdale
on everything he just said.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Folska. If the mover could vote.
VINCE BUZEK: Madam Chair, I-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, director.
VINCE BUZEK: Thank you, Madam Chair. Notwithstanding those fine comments, I'd like to
make a substitute motion. I would move that the selection committee of the whole for the Interim

General Manager selection committee presents to the Board a motion to approve as finalists for
the Interim General Manager position the following individuals identified with the selection
committee during the Special Board Meeting held on January 9, 2020. I would move that the Board
move forward three of those individuals.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is there a second? I'm sorry, Director. OK, so I have a second
amended motion and a second. yes, call for the question. We are voting on the substitute-- Director
Buzek's. That's what's on our screen, Miss McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. We're voting on a substitute?
RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Correct.
ROLF ASPHAUG: Chair Rivera-Malpiede?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
ROLF ASPHAUG: This is Rolf Asphaug. Just to make clear, a vote for yes is a vote for the
substitute motion to move three forward. A vote for no is a vote to go back to the main motion to
move five forward.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Got it. Has everybody voted? OK. That amendment fails.
DOUG TISDALE: Call the question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: The original amendment moving the five candidates forward. All
in favor, please vote yes or no. Thank you.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Yeah. OK, here we go. Director Tisdale, you are the mover.
DOUG TISDALE: Voted.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE OK, Director-[WHISPERING]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: It passes 12 to 2. So we will be moving all five candidates forward
as finalist for the Interim General Manager position.
DOUG TISDALE: Madam Chair, point of order, if I may speak to the motion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes, Director Tisdale.

DOUG TISDALE: We said that we would identify these specific individuals following the vote if
the vote were successful, and there were two negative votes. I note for the record that being
Secretary Buzek and Director Whitmore. And I would note at this time that the candidates
identified to move forward are Mr. Michael Ford, Ms. Amy Ford, Ms. Jacqueline Millet, Mr. Paul
Ballard, and Mr. Michael Meader.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Menten?
NATALIE MENTEN: I would like to just speak under other matters, but it's related to this issue.
So when would you prefer that I speak? Now?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We are done with the motion. We are closed, so we are now under
other matters. Yeah, go ahead.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right. So I would just like to say that with these five candidates who
have come before us and have lengthy resumes and a lot of skill sets with them, I'm very much
looking forward to the public input, the employees, the coworkers that they have encountered over
many, many years. I think this will be of great value to us as we make the decision for interim
manager. And just so that the public-- for anybody who's in the audience-- I am going to depend
on Mr. Asphaug. If you could just remind us, we have now 14 days requirement that we have met
with the finalists.
ROLF ASPHAUG: This is Rolf Asphaug. There is a minimum 14-day requirement after finalists
are announced, so yes.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK, great. So just to finish up, I'm very much looking forward to the public
chiming in on their thoughts as this agency moves forward. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Menten. Director Lewis?
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Chair. I would actually like to say something very similar to
Director Menten. I think this is a really great opportunity to take these names to the public, and
have them do their own research, and open this process up in a transparent way, which I think
we've heard many directors desire from our constituents and our stakeholders. And I think this is
a way in which we can do that. And so I look forward to engaging our constituents and our
stakeholders in this process, and them being aware of who our candidates are. And I might add
that we did have wonderful conversations with these candidates. And I think it's a great opportunity
for our constituents and our stakeholders to do the same.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a question. Do we now talk about process
or what happens next or how? Counselor?
I think I'm asking you. I'm not sure, I could be just asking the room in general.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: About the process?
KATE WILLIAMS: Can we discuss the process now of what happens next?
ROLF ASPHAUG: This is Rolf Asphaug. Yes, you could discuss the process, not vote on it. But
you could have discussion in open session. Presumably, after the 14-day period, you'll have further
discussion in executive session to decide on the personnel issue, and get a sense of who you wish
to name. And then that announcement, of course, in open session.
KATE WILLIAMS: OK, I'm still-- that means the process now includes background checks, and
reference checks, and all. I would be happy to volunteer to do some work on calling references.
Obviously, I'm not going to do the background checks. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
KATE WILLIAMS: Unless we find out that our HR department is going to do that. So I guess
that's the next move.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. OK, thank you. Director Catlin?
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you. I'd like to echo Director Tisdale's sentiments that we had a slate of
excellent candidates. Over 40 people applied for this position. And we winnowed it down in a
multi-step process. And it was a very energetic and robust discussion all day. And the five
interviews that we conducted were just rich with information, and with passion. And we learned a
lot more about the candidates.
So I think it's a great opportunity now for our public to become engaged, and to provide us with
additional information so that we can make this important decision, even though this is an interim
position. But I think it's a great opportunity, and we are very, very fortunate that we have five
really quality candidates. And I don't think that we could go wrong for the interim. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Cook?
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, thank you. I agree with a lot of the comments. Along the lines of this
next phase, Mr. Vesley, can you present to us a proposal for ways to carry out both the background
checks, especially if we can do them pretty economically, and going forward with reference checks
that in some way can involve one or more board members, so it's not just the HR group doing
reference checks, but that we have a chance to participate or listen in, or something like that? I
wanted to see if you could come back to us with a process-- if this group generally agrees with
that-- that would include going ahead with the background checks now, and then also some way
to involve us in the reference checks.
ROGER VESLEY: Yes.
SHELLEY COOK: Maybe it's one person or two people or something.

ROGER VESLEY: Yes, thank you very much. Yes, we can conduct the background checks and
take care of that through our normal processes that we have in place. As far as reference checks
goes, I would welcome a member or members to assist. And I'll be happy to sit down with the
board members to handle the reference checks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Great, thank you.
ROGER VESLEY: You're welcome.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker? No? OK. Any other comments or questions?
Any other matters to come before the board?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Move to adjourn.
DOUG TISDALE: Second.
NATALIE MENTEN: All in favor.
GROUP: Aye.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We are hereby adjourned.
