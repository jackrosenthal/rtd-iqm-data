BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

May 15, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 21, 2013

Subject:

Presentation of 2012 RTD Comprehensive
Annual Financial Report and Report to
Governance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and
audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP.
BACKGROUND
State statutes require an annual audit by independent certified public accountants. The District is also
required to provide annual audited financial statements to external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements, and other contractual
documents. The accounting firm of RubinBrown, LLP performed the 2012 audit. In addition to the
requirements set forth in state statutes, the audit also was designed to fulfill the requirements of the
federal Single Audit Act of 1984 and related OMB circular A-133.
DISCUSSION
A confidential electronic copy has been included in MinuteTraq. Bound copies will be provided at the
meeting on May 21. We have been advised by the auditor’s that the financial statements in the enclosed
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of the District as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of its operations and its
cash flow for the 2012 and 2011 fiscal years in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District's independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is the recommended action, state statutes and other sources, such as
rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited financial
statements into the record.
2. Do not accept and enter into the record the audited financial reports relating to the year ended
December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and audited by the District’s independent auditor,
RubinBrown, LLP. This is not the recommended action, since state statutes and other sources,
such as rating agencies and other legal covenants, require the District to enter annual audited
financial statements into the record.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 16, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

May 16, 2013

Board Meeting Date: May 21, 2013

Subject:

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the revised RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy mandated by the Federal Transit Administration of the
United States Department of Transportation.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the current policy on October 25, 2011. Recently there have been
changes in the federal regulation guidance on recreational and medical marijuana and Collective
Bargaining Agreement. RTD is therefore required to revise the policy, as negotiated with the ATU 1001,
and define provisions to comply with current US Department of Transportation and Federal Transit
Administration requirements. A revised copy is attached for your review with specific changes listed
below.
DISCUSSION
The policy changes are as follows:
Page 6
Updated Medical and Recreational Marijuana policy statement in accordance with
49CFR part 40.
Page 8
Removed 24-month provision for first and second violation for alcohol levels
between 0.02 but less than 0.04.
Pages 8 & 9 Removed 24-month provision for first and second verified positive test.
Page 11
Removed a list of initial and confirmatory cutoff levels replacing them with a single
sentence referring to 49CFR Part 40, as amended.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Removal of the 24-month provisions from the policy will decrease the number of repeat offenders. It will
decrease the financial strain on the District as multiple violations of Drug and Alcohol Policy create
intense and lengthy follow-up programs that require significant RTD resources. Savings to RTD are, at a
minimum, of $10,000 per occurrence.
By removing references to specific federal regulations and metabolite levels, fewer updates to all
covered employees will be required.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended that the Financial/Administration Committee recommend to the full RTD Board
of Directors that the revisions to the RTD Substance Abuse Policy be approved.
2. Do not approve the revised policy. This is not recommended, as this will result in the Agency
being non-compliant with the DOT and FTA regulations.

Regional Transportation District

Drug and Alcohol Policy

The Regional Transportation District is dedicated to providing safe, dependable, and economical
transportation services to the public, and to providing a healthy, safe and satisfying work environment
for our employees. RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union, Division 1001, agree that employees of the
system must be able to work in a drug and alcohol-free work environment. At the same time, every
effort must be made to protect the rights and respect the privacy of all employees. The employer has the
right and duty to protect its employees, passengers and the public from the adverse effects of drug and
alcohol abuse. It is not the intent of the employer to restrict the employees' off-the-job conduct.
A successful drug and alcohol program must address the safety implications of drug and alcohol
abuse, and must also institute proper procedures and controls guaranteeing accurate alcohol and drug
testing results, while preserving confidentiality and focusing on rehabilitation through an effective
employee assistance program.
It is the responsibility of all employees to report to work free of alcohol and controlled
substances. At the same time, every effort must be made to protect and respect employees' rights and
privacy.
To meet these goals and comply with legal requirements, RTD has implemented this policy to (1)
detect drug or alcohol use in violation of this policy through testing; (2) encourage employees to obtain
treatment and rehabilitation for drug and alcohol problems; (3) deter drug or alcohol use in violation of
this policy through education, training, and discipline; and (4) enforce RTD's goal of a drug- and alcoholfree work environment through appropriate discipline.
Drug and alcohol abuse can have profound effects on the health, work, and personal life not only
of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at large. Employees should be aware
of the signs and symptoms of drug or alcohol problems, and of available methods of intervening when a
substance abuse problem is suspected. Appendix A to this policy contains additional discussion of these
matters.
This policy was originally adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on October 18, 1994 and
subsequent modifications were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on September 15, 1998, July 18,
2000, May 20, 2003 and July 2011. Many elements of this policy are required by federal regulations
covering persons in safety-sensitive job classifications. Other elements of this policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Appendix B to this policy explains which elements of this
policy are not federally required. Employees wishing to review federal regulations on drug and alcohol
use may contact RTD's Drug and Alcohol Program Coordinator.
This policy supersedes all other RTD drug, alcohol or substance abuse policies. To the extent that
any elements of this policy may conflict with federal or state regulations as they may be amended or
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

revised in the future, the regulations shall control. Employees are expected to review, be familiar with,
and obey this policy and all laws concerning drug and alcohol use and testing. All existing and new RTD
employees must receive at least 60 minutes of training on the effects and consequences of prohibited
drug use on personal health, safety, and the work environment, and the signs and symptoms which may
indicate prohibited drug use.

2.0 Applicability
2.1

Categories of Employees

This policy applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers,
and contractors. For ease of reference, all of the above persons are referred to in this policy as
"employees" unless otherwise noted. This policy applies to all employees while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty or while performing any RTD-related business. Visitors and vendors are expected to
adhere to this policy while on RTD property.
In addition to being subject to all other elements of this policy, employees who perform "safetysensitive functions" for RTD, as that term is defined in federal regulations 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended
and Part 655, are subject to random drug and alcohol testing and other special requirements set forth in
this policy. Generally, a safety-sensitive function occurs when an employee is performing, ready to
perform or immediately available to perform any duty related to the safe operation of mass transit
services. The following are safety-sensitive functions:
1.

Operation of a revenue service vehicle, whether or not such vehicle is in
revenue service.

2.

Controlling dispatch or movement of a revenue service vehicle.

3.

Maintaining revenue service vehicles or equipment used in revenue service.

4.

Operating a non-revenue service vehicle when required to be operated by a
holder of a CDL.

5.

Carrying a firearm for security purposes.

6.

Supervising, where the supervisor performs any function listed in items 1-5
above.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Compliance with this policy, including participation in RTD's drug and alcohol testing program, is
a required condition of employment.

RTD has reviewed the actual duties performed by employees in all job classifications to determine
which employees perform safety-sensitive functions, and has determined which job functions may
require the performance of safety-sensitive duties. An analysis will be performed if any new job

2.2

Categories of Prohibited Substances

This policy applies to controlled substances (see section 2.2.1 of this policy); legal drugs or
medications which may impair mental functioning, motor skills or judgment (section 2.2.2); and alcohol
(section 2.2.3). For ease of reference, these substances are collectively referred to in this policy as
"prohibited substances" unless otherwise noted.

Controlled substances are any drug or other substance identified in Schedules I through V of the
federal Controlled Substance Act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), federal regulations at 21 CFR sections
1300.11 through 1300.15, and the Colorado Controlled Substance Act (CRS section 12-22-301), all as
amended. Controlled substances include, but are not necessarily limited to: marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and PCP (phencyclidine).
2.2.2 Legal Drugs or Medications
The appropriate use of legally prescribed drugs or over-the-counter medications are not
prohibited. However, the use of any legally prescribed drug or medication which carries a warning label
that indicates that mental functions, motor skills, or judgment may be adversely affected must be
discussed by employees with their appropriate health care professional before performing work-related
duties. Employees are urged to seek and obtain medical confirmation prior to using prescription or over
the counter drugs to assure that such consumption will not adversely affect their ability to safely
perform essential job functions. Appendix C contains guidelines for use of prescribed drugs and over-thecounter medications and a partial list of some over-the-counter medications that may affect your ability
to drive.
A legally prescribed drug is one for which the employee has a prescription or other written
authorization from a licensed health care provider permitted by law to prescribe or dispense drugs or
medications. The authorization must include the employee's name, the name of the substance, the
amount to be taken, and the period of authorization.
2.2.3 Medical and Recreational Marijuana
Colorado law on the use of medical and recreational marijuana does not amend, exempt, or
supersede RTD’s Drug and Alcohol Policy. The Department of Transportation’s Drug and Alcohol Testing
Regulation 49CFR Part 40, section 40.151(e) does not authorize verification of a test based on
information that a physician recommended that the employee use a drug listed in Schedule I of the
Controlled Substances act. (e.g., under a state law that purports to authorize such recommendations,
such as the “medical marijuana” laws that some states have adopted). The MRO will not verify a drug
test as negative based upon learning that the employee used “medical or recreational marijuana” when
states have passed “medical or recreational marijuana” initiatives.

2.2.4 Alcohol
Alcohol is a colorless, volatile liquid that is the intoxicating agent in fermented and distilled
beverages. It also includes ethyl-alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols including methyl or
isopropyl alcohol. Alcohol can be found in certain medications as well as in alcoholic beverages.

Hours of Compliance

Testing is conducted on all days and hours throughout the year. Employees are subject to this
policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD
vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends. Employees are subject to this policy on regularly scheduled days, and when volunteering for or
assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. Safety-sensitive employees are also subject to this
policy at additional times set forth in section 3.4 of this policy.

3.0 Prohibited Conduct; Discipline
Discipline under this policy is independent of discipline for violation of any other performance
code or work rules. For example, an employee who causes an accident and tests positive for alcohol use
may receive separate, consecutive penalties for both the accident and the positive test.
In addition to any disciplinary action taken under this policy, law enforcement authorities may be
notified where criminal activity is suspected in connection with any of the following prohibited conduct.

3.1

Possession/Use of Prohibited Substances at RTD

Any employee found to manufacture, distribute, dispense, sell, possess, or use prohibited
substances while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD
vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break
ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.2

Intoxication/Under Influence

Any employee reasonably suspected of being intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence
of a prohibited substance, or of being not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD
duty, while on the property of RTD to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or
other breaks if the employee is scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be immediately
suspended from job duties pending an investigation and verification of his or her condition. Any
employee found to be intoxicated by, impaired by, or under the influence of a prohibited substance, or
not fit for duty due to use of a prohibited substance, while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, and on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

Positive Drug or Alcohol Tests

Any time that an employee loses while removed from service pending report of a confirmatory
test (or for safety-sensitive employees, while removed from service under section 5.1 of this policy) will
be counted towards disciplinary suspension time.
3.3.1 Alcohol Test of 0.02 but Less than 0.04
Federal law requires RTD to remove a safety-sensitive employee from service as provided in
section 5.1 of this policy if a confirmatory breath alcohol test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02
or greater but less than 0.04. To deter such conduct, a safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory
breath alcohol test of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04 may receive the following discipline:
1.

First violation: Removal from service for no less than eight hours or until the start of
the employee's next shift, whichever comes first; warning letter; and
recommendation that the employee seek assistance from the Employee Assistance
Program (“EAP”).
For a first violation when the employee has already been subject to the return-toduty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, discipline may be a five-working-day
unpaid suspension (with time lost under section 5.1 counting toward the
suspension time) up to termination, depending on the circumstances.

2.

Second violation: Disciplined as a "verified positive" test as defined in section 4.1.2
of this policy (i.e., as a positive confirmatory test for alcohol concentration of 0.04
or greater).
For a second violation when the employee has already been subject to the returnto-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy, the employee may be terminated.
3.3.2 Verified Positive Test

Any employee with a "verified positive" drug or alcohol test, as that term is defined in section 4.1 of
this policy (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater),
may receive the following discipline:
1.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Positive drug or alcohol tests may be subject to discipline up to and including termination as set
forth in this policy. In addition, sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy specify an employment assessment
and return-to-duty requirements following a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for
drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater).

First violation: 20-working-day unpaid suspension to termination, depending on
circumstances. If discipline is other than termination, the employee must also
undergo an employment assessment and fulfill return-to-duty requirements as set
forth in sections 5.3 and 5.4 of this policy.

3.4

Additional Prohibitions for Safety-Sensitive Employees

Any safety-sensitive employee who uses alcohol within four hours prior to duty, or during
otherwise specified on-call hours, may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.5

Noncompliance with Testing Requirements

Any employee who refuses to comply with an RTD request for drug or alcohol testing, provides
false information in connection with a drug or alcohol test, or attempts to falsify drug or alcohol test
results through tampering, contamination, adulteration, or substitution of a test sample, may be treated
as if the employee had received a "verified positive" drug test result (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for
drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater), may be removed from service immediately, and
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination. In addition, noncompliance with testing
requirements may constitute a verified positive drug test result for purposes of section 5.1 of this policy
(removal of safety-sensitive employees from service).
"Refusal to comply” includes:
1. Failure to appear for any test (except pre-employment test) within a reasonable time
as determined by RTD.
2. Failure to remain at the testing site until the testing process is completed, except a
pre-employment test.
3. Failure to attempt provide a sufficient amount of urine, breath or saliva specimen as
required by FTA or DOT regulations.
4. In the case of a directly observed or monitored collection in a drug test, failure to
permit the observation or monitoring of your provision of a specimen.
5. Failure to provide a sufficient amount of urine or breath when directed, and it has
been determined, through a required medical evaluation, that there was no
adequate medical explanation for the failure.
6. Failure or decline to take an additional drug test RTD or the collector has directed
you to take.
7. Failure to undergo a medical evaluation, as directed by the MRO as part of the
verification process, or as directed by the Designated Employer Representative
(DER).
8. Failure to sign Step #2 of the ATF.
9. Failure to cooperate with any part of the testing process.
10. For an observed collection, fail to follow the observer’s instructions to raise your
clothing above the waist, lower clothing and underpants, and turn around to permit

For pre-employment only, failure to appear, aborting the collection before the test commences, or
failure to remain at the site prior to commencement of test is NOT a test refusal.
A refusal to test constitutes violation of this policy and will be treated the same as a positive test
result. Refusal to test under RTD authority will not be considered as a refusal to take a DOT-required
test.

3.6

Criminal Convictions

Any employee who is convicted of a felony involving off-site purchase, sale or distribution of a
controlled substance, or who fails to immediately notify his or her supervisor of any such conviction,
may be subject to discipline up to and including termination.

3.7

Noncompliance with Treatment Requirements

Under certain circumstances, federal law requires RTD to impose and monitor treatment of RTD
employees for substance abuse, and to set aftercare and return-to-duty requirements (see sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy). Any employee who refuses or fails to comply with RTD requirements for
substance abuse treatment, aftercare, or return to duty may be subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

3.8

Improper Use of Policy

Supervisors, managers and employees are required to use and apply all aspects of this policy in
an unbiased and impartial manner. Any employee who knowingly disregards the requirements of this
policy, or who deliberately misuses or misapplies this policy against any other employee, may be subject
to discipline up to and including termination.

The Union and RTD will cooperate to allow the Union reasonable opportunity to review the Drug
and Alcohol program subject to limits of confidentiality. Such review may include, but is not limited to,
credentials of the medical review officer, Substance Abuse Professionals, breath alcohol technicians, and
testing laboratories.
In addition, RTD will permit the Union reasonable opportunity to review the results of blind testing
conducted on an unannounced basis to maintain the integrity of the testing facility. The Union shall
receive, when reasonably requested and subject to confidentiality, information including, but not limited
to, drug test results, chain of custody forms, the random selection process, and collection site
procedures. RTD and the Union may jointly review literature and research on alcohol and drug testing
technology and procedures, suggested changes and improvements to the program, and employee
education and training programs.
RTD will strictly adhere to all standards of confidentiality. Testing records and results will be
released only to those authorized by federal regulations to receive such information. RTD will strive to
protect employees' rights to dignity, privacy, and confidentiality throughout the testing process.
4.1.1 Drug Testing Procedures
RTD will designate a medical review officer (“MRO”) to receive drug test results and evaluate,
interpret and verify the results in conjunction with an employee's medical history, to determine whether
a positive drug test result was caused by the use of controlled substances or by an employee's medical
condition. The MRO will then report all test results to the RTD via electronic file. The MRO shall be a
licensed physician (doctor of medicine or osteopathy) with knowledge of drug abuse disorders. In
carrying out his or her responsibilities, the MRO shall examine alternate medical explanations for any
positive test result. This action may include conducting a medical interview and review of the
individual’s medical history, or review of any other relevant biomedical factors. The MRO shall review all
medical records made available by the tested individual when a confirmed positive test could have
resulted from legally prescribed medication. The MRO shall not, however, consider the results of urine
samples that are not obtained or processed in accordance with 49 CFR Part 40, as amended.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Employees may be required to submit to urine drug testing and/or breath alcohol testing under
circumstances set forth in this policy. Testing shall be conducted in a manner to protect the rights of the
employee, assure the integrity of the drug testing process, safeguard the validity of the test results, and
ensure that test results are attributed to the correct employee. Collectors will use techniques, equipment
and laboratory facilities which have been approved by the federal government. All testing will be
conducted consistent with federal requirements of 49 CFR Parts 40 as amended and Part 655.

Pursuant to federal regulations, drugs to be tested for are marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine (PCP). (RTD reserves the right, not based on federal regulations, to
test for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium, Librium, Xanax),
nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude), and nonamphetamine stimulants, by separate urine specimen
if there is reasonable suspicion of such drug use (see section 4.2.2 of this policy).
An initial drug screen will be conducted on each urine specimen at a laboratory certified by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). For specimens that are not negative (at or

1.B.2.a

Before verifying that an employee has a positive test result, the MRO is responsible for contacting
any such employee, on a direct and confidential basis, to determine whether the employee wishes to
discuss the test or present a legitimate explanation for the positive result. An MRO staff person may
make the contact; the MRO’s medically licensed or certified staff person may gather information. If,
after reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to reach the employee directly, the MRO may contact RTD’s
designated management official for assistance in contacting the employee. RTD’s designated
management official will take maximum precautions to preserve the confidentiality of the MRO contact.
If, after making all diligent and reasonable efforts, neither the MRO nor RTD’s designated
management official are able to contact the employee within ten (10) days of the date the MRO received
the confirmed positive test result from the laboratory, the MRO may verify the test result as positive.
The MRO may also verify the test result as positive if RTD’s designated management official has
successfully made and documented a contact with the employee and instructed the employee to contact
the MRO and 72 hours have passed since the time RTD’s designated management official contacted the
employee. The MRO may reopen the verification of positive test if the employee presents documentation
of serious injury or illness or other circumstances which unavoidably prevented the employee from being
contacted within the designated time period, and if the employee then presents a legitimate (in the
MRO’s opinion) explanation for the positive test, the MRO shall declare the test to be negative.
The MRO shall notify each employee who has a confirmed positive test that the employee has 72
hours in which to request a test of a split specimen provided at the same time as the original sample. If
the employee requests an analysis of the split specimen within 72 hours of having been informed of a
verified positive test, the MRO shall direct, in writing, the laboratory to provide the split specimen to
another DHHS-certified testing laboratory for analysis. All costs for such testing shall be paid by the
employee (by payroll deduction if necessary) unless the additional test invalidates the confirmatory test.
The methods of collecting, storing and testing the split sample will be consistent with 49 CFR Part 40. If
analysis of the split specimen fails to reconfirm the presence of the drug(s) or metabolite(s) found in the
primary specimen, or if the split specimen is unavailable, inadequate for testing, or untestable, the MRO
shall cancel the test and report cancellation and the reasons for it to the DOT, RTD and the employee.
Federally-mandated urine and breath forms must be used for all federally-mandated testing.
Specimens shall be collected and identified as required by 49 CFR. Specimens and written records shall
be stored by the laboratory, MRO and RTD as required by 49 CFR Part 40. Among other requirements,
all records pertaining to a given urine specimen shall be retained by the drug testing laboratory for a
minimum of 2 years, and all specimens confirmed positive shall be kept in their original labeled specimen
bottles and placed in properly secured long-term frozen storage for a minimum of 1 year. The laboratory
shall be required to maintain any specimens known to be under legal challenge for an indefinite period.
RTD’s contracts with laboratories shall require that the laboratory maintain employee test records in
confidence, as provided in DOT agency regulations; and that the laboratory shall disclose information

Department of Transportation (DOT) requires employees to submit to an observed collection
under the following conditions:
1. Return-to-duty tests.
2. Follow-up tests.
3. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
temperature on the original specimen was out of the accepted temperature range.
4. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the original
specimen appeared to have been tampered with.
5. Anytime a collector observes materials brought to the collection site or the
employee’s conduct clearly indicates an attempt to tamper with a specimen.
6. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the
laboratory reported to the MRO that the original specimen was invalid and the MRO
determined that there was not an adequate medical explanation for the result.
7. Anytime the employee is directed to provide another specimen because the MRO
determined that the original specimen was positive, adulterated or substituted, but
had to be cancelled because the test of the split specimen could not be performed.
4.1.4 Alcohol Testing Procedures
Alcohol testing will be performed by a qualified Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT) or Screening
Test Technician (STT). The BAT or STT must receive qualification training meeting the requirements in
49 CFR Part 40 as amended. If the initial test indicates an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater, a
second, confirmatory, test will be performed. If the confirmatory test indicates an alcohol concentration
of 0.04 or greater, the confirming test will be considered a "verified positive" test under this policy.

expected for human urine. Dilute negative results 2-5 mg//dl requires an immediate recollection under
direct observation.

4.2.1 Pre-Employment Drug Testing
All applicants for employment will be tested for drug use prior to employment in any position at
RTD, and prior to transfer from a non-safety-sensitive position into a safety-sensitive position. Receipt by
RTD of a verified negative drug result is required prior to employment or transfer. A verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use) will disqualify an applicant from again applying for
employment or transfer for 24 months from date of collection; in addition, the applicant will receive a

to re-test with a negative test result.

4.2.2 Reasonable Suspicion Testing
An employee will be tested where there is reasonable suspicion that the employee has engaged in
drug or alcohol use. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing for safety-sensitive employees shall be
performed just before, during and just following the performance of a safety-sensitive function. To come
under reasonable suspicion, the employee must be observed by a supervisor trained in the detection of
drug or alcohol misuse. Supervisors who make reasonable suspicion determinations of drug use shall
receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, and performance indicators of
probable drug use. Supervisors designated to determine whether reasonable suspicion exists for alcohol
testing shall receive at least 60 minutes of training on the physical, behavioral, speech and performance
indicators of probable alcohol misuse. Reasonable suspicion testing is required when (1) one trained
supervisor can (2) articulate and substantiate physical, behavioral and performance indicators of probable
drug use or alcohol misuse by (3) observing the appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors of the
employee. Examples of conditions which may result in reasonable-suspicion testing include, but are not
limited to, the following:
1.

Physical signs and symptoms consistent with use of prohibited substances.

2.

Evidence of manufacture, distribution, dispensing, possession or use of prohibited
substances.

3.

Occurrence of a serious or potentially serious accident that may have been caused
by human error, including but not necessarily limited to any accident in which the
RTD Accident Investigation Team (AIT) is summoned.

4.

The employee is involved in an accident in which, at the reasonable discretion of
the supervisor, negligence, carelessness or poor judgment may have been involved.

5.

Fights involving physical contact, assaults, and flagrant disregard or violation of
established safety, security, or other operating procedures.

6.

Accidents in which an RTD vehicle rear-ends another vehicle and causes damage.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Safety-sensitive employees who have been off duty for 90 days or more for any reason, and have been
out of the random pool, must successfully pass a pre-employment drug test prior to the performance of
a safety-sensitive function.

Packet Pg. 121

1.B.2.a

In case of a non-fatal accident in which either (1) an individual sustains injuries requiring
immediate treatment at a medical treatment facility, (2) the RTD vehicle is a bus, van or automobile and
one or more vehicles incur disabling damage that requires towing from the site, or (3) the RTD vehicle is
a vehicle operating on rails and is removed from revenue service, tests will be conducted on all
employees on duty in the RTD vehicle (unless the employee's behavior can be completely discounted as
a contributing factor to the accident) and on any other employee whose performance could have
contributed to the accident.
The above post-accident testing procedures are separate from reasonable-suspicion testing
conducted under section 4.2.2 of this policy.
Post-accident testing will be done as soon as possible, and no later than eight hours after the
accident for alcohol testing and 32 hours after the accident for drug testing. An employee involved in an
accident must not use alcohol until after the employee undergoes alcohol testing or eight hours have
elapsed, whichever comes first. Every effort will be made to conduct alcohol testing within two hours
after the accident. In the event the alcohol test is delayed beyond two hours, RTD will prepare and
maintain a record stating the reason(s) for the delay. If an alcohol test is not administered within eight
hours following the accident, all attempts to administer the test must cease and RTD must update the
record.
Nothing in this policy shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical attention for
the injured following an accident or to prohibit an employee from leaving the scene of an accident for the
period necessary to obtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary emergency
medical care. However, any employee who under the above circumstances fails to remain readily
available for drug and alcohol testing (including notifying RTD of his or her location), or who otherwise
leaves the scene of an accident without appropriate authorization prior to submission to drug and alcohol
testing, will be considered to have refused the test. Under section 3.5 of this policy, leaving the scene
of an accident without valid reason is a serious violation subject to discipline up to and including
termination.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

In case of an accident involving any RTD vehicle (regardless of whether or not the vehicle is in
revenue service) that results in a death, tests will be conducted on all employees on duty in the RTD
vehicle and on any other employee whose performance could have contributed to the accident.

4.2.4 Return-to-Duty Testing
As part of the employment assessment and return-to-duty requirements set forth in sections 5.3
and 5.4 of this policy, any employee with a verified positive drug or alcohol test (i.e., a positive
confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) must test negative for drugs
and alcohol before returning to work, and will be subject to follow-up random drug and alcohol testing
after returning to work.

1.B.2.a

Employees in safety-sensitive positions will be subjected to unannounced random drug and
alcohol testing in accordance with FTA regulation 655.45. Random selections shall be a sufficient
number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than
the minimum annual percentage rate of 10% of the safety-sensitive workforce for alcohol and 25% for
drugs or at the rates set forth by the FTA in Part 655, as amended. Each such employee shall be in a
pool from which random selection is made. Each such employee shall have an equal chance at selection
and shall remain in the pool even after being tested. The basis for random selection shall be by a
scientifically valid random number generation method initiated by computer. To ensure that employees
have a reasonable expectation that they might be called for a test on any day they are at work, the
dates for random testing shall be spread reasonably throughout the calendar year. Random tests are
unannounced and immediate. Employees are required to proceed to the test site immediately upon
notification. Random testing may also be conducted pursuant to other sections of this policy. A safetysensitive employee shall only be randomly tested for alcohol misuse just before, during and just following
the performance of a safety-sensitive function. In addition, RTD senior staff will be expected to
participate in random testing (testing of non-safety-sensitive senior staff is based on RTD’s independent
authority and not federal regulations).

4.3

Employee Status Pending Test Results

Employees who are tested for reasonable suspicion or post accident testing will be immediately
removed from service without pay and will not be allowed to return to work until test results are
reported.
If a negative test result is reported, either from an initial test or a confirmatory test, the employee
will be notified immediately, returned to work, and compensated for the period of absence from work.
As a general rule, when an employee is sent for a random test, the employee will not be removed
from service pending receipt of test results.

5.0 Consequences of Positive Tests
5.1

Special Consequences for Safety-Sensitive Employees

A safety-sensitive employee with a confirmatory alcohol test result of 0.02 or greater, but less
than 0.04, shall be immediately removed from service for a minimum of eight hours, or until re-tested
below 0.02 or until the employee's next shift. A safety-sensitive employee with a verified positive test
(i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) shall be
immediately removed from service until after an employment assessment and release to return to duty
by a Substance Abuse Professional (“SAP”) under section 5.3 of this policy.

Discipline for a positive drug or alcohol test is set forth in paragraph 3.3 above.

Employment Assessment

Any employee with a verified positive test (i.e., a positive confirmatory test for drug use or
alcohol concentration of 0.04 or greater) will be immediately removed from duty and must be promptly
assessed by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP). An SAP is either (1) a licensed physician, or a
licensed or certified psychologist, social worker, or employee assistance professional with knowledge of
and clinical experience in the diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-and drug-related disorders; or (2) an
addiction counselor certified by the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors
Certification Commission. The SAP will evaluate each employee to determine what assistance, if any,
the employee needs in resolving problems associated with prohibited substance abuse or misuse.
Assessment by an SAP does not exempt an employee from discipline, and does not guarantee
continued employment or reinstatement. The cost of any treatment or rehabilitation services will be paid
by the employee or the employee's own insurance provider.
If the SAP releases the employee to return to duty, the employee must promptly follow the
rehabilitation program prescribed by the SAP, must pass a directly observed return-to-duty drug and
alcohol test (non-observed return-to-duty for positive/refusal results that were collected under RTD
authority), and must fulfill the return-to-duty requirements of section 5.4 of this policy.

5.4

Return-to-Duty Requirements

Employees who re-enter the workforce following (1) completion of a disciplinary suspension for a
verified positive drug or alcohol test, (2) a favorable employment assessment, and (3) successful returnto-duty testing, shall be subject to the following requirements:
1.

Unannounced observed follow-up drug and alcohol testing for one to five years
depending on the circumstances of the case and as recommended by the SAP.
Safety-sensitive employees must pass a minimum of six follow-up tests within the
first 12 months back in safety-sensitive duties.

2.

An agreement to follow specified after-care requirements recommended by the
SAP, with the cost of such requirements to be borne by the employee or the
employee's own insurance provider.

3.

Compliance with all recommendations of the SAP, and release to RTD from each
treatment provider of records of attendance, recommendations, and compliance.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

6.0 Employees Who Seek Assistance Prior to Violations

Employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug dependency prior to violation of this policy
will be referred to the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) for appropriate treatment and/or rehabilitation
program. Employees will not be subject to discipline for their participation in such programs. Employees
participating in or completing a treatment or rehabilitation program will continue to be required to comply
with RTD performance standards, policies, and rules and regulations, including but not limited to this
policy, and may be subject to discipline if these are violated.
If determined necessary by RTD-approved medical professionals, medical leaves of absence may
be arranged to allow for proper treatment of employees who seek assistance with alcohol or drug
dependency, and RTD may make other reasonable accommodations pursuant to federal law.
RTD offers an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which is confidential, voluntary, free of
charge, and independent of RTD. EAP counselors can provide drug or alcohol treatment and/or
rehabilitation programs. Employees can call the EAP office directly and confidentially at 1-800-284-1819
to obtain additional information and to make an appointment. Alternatively, RTD encourages employees
with dependency problems to seek assistance through appropriate treatment or rehabilitation programs
with qualified Substance Abuse Professionals of their choice.
Upon successful completion of a treatment or rehabilitation program for drug or alcohol
dependency under this section, the employee must pass a non observed return-to-duty drug and alcohol
test and the employee will be subject to non observed random follow-up testing for a period of one year
to five years with a minimum of six times in the first year. An employee who fails to comply with non
observed random follow-up testing may be subject to discipline under section 3.5 of this policy.

7.0 System Contact
Employees are expected to fully understand and obey this policy. If you have any questions about
this policy or its effect on you, please ask your supervisor. Any persons with questions regarding this
policy or related matters are also invited to contact RTD's Labor Relations Manager at 303-299-6543
(D0-M1L) (represented employees) or RTD's Senior Manager, Human Resources Services at 303-2992100 (BLK-11) (salaried employees).

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Employees are strongly encouraged to seek assistance to overcome alcohol or drug dependency
problems before accidents or violations of this policy occur. RTD is strongly committed to working in a
positive manner with such employees.

Drug and Alcohol Policy

The attached materials contain discussion of the effects of drug and alcohol abuse on the health,
work, and personal life not only of the abuser but also the abuser's family, friends, and the public at
large. The materials also discuss the signs and symptoms of drug and alcohol problems, and possible
methods of intervening.

NOTE: RTD provides its employees a confidential Employee Assistance Program
(EAP) which provides employees and their immediate families a broad range of
confidential counseling and referral services for personal and job-related problems,
including drug or alcohol abuse. The program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week. The EAP provides up to eight sessions of counseling for a problem and, if
warranted, refers the employee or family member to another agency or helping facility.
The employee is responsible for charges after a referral is made; however, the EAP can
often find an agency whose services are free or covered by insurance. Sick leave may
be used to visit EAP counselors during regular business hours.

Drugs and Alcohol: Effects, Signs, and Solutions

Contrary to popular belief, relatively few drug or alcohol abusers are on "skid row." For example,
only three percent of alcoholics are destitute; most hold jobs and have families.
Drugs and alcohol affect their users' judgment, performance and safety-awareness, which in turn
directly affects the safety and well-being of the users' families, all other employees, and the public at
large.

Effects of Drug and Alcohol Abuse
Drug and alcohol abuse affect a person physically and mentally. These effects occur not only
during actual intoxication (which can last from almost immediately in the case of alcohol, to one to 24
hours after intake for other drugs), but also during residual hangovers, fatigue rebounds, and longer
periods of mental impairment. Physical and mental effects may include:


Poor coordination
Fatigue
Delayed decision-making
Poor or erratic judgment
Confusion
Learning difficulties
Poor memory
Loss of concentration
Depression or anxiety
Difficulty in sorting out priority tasks
Neurotic or psychotic behavior
Refusal to accept authority

Drugs and alcohol can also lead to many serious physical problems. For example, cocaine use even in small amounts, or by first-time users -- has been linked with heart attacks. Amphetamine abuse
can lead to strokes. Alcoholism can cause fatal cirrhosis of the liver. Use of heroin and other
intravenously-injected drugs expose the user to transmission of AIDS.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

One of every ten U.S. workers abuses alcohol or drugs. In fact, some studies conclude that up to
20-25 percent of the nation's workforce may be abusing alcohol or drugs. Experts estimate that there
are 10 million alcoholics in this country, 6 million current cocaine abusers, 16 to 20 million people who
frequently use marijuana, and several million persons who abuse prescription drugs.

Some persons wrongly believe that marijuana is relatively "safe." However, in addition to
marijuana's links to many of the above physical and mental disturbances, research indicates that
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

21

Packet Pg. 128

1.B.2.a

marijuana is a "gateway" drug leading to further drug use. Almost 60 percent of marijuana users will go
on to use other drugs.
RTD's mission to provide safe and efficient mass transit is directly threatened by employees' drug
and alcohol abuse. For example, each year approximately two million motor vehicle collisions occur that
involve drinking and driving, injuring 700,000 persons and killing 25,000 persons. One of every two
Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related traffic accident in his or her lifetime.

The first signs of drug or alcohol abuse may be hard to distinguish from signs of other problems
such as job stress, overwork, fatigue, or emotional problems. To make recognition even more difficult,
drug- and alcohol-abusing employees often develop survival skills to avoid detection. Supervisors and
co-workers need to be aware of the following general signs of drug and alcohol abuse:


Absenteeism or tardiness. Employees with substance abuse problems may be absent an average of
two to three times more than the normal employee. They may exhibit a pattern of absences on
certain days, such as Mondays and Fridays.



Staff turnover. Chemically dependent people have disorganized lives. Many quit rather than face
detection; others transfer or are fired for poor or unsafe performance.



Equipment breakdown. Substance-abusing employees often lose interest in maintenance of
equipment and may use broken equipment as a way to avoid work.



Erratic performance; poor work quality. Mental and physical agility and concentration deteriorate
with substance abuse. The abuser may miss deadlines, have poor concentration, work in bursts of
energy, and overlook important details. The person becomes unreliable.



Poor morale. Substance abuse creates wide mood swings, anxiety depression, and anger. Coworkers often see substance abusers as poor "team workers" and safety hazards. Abusers often
blame work problems on someone or something else.



Increased accidents and "near-misses." Impaired employees are 3.6 times more likely to cause an
accident. Even small quantities of drugs or alcohol in the system can cause deterioration of
alertness, clear-mindedness, and reaction speed. For example, studies show that a person's driving
ability substantially decreases at a blood alcohol content level of .04%. This is the equivalent of
approximately two beers or one martini consumed in one hour.



Theft. Drugs are expensive, and drug users need lots of money to support their habits. As
substance abusers' value systems and judgment are affected by drugs, their loyalty and dedication to
their co-workers and employers is weakened.

Signs of Drug and Alcohol Abuse

The following signs may also indicate involvement of drugs or alcohol in a person's problems:

Note that each symptom, by itself, may point to problems other than drug or alcohol abuse.
However, when a pattern begins to develop, a supervisor, manager, co-worker or family member needs
to be alert and act quickly. Fueled by drug or alcohol abuse, these behaviors can quickly lead to
accidents, productivity problems, higher operating costs, greater absenteeism, and worsened service to
the public.

Solutions for Drug and Alcohol Abuse
One of the biggest obstacles to overcome in trying to help or reach the drug or alcohol abuser is
denial. To overcome a drug or alcohol dependency, a person must first and foremost be able and willing
to recognize the problem. However, some abusers, especially cocaine users, erroneously believe that
the drug actually improves their performance. Others insist that they can "control" their addictions on
their own. Denial must be confronted and overcome before the abuser can begin to recover.
Supervisors and co-workers endanger the lives and safety of the abuser, and his or her family, coworkers and the public, if they try to "cover up" for the abusing employee or do the employee's work.
Co-workers and supervisors should not allow a suspected substance abuser to continue working
at a lower level, and should not let friendship with the employee or fear of exposing an "embarrassing"
problem lead them into concealing the problem. They should not share in the abuser's denial by
encouraging the abuser to believe that he or she doesn't have a problem.

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

1.B.2.a

Co-workers and supervisors should pay attention to the warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse,
talk to the abuser about concerns you have for the abuser's health or job, and refuse to cover up for or
take excuses from the abuser.
Supervisors should also know how to administer and apply RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy and
other performance rules and policies.
RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

23

Packet Pg. 130

1.B.2.a

Co-workers and supervisors should encourage a suspected abuser of drugs or alcohol to seek
assistance from RTD's Employee Assistance Program. The abuser should be reminded that any help
offered through the EAP program is strictly confidential. Such EAP programs have 70-80 percent
success rates for substance abuse recovery. This is higher than rates for other programs, because with
EAP programs the employee has the commitment of the company behind him or her.
A person dependent on drugs or alcohol can also be referred to his or her personal health care
provider or clergy member, to private alcohol or drug treatment clinics, or to self-help groups such as
Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous.
Additional information on drug and alcohol use and abuse can be obtained from the Employee Assistance
Program or RTD's Department of Administration.

RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy (03.04.2013.)

Attachment: 2013 Drug and Alcohol Policy (1588 : RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy)

Successful intervention in the workplace often starts with a frank, firm, but sensitive discussion
with the person, focusing on problems with the person's performance or safety. To deal with the
person's likely denials, problems should be clearly documented so that the person can be shown clearcut evidence of what is wrong.

APPENDIX B
Regional Transportation District
Drug and Alcohol Policy

Many elements of RTD's Drug and Alcohol Policy are required by federal regulations covering
transit employees in safety-sensitive positions. Other elements of RTD's policy are not required by
federal regulations but are official RTD policy. Federal regulations require RTD to identify which
provisions of its policy are mandated by the regulations and which are not.
The parts of the Regional Transportation District Drug and Alcohol Policy not mandated by federal
regulations are as follows:
1.

RTD’s Policy applies to more than safety-sensitive employees covered by federal regulations. It
applies to all safety-sensitive and non-safety-sensitive RTD employees, volunteers, and
contractors. Visitors and vendors are also expected to adhere to the Policy while on RTD
property. (See Policy section 2.1.)

2.

RTD’s Policy contains hours of compliance beyond those required by federal regulations.
Specifically, employees are subject to the Policy while on RTD duty, while on the property of RTD
to perform RTD duty, while driving RTD vehicles, on lunch or other breaks if the employee is
scheduled to return to work when the break ends, on regularly scheduled days, and when
volunteering for or assigned to extra work on days off, holidays, etc. (See Policy section 2.3.)

3.

Discipline is not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.0 and 6.0.)

4.

Possession/use of prohibited substances, criminal convictions, noncompliance with treatment
requirements, improper use of policy, and alcoholic beverages on RTD property are not addressed
in the federal regulations. (See Policy sections 3.1, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.)

5.

The RTD-Union agreements for Union review of the Drug and Alcohol program and blind testing
results, and for joint review, are not addressed in the federal regulations. (See Policy section 4.1.)

6.

RTD has reserved the right, not based on federal regulations, to conduct reasonable-suspicion
testing by separate urine specimen for additional drugs including barbiturates, benzodiazepines
(e.g. Valium, Librium, Xanax), nonbarbiturate sedatives (e.g., Quaalude,), and nonamphetamine
stimulants. (See Policy section 4.1.1.).

7.

The following tests for non-safety-sensitive positions are not addressed in the federal regulations:
Pre-employment, Reasonable Suspicion, Post-Accident, Return-to-Duty, Follow-up and Senior
Staff Random testing. (See Policy section 4.2.)

Be Cautious. All medications, prescription (Rx) and over-the-counter (OTC) medications
have the potential to be dangerous. Use medications cautiously and always in
accordance with your physician’s directions. Do not perform any safety-sensitive
function if you are impaired by any medication; however this caution should not be
construed to require any FTA covered employee to delay or deny any necessary medical
treatment.
Inform your prescribing physician, dentist or other medical professional. Before accepting
a prescription, inform you physician of your safety-sensitive position and explain your job
duties. Do not assume he/she will remember your explanation from one visit to the next.
Remind him/her of any other medications you might be taking; make sure to include those
medications prescribed by other physicians. Make sure the physician has your complete
medical history. Ask if you will be able to perform your duties safely on these
medications. If no, ask if there is an alternative.
Solicit information from you pharmacist. Anytime you need additional information about
an Rx or OTC, ask your pharmacist. A pharmacist will be very knowledgeable about the
medication ingredients, side-effects, precautions, drug interactions, and effects when
combined with other drugs. Even if you have already obtained information from your
prescribing physician, your pharmacist may be more knowledgeable and be able to
provide additional information and insight. Read warning labels and side-effects provided
on information summaries provided with Rx and OTC’s.
Do not over-medicate. Always follow the prescription directly as written. Never increase
the dosage or frequency of use without explicit directions from your doctor. Not only is
this practice medically risky, but increased dose of a medication may cause impairment
when the same medication used as recommended may not.
Check the strength of the prescription. Sometimes medicines are prescribed in different
strengths (i.e., 500 vs. 250 MG). Do not take a pill without first checking the dosage
and comparing it to the prescription, even it you have taken this medication before or this
is a refill.
Never take someone else’s medication. Even if you have taken this medication or one
like it before, this is illegal, dangerous, and it may cause impairment.
Always monitor your reaction. Anytime you take any medication (Rx or OTC) watch for
any side-effects which could impact your ability to perform your job safely including
drowsiness, dizziness, confusion, etc. Try to get accustomed to the medication first
before reporting for work. The same applies even if you have taken this medication in
the past with no previous side-effects. An individual’s reactions to a medication may
vary with each treatment, the nature of the illness and other medications taken.
Avoid Rx/OTCs that have been problems in the past. If you have taken medications in

the past that have caused negative side-effects, make a note of the active ingredients
and avoid these in the future. Inform your prescribing physician of your problem with the
previous medications and ask for alternative medications that do not have this ingredient.
For OTCs read the ingredient portion of the label and ask the pharmacist for assistance.
Ask for alternative treatments or dosage schedule. If you notice side-effects that could
pose a safety risk, consult your prescribing physician (or pharmacist in the case of an
OTC) about alternative treatments, medications, dosages, or schedule of use. You may
be able to avoid the negative side-effects by simply shifting the dosage schedule to take
your medications following your shift rather than before.
Do not perform safety sensitive duties while impaired. In instances where no alternative
prescription is available, you must inform your supervisor that you cannot perform any
safety sensitive duty while you are impaired by such medication.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
NEVE’S UNIFORMS - CONTRACT # 27DK007
AUDIT REPORT # 13-02-01

RTD contracted with Neve’s Uniforms Inc. to supply uniforms for RTD Bus
Operators and Street Supervisors, starting in early 2008. The original estimated
value of this three year contract to supply selected RTD uniforms was just over $1
million. Per Oracle data extracts, RTD spent approximately $190,000 for Bus
Operator and Street Supervisor uniform supplies in 2012.
Each qualifying RTD employee is provided a ‘Uniform Purchase Certificate’ and a
clothing guide which specify how much they are authorized to spend at Neve’s for
their uniform needs. The authorized amounts depend on how long the employee
has been with RTD and max out at $375 for the first year of employment.

AUDIT SCOPE
We reviewed the process to develop an RFP within RTD, solicit various firms,
obtain and evaluate proposals from firms expressing an interest in bidding on the
project, and selecting the winning contractor. We also reviewed the controls over
vendor payments to ensure only authorized clothing and equipment were
purchased and vendor invoices were properly approved and paid in a timely
manner.

CONCLUSION
Our review noted the contract award process was appropriately followed however,
only Neve’s Uniforms Inc. replied with a local competitive bid. Our test of paid
invoices indicated that charges were within policy guidelines, were properly
supported, and were appropriately approved at RTD before payment.
CURRENT STATUS
No further Internal Audit follow-up is required at this time.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
INTERNAL AUDIT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
AUDIT REPORT 13-02-02

To provide a basis for the operations of a division or department, complete policies
and procedures should be well documented and current. These procedures not
only highlight the operations of a given department, they also provide a valuable
training aid for new and existing employees. Internal Audit relies on each
department’s policies and procedures as an integral part of our audit reviews. As
such, it is important that the Internal Audit department also maintain proper
policies and procedures to document the operations of this function.

AUDIT SCOPE
To ensure the Internal Audit department procedures are current and complete, an
extensive review is conducted every two to three years. This review includes all
individual policies as well as an update of all relevant professional standards
associated with internal auditing. In addition to evaluating existing procedures,
Internal Audit reviewed current literature to determine any areas where policies
should be expanded.

CONCLUSION
Our review of the Internal Audit department policy and procedure manual indicated
it was generally complete and up-to-date. The manual was revised during our
review to reflect changes in professional standards as well as improvements in
reporting audit plans and results to the Financial Administrative and Audit
Committee, and the Board of Directors. No significant exceptions were identified.

CURRENT STATUS
The new procedure manual has been printed and is available from the Audit
department. We consider this review closed.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
CHANGE ORDER CONTROLS
AUDIT REPORT 13-04-01

BACKGROUND SUMMARY

The Regional Transportation District has been conducting one of the largest public
transit expansion projects in the country. The FasTracks construction of several
rail lines and BRT projects has required complex contracts to be negotiated with a
variety of contractors, both locally and nationally. As with any major construction
project, there are always changes and adjustments which need to be addressed as
a result of unforeseen, on-site issues. As such, they require scrutiny to ensure
that the original contract amounts are not exceeded and changes do not revise the
initial scope of work.

AUDIT SCOPE
This audit was selected by Internal Audit and reviewed the general controls over
change orders to existing agreements. The process was examined to determine if
controls relating to changes in construction as well as overall costs were
reasonable. In addition, processes regarding the methods that these changes were
recorded and described within RTD’s ERP system were reviewed.

CONCLUSION
The audit revealed no significant exceptions. Some minor clerical omissions were
identified in the electronic documentation but were cleared upon review of various
hard copy files. We also noted two minor technical issues regarding a conflict in
departmental policies and an on-going issue with contract accounting controls
within the ERP system.

REPORT OF THE INTERNAL AUDITOR
PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
AUDIT REPORT 13-04-02

BACKGROUND SUMMARY
RTD provides various transportation services to their customers, by both bus and
rail. To ensure these services are meeting the needs of the District and its
passengers, RTD has developed a set of standards and measurements designed to
evaluate various operations. These standards relate to the mission statement for
RTD and cover providing safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and costefficient transportation services.
AUDIT SCOPE
This review was selected by Internal Audit. We reviewed the various performance
standards used by RTD to determine the operational efficiency and internal
monitoring of services.
Standards were reviewed for accurate and timely
reporting. We reviewed procedures to ensure standards are periodically examined
and adjusted as situations change and the FasTracks program expands. In
addition, the results were reviewed for the past two years to determine the level of
compliance maintained by the District.

CONCLUSION
The current procedures provide adequate control and updating of the appropriate
standards. The standards are reviewed annually by RTD staff in conjunction with
budget preparation and are approved by, the Board of Directors.
Senior
management stated there were discussions pending to review all of the standards
to determine if any revisions were appropriate. Internal Audit agrees with the
process and the methods RTD uses to determine service standards. A high level of
compliance has been consistently maintained.

First Quarter 2013 Investment Report

Information

DISCUSSION
Please find the District’s investment report for the first quarter of 2013 attached.
The U.S. economy expanded modestly (2.5 percent) during the first quarter of 2013. The unemployment
rate declined modestly over the period but still remains elevated and general inflationary pressures
remain tame.
In order to promote economic recovery, the Federal Reserve chose to continue with its accommodative
monetary policy and leave the federal funds target rate range (0.0% - 0.25%) unchanged during the
fourth quarter noting that this level will continue to “be appropriate at least as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5% and inflation expectations continue to be well anchored”.
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:
RTD cash and cash equivalents:
B of A/Merrill Lynch 3-month U.S. T-Bill Index

1st Quarter
0.033%
0.016%

B of A/Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index:

0.074%
0.075%

0.074%
0.075%

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the first quarter of 2013 was 0.7% which would
produce annualized earnings of $2.438 million. The current return for the month of March was 0.66%.

Subject:

2013 Financing Update

INFORMATION
As previously approved by the Board of Directors, staff has proceeded with three debt refunding
transactions in 2013 for interest expense savings. The District’s Debt Management Policy requires that
refunding transactions achieve a minimum of 3% present value savings which was achieved. The final
maturity of the previously outstanding obligations was not extended and the interest expense to be
saved over the life of the bonds is summarized as follows:

Refunded Debt
2004 & 2005A Senior Bonds
2005A Certificates of Participation
2006A FasTracks Bonds
Total Interest Savings

Amount

$ 96,580,000

$ 83,836,388

Present
Value
Savings
4.19%
6.93%
5.50%

In an effort to maximize efficiency, staff combined the 2005A Certificates of Participation refunding with
the raising of approximately $200 million of new capital to fund new bus and ticket vending equipment
as anticipated in the Strategic Budget Plan. The interest rate obtained on the new equipment financing
was 2.59%.
During all three of these transactions, the ratings agencies of Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch
reviewed their previously issued credit ratings for the RTD bonds and Certificates of participation and
affirmed all of the previously issued ratings. The agencies did note that declines or underperformance in
sales tax revenues or the issuance in the near term of a significant amount of debt beyond current plans
could prompt a downgrade of RTD ratings.
Additional financing plans for 2013 include a $240 million grant anticipation note financing relating to
advancing a portion of the $1.030 billion Federal New Starts Grant related to the Eagle project. The
final planned financing transaction for 2013 is an approximately $120 million FasTracks revenue bond
issue which, together with other available funds will finance construction of the North Metro Rail Line to
72nd avenue.

2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan Update

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this Board Report is (1) for Staff to present the Board with the draft of the Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP), (2) to give the Board an opportunity to further discuss the magnitude and nature of
the challenges in the SBP, and (3) to provide the Board with process knowledge as staff moves forward
to balance the SBP and the 2014 Budget.
DISCUSSION
The Strategic Budget Plan is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash
flow planning information used to develop the upcoming annual budget, new capital budget, and overall
scope of program activity, including hours of service the District can afford to provide. Staff includes a
PowerPoint presentation for this discussion which includes the following:

OPERATING REVENUE:

(1) Positive variance on diesel fuel and purchased transportation due to invoice timing
(2) Variance is primarily due to lower than anticipated costs on maintenance campaigns with additional variances from traction power and wages
(3) Variance due to timing of invoices for East Colfax Transit Study and Northwest Area Mobilitiy Study (NAMS) costs
(4) Variance is primarily due to timing of grant funded projects as well as the Mall project
(5) Year end accrual reversals for grounds maintenance and security services
(6) Variance due to lower outside legal fees and lower licenses, permits and penalties
(7) Variance due to timing of low value computer and communication equipment purchases and data processing services
(8) Variance from budgeted costs for schedule printing, SmartCard and grand opening events
(9) Purchasing card expenses are initially coded to this department and subsequently moved to the correct departments once purchasing cards are reconciled and paid.
(10) Variance reflects the union lump sum payment in which costs were budgeted throughout the year. This will be modified for timing with the Amended Budget.
