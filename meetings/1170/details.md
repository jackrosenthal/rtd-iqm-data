#### 1. Presentation of 2012 RTD Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and Report to Governance

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors accept and enter into the record the District’s audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2012 as prepared by Staff and  audited by the District's independent auditor, RubinBrown, LLP.

Motion:              Director Folska made the motion to move this to the full Board at the May 28th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Lasater seconded the motion

Discussion:               Terry Howerter stated that compiling the financial statements took many man hours.  He explained that the audit process began back in September of 2012.  Terry introduced Kathy Maher from Rubin Brown, Susan Sandoval from the Accounting Office at District Shops, Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Review and Cheryl Wallace from Rubin Brown.

Cheryl Wallace reviewed the required communications with the Board.  Rubin Brown issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements for the District, as well as on the compliance and controls for RTD’s federal funds.  The comprehensive annual financial report has different sections; they did provide an opinion on the federal awards, budget information and fund statements.  They did not provide an opinion on the management discussion analysis and pension information which is done by the District or the introductory and statistical information.  The scope and timing of the audit was planned through communications on August 30, 2012.  The District implemented two new required accounting practices successfully; one was codification and the other one had to do with deferred inflows and outflows.

When Rubin Brown looked at the estimates on the financials, RTD basically has three estimates by classification.  Depreciation is considered an estimate because we have capital assets and we are estimating the useful lives.  Allowance is also an estimate because of the receivables for the revenue.  There is also an estimate related to the net pension obligation related to the pension plan.  With regard to sensitive disclosures, RTD has a few.  That means that there are some transactions that warrant attention.

She stated that there were no difficulties encountered during the audit.  The District was very well prepared and responded in a timely manner to all of Rubin Brown’s requests.  There were no corrected or uncorrected misstatements which means that the information the Board receives on an interim basis is accurate and reliable.  They did not have any disagreements with management.  They did ask management to sign a representations letter.  There were no outside consultations and no other significant audit findings.

Kathy Maher reviewed their observations and suggestions for the Board.  They noted two key areas that RTD excelled during the year.  RTD did a great job looking at the account receivables balances; staff analyzed what was collectable and wrote off old and long-outstanding balance.  The second piece is that RTD was named one of the most significant construction projects.

The audit of the financial statements was unqualified which is a clean opinion.  They have some comments and suggestions.  With regard to Davis-Bacon, RTD’s policy states that all certified payroll should be reviewed but because there is so many sub-contractors, some areas are only doing a sample review as opposed to a full review.  Therefore they recommend RTD solidifies the policy on what they should be reviewing and consider using the in-house certified statistician to ensure that the proper sampling is being performed.  With regard to the construction in progress process, RTD records construction in progress and in the accounting system there is a project completion date which is the budget date.  They recommend improved communication between the project managers and the finance department for when that project is placed in service so that they can be properly categorized in terms of asset class and the depreciation of those assets.  On the federal grants, they noticed that some grant requirements were not clearly communicated to all departments.  Again they recommend improved communications and record maintenance for federal grants.

With regard to Information Technology (IT) governance, they brought in a specialist to review RTD’s processes.  The first category was documenting the information security policy and nailing down the policy for all different areas of RTD.  The second was performing an IT risk assessment to help the leadership understand the IT risks.  With regard to IT access, they suggested a review the super user’s access to understand who has that access and reviewing periodically.  They recommend reducing the unrestricted physical access to the server room.  Finally, they also recommend expanding management’s user access of the different modules that each employee has access to.

Cheryl stated that RTD had a clean audit; it had unqualified opinions and good practices.  They only had some observations to improve some of the positive control environments that are already in place.  Terry Howerter stated that the staff has reviewed the recommendations and support their implementation.

Director Menten asked for a spreadsheet of the account receivables that were written off.  Terry stated that they will provide it.  He reminded the Board to keep in mind that they place an allowance on the account receivables which means that they have concerns that they might not be collectible.  That is kept in the accounting records.  Director Menten also asked for the grand total.  Cheryl stated that the balance sheet is on page 40 of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report and it includes the allowance.  Terry stated that it was $4,131,000 for the current year and the allowance for that is $851,000.

Director Menten asked if they do an audit on the DBE/SBE programs.  GM Washington stated that staff provides that update at the Civil Rights Committee meeting.  They review it by agency goals and existing contracts.  The compliance office evaluates each contract constantly to see if they are meeting the goal.  Director Menten stated that she has concerns with regard to the companies being certified DBE/SBE when they really are not.  GM Washington clarified that RTD is not a certifying agency for DBE.  The Colorado Department of Transportation or the City/County of Denver certifies DBEs.  They are the ones that verify that the companies are DBE/SBE.  RTD has very good connection with the certifying agencies but we are not going out and checking firms because we are not the certifying agency.

Director Hoy congratulated the staff on a clean audit.    He feels that with regard to the items for improvement, some of them are not clear.  With regard to the Davis-Bacon there seems to be a disparity on what we say we do and what we actually do.  He wonders as we go forward if we are working with Rubin-Brown on those issues or working on them on our own.   Terry stated that RTD will implement the suggestions and next year the audit company will review what we have done.  Cheryl stated that they are here during interim to work on this.  They come several times during the year.  They will probably be here in September.  GM Washington explained that we have not had a repeat finding which means we are fixing those issues.

Director Lasater stated that he finds it disconcerting that we have the weaknesses indicated in the report with regard to IT.  Physical access to a server room should not be allowed as we are a highly fiscally responsible entity.   With regard to the super users’ access, he likes the recommendation of having an independent third party agency keep track of it.  He is surprised that we do not have a policy in place that addresses this discrepancy.  He would like this fixed as soon as possible.  Terry stated that the access to the server room has already been modified.  Trent Ratcliff is reviewing our IT policies and making recommendations on changes.

Director Sisk asked if they can provide the advisory comments from last year and what was done to address those issues.  Cheryl stated that they will provide it.  Director Sisk also asked about the management estimate of net pension obligations.  He asked what they did to estimate it and if they mean that we are in compliance with our pension requirements.  Cheryl stated that it is a management estimate and that they rely on actuarial information.  RTD employs actuaries to look at the pension fund.  They do the statistical analysis and based on the benefit RTD provides they identify what the paying contribution should be and where the plan is.  Rubin Brown looks at that information and makes sure that it is consistent and that it follows GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).  Director Sisk summarized that Rubin Brown bases their opinion on actuarials that are hired by RTD but they do not go back and validate the actuarials with other organizations.  Cheryl stated that as auditors they are required to look at the assumptions and if RTD had an assumption of investment return of 20% that would get their attention because RTD would not be earning 20%.  They do a litmus test of the assumptions projected.

Director Bagley asked which way we are trending for the debt to net position ratio for 2013.  Terry stated that in 2013 we will increase the debt level due to some of the plans for financing the buses which was just approved by the Board.  He looks on a regular basis at the net revenue calculation which requires RTD to have net revenue 1.2 of debt which indicates that we have adequate funds to pay all of our bills, take care of our expenses, service our debt and have a reminder after that.  Director Bagley stated that he understands that staff is satisfied with where we are today.

Director Walker stated that we will work with our contractors to help them overcome any problems they had before the final audit is issued.  He assumes that is what Rubin Brown does.  Cheryl affirmed that is what they do.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED to the Consent Agenda.

##### a. 2012 CAFR Final

#### 2. RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the revised RTD Drug and Alcohol Policy mandated by the Federal Transit Administration of the United States Department of Transportation.

Motion:              Director Bagley made the motion to move this to the full Board at the May 28th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, stated that the proposed changes to the current Drug and Alcohol Policy which was approved by the Board on October 2011 were outlined in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  This is to make sure the policy complies with the recent changes in the federal regulation guidance on recreational and medical marijuana and collective Bargaining Agreement as negotiated with the ATU 1001.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.

#### 1. First Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager for Communications, and Kevin Parker, Auditor, stated that the Statements of the Audit completed in the first quarter of 2013 and the current status report are included in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

#### 2. First Quarter 2013 Investment Report

Terry Howerter stated that the District’s investment report for the first quarter is included in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  He highlighted that they met the benchmark and that the first quarter of 2013 was .7% annualized earnings on our investments.

Director Lubow noticed that the 2013 yield seems lower than 2012.  She asked if there is a reason for that.  Brenden Morgan stated that interest rates have move down in the first quarter and we had a large construction payment of over a $100 million this year.  We were allowing those securities to mature and reinvesting in money market funds that paid very little in this current market environment.

#### 3. 2013 Financing Update

Terry Howerter stated that they included a summary in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  Brenden Morgan stated that RTD has initiated the three debt refunding transactions for interest expense savings.  They have achieved the 3% value savings required.  The 2004-2005A Series Bond has a present value savings of 4.19%, the 2005A Certificates of Participation have a 6.935% and the 2006A FasTracks Bonds have a 5.5%.  If we add the savings all together, RTD will save $83.8 Million over the remaining life of the bonds.  That savings is net of the expenses associated with completing these transactions.

Director Hoy asked if the $84 million is a savings over what we would have spent if we had not done this refinancing.  He also asked if the terms of the bonds remained the same.  Brenden stated that he is correct with regards to the savings.  He said that we did not change the terms of the bonds to extend our obligation out further into the future.  Director Hoy asked where those savings will be allocated.  GM Washington stated that typically any savings would go into the general fund; however, he is not sure this is “real money”.  The savings come over the life of the bonds.  On the base system it would go in the general fund.  On the FasTracks side we would try to do more as listed in the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM).  The RAM identify the projects where the funds would go.  Terry stated that when we did these three refinancings it is a complicated process.  They lined things up in certain years so that our payment stream would improve our net revenue calculation.  Secondly we did not go further out from what we had originally issued for the bonds.  On the 2006 FasTracks Bonds of $53 million, the interest savings will be recognized between now and 2036 when those bonds are retired.  The great thing is that this reduces our Tabor obligations by $53 million giving RTD the benefit today to issue additional Tabor sales tax debt.  This is the best debt we can issue for RTD.  The savings are coming back into the program.

Director James asked if the present value saving is the interest that would have been paid over the entire term of the debt.  Terry stated that the interest saving is the new debt compared to the original debt.  Director James asked if the 3% threshold used for the present value is comparable to a home mortgage refinancing where you want the interest rate to be low enough to make it worthwhile.  Terry stated that that is correct.

Director Sisk asked what Brenden Morgan meant by the comment of the financing agencies stating that declines or underperformance in sales tax revenues or the issuance in the near term of a significant amount of debt beyond current plans could result on a downgrade of RTD’s ratings.  Brenden stated that when the agencies prepare the report on any given credit issuance, they list any factors that theoretically could cause our rating to increase or decrease.  On the decrease side of that they had the underperformance of the sales tax revenue or significant amount of debt beyond of what we currently have in our plans.  We already briefed them on the FasTracks revenue bonds that we will be potentially issuing later this year to fund the North Metro Rail line, so they are already considering this; however, if were to come back with another $500 million debt deal they would have to take a close look at that and see if that would have a negative impact.  Director Sisk asked if we are suggesting that our sales tax revenues are not within our budget.  Terry said that we are suggesting that. We budgeted a 4.2% increase over the prior year and we are currently at 1.9%.  The other thing is that on our sales tax bond issues, they are very secure.   The rating agencies have not had too much of a concern over the sales tax backed bond issues.  Their concern is on our Certificates of Participations (COPs).   Their concerns is that if our sales tax revenue decreases, we will continue to service our bonds but the Board might not approve the annual appropriations for the COPs.  That is where we have some risk, if any at all, but they are aware of everything we have planned.

#### 4. 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan Update

Terry Howerter explained that they come to the Board with updates on the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) to keep the Board informed as to what we are doing, how things are progressing with our amended budget and the SBP itself and what the next steps are.  They want the Board to be well informed as to what staff is looking at and have a good understanding of the process.

Jannette Scarpino reviewed the presentation that is included in the May 21, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.  The SBP is RTD’s six year plan.  It includes the years 2014-2019.  It only includes the base system and operating activities from the West Line which is funded by the FasTracks 0.4% tax.  FasTracks projects are covered separately.  At this point they are not recommending service reduction for 2014 to balance the SBP.   There is a fare increase projected by the Board for review in 2015.

On the SBP Summary Cash Flow – Base revenue comes in various forms; it includes fare revenue, sales and use tax, grant revenue, other income and a DUS land sale scheduled for 2014.  The Adjustment Balance is $16.5 in 2015, $14.4 in 2016 and $2.2 in 2018 for a total of $33 million over the SBP period.  The operating expenses do not including depreciation because it is a non-cash expense.  Included in the summary is the Collective Bargaining agreement with the Union and our diesel lock for 2013; it also includes the one-time project expenses for operating or expense project.  We also have the expense projects carry forward.  We reduced the FasTracks subsidy for the rubber tire services.  We show the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) contribution because we changed the methodology for the current SBP.  We show a FISA contribution from the sale of the Civic Center air rights in 2013.  The interest income derives from investable balances and the interest expenses derive from the amortization schedules that we run.  The change in net assets or income shows the capital expenditures which are in our current SBP’s project requests.  Our assumption for the change to fund balance is that we continue to support the Board appropriated fund to the tune of $3 million every year as well as the capital replacement fund to the tune of $3 million every year.  The beginning unrestricted net assets or fund balance is the ending fund balance from last year that is rolled over at the beginning of the year and then that amount is rolled forward to the unrestricted fund balance.  That bottom line is either positive or break even on both years.  The total adjustment to balance the SBP is $33 million over the time period; staff is working on resolution of this shortfall by focusing on the projects in the SBP and their impact to the cash flow.  They will eliminate or reduce the capital project requests and will bring those requests back into the SBP if sales tax improve or we have an excess fund balance at year end to draw on.  This is challenging because it affects our state of good repair as well as maintenance costs.  They will bring a final list of projects eliminated or deferred for Board review.  Until then the review process continues at the Senior Management level and their goal is to arrive at a balanced SBP.

They have included the West Line in the SBP analysis because it is an operating entity.  The revenue sources include a sales tax contribution from FasTracks because it is needed to support the West Line operating expenses and a reserve of 3 months of operating expenses in 2013 and a reserve of 2 months of operating expenses beginning on 2014.  The bottom line is positive and the contribution to the Board appropriated funds and capital replacement funds as well as the unrestricted year end fund balance represents 3 months of operating expenses in 2013 and 2 months of operating expenses in 2014.

For the next presentation in June they will show both operations combined for base systems and the West Line as well as show the West Line separately per they cost allocation methodology.  Jannette reviewed the opportunities and challenges listed in the presentation.

Next steps include:

- June 18 – Present 2013 Recommended Amended Budget; SBP Update to FAAC

- June 25 – Adopt 2013 Amended Budget

- July 9 – Presentation of SBP to FAAC for Board adoption

- July 16 – Adopt 2014-2019 SBP

- August 27 – 2014 Budget Study Session

Director Sisk thanked staff for the presentation.  He asked why the West Line contribution from FasTracks was not prorated.  Janette stated that the contribution is only required to cover operating expenses and any contribution to the fund balance.  The operating expenses for $11.8 million represents 8 months of operating expenses for 2013.   Director Sisk stated that he would expect that the tax contribution from FasTracks would be incremental.  Terry explained that what is in the operating expense is the training cost through April 26.  They had FasTracks employees for the West Corridor being trained and charged directly to FasTracks plus the 8 months of allocated expenses after that.  The revenue contribution for the sales tax is higher because they see it as three companies.  Company one is the base operation, company two is the FasTracks capital with all the projects on it and company three is the operation for the West Corridor.  They needed to grow a fund balance on FasTracks as well as company three so when you add companies two and three together we have an adequate fund balance per Board policy.  Director Sisk asked if when we open the other lines we will do the same.  Terry stated if that it is still a Board policy to have 2 months in the fund balance we will do the same thing for I-225.  Terry stated that he is starting to view this as a base system operation funded by FasTracks because Rail Operations runs the trains and they provide the maintenance.  All the cost are being taken through company three and supported by FasTracks.

Director Hoy wanted to clarify if we moved enough money to make the bottom line work.  Janette stated if you are asking if it is a “cash contribution” to base in 2013, the answer is no; it is just an accounting entry.

Director Rivera-Malpiede noted staff mentioned a fare increase for 2015.  Jannette stated that they will bring to the Board for consideration.  Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she would oppose a fare increase.  She thinks that we need to do whatever we need to do to avoid increasing the fare.  She wants to be a part of the analysis.  GM Washington stated that the policy states that we are should consider a fare increase every three years; it doesn’t mean we have to change it but the Board policy states we need to consider it every three years.  Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she is concerned about the constituents that would be living further away from the city because of the building of FasTracks.   She wants to make sure that they do not carry the burden of a fare increase.

#### 5. March 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report

Terry Howerter stated that the March 2013 Financial Status Report can be found in the May 21st, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet.

On the dashboard for the month over month comparison, ridership for the month went down by 4.5% (391,000), Fare Revenue increased by 2.1% ($202,000) and the Sales & Use Tax increased by 1.5% ($550,000).  On the year-to-date comparison, ridership decreased by 3.5% (871,000), fare revenue increased by 0.7% (192,000) and the Sales & Use Tax increased by 1.9% ($2,005,000).  The ridership was affected by the extra day last year due to leap year.

Doug MacLeod stated that they do not know anything in particular that is driving ridership down.   He mentioned that EcoPass, CollegePass and annual passes make up about 60% of the fare revenue which is not necessarily affected by ridership on the short term.  They see a decrease on the fare revenue on the short term for the cash paying customers.  The fare revenue is actually up because we have seen an increase on the passes.

On the statement of position, in the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA) in the base system column they show $5.563 million from the sale of air rights for Civic Center which the base system owned.  They were sold for $8,063,000.  They subtracted $2.5 million that went towards the Northwest Area Mobility Study and the remainder went to the FISA.

On the Sales & Use Tax trend report, the monthly percentage increase by month shows January 2013 being up 2.8% vs 2012.  February is up 1.6% and March 1.5%.  The commutative year-to-date is 1.9%.  The trend so far is below what CU Leeds forecasted.

Director Hoy asked for clarification with regards to the year-to-date fare revenue increase while ridership decreased.  Doug explained that a rider that purchases a monthly pass pays the same amount whether he rides once or 15 times during the month.  So no matter how the ridership fluctuates we still get the same amount of revenue in the passes.   The revenue went up because we had increases in our CollegePasses.

Director Lubow asked what we do when the Sales & Use Tax revenue is less than projected.  Terry stated that we monitor it closely and budget to that amount.  In June they will have a new forecast and we look at changes for the mid-term and long term.  These changes are included in the amended budget.  We will manage the budget and SBP to those factors.  Janette mentioned that in September the forecast was different to what they had in December.

Director Bagley stated that it would appear that the things not taken into consideration were the sequestration and change in social security deductions.  It makes people feel less wealthy and those are two factors that can contribute to the lower Sales & Use Tax collection.  Doug stated that those two factors definitely have an impact; however the CU Leeds School of Business had included those issues even though they were not sure on the impact they would have.

Director Walker asked what the biggest source is for Sales & Use Tax.  Doug stated that restaurants, automobile sales, warehouse stores, and fuel delivery are the biggest.  Terry stated that the bigger ones at this time of the year are the home repair/lumber shops (Lowes, Home Depot, etc.).   Director Walker asked if Denver collects Sales & Use Tax on building materials.  Terry stated that they do.

Director Bagley asked about the internet sales tax.  Terry stated that as far as when it might be approved staff is getting a mixed read.  It could be a year to four years out depending on who you talk to.  The nice thing is the tax is that RTD and the State of Colorado are well position with software in place to start collecting that money.  They expect that it would be around $15-20 million a year.  Bill 1272 for parity with the State will be signed next week.  Staff expects a small increase in our sales tax revenue when this occurs.   The audit at the state level is proceeding well and those numbers are not included in this report.
