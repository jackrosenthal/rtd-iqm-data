Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: April 19, 2016

Subject:

Longmont Free Fare Buy Up

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that RTD approve a new contract
with Boulder County to allow the County to continue to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local
fixed route services, herein referenced as “the 300 series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323,
324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride services for a period of an additional 18 months.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County entered into an agreement with the RTD in 2014 to “buy up” all fares on the 300 series
routes in Longmont. The current contract was for a period of two years from July 1, 2014 – June 30,
2016. The County would like to continue the program.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of the major reasons that ridership has declined in
Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective of this action is to continue to build ridership
and increase mobility options for low income riders.
Under this program all passengers will continue to be allowed unlimited boardings on all 300 series
routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or Regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of the
program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within their thresholds; any new cost will
be borne by Boulder County. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, have
performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of RTD
Marketing. RTD will continue to promote this program. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will
hold meetings to discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program.
During this 18 month period, Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD $391,806 for fares on the
300 series routes and approximately $21,150 for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service
area boundaries of the 300 series routes (the Access-a-Ride dollars are approximate and the County will
reimburse based on actual usage). Calculations for this reimbursement are based on the original dollar
amount established in the 2014 contract which was based on the 300 series fare revenue from 2012.
This new dollar amount reflects the new fare structure and an additional 8% to reflect the new riders.
There will be an escape clause in the contract that will allow either the County or RTD to discontinue the
program with 60 days’ notice.
Overall the program has been doing very well in terms of increased boardings. RTD survey results
reflected that approximately 8% of the increased boardings were “new” riders. 2013 boardings for the

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Longmont local routes were 156,863 boardings (weekday and Saturdays). In 2015 boardings increased
to 313,692.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There will be no financial impact to the RTD.

Proposed August 2016 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the
public for review and comment.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service
enhancements, routine schedule adjustments and several service reductions. Also included in this report
are two grant funded proposals anticipated to be implemented in the August service change. Funded
through a CMAQ grant, the new Route 62 would operate between the Central Park Boulevard Station
and 60th/Dahlia in Commerce City. Also funded through a CMAQ grant, enhancements to the frequency
of the Free Metro Ride operating between DUS and Civic Center Station are proposed. We will monitor
customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PROPOSED SERVICE CHANGES

Routes proposed for service improvements:
Route 62 – Commerce City/Stapleton: new grant funded route service between Central Park Boulevard
Station to 60th/Dahila.
Route 83L – Parker/Leetsdale: add a 5:04am weekday and 5:39am weekend trips from Civic Center
Station to Nine Mile.
Route 121 – Peoria Street: shift 12:15am from 40th & Airport Station to 12:45am.
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: add one PM eastbound Route FF6 trip
Free MetroRide: increase peak period frequency to operate every 4.5 minutes.

Packet Pg. 12

1.C.3

Routes proposed for service reductions:
BroncosRide and CU/CSU Game: discontinue BroncosRide and CU/CSU special service from the
Montbello park-nRide.

Routes proposed for mixed service improvements/service reductions:
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: cutback 2:57pm eastbound trip from Federal Center Station, to instead
originate at Lakewood Commons at 3:15pm.
Route 31 – Federal Crosstown: extend and convert a Route 30 trip to 72nd Avenue as a Route 31 trip
and shift the afternoon northbound school tripper.
Route 72/72W – 72nd Avenue Crosstown: reroute to serve the new Westminster (Rail) Station
Route BOLT – Boulder/Longmont: convert selected peak trips to become express trips.
Route CV/CS/CX – Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver: convert one Route CV trip leaving Civic Center
Station a Route CS trip.

Routes proposed for routine running time analysis/schedule adjustments
Route 1 – 1st Avenue: running time analysis to improve on-time performance
Route 3 – Alameda Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 11 – Mississippi Avenue: adjust evening trip times
Route 16 – West Colfax: minor schedule adjustments
Route 28 – 28th Avenue: minor schedule adjustments
Route 51 – Sheridan Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Route 66 – Arapahoe Road: running time and trip time adjustments
Route 76 – Wadsworth Boulevard: minor schedule adjustments
Flatiron Flyer – US 36 BRT: routine schedule adjustments

Seasonal Service Changes
School Service
Resume seasonal school service on the following routes:
Routes 1, 9, 11, 24, 30, 30Ltd, 31, 51, 52, 65, 73, 100, 206/206F and 208/208F
(Route 43 school tripper service replaced by increased frequency on the Route 43)
Routes BOUND, DASH, JUMP, SKIP and STAMPEDE: Change to fall/winter schedules.
Route N – Nederland/Boulder: reinstate routing to Eldora Ski Resort.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system financial impact contained in this proposal is estimated to be $719,170 annualized,
with $672,800 being funded through CMAQ grants, resulting in a net base system impact of $46,370.
PUBLIC HEARINGS
There are 4 public hearings proposed to be held between May 19th and May 24th in Commerce City,
Denver and Longmont.
A Look Ahead – January 2017
Route 43 – Martin Luther King Boulevard
Due to the likely increase in ridership caused by extending the service to the Auraria Campus the peak
periods will have to be monitored for need of additional capacity.
E Line
Responding to recent growth on the E Line weekday midday period (9:30 AM-2:30 PM) warrants an
increase in service to provide 15-minute service.

Adoption of 2017 Performance Measures

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopts the attached 2017 Performance Measures for mission statement goals 1-7. There are 23
specific performance measures in total, and it is proposed that an additional goal be added for a total
of 24.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These performance measures provide a framework in which RTD can
determine how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District within the
context of its mission statement, and integrate with the Board’s 2017 priorities of Fiscal
Sustainability, Workforce/Human Capital and State of Good Repair. A report detailing year-to-date
performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the end of
each quarter. The proposed performance measures for 2017 are brought to the Board of Directors for
approval at this time because the measures are used in development of the 2017-2022 Strategic
Budget Plan (SBP) and 2017 Budget.
DISCUSSION
Recommended changes in the adopted goals from 2016 to 2017 are listed below:
 Goal 3.1 System-wide on-time performance
The goal for system-wide on-time performance is reduced for Local On-Time Bus Service
from 88.0% to 86.0% and similarly reduced for Regional On-Time Service from 94.0%
to 92.0%. On-time service data has been collected since 2011 using Automated
Passenger Counters which have a GPS component. This automated collection method
has enabled the collection of far more accurate data regarding scheduled and on-time
performance. Data counts alone have exceeded 18,000/day vs. 240/day using the
previous observational method. The new data capture methodology has shown on-time
performance consistently in the 83%-86% range for local service. A peer review survey
indicated an on-time performance goal of 87.6% on average with actual on-time
performance of 81.9% on average.
Peer performance is below RTD’s current
performance of just over 85% overall and below the requested goal of 86%.
Additionally, Bus Operations has determined that an additional $2,000,000 in resources
would be required in order to consistently meet the 88%/94% goal.


Goal 3.2 Maintain system-wide service availability
o While service availability is currently measured for Light Rail, an additional goal is
proposed for service availability for Bus as well beginning in 2017. The measure is

Packet Pg. 34

2.B.3

calculated as total operating hours less service delay hours, divided by total scheduled
hours. In other words, it is the percentage of scheduled service that is available as
operating service. The goal has been 99.0% for Light Rail and will be 97.0% for Bus.
The latter is considered a realistic measure considering lost service experienced in
recent months from lack of operator availability. This measure also includes time lost as
a result of accidents, vehicle breakdowns, etc. Bus system-wide availability was 98%
for 2013, 97% for 2014, and 96% for 2015.


Goal 3.4 Improve mileage between road calls
o The goal for Mileage between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls is increased from
28,000 to 30,000 miles. The improvement is expected due to the new bus vehicles
that dominate the bus fleet and require fewer maintenance road calls. A lost service
maintenance road call is a maintenance-related problem that results in a revenue vehicle
being traded, towed, or repaired on the street causing a service delay of 1 minute or
more. Mileage between lost service road calls is calculated by dividing actual miles
operated by the number of lost service maintenance road calls.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o Overall ridership increase will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and in the Board-approved
Ridership Goal model, and it is carried as a placeholder at this time.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue and total operating revenue
o These measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2017 Annual Budget in November 2016 and are carried as placeholders at this time.

It is noted that we are developing a performance protocol for commuter rail linked to the
concessionaire agreement with Denver Transit Partners and such measurement report will be brought
to the Board for review at a later date. While we have numerous contractual reporting requirements
at various intervals, DTP’s operational reporting system is a work in progress and we plan to create a
baseline report in 2016 to incorporate relevant criteria. Major categories around which measurement
criteria will be developed include rolling stock availability, station availability, asset service availability,
and incident detail, among other criteria.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2017 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2017 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2017 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2017 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2017 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2017 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2017 Performance Report.

The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the pubic pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with chips. These cards can be loaded with certain
dollar amounts and used much like a debit card. Once the card is loaded, it can be used to board bus or
rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional value can be loaded onto
the card at RTD retail outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the Public Pilot Riders at the
RTD retail outlets. For the first twelve-weeks and as of March 27th, a total of 1,240 cards were issued
of which 950 (77%) were full fare and 290 (23%) were discount cards. The average initial stored
value loading is $42.18 with a total value loaded of $84,200. There have been 15,595 boardings using
these MyRide cards with fare payment value of $43,200. Of these boardings; 73% were local, 25%
regional and 2% airport.

Review of 2017-2022 SBP Development
Process and 2017 Budget Assumptions

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: April 6, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: April 12, 2016

BACKGROUND
Staff has prepared the attached presentation to give the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input in the development of the RTD 2017 Annual Budget. The purpose is to provide a
framework for conversation and to confirm Board approved parameters for decision making in the
development of the 2017 Budget and 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).
DISCUSSION
The Strategic Budget Plan is RTD’s six year financial plan for the Base System. It is updated
annually and provides important cash flow planning information used to develop the upcoming annual
operating budget and new capital budget and overall scope of program activity, including hours of
service the District can afford to provide. (See attached power point presentation.)
In the early stages of the development of the SBP and annual Budget, staff looks to the Board for
guidance regarding key budget objectives and assumptions that are to be used in the generation of
the financial plans. This is to inform the Board that staff intends to use these existing guidelines
unless overriding instructions are received. Parameters currently considered in the preparation of the
District’s 2017-2022 SBP and 2017 Budget are:
(1) Fiscal management, including requirements to operate per specified performance goals and
to maintain a balanced budget
(2) Continued development of fund balances, maintain adequate unrestricted fund balance
(3) Continued implementation of remaining Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations
as feasible
(4) Optimization of service levels for bus and light rail systems
(5) Fuel lock for budget certainty
(6) State of Good Repair (SOGR) of facilities and equipment
(7) Prioritization of capital and expense projects
(8) Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiated costs through 2017
(9) Planned fleet expansion/replacement and Certificate of Participation (COP) financing
(10) Cost allocation to West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide, and I-225 Rail Line
based on resource drivers
(11) Annual service payment to DTO for operation of commuter rail
(12) Increase in operating and maintenance costs and reduction in construction expenditures
for FasTracks
Material uncontrollable variables which significantly impact RTD’s budgeting process and financial
planning can change, however. The following items will affect RTD in the development of the 20172022 SBP and 2017 Budget:

Packet Pg. 77

2.C.3

(1) Sales and use tax revenues
a. Current quarterly CU-Leeds School forecast (March 2016) for sales and use tax
indicates an increase in 2016 of 6.4% above 2015 collections (Baseline Forecast)
b. Forecast for 2017 is an increase of 5.6% over 2016 (Baseline Forecast)
c. Actual sales and use tax year-to-date January 2016 increased 0.7% over same
time prior year
d. Actual sales and use tax January 2016 is 3.1% lower than budget
e. May consider using forecast that is lower than the baseline forecast
(2) Fuel costs
a. Diesel fuel is locked in 2016 at $2.23/gallon
b. A procurement is underway to renew our diesel fuel contract which expires at the
end of 2016; this will give us the opportunity to lock a price in 2016 for 2017
consumption
(3) Inflation rate/Consumer Price Index
a. Using Moody’s CPI forecasts (not Colorado Legislative Council) that agree with
FasTracks Annual Program Evaluation (APE)
b. Denver/Boulder area: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to operating and maintenance
costs/expense and capital project costs
2016: 2.4%
2017: 3.0%
2018: 3.1%
2019: 2.9%
2020: 2.7%
2021: 2.7%
2022: 2.6%
c. National: Moody’s CPI forecasts applied to fuel costs
2016: 1.3%
2017: 3.1%
2018: 3.0%
2019: 2.8%
2020: 2.5%
2021: 2.3%
2022: 2.3%
(4) Fare revenue increase
a. 2016 fare restructure had targeted a 10% increase in fare revenue in 2016 to meet
fare revenue goal in SBP
b. Given retention of transfers, fare revenue increase is expected to be approximately
6.5% system-wide in 2016 to be reflected in 2016 Amended Budget
c. 2017 fare revenue increase will be established with development of 2017 Budget
(5) Ridership
a. Ridership increase will be recalibrated in 2016 Amended Budget for an increase of
1% system-wide in 2016 (due to new FasTracks corridors offset by declining
ridership overall)
b. Actual results will serve as basis for 2017 estimate
(6) Additional grant revenues as they become available within Board policy and RTD
objectives
(7) Economic conditions in Colorado and the District
CONCLUSION

Packet Pg. 78

2.C.3

Staff is seeking guidance on how to proceed with the guidelines and parameters identified to develop
a first draft of the SBP, which staff tentatively plans to present to the Financial Administration &
