January Board Meeting Agenda Review
Motion:

Director Whitmore made the motion to move the
agenda for the January 28, 2025, Board
Meeting to the Full board.
Page 1 of 3

Director O’Keefe seconded the motion.
Chair Bouquet noted a few changes to the
agenda which are as follows.
First was a correction to the 2025 Committee
Appointments Board Report. First Vice Chair
O’Keefe was listed as an appointed member of
the Performance Committee, when Secretary
Nicholson should have been listed instead. The
Board Office will make the correction.
Second, at the request of Performance
Committee Chair Guzman, the Board Office will
add any proposed amendments that were
submitted by 5:00 p.m. on January 22, 2025,
for the GM/CEO Short-term Goals. Any proposed
amendments to the performance assessment
framework must still be brought to the floor at
the January 28, 2025, Board meeting by way of
a properly recognized motion and a second.
Lastly, Chair Bouquet asked if there was any
objection to proactively moving the 2025
GM/CEO Short-term Goals from Unanimous
Consent to Recommended Action, in anticipation
of discussion and potential amendments at the
Board Meeting.
Due to technical difficulties, the committee took a recess from 11:55 a.m. to 12:10
p.m.
Chair Bouquet declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
