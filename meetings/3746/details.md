Motion:              Director Whitmore made the motion to move the agenda for the January 28, 2025, Board Meeting to the Full board.

Director O’Keefe seconded the motion.

Chair Bouquet noted a few changes to the agenda which are as follows.

First correction was to the 2025 Committee Appointments Board Report. First Vice Chair O’Keefe was listed as an appointed member of the Performance Committee, when Secretary Nicholson should have been listed as the appointee instead.

Second correction was at the request of Performance Committee Chair Guzman, the Board Office will add any proposed amendments that were submitted by 5:00 p.m. on January 22, 2025, for the 2025 performance assessment framework for the GM-CEO. Any proposed amendment to the 2025 performance assessment framework must still be brought to the floor at the January 28, 2025, Board meeting by way of a properly recognized motion and a second.

Third correction was at the request of Chair Bouquet who asked if there was any objection to proactively moving the 2025 GM/CEO Short-term Goals item from Unanimous Consent to recommended action prior to the approval of the meeting agenda.

Chair Bouquet declared the motion PASSED unanimously.
