Recommended Actions
a. Execution of 2010 Option with Global Transportation for the Provision of access-a-Ride
Service - Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Customer and Contracted Services
introduced this action item.
Initially, the District entered into contracts with four service providers for access-a-Ride
service covering the years 2008-2012 (three year contract with two service year options).
Those providers were: Global, MV, CUSA, and Special Transit of Boulder. In 2008, shortly
after the change to the new contract model, Global came to RTD looking for assistance as
they were having trouble transitioning from the old contract to the new contract. Staff
worked with them reviewing their financial bid model as well as their business practice.
As a result, the 2009 contract model was adjusted and the decision was made to convert

the last year of their contract (2010) to an option. This was one of the conditions of the
renegotiation of their contract. The same adjustments will be made in the 2010 contract
as in the 2009 contract and these are due to legitimate oversights in the initial bid model
provided by Global as well as some items that were changed since the initial RFP went on
the street.
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the Interim General Manager or his designee, to amend the existing
contract between RTD and Global Transportation for the provision of access-a-Ride
paratransit services in order to incorporate an option for the provision of access-a-Ride
service for the period January 1, 2010 thru December 31, 2010. This contract
amendment will be for one year in an amount not to exceed $5,059,742.00. There will
still be two (2) additional one year options. This amendment will bring the three (3) year
contract total with Global Transportation to a maximum that shall not exceed
$13,185,321 for the period January 1, 2008- December 31, 2010. The amounts for the
remaining two (2) one-year options shall not exceed $5,600,616 for the 2011 option year
and $6,205,151 for the 2012 option year. The combined total amounts for this contract,
including all option years, shall not exceed $24,991,088 for the five year period. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractors’ direct fuel costs in amounts estimated to
total approximately $2,457,532 for the initial three year period and $4,445,115 for the
five year period. This results in combined contract totals not to exceed $15,642,853 in
total for the initial three year period (2008-2010) and $29,436,203 for the five year period
2008-1012.
Motion:

Director Christopher made a motion to forward
this item to the December 15, 2009 Board
meeting agenda.

Second:

Director Chacon seconded the motion.

Discussion: Director O’Boyle wanted to know a bit more about the legitimate oversight
referenced by Bruce Abel. Mr. Abel said that Colorado vehicle registration fees do not
have a different fee structure to register public vehicles. All vehicles are treated as private
vehicles and this resulted in a substantial cost increase to Global. Staff wants this vendor
to be viable and sustainable and feels these adjustments are appropriate.
Director O’Boyle wanted to know if this would enable a vendor to submit a low bid, get
the contract and then adjust the oversight later. Mr. Abel responded that this is not the
norm. In this case, we have four vendors that were all selected and this adjustment
results in the low price proposer still remaining the low price proposer. There is no
material impact as a result of making these changes.
Committee Chair Brohl said this adjustment was done last year because there were some
items that were left out of the bid because they had one understanding and RTD had
another and this did not get resolved during the bid process. This was a legitimate
expense that would have been allowed in the bid and in the contract had it been added.
The contract amendment was made last year with the stipulation that some oversight be
added to make sure there weren’t any other cost that might be overrun. She asked Bruce
Abel about the oversight that the District has done.

Mr. Abel said that the Small Business Opportunity Office and the Contracted Services
Department have both been working very closely with Global and reviewed their books
with them about ¾ of the way through the year and they all agreed to move forward into
2010 and continue the oversight.
Director Bagley had a question on the contract, one provider got 50% of the service and
the other three got a sixth of the service. The other three providers had all worked with
the District previously and Global had not? Mr. Abel responded that Global had worked
with us previously, they are a small firm that had worked with us before as part of a larger
organization and they have subsequently spun off to form their own organization.

The motion passed unanimously.
