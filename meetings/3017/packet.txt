2020 Operating Expense Adjustments
The district-wide operating and administrative expense portion of the proposed budget amendment is
$733.2 million, which reflects a $6.6 million decrease from the 2020 Adopted Budget. This consists of
both increases and decreases to operating expenses as well as year-to-date budget transfers. These
changes result in a decrease of $10.3 million on the Base System, an increase of $1.2 million in
FasTracks Project, and an increase of $2.5 million in FasTracks Operations.
Of the $10.3 million net decrease for the Base System, budget reductions consist of previously approved
transfers to adjust budget line items and project budgets, intentional reductions by departments in
various line items, expense carryforward reductions, offset by necessary amended budget increases.
• Major reductions to the amended budget consist of $8.0 million in vacancy savings and furloughs
for represented and non-represented employees, $7.5 million in paratransit transportation and
fuel, $1.6 million in other outside services/projects, $1.5 million in Bus operator and overtime
wages, $1.4 million in contract maintenance, $1.3 million in purchased transportation contracts
and diesel fuel purchases, $0.7 million in security services, $0.6 million in software acquisition,
$0.5 million in special projects and public events, $0.5 million in self-insured claims, $0.4 million
in professional development funds and training, $0.4 million in management services, $0.3 million
in low value tools and equipment, $0.2 million in traction power, $0.2 million in oil, diesel
exhaust fluid and gasoline, $0.2 million in repair parts, and $0.2 million in travel.
• These reductions are offset by major increases of $6.2 million for lump sum contribution to the
represented pension plan (missed in the adopted budget), $4.8 million in represented fringes (not
budgeted appropriately in the adopted budget), $2.5 million in materials and supplies, $1.1 million
in contract maintenance, $0.7 million in management services, $0.5 million in LRT operator
overtime, $0.4 million in security services, and $0.3 million in low value tools and equipment.
For FasTracks Project, the $1.2 million increase consists of previously approved transfers, and $0.2
million in traction power, offset by reductions of $0.5 million in furloughs, $0.2 million in other outside
services, and adjustments for excess carryforward amounts in other outside services, management
services, and legal services.
For FasTracks Operations, the $2.5 million increase consists primarily of previously approved transfers,
$0.6 million in low value tools and equipment, $0.5 million in MOW repair parts, $0.5 million in other
outside services, $0.3 million in software maintenance, $0.3 million in professional training, and $0.2
million in represented fringes. The majority of the increases relate to the N Line. These increases are

offset by reductions primarily of $1.0 million in low value tools and equipment, $0.8 million in traction
power, $0.5 million in security services, $0.5 million in contract maintenance, $0.4 million in furloughs,
$0.3 million in other outside services, $0.3 million in legal services, $0.2 million in other materials and

In June of this year, staff presented to the Board projected cash flow scenarios for 2020. The Board
approved the worst case scenario to form the basis of the 2020 Amended Budget, which calls for
additional budget reductions above those that were initially submitted by departments. These initial
budget reductions were reviewed by the Board in May and are shown in the attached Exhibits A, B, and
C. The worst case cash flow scenario requires additional budget reductions of $7.425 million in order to
add a minimum $25.0 million to the unrestricted year-end fund balance at year-end 2020. Subsequent
reductions total $10.5 million, made up of:
Paratransit transportation*
Paratransit gasoline
Southwest Plaza Driver Relief Station (capital)
Self-insured claims
Launch marketing expenses
Total

$6.3 million
$1.3 million
$2.2 million
$0.5 million
$0.2 million
$10.5 million

*savings available due to reduced demand
The incremental budget reduction of $3.1 million plus updated forecast of grant revenue and other
income allow $34.7 million to be added to the unrestricted year-end fund balance, an increase of $9.6
million over the target $25.0 million.
Debt Service
On the Base System, budgeted interest expense will decline slightly by $74,000 from the Adopted
Budget. Debt principal payments will not change. On FasTracks, interest expense is will decline $1.3
million from the Adopted Budget and debt principal payments will not change. These reductions in
interest expense are the result of two refinancings in late 2019 and early 2020. Interest can no longer
be capitalized during construction per a FASB rule. No new financing will be issued during the remainder
of 2020 for either Base System or FasTracks.

2.11.A

2020 New Capital
The new capital portion of the proposed amended budget totals $98.5 million, consisting of $39.3
million for Base System and $59.2 million for FasTracks (Project). The combined increase over the 2020
Adopted Budget new capital is $58.8 million. These changes result from program changes that have
occurred since the 2020 Budget was adopted, and include the following significant changes:
Base System
New capital changes for Base System result in a net increase of $0.5 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. Adjustments to new capital funding since the 2020 Adopted Budget include funding
for charging infrastructure for electric buses, roof replacement at Platte Division, rail replacement at
Central Corridor, Access-a-Ride cut-away buses, 40-ft. transit buses, account-based fare collection
system, Oracle ERP upgrade, rail substation PLC upgrade, and TVM replacements. Please see
Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
FasTracks
New capital changes for FasTracks result in a net increase of $58.3 million to new capital from the
Adopted Budget. This results from updated project schedules for current projects that changed the
projected expenditures in 2020 and changes in cost estimates (East Line, Gold Line, North Metro).
Please see Attachment B for detail and Program Capital attached.
Previously Approved Capital Carryforward Adjustments
For the 2020 Adopted Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as of 9/30/19 were used to compute the
estimate of the capital projects carryforward. This methodology is used to accommodate the timing of
the adoption of the annual budget. For the 2020 Amended Budget, year-to-date actual expenditures as
of 12/31/19 were used to compute the estimate of the carryforward. This takes into account
expenditures that were made in the last quarter of 2019.
Previously approved capital to be carried forward is $450.5 million, a decrease of $123.2 million from
the 2020 Adopted Budget carryforward to reflect fourth quarter 2019 actual expenditures, transfers to
reclassify certain capital projects as expense projects and vice versa, previously approved project
transfers, project scope changes, deferrals to 2020, and completion of projects. Of the carryforward
amount, the Base System portion is $109.9 million and the FasTracks portion is $340.5 million. For
Base, major capital carryforward projects are the purchase of 40-ft. transit buses, purchase of LRVs,
16th Street Mall Paver Repair, Colfax Avenue Transit Priority Project, Central Corridor rail replacement,
CAD/AVL ratio systems software, and Welton Street blank-out screens. For FasTracks, major capital
carryforward projects are North Metro, and close-out for East Corridor, SERE, Gold Line, R Line, and
DUS oversight. Please see Attachment C for detail and Program Capital attached.
Revenue Changes
In the Amended Budget, revenues are projected to increase $10.5 million on a combined basis from the
2020 Adopted Budget.

Sales and Use Tax revenues are projected to decrease $163.8 million from the 2020 Adopted
Budget based on the CU-Leeds School May 2020 forecast. The 2020 Amended Budget
incorporates the pessimistic forecast that represents a 24.0% decrease from 2019 sales/use tax
revenue. The 2020 Adopted Budget used the CU-Leeds September 2019 baseline forecast which
called for a 2.0% increase over the then projected 2019 level. While it is customary to use the
baseline forecast in our budgets, it is believed the pessimistic forecast is appropriate in current
economic and pandemic conditions.
On a combined basis, grant revenues including operating grants, capital grants, capital
maintenance, federal grants, FASTER grants, STAMPS and CMAQ grants are projected to
increase $242.3 million from the amount in the 2020 Adopted Budget. On the Base System,
grant revenue is projected to increase $146.5 million from CARES Act funding, increase in 5339
Bus funding, offset by decreases in 5307 capital maintenance grants, 5337 fixed guideway
SOGR grants, FASTER grants, CMAQ grants, and carryforward grants. For FasTracks, grants are
budgeted to increase $95.8 million from CARES Act funding, an increase in New Starts, offset by
a lower carryforward amount.
o Contributed capital (not shown in the table above) is projected to decrease $37.8 million
due to reductions in project contributions on the Eagle project, offset by increases in thirdparty betterments on North Metro.
Farebox revenue is budgeted to decline in the 2020 Amended Budget for both Base System and
FasTracks. Fare revenue will decline because of pandemic service levels in March/April and
suspension of fares, and uncertainty about when ridership will resume in full in 2020. Fare
revenue is projected to fall to $93.8 million in the 2020 Amended Budget from $158.1 million
projected in the 2020 Adopted Budget, which is a decline of $64.3 million or 40.7%. Of revised
fare revenue, $65.7 million is attributed to the Base System and $28.1 million is attributed to
FasTracks (Operations).
Investment income is budgeted to decline by half from the 2020 Adopted Budget due to the
recent rapid decline in interest rates.
Other income is budgeted to remain unchanged from the 2020 Adopted Budget.

The revenue reduction to RTD from fare losses and the metro area’s decline in sales and use taxes
during pandemic stay-at-home orders are substantial. Much of the 2020 gap will be filled by emergency
appropriations from the U.S. Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security
(CARES) Act passed earlier this spring. RTD is entitled to $232 million of CARES Act funding for 2020
on a reimbursement basis, intended to cover revenue losses and extra operating costs attributed to
keeping the system safe during the pandemic. Budget reductions in both operating and capital
expenditures have been made to meet the balanced budget mandate, assuming all $232 million in
federal funding is used.
Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance
The combined Unrestricted Year-End Fund Balance is projected to increase $38.0 million from the
Adopted Budget to $55.5 million reflecting the funding sources and uses described above, amended
budget revisions to both revenue and expenses, and increases to reserves per fund balance policy.

2.11.A

FasTracks Project Reserves
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects maintenance of the FasTracks Management Reserve
(formerly contingency reserve) at a balance of $0.9 million. This reserve is appropriated annually, and
its purpose is to allow the District to accommodate minor changes to the FasTracks schedule without
requiring frequent budget amendments to draw funds from the FasTracks Internal Savings Account. The
FasTracks Internal Savings Account reserve fund is budgeted at $119.6 million, an increase of $16.1
million over the 2020 Adopted Budget from project underruns on FasTracks projects.
Budget Transfers
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget reflects year-to-date budget transfers executed within the General
Manager’s authority or by prior authorization of the Board of Directors. The District’s budget transfer
policy was adopted by the Board of Directors on 2/26/85 and amended most recently on 4/1/10. The
policy states that cumulative transfers between projects in amounts exceeding $250,000 require prior
approval of the Board of Directors.
Cost Recovery Ratio
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget meets the cost recovery ratio mandated by the Colorado General
Assembly. The estimated SB154 recovery ratio (all nontax revenue except ADA farebox revenues
divided by all expenditures, including depreciation, except ADA expenditures and expenditures incurred
for long-term planning and development of rapid transit infrastructure) exceeds the annual target of 30%
mandated by the General Assembly. The RTD operating revenue recovery ratio (operating revenues
except ADA farebox revenues divided by the same cost basis as the Colorado General Assembly) is
estimated to exceed the 20% target established by the Board of Directors.
Fund Balance Policy
The proposed 2020 Amended Budget includes a reserve of 3% of annual spending as defined in Article
X, Section 20 of the Colorado Constitution (the TABOR reserve). The proposed 2020 Amended Budget
maintains a Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, Unrestricted Year-End Fund, and
Unrestricted Operating Fund (Base System only) in the District's working capital. The objective is for the
total of these funds excluding the Capital Acquisition Fund to equal approximately three months of
operating expenses excluding depreciation for each of the District entities (Base System, FasTracks
Project and FasTracks Operations). On the Base System, this objective is not expected to be met in the
2020 Amended Budget.
Basis of Accounting and Budgeting
The accounts of the District are reported using the accrual basis of accounting. Revenues are
recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred. The District’s basis of budgeting
follows the accrual basis of accounting except (1) capital outlays and payments of debt principal are
treated as expenditures, (2) asset sale proceeds and debt issuance proceeds are included, (3)
depreciation, gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment, and the non-cash portion of longterm unfunded pension accruals are excluded from appropriation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Please see Discussion above.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

N Line Bus and Rail Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A. This
will result in a net neutral base system cost, and an estimated N Line Commuter rail service cost of
$27.4 million annualized; and further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments, as necessary, for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming
North Metro rail line also known as the N Line will represent significant milestones in achieving improved
connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan (North Metro)
contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network capable of connecting the
commuter rail service to RTD’s greater network of services. Recommendations in this proposal were
developed using a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions; service area demographics; transit
market research; route performance and analysis; and stakeholder input.
The N Line service area borders I-25 on the west, I-76 on the east, E-470 in the north, and Denver
Union Station in the south. Northglenn, Thornton, and Commerce City are the primary cities in the study
area with parts of Federal Heights included as well. The service area also includes some unincorporated
areas in Denver and Adams Counties.
The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line between Denver Union Station (DUS) and 162nd
Avenue in Adams County. As part of Phase one of the North Metro Corridor, the N Line will operate on a
13-mile segment between DUS and 124th Avenue Station at Eastlake. This segment, with six stations, is
expected to open in 2020 with presently available funding. The remaining planned section from 124th
Avenue Station to 162nd Avenue will have two stations and will be built and operated as Phase two of
the North Metro Corridor though it is currently unfunded.
DISCUSSION
The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan aims to build a network with bus and rail services that are well
connected and easy to use. To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of
limited operating resources, it is important that the proposed service change adhere to the RTD Service
Standards and be consistent with RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit network.

Packet Pg. 47

2.12.B

Providing good connections to the N Line Commuter Rail stations utilizing the service currently in the
area, required extending nearby route services into the new stations, resulting in the need for additional
resources. This is due to the amount of added distance to serve the stations in the corridor. However,
the increased resource expenditure does not result in a higher level of service frequency, though it is
hoped that higher levels of ridership will increase the warrants for additional service in the future.
Additionally, the cost impacts of the proposal are offset by savings found in the previous B and G Line
Bus and Rail Service Plan in terms of vehicle requirements (bus) and service hours.
It is important to note the reasoning behind the approach to this service plan as stated in the North
Metro Corridor Final Bus Operations Service Plan:
Route Design Strategies
For optimum performance of a transit network accompanied by best resource utilization, a clear
vision for the entire network is as essential as it is imperative for individual routes to attract
ridership. The following strategies have been used as guiding principles to inform
recommendations for study area bus routes. This framework is expected to result in routes with
both improved operating efficiency and customer attractiveness.
Route Streamlining
The N Line service plan aims to eliminate deviations unless they add value for significant numbers
of riders by serving major destinations, transit hubs, and rail stations falling within the corridor.
Additionally, the proposed recommendations look at streamlining bus transit to increase efficiency
and productivity, while facilitating network integration with the N Line.
Stop Consolidation
A balance between efficient stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit and reducing
unnecessary delay leads to improvements in transit service effectiveness. Even though stop
consolidation is not proposed in Phase I of the North Metro Corridor project, it is recommended
that RTD continue this program throughout the bus network.
Route Segmentation
In some cases, certain routes perform much better in specific segments. This trend may be a
result of a very long route serving large geographic areas, parts of which may not be as well
suited for transit. In such cases, separating the route into two distinct routes not only improves
adherence to set schedules, but improves efficiency. In the North Metro Corridor, Route 92 is an
example of a route with relatively low ridership from Washington Street/88th Avenue to Summit
Grove Parkway, and higher ridership for rest of the route. This service is a candidate for route
segmentation.
Low Performing Service Replacement
In areas where a route or route segment performs poorly and has limited scope of improvement in
performance, alternatives to fixed route service are considered. These alternative mobility options
include Flex Rides, special shuttles, service routes (tailored for specific trip making, e.g. seniors),

Packet Pg. 48

2.12.B

or commute oriented programs (e.g. station vans, car/bike sharing). These options maintain
service coverage as well as reduce RTD’s net subsidy.
Rail Service
Per most recent simulation from LTK consultants (June 2019), operating plan consists of a 20minute peak and 30-minute off-peak headway. This includes the same vehicles, schedule margin,
station dwell times, minimum turn times at terminals, and three added signal restrictions. In
addition, the A Line has priority in the Denver Union Station (DUS) throat and a southbound N
Line train may experience delays, due to a westbound A Line train operating behind schedule.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public meetings and a number of
comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website, along with letters received are
summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the N
Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/Brighton: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
Route 128 –Broomfield/Wagon Rd: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is estimated to be net neutral. The
operating and maintenance costs of the N Line is $27.4 million annualized and to be paid from the
FasTracks budget.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed N Line bus and rail service changes
has found no disparate impact or disproportionate burden.

Notes & Public Comments

-

Skyway Bridge - how does it work?
Will there be a pathway established from 48th/Brighton Station to National Western
Stock Show?
Why only hourly service on the 92/93L?
How would someone get to I-25 from 104th Station?
It’s impossible to get FlexRide from 6am to 6pm due to school kids tying up the
service.
Lights are disruptive for homes near the Eastlake Station.
When will the N Line open?
Thornton Crossroads doesn’t have enough lighting. Area is too dim, and is a safety
concern.
Will pedestrian access ever be established/improved to the stations?
Thank you for addressing graffiti issues at the stations in a timely manner.
What is the difference between the 92 & 93L? Why only hourly?
Will FlexRide service be expanded?
Will the 41L be able to travel from Brighton to Denver in less than an hour?
Will the N Line ever be expanded to accommodate double tracks?
When will the new Thornton PnR parking spots be open?
Are there any AA routing changes?
Will 104L still go to the airport?
Is the 39L going away?
Will Eastlake ever be a quiet zone?
Will train engineers have 8 hours shifts? Will there be mandating? What about a
whistle stop at district shops? Why is the 48 being removed from Platte - what will
bus operators do?
How can citizens hold RTD’s feet to the fire to ensure 2020 opening?
We were told Q1 2020 in recent presentation.
Were special events/downtown activity factored in to determining the frequency of
the N Line?
Was growth north of 124th Avenue taken into account during the construction of
the N Line?
When the N Line opens, will there be more options to and from Brighton?
What is the testing status of the N Line?
Who owns the empty field to the south of 104th station?
People are always crossing illegally. They’re violating active crossings.
What is the maximum vehicle height for entry into the PnR at 104th?
Is there a plan in place to deal with people who will avoid parking in the PnR at 104th,
and will park in residential areas?
Who is responsible for making a bus stop ADA accessible?

Specific questions pertaining to two bus stops not being ADA compliant within the
City of Thornton.
Could the 92 operate via Thornton Parkway to Colorado Blvd?
Why is the 88L hourly?
The 88 is always late. Will on time performance be addressed with the N Line
changes?
FlexRide is tied up with school kids from 6am to 6pm.
Could the 88 be extended into Thornton Crossroads Station?
Will there ever be a connection from the N Line to Orchard Mall?

Notes & Public Comments
8/21/2019
-

Where will the 93L start and stop?
What is the logic of making the 12 go to 112th as opposed to Wagon Rd?
The 41L will compete with the N Line, which is confusing. Weren’t you getting rid
of the R already because of that conflict?
Can we move Mountview stop to connect to the 32?
Would love a way to connect from Brighton to main systems on the weekend.
Is the 39L going away?
What is the 120L time span?
Are we on track for Q1 2020?
Will train frequency be shortened to 15 minutes in the future?
When will route schedules be published?
In regards to routes you’re not currently changing, what will be the impacts to
frequency after the N Line opens?
Will 122X change if the N Line takes ridership away?
Does the 120L run on weekends?
Will 120L run though Brighton PnR on weekends?
Where will the 120L start and stop?
What is the access to the 104th Station?
Studies show that parking does not increase ridership, and lots of people would rather
take the bus because it is cheaper than the train.
RTD should do a better job of reaching out to less-engaged communities.
We need to have more people at these meetings; do bus riders know about these
meetings?
What is the parking situation at the 124th Station?
How much do special events impact schedules to serve customers after standard
hours?
Is the Rockies bus still running?
How would we know if there’s special service for a large event? I don’t see it on the
RTD app.
We need a phone number where you can call to get information, or we need the
special service notifications more visible on the app.
Route 62 is the only route that has special service listed online.
Are the rails grounded?
So this isn’t considered light rail?
What is the seat configuration of the N Line?
Do the N Line cars have steep steps like the light rail or level boarding?
Will any more buses be going to Eastlake Station?

What is the timeline for stations even further to the north?
Will there be bus stops at Melody, Grant and Huron on 112th and 104th?
Sometimes private money pushes out public money. We need more citizens involved.
Can we increase parking at Wagon Road?
If ridership increases, will you have more cars instead of the married pairs?
What kind of train is pictured on the last slide of the presentation?
What is the purpose of the 145X?
Could an earlier connection be made to the 145X or could it be rerouted down Bridge
St?

There’s no mention of change to the 39L, please make that more clear.
Did you get rid of route 17 to Red Rocks, or is it now the 125?
When will the parking spaces be open at Thornton PnR?
Are any parking expansions planned for other stations along I-25?
Was the Riverside Cemetery entrance issue resolved with the N Line?
Are there tentative dates or milestones available to the public?
Do we have a risk registry?
What happens when you extend north of 124th? Will the N Line be shut down during
construction?
Why is the proposed schedule for route 92 shorter than it is now?
Please explain the 92 & 93L frequency.
When will the Commerce City station be open?
Will FlexRide be available at any stations?
Does the RTD provide special service for soccer games?

-

Will these trains have the same PIDS systems as the A Line?
When will phase 2 begin?
Bus to bus transfers are a harder sell than bus to rail. Why not connect 114 to
Eastlake?
80/80L is only 6 miles long. Lots of development west of the western terminal. Would
be very cheap to extend the route further west.
Why is 520 the way that it is?
Could 48 frequency be increased in the peaks?

BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Board Chair & Director,
District C

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct Final
Report and Revised Code of Conduct

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Chair of the RTD Board of Directors presents to the Operations and Customer Service Committee a
motion to approve the final report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct (Ad Hoc Committee)
and the revised RTD Code of Conduct (Code), attached.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manger’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership
Task Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The Code was first approved by the Board in 2016, at a time when large transit agencies across the
country were adopting similar codes. Over time, staff recognized that revisions to the Code were needed
and presented those revisions to the Board for approval, following considerable debate, in April 2020.
The Ad Hoc Committee, composed of RTD staff and key stakeholders from the community, was formed
shortly after and was charged with ensuring that the Code would:
• Continue to work toward preserving the safety, cleanliness, and accessibility of RTD’s system;
• Be enforced fairly, consistently, and equitably; and
• Address public safety needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed each rule and provision of the Code at length. The Committee members were
asked to cite their specific questions and concerns regarding the Code and suggest realistic changes to
address those concerns. The suggested changes were vetted by the Committee and incorporated into
the attached version of the Code, which must be readopted by the Board before going into effect.
ALTERNATIVES
1) To approve the final report and Code.
2) To amend the final report, the Code, or both.
3) To postpone action on the adoption of the final report and Code.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the adoption of the final report or the Code.

December 20, 2016
Revised July XX, 2020
1. Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering transportation safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and costeffective transportation throughout the District to all constituents. RTD strives to ensure that everyone is
treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for the safety, convenience,
and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules
prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles
(including RTD buses, access-a-Ride vehicles, call-n-Ride vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail
vehicles), facilities (including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and
fountains, and administrative, operational, and maintenance facilities), or property. Prior to
enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited
by this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement
ranging from a verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5:
“Enforcement”). Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (see Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”).
2. Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016 by RTD’s Board of Directors and
thereafter amended on July XX, 2020.
3. Prohibited Conduct:
A person (including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to
companies, clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from
committing, attempting to commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit,
the following acts on any RTD vehicle, at any RTD facility, or on RTD property unless otherwise specified
in this Section:

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive, RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
• Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service
Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of Civil
Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.
5. Enforcement:
RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
in the administration of this Code of Conduct.
If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by a disability, RTD
personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
Enforcement will be conducted in a fair and reasonable manner. A person who engages in any of the
above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility,
or property by a law enforcement officer, an RTD Transit Security Officer, an RTD Bus/Light
Rail/Commuter Rail Line Supervisor, or other authorized RTD personnel. Such personnel are
authorized to issue an order to the person to exit RTD property for up to the remainder of the service
day.
Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to
do so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.

A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may also, or instead, be issued a
suspension by RTD, suspending the person from all RTD vehicles, properties, and services for a
determined amount of time pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy and procedures.
A person ordered to leave or suspended from RTD property will not be entitled to any refund of unused
fare media that may expire during the time of the person’s exclusion.
Suspension or orders to exit RTD property may be appealed pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension
policy and procedures.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, riding an RTD vehicle without evidence that the
proper fare has been paid may be treated in accordance with Colorado Traffic Code, C.R.S. § 42-41416.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, illegal activity may result in a citation under any
applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, including C.R.S. § 18-9-114 - Hindering
Transportation (Class 2 Misdemeanor), and C.R.S. § 18-9-115 - Endangering Public Transportation and
Utility Transmission (Class 3 Felony).
This Code of Conduct does not seek to limit, replace, or conflict with any federal, state, or
local law, regulation, or ordinance and does not limit or prevent any law enforcement
agency or entity from taking any lawful action against any person on any RTD vehicle,
facility, or property.

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive, RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
•Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service
Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of Civil
Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.
5. Enforcement:
RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
in the administration of this Code of Conduct.
If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by a disability, RTD
personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to
immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility, or property by an RTD Transit Police Officer, an RTD Transit

Subject:

COVID Budget Response Principles

Date: July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Added to Committee Agenda as a Director initiated request pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Art. VI,
Section 1(f). Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
It is recommended by Directors Buzek, Cook, and Guissinger that the Board of Directors adopt COVID
Budget Response Principles to guide and support the agency’s response to the financial shortfalls
occurring with the pandemic.
This action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal 1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Core Goal 3 - Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
RTD, like all agencies, is faced with unprecedented and sweeping changes in its financial position
stemming from the outfall of the pandemic. It is possible, even probable, that the impact will be
longstanding, extending into 2021 and beyond. As a result, General Manager Paul Ballard has convened
the COVID Fiscal Response Task Force and charged that group with developing budget measures to
address these fiscal challenges.
In order to assure our ability to continue serving our riders and the region in the midst of significantly
reduced revenues, it’s critical that the board and agency leadership proceed with care and forethought,
operating from values and principles to appropriately guide decisions to come.
POLICY BASIS
RTD’s mission is to “Meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by providing safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective service throughout the district.”
Per the Board Governance Manual, “The Board’s role is a policy making governance board and sets the
strategic direction for the agency.” The Board appreciates staff’s efforts, and strategic and policy
guidance serves to support those efforts.
DISCUSSION
Discussions of the need for principles to guide the agency as it responds to declining revenues have
occurred during the Board workshop of June 4, 2020; in conjunction with a motion made in the June 9,
2020 Finance, Administration, & Audit Committee meeting; and at the Board meeting of June 16, 2020.

Packet Pg. 116

2.13.E

These discussions led to a Board request that a set of COVID budget reduction guiding principles be
brought forward for approval through the Finance, Administration & Audit committee to the Board of
Directors.
After consultation with staff and Board members, several individual Directors support the adoption of the
attached COVID Budget Response Principles.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt principles to support and guide staff development of budget responses to COVID-related
revenue shortfalls.
2. Do not adopt principles.

RTD COVID Budget Response Principles

Keeping riders, employees and the region healthy and safe:
We will strive to keep our communities connected and our riders, employees and region
healthy and safe.
Service reductions should not be our primary response. We’ll be creative:
We will take a balanced approach to budget reductions and do so in such a way as to align
with our mission. Accordingly, service reductions should be minimized so as to minimize the
impact to our customers. We will strive for a well-rounded approach by incorporating
reductions in overhead, breaking down silos and engaging partners, and seeking creative
approaches to service delivery.
We’ll prioritize mobility for people who most depend on transit during the pandemic:
We will strive to maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most
depend upon our services to access essential jobs and other necessities, while also keeping
our communities and activity centers appropriately connected.
We will support and value all of our employees.
We acknowledge our frontline employees who directly promote our mission to the public
and who have borne the brunt of mandating in the past. We also acknowledge those fulltime employees in the lower wage categories, because a humane work environment is
valued by RTD.
Being data-driven and informed by collective wisdom and expertise:
We will use a thoughtful, responsible approach to decision-making for the COVID period,
while planning for the mid-term financial period and post-pandemic future, by incorporating
the best available data, expertise, and wisdom, including through the Re-Imagine project,
the accountability committee, and stakeholders.
We’ll be actively transparent and seek input:
We will take active measures to be transparent and seek input regarding our use of CARES
Act money as well as in the decision-making process for measures we adopt to respond to
ongoing COVID financial impacts.
