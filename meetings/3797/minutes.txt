Motion To
Amend:

Director Nicholson made the motion to amend
this item with the following:
Negotiated Land Price: RTD will operate within
the bounds of its existing statutory requirements
to allow reductions in purchase price or rent in
exchange for affordable housing development or
other benefits to the agency. If developers can
demonstrate a financial gap, RTD will permit a
30% reduction in land price or rent if projects
provide at least 50% of units to households
making up to 60% of Area Median Income
(AMI). RTD may permit other discounts (either
higher or lower) for projects with alternative
affordability programs, as determined by RTD
staff with input from local and/or state housing
officials. However, no more than a 5075%
discount will be applied for any given project.
RTD will favorably consider projects that provide
for a range of household incomes, offer
multibedroom unit sizes, include more accessible
units than required by law, limit residential
parking, are deeply affordable, emphasize
priority groups identified by the Colorado
Housing and Finance Authority (CHFA), and/or
maximize allowable density.
