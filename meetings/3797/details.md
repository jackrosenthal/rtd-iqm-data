If developers can demonstrate a financial gap, RTD will permit a 30% reduction in land price or rent if projects provide at least 50% of units to households making up to 60% of Area Median Income (AMI). RTD may permit other discounts (either higher or lower) for projects with alternative affordability programs, as determined by RTD staff with input from local and/or state housing officials. However, no more than a 5075% discount will be applied for any given project.
