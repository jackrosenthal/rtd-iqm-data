COMMITTEE WORKPLAN APPROVAL
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of the 2024 Performance Committee Work Plan

April 1, 2024

COMMITTEE ACTION
For the Performance Committee to approve the 2024 Committee Work Plan.
REPRESENTATIVE
Peggy Catlin, Performance Committee Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, regular Board meeting, the Board of Directors approved a Bylaws
amendment calling for each standing committee of the Board to draft and approve an annual work plan.
The work plan before the committee will cover meetings from April 2024 to February 2025.
Annual committee work plans are a useful tool for ensuring the Board and staff collaborate effectively to
accomplish the necessary work of the agency and Board, while providing dedicated space for the Board
to pursue governance/policy objectives and gain further insights into matters of interest to Directors.
Work plans elevate and respect the role of the committees of the Board as some of the most effective
forums for completing the work of the Board.
Per the Board Bylaws (Article VI, Section 1, f.), the Performance Committee (Committee) “is responsible
for performance management of the General Manager and CEO and the GM/CEO’s contract and annual
comprehensive performance evaluation, as well as monitoring metrics as to the agency’s performance
related to the Strategic Plan success outcomes.”
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed this item during its Monday, March 4, 2024 meeting, and Directors offered
further input following the initial discussion. The GM/CEO, Board Chair, Committee Chair, and Board
Office Executive Manager met to further refine the work plan following the input from the Committee
and Directors highlighted above.
It should be noted that this work plan includes items for additional monthly meetings of the committee,
which were calendared following an initial discussion on the work plan. Furthermore, this work plan
includes items related to the GM/CEO 360˚ assessment, which will occur following the agency’s
procurement of a consultancy to perform that work. Adjustments may be made to the timing of the
assessment and subsequent review process as determined by the Committee in collaboration with the
GM/CEO.

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

Directors are asked to review and make any additional changes to the work plan before voting to
approve the work plan.
Once approved by the Committee, the work plan will be forwarded to the full Board for review. The
approved work plan may be adjusted by the Chair of the Committee in consultation with the Committee
Vice Chair and responsible RTD staff.
This discussion and approval align with the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer
Excellence, Employee Ownership, and Financial Success, as the Performance Committee’s ability to
effectively govern directly impacts the overall performance of the agency. An organized committee work
plan will ensure RTD’s resources are used efficiently, and that the Board’s policy and governance
objectives are more focused, collaborative, and obtainable.
