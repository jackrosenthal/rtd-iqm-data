BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Ad Hoc Committee on Security Report Status

Committee Meeting Date:
February 9, 2021

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
Mike Meader, Assistant General Manager, Safety, Security and Asset Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
A Safety & Security Ad Hoc Committee (Committee) was created in October 2020 by the Board Chair,
pursuant to Board Bylaws, to review the agency’s security model with the intent to ensure that the
agency:
o Continues to work toward preserving the safety, security, and accessibility of RTD’s
transit system for all customers
o Addresses the needs of RTD and its customers
o Minimizes agency exposure and liability
o Continues to maintain statutory and regulatory compliance and to incorporate industry
best practices with respect to its security operations.
The Committee comprised of six Board members, as well as several staff members who possessed the
acumen and experience relative to the subject matter met publicly beginning in late October 2020.
The Committee convened weekly in a public forum beginning on October 28, 2020 through December 2,
2020. It was intended for a final report to be developed and presented no later than December 8, 2020
to the full Board with recommendations pertaining to an optimal security model.
During the time period outlined, the new General Manager and CEO assumed her position in November
and begin attending the committee meetings. Upon acclimation to the committee’s purpose, a
recommendation was made by the General Manager and CEO to the Committee Chair (i.e., the Board
Chair) that the final report be held in abeyance until additional actions could be leveraged to ensure the
agency’s path forward included ample customer and stakeholder engagement, as well as industry best
practices.
DISCUSSION
In January, the General Manager and CEO sent a formal request to the American Public Transportation
Association (APTA) requesting a peer review. The request for the peer review was received by APTA
and is currently being coordinated with the expectation of commencing in March.

Packet Pg. 24

1.C.1

An APTA peer review is designed to assist the requesting agency in addressing agency specified issues
through subject matter experts within the transit industry. Coordinated by APTA with the requesting
agency, the subject matter experts, who typically are from peer agencies, convene at the requesting
agency and conduct an intensive review of the issues to be addressed. Due to the pandemic this peer
review will be held virtually.
The peer review typically includes the following:
• Introductory meeting including the peer review panel and agency representatives
• Briefing by agency as to background for the peer review request and issues to be addressed
• Presentations and/or briefings by agency staff
• Interviews with applicable agency staff
• An interactive exit conference between the panel and the agency representatives
• Written report with formalized findings and recommendations
The agency plans to retain a transit industry security consultant to assess the peer review
recommendations, assist in community outreach and engagement, aid in determining the optimal
security model as well as guide RTD in implementing a community-based security model.
Updates will be provided to the Board as these activities progress.
It is anticipated that these efforts will be completed no later than June 2021.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The total estimated financial impact of the APTA peer review is $15,500 and consultant fees of which
will be determined.
