KATE WILLIAM: Good evening. I am here.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And myself, present. Ms. McManus, please show that all 15
Board members are present.
And let me just start by saying that at RTD, safety is our core value. And I'd like to begin this
meeting with a short safety briefing. Please remember that frequent and thoroughly washing your
hands is very important. Continue to practice physical distancing. Six feet is the minimum.
Minimize time spent in a poorly ventilated area, especially when large number of people are
present. And wear a mask at all times in public spaces, such as in office spaces and grocery
stores and while using public transportation.
I'd like to start this evening by saying to all of you thank you for joining on this historical
evening. In order to gather additional feedback to further inform the Board's pending decision
this evening, the agency put out this survey asking for the public, employees, and stakeholders to
weigh in on the merits of the three excellent candidates for the position of the CEO and General
Manager. We received a significant number of responses. And I will ask our senior marketing
research analyst, Jeff Tranguch, to share with us a summary of those responses.
Mr. Tranguch, I'll pass over with the floor to [COMPUTER TONES].
JEFF TRANGUCH: Thank you very much. Can everyone hear me OK?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.

JEFF TRANGUCH: Wonderful. I'm going to share my screen. All right. Everybody still with
me?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yeah.
JEFF TRANGUCH: OK, wonderful.
So thank you for your time tonight. My name is Jeff Tranguch. I'm the Market Research
Manager at RTD. Over the next few moments, I will review with you the results that we received
from the public and key stakeholders in response to the survey we put out regarding the next GM
and CEO of RTD.
We solicited feedback through an online survey using anonymous links through Survey Monkey.
We collected data over several days, beginning the afternoon of August 19 and then closing at
11:59 PM Mountain Standard Time on August 23. We had a separate survey for stakeholder and
a separate survey for the public.
When all was said and done, we obtained 685 responses from the general public. That includes
three responses in Spanish. The survey was available to those with limited English proficiency.
So three responses from the Spanish speakers and the rest coming from the general standard
survey.
We also received six responses from the key stakeholders. And over the next two slides, I will
share with you the high level summary of what those two results look like.
Starting first with the public data. We kept it very brief and asked the question, based on your
knowledge of the candidate, how qualified do you think they are to serve as RTD's next General
Manager or CEO? And what you see here is we have it on a 10-point scale, where 1 is not at all
qualified and 10 is very qualified. So each respondent provided a score based on his or her
understanding of the candidates. And this is based on their understanding from going to our
website, reading a little bit more about that candidate, and then viewing the video that each
candidate had posted.
We have the mean scores reported there on the right hand side in that red column. Looking at
this in particular, we have varying sample sizes. So that little n number that you see next to each
candidate's name is the number of people that provided a response to that specific question. So
you'll see some variance there, which that tells us that people either answered not sure, which we
did not count those responses in here. There were very few. Others may have skipped it
altogether. So we just wanted to report that. There's not too much variance between them, but we
always like to report these sample sizes whenever we report data.
So looking simply at the means, Ms. Johnson has the highest mean at 7.72, followed closely by
Ms. LeGrand at 7.36, and Ms. Quigley at 7.33. Looking strictly at the number 10s, you see Ms.
Johnson has 37%, and 33% shared equally among Ms. LeGrand and Ms. Quigley.

Now respondents did have the opportunity to comment, in which we sorted in the full report that
the Board has access to and the public will able to view, is basically counting how many
respondents, or, excuse me, how many comments for each candidate was provided. So after
voting on each candidate, a respondent was given the opportunity to provide an additional
comment as to why they provided that score.
So in total, we received 742 comments for each one. About less than half of the people that
responded provided a comment. Again, they were optional. They didn't have to provide a
comment there. Much of what they were saying, they liked one person's charisma versus another.
But it's not like there was one clear winner. And really, that data is qualitative. So it's not really
meant to say, yes, this is the person that the public clearly likes, but this is why they gave that
rating as they did.
And one thing that was apparent is that there were several folks that knew these folks, either by
working with them at other agencies or working with them through APTA and other agencies
like that, that voted. Just wanted to make that aware for everyone, as you may see that as you go
through the responses yourself.
For the key stakeholder data, we received six responses from the key stakeholders around the
district. And you'll notice that we don't have percentages reported here. These are simply counts
because of how small the percentages were. In addition to that, we did not compute a mean. Due
to such small sample sizes, it would have produced varying means and doesn't make much sense
to do that when you have such a small sample size.
So looking strictly at just the numbers, Ms. Johnson coming in ahead with three number 10 votes
and then two number 9 votes and one number 3. Ms. LeGrand coming in at a number 9, one
vote, and 8, two votes, 7, three votes. And then Ms. Quigley receiving a 2, a 3, a 7, 8, 9, and a
10. And in total, we received 11 comments from the stakeholders for those candidates, five going
for Ms. Johnson, three for Ms. LeGrand, and three for Ms. Quigley.
That is the high level summary. Again, the full comments according to each score that everyone
provided is available. I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have. And I'll stop there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Jeff. If I might, I'd like to start. And I guess my first
question would be, how many key stakeholders were sent this survey?
JEFF TRANGUCH: The actual number, I am not 100% sure of. I want to say it was a few dozen.
I don't know if Pauletta is on. She'd be able to answer that. But I can get back to you on that. I
can check with my team tonight to find out the exact number.
BARBARA MCMANUS: We could see if Gregg Moser is available to answer that question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Moser, are you on line?
GREGG MOSER: I am, yes. And there was-- the survey was sent to the key stakeholders,
including the Accountability Committee. It was sent to about 30 to 35 other individuals. And it

was also sent to-- and I apologize if I'm not capturing their name correctly-- but the citizens
advisory group that is also part of the stakeholder group of RTD as well.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. OK. Are there any questions from Board
members for Mr. Tranguch? And I will start with you, Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: No questions, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No questions. But thanks, Jeff. That was a lot to pull together. You did a
great job. Thank you very much.
JEFF TRANGUCH: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I agree. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No questions. Thank you, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No questions. Thank you for all the hard work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: No question. Thank you for the information.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: No questions. Thank you, Jeff, for the work.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten. Can somebody unmute Director Menten?
All right. I'm going to go to Director Mihalik and come back. Director Mihalik, do you have any
comments or questions?
KEN MIHALIK: No questions or comments. Thank you.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you, Madam Chair. I have no questions. And I concur in the thanks
and appreciation expressed by other Directors. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Thanks. One question. I'm wondering if Mr. Transguch or anyone can tell
where the responses were generated? And the reason I'm asking is because it seems like some of
the responses came from places other than Denver.
JEFF TRANGUCH: That's a great question, Director Walker. [AUDIO OUT] find out something
like that is by looking at IP addresses. I'm not too well versed on that. I could check with
members of my team to see if there's a way we could follow [? latency ?] either through social
media or other links-- or, excuse me, IP addresses that have come to our website. We might be
able to find out that way. But I can't guarantee anything. But I can certainly look into it.
JEFF WALKER: OK. No, that's not necessary. It was just more of a curiosity if you knew off the
top of your head. That's OK.
JEFF TRANGUCH: No, sir, I do not.
JEFF WALKER: Thank you. OK. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: No questions. Great job. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: No. I agree that it was nice work done on our part in a short amount of time.
And I have no questions. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Director Menten, are you on the line?
NATALIE MENTEN: Well, my preference is the phone. And it seems I might be still muted on
that. So I am on the Teams now.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, great.
NATALIE MENTEN: But if we could note that when we go into Exec Session I would prefer to
be on the phone and unmuted. I do not have any questions related to the survey. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. Thank you, Director Menten.

What I'd like to do at this point is the overview of the General Manager's executive search
process. And I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to thank First Vice Chair Peggy
Catlin and Treasurer Guissinger for leading this charge, along with our consultant, Gregg Moser.
This has been an extraordinary process and has gone very, very smoothly. And I would just like
to say on behalf of the Board, thank you so much for all the hard work that you've put into this,
and to the entire Board for their commitment of tireless hours of interviewing and reading and
talking to folks. So thank you.
At this time, I'd like to ask First Vice Chair Catlin and Chairman of the General Manager's
Executive Search and Oversight and Performance Management Committee to walk us through
the remaining steps in the executive search process. Committee Chair Caitlin, the floor is yours.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. Can you all hear me?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: OK. Sometimes it breaks up, just as we're experiencing.
If you might bear with me a little bit, I wanted to state for the public record all the work that has
gone into this by not only the committee but the Board staff, as well as most of the Board
members. After an exhaustive search and with considerable support from our consultant, Gregg
Moser, we've identified three outstanding candidates for the position of General Manager and
CEO.
Tonight our job as a Board is to determine which of these highly qualified women will lead this
agency into its next chapter. Given the challenges and opportunities we face in the coming days
and years, we do not take this decision lightly.
How have we gotten to this point in the search process? Within two weeks after Dave Genova's
announcement of his retirement, the Board met and decided to expand the pool of potential
applicants to include individuals from outside the agency for the interim position. With
assistance from RTD's HR department, the Board selected 5 finalists from among the initial 42
candidates for the position. And on January 28, the Board chose Paul Ballard to serve as CEO
and General Manager.
Paul began his tenure in late February, mere days before the impacts of COVID-19 began to be
seen across Colorado. And I would like to add that we relied heavily on Paul's experience and
expertise and assessment of the agency to help us in this search process. So I neglected to thank
him earlier.
The Board began its process to select an external firm to begin the exhaustive nationwide search
process for RTD's next CEO and General Manager. Krauthamer and Associates was selected in
April to perform that monumental task, and Greg Moser was named our consultant.

And personally, I'd like to thank Gregg for his tireless efforts during this process, the countless
very late night phone calls which his two hour earlier timeframe was really extraordinary, and his
boundless energy, creativity, professionalism, and resourcefulness. So thank you so much,
Gregg.
So the General Manager Executive Search, Oversight, and Performance Management Committee
convened for the first time on April 23. In the four months since then, the committee, comprised
of seven members of this Board, has met many, many times. During that time, the committee has
carefully and deliberately worked to include the voices of all the members of the Board through
the buddy system, as well as those of our public, RTD employees and stakeholders in our
ultimate decision making.
As part of that commitment of inclusiveness, the committee has also directed Gregg to contact a
multitude of key stakeholders and elected officials throughout the region to solicit their feedback
regarding our search. And I know he went back many times to try and get in contact with the key
stakeholders that we had identified.
Our initial solicitation for candidates for the position yielded 58 interested individuals. And after
extensive review of their application materials, Gregg Moser narrowed those down to
approximately 18 for the committee, in consultation with the other members of the Board, to
choose. And we ended up selecting seven highly qualified applicants to move forward, one of
whom would later remove his name from consideration.
Our committee then conducted interviews for the remaining six outstanding candidates at the
beginning of August. And from those candidates, the Board convened a special Board meeting
on August 7 to formally approve the selection of the finalists, Debra Johnson, Adelee Le Grand,
and Tina Quigley. All three of these women are well-known and respected throughout the transit
industry for their leadership and experience.
So each of these finalists was asked to really go through a lot. They were asked to present their
vision for the agency in the next 90 days, the next two years, and the next five days. And those
presentations were recorded and posted on the RTD website as of-- on the 23rd. I would like to
say that they did present-- make those presentations in front of Director Guissinger and myself,
as well as Gregg Moser and Paul Ballard. So they were able to interact with an audience on a
Zoom format.
The Board conducted a second round of interviews for the finalists this past Wednesday, August
19. The first round of interviews was impressive. The second round was amazing. No matter
what our decision is tonight, we are honored and humbled to have such amazing women vying to
lead this agency in the years to come.
Also on August 19, immediately after the beginning of the third candidate's interview-- each
interview was an hour and a half, by the way-- RTD's Communications Department sent out the
survey that Mr. Tranguch just described in order to seek feedback from the public, operators, and
key stakeholders, along with the videos. That survey closed on Sunday at midnight. As Mr.

Tranguch mentioned, we received a significant number of responses, which the Board has now
reviewed and will factor into the decision making process.
And I personally looked at all 742 comments. And I can tell you that as extensive as that was, it's
not going to make our discussion or our decision any easier.
But that leads us to tonight. And in a moment, we will convene an Executive Session where the
Board will discuss in depth the merits of all three candidates and we will hopefully come to
consensus around one individual. And should that happen tonight, the Board will reconvene the
meeting in open session and will consider a resolution that will designate the next General
Manager and CEO, subject to negotiation and execution of an employment contract. In order to
negotiate that contract on behalf of RTD, a negotiating team will then be formed by Chair
Rivera-Malpiede.
We understand that the eyes of the region and, in fact, the eyes of the whole transit industry are
upon us. And as soon as the General Manager is named, our Communication team will
[COMPUTER TONES] holders and the public to our decision.
Once the both sides have agreed in principle to a contract, the Board will once again convene,
this time to consider the adoption of the terms of the employment agreement. This could happen
as soon as next month or as late as the end of October, though the Board can decide to extend the
deadline at its sole discretion.
Once the contract's signed, the GM can begin her tenure here. All three of our candidates are
from out of state, so there may still be a transition period before the person can begin working
within the District itself. And Paul Ballard has assured us that he is going to help us with that
transition to make it smooth.
And at that time there will be an opportunity for us to publicly introduce our new GM and CEO
to the region. And what that looks like, we're not yet sure. It will depend on the COVID
pandemic. But we fully hope to engage the public in general with our selected candidate.
We really look forward to having our new GM on board, and the Board recognizes that there is a
great deal of work ahead both [COMPUTER TONES] for the new leader of this agency. As
such, we look forward to working hand-in-hand with our constituents, partners, and stakeholders
to tackle the challenges we face and to take advantage of the opportunities presented to us.
And thank you for indulging me that time. I know we're trying to keep our meeting short. But the
fact of the matter is there has been so much effort that has gone into this. And I just wanted to let
the public know that we have not taken this lightly and that we have tried to do everything we
could to cover all of our bases.
So with that, Madam Chair, I'll turn the-- unless anyone has any questions, I'll turn the meeting
back to you.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Are there any questions from Board members? And what I will
do is go through the list again.
Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: No questions. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: No questions. Great summary, Peggy.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: No questions. Thanks a lot.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: No questions. Thank you, Madam Chair. However, I did want to thank
everyone for their hard work. And I know that Peggy and the committee, GMEC, Gregg Moser.
And really, I have to give it to our Board staff and the great leadership of Barbara McManus.
And I must say, I am very comforted to know that Mr. Ballard will be here until the transition
has been made smoothly. So thank you all so very much.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: No questions. Thank you and I'll second Director Folska's comments.
Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Lewis?
KATE WILLIAMS: She's here. She's just on the phone. She might have an issue.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, I'm sorry. I'll come back to you. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: No questions. I just want to thank everybody involved for all their hard, very
good work. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Two questions. And I do want to make sure that you're hearing me.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
NATALIE MENTEN: [AUDIO OUT] you're hearing me OK? Because I've had my microphone
problems.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If you could talk closer to your phone, it's hard to hear you.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right. Can we ask staff, is my phone unmuted? The one ending in
0184. Because I prefer to speak on that so that I am clear.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. McKay or Ms. McManus, can you check that?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Menten, you have to hit star six to unmute your own phone.
NATALIE MENTEN: Say the numbers again.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Star six.
KATE WILLIAMS: Madam Chair, could you call Director Lewis again? She might have had the
same issue.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Director Menten, I'll come right back to you. Director
Lewis
SHONTEL LEWIS: No questions from me. Thank you so much for the summary.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Director Williams.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: Yes, thank you. So I do have two questions. The first is, when would the
public, once we have a contract agreement and it's going to go back to the Board, when would
the public have the ability to comment on it at that point in time, prior to the Board approving it?
That's first question.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Melanie, could you speak to that? Because I'm not sure what the
protocol is for an unexecuted contract to be public.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. I think there's a couple options, depending on how the negotiation
process unfolds and the timing of it. But certainly, the Board could release the terms of the
agreement in advance, if that's something that you all decided to do, if there was an agreement in
principle.
I think there's also been some conversations potentially about at a minimum releasing some
information about some of the potential terms. So that might be an option as well. But I think
you'll have to sort of see how that process unfolds. But certainly, the contract that is going to
ultimately have to be approved by this Board is going to be included in the Board materials. And
at a minimum, there'd be a 24-hour advance notice when that's posted, before the Board were to
finally approve, consistent with the Open Meetings Law.

NATALIE MENTEN: All right. And as a follow up to that, since that may not be a regular
monthly Board meeting, the Board would have the ability to add a public comment period prior
to that vote?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: General Counsel?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah, I think that's something that you all-- if the Board decided they
wanted to do a public comment period, that would be something you could certainly do. Yeah.
NATALIE MENTEN: OK. And then my additional question is, so what I am hearing is that
potentially as we move forward, we have chosen a General Manager, we will have a certain
period where potentially we are paying two General Managers?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten, I think that is something we need to be
discussing later on. I would assume that we wouldn't want someone to come in without the
benefit of hearing from our interim General Manager. But I do think that's a discussion item we
can have a little bit later on, if you're OK with that.
NATALIE MENTEN: As long as it's in the public venue.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you.
NATALIE MENTEN: I don't know when that would be.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. General Counsel?
NATALIE MENTEN: [INAUDIBLE]
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah. General Counsel?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yeah. So Director Menten, can you just certify your question? You're
asking whether-- sorry, go ahead.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: No. Go ahead, please.
NATALIE MENTEN: I'm to go ahead?
MELANIE SNYDER: I just want to-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If I could have the General Counsel go ahead, please.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. So I just wanted to clarify. So the question is whether there could be
a period in time where RTD would be paying both the Interim General Manager and the-- in a
transition period and overlapping with the new General Manager?

NATALIE MENTEN: Yes, that was my-- but I caught earlier is that the interim would stay on
till the new GM got their footing or there was a [INAUDIBLE] there. But that potentially could
be somewhere from maybe a few days, although that might be a little hard to believe a new GM
would have their footing in a few days, weeks, months, I'm not sure. And considering our budget
situation, I feel it's best to at least be asking this question right now.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK. And I think that there's an opportunity for the Board to discuss that
and determine what kind of overlap period would be appropriate, if any. So that's not-- you have
the legal authority to do that. I think that's a policy question for the Board as a whole to discuss
and decide.
PEGGY CATLIN: Madam Chair, if I might? This is Director Catlin.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please. Please, First Vice Chair Catlin. Yeah.
PEGGY CATLIN: Since I'm the one that made that statement, I was trying to say that during the
final negotiation period, and as we're getting this person situated, Mr. Ballard would still be
available to assist in that transition. There will be a transition period where this person might be
moving, relocating, getting situated. And that's where we would rely on Paul to provide his-provide some transition assistance. That was the intent of my statement.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Chair Catlin. Any other questions, Director Menten?
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: I have a question. Folska.
NATALIE MENTEN: Just a comment that compensation, especially in light of the agency and
the furloughs and we're not even done yet with potential compensation reductions in the agency,
potential more furlough days, the dollars are of great, huge importance to me, especially
considering what many people face in job searches down in the regular people out there. Thank
you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Director Mihalik, you are next.
KEN MIHALIK: Thank you. I don't have any questions or comments. Just a thank you to all the
people who've put in so many long hours.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. No questions. But I do want to note for
the record something that the Committee Chair Catlin did not mention. That is, literally
thousands and thousands of hours have been expended collectively by all of the members of the
Board and by staff in making this selection. It is not an overstatement to say that it has been
thousands of hours in this exercise. And I think that should be noted for the record. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Director Walker.

JEFF WALKER: Thanks. Thanks to Ms. McManus, the staff in the Board Office, Mr. Ballard,
and everyone who put in the work to make this happen. That's it. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: I just echo the eloquence of Director Folska and the great thank you that
she passed out to everyone involved. That's all. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Williams?
KATE WILLIAMS: No, I have nothing further to add. I'm just glad to be here and looking
forward to moving forward.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Thank you, ma'am. First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: I wanted to echo Director Tisdale's comments. And when we embarked upon
this search, it was discovered that some of the materials from previous searches weren't
available, despite the Board Office's attempts to get information from previous work done.
And so we've talked about, since this was a new process that we embarked upon for this search,
we've never looked outside for an interim. We really did change the practice that had occurred in
this agency for a number of years. And so I've talked to Ms. McManus and Mr. McKay about
capturing our lessons learned in a white paper so that years down the road, when we go through
an exercise again, we can really help guide future boards just on what went well and what did not
go well.
But I think under these circumstances, with this remote access and an interview process, I think
we did something that was rather trailblazing. And I think it would be really good to capture our
lessons learned in a document going forward. So just wanted to state that for the record.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, First Vice Chair Catlin. I have to absolutely agree
with you. This has been an extraordinary experience in terms of the Board working together
collectively and collaboratively and coming up with the process as we've moved forward. But
through your leadership and Treasurer Guissinger, along with our Board staff and Mr. Ballard
and Mr. Moser, this has been quite an amazing experience to be part of. So thank you.
It is now that time-CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Chair Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --madams and gentlemen of the Board of Directors.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes. Yes, please.

CLAUDIA FOLSKA: This is Director Folska. I had a question. I'm sorry to interrupt you.
On a technical note, every time I get into these meetings, somehow there's like a master mute
going on. And that would be well and fine, but sometimes on my phone, because of my assistive
technology, I'm not able to access the keypad and press star six to get myself out of this super
master mute control panel. Is there something that the Board staff can do so they're not-- there
isn't this master mute, and then when we're able to mute our phone we just can? Because I think
that's part of the problem. And I have to keep calling back in to do that. And if I have to keep
calling in, it's fine. But-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Can Ms. McManus or Mr. McKay address that issue? Because I
also know Director Menten is having that same issue, as well as Director Lubow.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So when we go in-- this is Barbara McManus-- when we go into
Executive Session, we won't utilize the Mute All. We do utilize it in the public forum, just so
everybody is muted and we can hear minus background noise. And as to some of the Directors
that if they choose to dial in instead of using Team, I want to reiterate the star six. And Director
Folska, I understand that that's a challenge for you. So hopefully when we go into Executive
Session, we won't have any reason to use the Mute All and you should be hearing fine.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: All right. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Does that answer your question, Director Folska?
I'm going to assume that's in the affirmative.
OK. It's time, everybody. I am now going to entertain a motion to move into executive session
for consideration of personnel matters regarding the General Manager Chief Executive Officer
Selection and candidate finalists Debra Johnson, Adelee LeGrand, and Tina Quigley, pursuant to
24-6-402(4)(e)(l) C.R.S. for determining positions relative to matters that may be subject to
negotiations, developing strategy for negotiations, and instructing negotiations regarding the
General Manager/ Chief Executive Officer compensation and contract, and 24-6-402(4)(b)
C.R.S. to receive legal advice regarding the same.
I would like to have a movant.
KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
DOUG TISDALE: Second, Director Tisdale.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Tisdale. OK.
Let me just say this. All in-- if there's anyone against-- I'll just assume everyone's in favor-- but if
anyone's against, please note that right now. Hearing none, I would like to note for the record
that immediately upon the conclusion of this executive session, the Board will reconvene to
address additional business.

And would all those entitled to participate in the Executive Session please move into the other
meeting instance at this time? Once that meeting is adjourned, the Executive Session will come
back into public hearing to make an announcement. Thank you, everybody.
All of the board is on. I see Director Walker. Shall we go through the list to see which Directors
are on, Ms. McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: I'm sorry, yes. We won't go in particular order, because I don't have
that same document in front of me. But I'm happy to list all of the Directors.
We're going to start with the Executive Committee.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK.

BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Yes, ma'am. I'm here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: 15 present, zero absent.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Ms. McManus.
I would like to thank every one of you in this meeting room for hanging in there while the Board
was in Executive Session. The selection of the agency's General Manager is one of the most
important responsibilities that this Board will undertake AND our decision requires a great deal
of discussion, deliberation, and reflection by each and every one of us.
But now it is time. And without further ado, we have one recommended action on the agenda.
And I would like to call First Vice Chair Catlin to make that announcement.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. And I don't have the recommended action print
out in front of me. So if you wouldn't mind reading it, then I would like to make a motion.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. The General Manager's Executive Search and
Oversight and Performance Management Committee presents to the Board of Directors a motion
to approve the attached resolution to identify one of the three finalists candidates as the RTD's
General Manager, subject to negotiation and execution of an employment contract.
And I will do a movant and a second, and then you can do the announcement.
LYNN GUISSINGER: We have to do the vote.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes. I would like to move-- we do a move and then a discussion-ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
PEGGY CATLIN: --and then the vote.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, hold on.
PEGGY CATLIN: What?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Go ahead, Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: I would like to approve-- or I would like to make a motion to approve, subject
to negotiation, the selection of Ms. Debra Johnson as the next CEO/ General Manager of RTD.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Do I hear a second?
LYNN GUISSINGER: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger. Is there any discussion on this motion?
Hearing none, I will now call on the Directors in each turn, starting with Director Broom.
Director Broom.
BOB BROOM: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Cook.

SHELLEY COOK: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: I would like to take the option of the comment. You went so fast. I
thought we would have that option.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: I'm sorry, which option?
NATALIE MENTEN: Discussion.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't hear you say you wanted discussion. Go
ahead, Director Menten.
NATALIE MENTEN: All right. I would like to make a statement. So for the public, to give them
an insight into how this process works. Tonight this is a single resolution but there is really two
parts to it. One is the candidate. But the second part is sending negotiators out to get a set
contract within a salary range.
And so what I am focused on is not the candidate themselves in my votes. Because I feel the
candidates had very similar qualities and experience. But the second part of what is included in
this resolution, although you won't see it in the text, is about the salary range, not only what
we're going out with these current negotiations but what we've seen in the past at RTD.
And what my issue is is the salary range, and again, what we have paid in the past. I'll share a
fact from the past that some of the Board may remember. I doubt many of the public know about
this. But I put a motion forward on the table, I believe it might have been 2018, with our former
General Manager, to reduce that salary by close to $100,000. And I think I had maybe a couple
other Directors join me in voting for that. That motion was reducing a $295,000 salary down to
around $190,000.

I think it's very unreasonable that the taxpayers have had to pay General Managers' salaries at
close to $300,000 or above when the head of the Colorado Department of Transportation, which
serves every individual in Colorado, is paid around $190,000. And I have spoken about this time
and again. The governor is paid, what, around $125,000.
So the question is, how did RTD get so far off track with excessive salaries when, at the end of
the day, less than 3% of the population uses RTD, compared to that head of CDOT making
$190,000? And as I said before, even if you're in a coma, the highways are benefiting that
person.
So my vote tonight is in opposition to what is going to be another bloated executive salary at
RTD. And looking at our budget problems, we do need to start to address these things. So my
vote tonight, again, is no, because I know what is coming with salary, and I was elected to be a
fiscally responsible representative of the people. When I go to town halls and I talk about the
GM, General Manager, CEO salary at RTD, when I talk about the top salaries at RTD at town
halls, these people are not happy to hear these things.
And so somebody has to take a stand against this. And so that is why I am being vocal at this
point. And I know the Board would like to have a unanimous vote, but I have not seen the fiscal
responsible actions to indicate that. And so I will not stand quiet as the taxpayers are going to be
on the hook for another big bill.
Thank you. My vote is no.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: --Director Menten. Director Mihalik.
KEN MIHALIK: I am a yes but certainly share the concerns that Director Menten has expressed.
Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: I vote yes, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: I vote yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Absolutely yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: And I am an absolute yes as well.

With that, so that is 14 yeses and one no, Ms. Debra Johnson will be on our next CEO General
Manager, looking at negotiations. So congratulations to her. We are excited to start this new
adventure down the Regional Transportation District.
I want to thank the entire Board for their commitment to really doing their due diligence in all of
the interviews and information that we've received. And I particularly would like to thank the
community for their input and our key stakeholders. This clearly was a collaborative method of
coming together to choose the next leader as we move down this road. So I'm very, very excited
and on behalf of the Board of Directors would like to say thank you.
With that-SHONTEL LEWIS: Madam Chair?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Director Lewis.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: If I could, what I'd like to do is go down each Board member to
make any closing comments. And with that, I'd like to start backwards. Director Williams.
KATE WILLIAMS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm very pleased to be a part of this decision
tonight and to welcome Debra Johnson to Denver and to RTD and to the future that we're all
working toward together. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Whitmore.
TROY WHITMORE: Thank you, Madam Chair. It's been an honor to be a part of this process. I
just want to congratulate my colleagues, especially those on the committee, thank the staff,
especially the Board staff and Mr. Ballard. Obviously, Mr. Moser has done a wonderful job on
our behalf. Look forward to an exciting-- well, we made history tonight. And I look forward to
making a lot more positive good history through this agency. And happy birthday, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Walker.
JEFF WALKER: Happy birthday, Madam Chair. It's been a pleasure working, being on this
committee. And I'd like to thank all of the applicants, the finalists, and congratulate Miss
Johnson and looking forward to spending the last couple of months of my term working with her
and the rest of the Board. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. In addition to all of the other things
that have been noted, I want especially to underline the thanks just expressed by Director Walker
to the other two candidates whom we had the privilege and the pleasure of coming to know and
spending time with and coming to have an incredibly high regard for. It was, as we have stated,

an embarrassment of riches. And congratulations to Debra Johnson, but genuine and sincere
unqualified thanks to Ms. Adelee LeGrand and Ms. Tina Quigley. Thank you very much, Madam
Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Tisdale. Director Mihalik, do you have any
additional comments?
KEN MIHALIK: Thank you. Just looking forward to welcoming Ms. Johnson to Denver. And
look forward to working with her. I think everyone will find her enthusiastic and engaging and
look forward to seeing what she brings. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Menten, do you have any other closing
words?
NATALIE MENTEN: Just for the public, so that they're aware of the process. So again, we are
sending out folks to do negotiations with this candidate. But you as the public should be able to
get a view of this contract, including the details of benefits and the base compensation, any other
components. And I have advocated in our meeting earlier that the public should be able to have a
public comment period. And I would encourage those of you that are part of the system, keep
this in mind when we see service cuts, fares potentially going up, and then looking at the
overhead, perhaps you would like to speak up at that point to express your thoughts about a sixfigure, very six-figure salary.
So it's not over yet, even though you've heard, sound like it is. There is a stage two that will be
coming up. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, ma'am. Director Lubow.
JUDY LUBOW: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to welcome Debra Johnson and tell her I'm just so
excited at the thought of working with her and doing the important work that's going to be
happening from now on.
I also wanted to reiterate that our list of candidates were wonderful, just was really terrific, and it
was very hard to make a decision. So I wanted to thank you all. Thank you all. It was a privilege
to get to know you. That's it for me. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lubow. Director Lewis.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Thank you, Madam Chair. I really appreciate the process, appreciate the
candidates. And I actually don't disagree with much of Director Menten has shared regarding
salaries. And I will say, for the record and for those that are listening, I was hesitant-- I am
hesitant for us to have a conversation about a reduction in salary when we are literally making
history and bringing in the first woman to lead our agency, particularly understanding the
historical context of pay inequity as it pertains to women.

And so Director Menten, I just want to let you know that I hear you and I'm looking forward to
working with you to figure out how we might be able to rectify this all.
To the other candidates, you all were incredibly impressive. I'm excited to work with Debra. I'm
excited to see the future of this agency. And I appreciate this process. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Lewis. Treasurer Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: I'm excited to welcome Debra Johnson. I think she's a great candidate. It
was a tough choice. We had three great candidates. And I echo Director Lewis's statements. It's
an historic day. And I'm excited to move forward. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. Director Folska.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Thank you, Chair, and happy birthday again.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, thank you.
CLAUDIA FOLSKA: Yes. I am very excited to welcome Debra Johnson to the RTD family. I
think she's going to do wonderful, wonderful things for the District. And people, whether they
use RTD or they don't, we all benefit from having a great public transit system that's multimodal.
And to the other candidates, you were so incredible, so wonderful. And I know that you'll do
great things in the future. And it was such a difficult decision to come to. But thank you so much
for the hard work you put in to the process and giving it your all. And it was very obvious to me.
Thank you very much. And that's all for me, Madam Chair.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Director Folska. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair, and happy birthday.
So Director Folska and others expressed it really well. First of all, I'm just thrilled to be able to
welcome Debra Johnson. And second, to the other applicants, it was as hard of a choice as we
are all saying. And we recognize and appreciate, I think, what it takes to put yourself out there
and thank you for being willing to do so.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. I'm going to go-- you know, First Vice Chair Caitlin,
I'm going to let you go last since you were the Chair of this committee. Mr. Secretary Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Madam Chair. And it's hard to add anything more that's already been
said. Debra Johnson, great work. And we really look forward to seeing you here. Tina Quigley,
Adelee LeGrand, my gosh, you guys are incredible. And thank you so much for taking part in
this.

I also want to thank Paul Ballard. Because he's led this agency with a steady hand through a
difficult time and has helped us in this selection process as well. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir. Director Broom, any last comments?
BOB BROOM: Thank you, Madam Chair. The only thing I'd say is that this has been quite an
experience, hiring virtual candidate. I'm looking forward to actually meeting in person Ms.
Johnson when she comes to RTD. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, sir.
I just would like to close, before I send it over to First Vice Chair Catlin, I would also like to take
this opportunity to thank Mr. Ballard, our incredible Board staff, Ms. McManus, Nicole Carey,
Tai-Shrae, and John McKay. They've done an amazing job of pulling all this stuff together, our
consultant, Mr. Gregg Moser, and our Communications team. Pauletta Tonilas and Jeff really
getting all that information out to the community, compiling all that information was just
amazing.
And last but not least, these three women were the most amazing, dynamic women leaders I've
had the privilege to interview and read. And I just have to say to you, this was probably the
toughest decisions I have ever made. And I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my
heart.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to First Vice Chair Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I just wanted to express my enthusiastic
congratulations and welcome to Debra Johnson, and also to thank the other two candidates who
were just so very, very impressive. And to echo what everybody else has said, this was a very,
very difficult choice. And I found myself really debating with myself for several days about
which candidate would best serve this agency.
But I also want to thank this Board. I have been very impressed with the dignity and the respect
that each and every one of you has conducted yourselves with in this process. Because we were
able to have this discussion in a very, very respectful and actually pretty pleasant several hours.
And so I just wanted to congratulate you all. It was a pleasure to be a part of this process and we
are going to be moving on.
Oh, I did want to thank Mr. Ballard. Because not only has he been helpful in this process, but he
has served as our Interim GM and CEO in such a fine fashion. And I can't thank him enough.
And also thank Gregg Moser, even though his work isn't quite done. It's been a pleasure and
we've really broken a lot of ground in terms of this virtual interviewing process. It's unlike
anything I don't think anyone's ever seen. So congratulations to all. And I'm going to say good
night.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you so much. With that, I will now entertain a motion to
adjourn the meeting. Do I have a motion?

KATE WILLIAMS: So moved, Director Williams.
TROY WHITMORE: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Mr. Whitmore. OK, I have a first from Director Williams, a
second from Director Whitmore. It is now 8:41 PM Mountain Daylight Time. Thank you all for
joining us on this most momentous, historical day for RTD. And congratulations to Ms. Debra
Johnson. We look so forward to working with you in the weeks, months, and years ahead.
Everybody have a pleasant evening. Good night.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Good night.
SHELLEY COOK: Good night. Happy birthday.
