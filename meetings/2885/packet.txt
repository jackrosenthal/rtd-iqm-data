BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: July 2, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

July 2, 2019

Board Meeting Date: July 16, 2019

Subject:

Award of “Group 29” Contracted Fixed-Route
Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Transdev for the
provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 29.” This contract is for three years,
with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year contract amount for service is
$85,326,407.00; the option year 1 amount is $30,560,167.00; and the option year 2 amount is
$31,742,845.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for service is $147,629,420.00. In
addition, RTD will reimburse the contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be
$9,614,906.00 for the initial 3-year contract term; $3,356,141.00 for option year 1; and
$3,435,828.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is
$16,406,875.00. The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit
service and fuel is $164,036,295.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
BACKGROUND:
Originally mandated in 1988 by Senate Bill 88-164 and revised by other legislative activities over the
years, RTD is obligated to “implement a system under which up to fifty-eight percent of the district’s
vehicular service is provided by qualified private businesses pursuant to competitively negotiated
contracts.” RTD currently outsources approximately 45% of its fixed-route service, 100% of its
ADA paratransit service (Access-a-Ride), and 100% of its general public on-demand service (Flex
Ride, formerly known as Call-n-Ride). The total amount of vehicular service currently contracted out
is close to 56%.
On February 26, 2019, a Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 named “Group 29” was issued
soliciting proposals for the provision of fixed-route transit services. The “Group 29” service package
replaces “Group 25”, which will expire in 2020. The service package consists of 111 buses
operating 36 routes providing approximately 340,371 revenue hours per year. A summary of the
routes included in “Group 29” is included as Attachment A. Responses to the Request for Proposals
were due on April 26, 2019. Proposers were required to provide detailed operating plans for
providing fixed-route service, including hiring and training employees, maintaining RTD-provided
transit vehicles, and conforming to RTD operating requirements. The contract award was anticipated
to be awarded on a fixed-price basis and based on “best value” competitive proposal procedures.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

DISCUSSION:
This recommendation represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response
to Request for Proposals (RFP) 19-DH-009 to provide “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. The
contract to provide this service is scheduled to be effective on January 12, 2020.
PROCUREMENT:
Two (2) proposals were received from Transdev and First Transit in response to RFP 19-DH-009 for
the Provision of “Group 29” Public Transportation Services. Both proposals were evaluated on the
following evaluative criteria: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (35%);
b) experience/qualifications and safety record (30%); c) price (30%); and d) SBE plan and goal
attainment (5%).
The technical evaluation team reviewed and scored each proposal based on a)
understanding/approach and organization for implementation and b) experience/qualifications and
safety record. The technical evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager,
Contracted Services; Greg Smith, Manager, Competitive Services; Steve Gieske, General
Superintendent, Maintenance; Loradeane Clinkenbeard, Manager, Bus Operator Training; and Erin
Vallejos, Technician, Contracted Services.
The SBE plan and goal attainment was reviewed and scored by Brittany Eroen, Compliance Officer,
SBO.
The proposal pricing was reviewed and scored the Procurement Department staff.
“GROUP 29” PROPOSALS:
Transdev - The following is a summary of the strong points of the Transdev “Group 29” proposal
which support the recommendation of contract award to Transdev:
Facility. Located at 2775 S. Vallejo Street Englewood, CO 80110 which is on the west side of the
Denver metro area and is centrally located within the “Group 29” service area. The facility is fully
functional and its location does not require any increases in diesel fuel use or increased travel times
to get to bus route terminals.
Bus Operator Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in bus operator wages. The bus
operator starting wage will increase from $18.47/hour to $19.80/hour (RTD starting wage for
operators will be $20.58/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other operator wage levels.
RTD, as well as our contractors, have faced long-term challenges with recruiting and retaining
qualified operators. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a
more attractive wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of operators and result in
improved service for our passengers.
Mechanic Wages. Transdev’s proposal provides an increase in mechanic wages. The Transdev C
level mechanic wage will increase from $21.67/ to $22.32/hour (RTD starting wage for an entry
level mechanic will be $26.08/hour). Adjustments were also proposed for other mechanic wage
levels. The proposed wage increases will provide Transdev the opportunity to offer a more attractive
wage package which will improve recruitment and retention of mechanics.
Dedicated On-site Recruiter. This new full-time position will be solely focused on the recruitment of
bus operators and maintenance personnel for the Transdev location.

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

Enhanced Quality Control. Transdev will track all performance metrics captured through Trapeze,
Webrisk, MMIS and SmartDive to monitor, maintain and if necessary improve performance under all
RTD Board of Director adopted performance measures.
Maintenance Program. Transdev will add an on-site Diagnostics Training Manager dedicated to
providing additional training for mechanics. Transdev will accomplish this through a maintenance
training lab which will provide real time and virtual training ensuring technicians are equipped to
diagnose and address all maintenance repairs. All mechanics will receive 60 hours of initial training
when hired and 40 hours of refresher training each month. During the term of the “Group 29”
contract Transdev has committed to obtaining an Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) shop
certification. The Transdev division has five mechanics that are ASE certified and one mechanic that
is Master Technician certified.
Proposed Management Team. Under this team’s leadership, the Transdev division consistently
meets/exceeds most of the RTD quarterly performance goals. The team has developed and nurtured
positive and productive relationships with surrounding governments and communities. The team has
long-term experience providing service for RTD and there will be no disruption of service when
transitioning from the previous “Group 25” contract to the new “Group 29” contract.

local operation is supported by a number of experienced professionals at the Regional level.
SBE goal set at 5%. Transdev’s proposed SBE plan meets the 5% goal.
The technical evaluation team requested further clarification on a few items which were adequately
addressed by Transdev.

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1

First Transit - The following is a summary of the First Transit “Group 29” proposal that does not
support the recommendation of contract award to First Transit:
Facility. First Transit proposed a bus facility at 18000 E. 22nd Avenue Aurora, CO 80011 with
arterial access to I-70 and I-225. The technical evaluation team determined this facility did not meet
the needs of the “Group 29” solicitation for two reasons.
1. Arterial access in this area is highly congested and would cause significant delays for buses
traveling to assigned bus routes. This would result in delayed service start times.
2. The proposed facility is located on the east side of metro Denver while the service package for
“Group 29” is located primarily on the west side of metro Denver. Buses would have to travel
greater distances to get to bus terminals resulting in increased diesel fuel use and cost to RTD.
Management Team. The proposed First Transit local management team did not meet the minimum
qualification requirements set forth in the “Group 29” RFP.
Cost. First Transit’s proposed price included an additional $10,600,000 in startup and additional
costs to support a new operating facility. The price proposal also included an additional $4,200,000
in additional management fees. For this reason and the others noted above, the technical evaluation
team determined that it was not in the best interest of the RTD to pursue any further action with the
First Transit “Group 29” proposal.
TRANSDEV “GROUP 25” PERFORMANCE:
The Transdev division currently operates the “Group 25” fixed route service package. The division’s
performance was evaluated based on the following Board of Directors adopted performance
measures:







Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles ≤2.0

Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 Miles: Transdev utilizes bus operator monitoring
technology and post-accident investigations for retraining of operators. They emphasize safety with

Packet Pg. 6

1.B.1

all employees at monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at
their facilities.
Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 Miles: Transdev raises awareness of passenger safety
through campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000
miles. All five passenger accidents that occurred in 2019 were classified as non-preventable.
On-Time Preventive Maintenance Inspections: Transdev places a high emphasis on completing
preventive maintenance inspections as required, and as such, the local operation is diligent about
completing these inspections on time.
On-Time Performance: Transdev understands the impact new operators, construction detours, and
traffic can have on OTP. From the beginning of the “Group 25” contract, Transdev worked in
conjunction with RTD Service Planning and Scheduling to improve OTP. They identified low
performing routes and assigning street supervisors to campaign the routes and to meet with
operators to discuss factors that impact their ability to run on time. Schedule issues are forwarded
to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls: Transdev did not meet the goal in 2018 but improved to
46,843 Miles Between Lost Service Maintenance Road Calls through May 2019 compared to 22,737
in 2018. During a 2018 routine review of maintenance activities, deficiencies were identified in
Transdev’s Maintenance Management team, Preventive Maintenance Inspection (PMI) and Quality
Control (QC) practices. During the remainder of 2018, Transdev hired a new Maintenance Manager
and Quality Control Manager who in conjunction with the local and regional Transdev Management
teams, revised PMI and QC maintenance procedures. Transdev has since improved Preventive
Maintenance adherence to 100%, reduced repeat maintenance occurrences by 50% and improved
miles between lost service road calls to 46,843.
Competitive Services staff will continue to monitor Transdev to ensure they complete preventive
maintenance inspections on time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring repeat issues,
provide additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to maintaining the buses
in their fleet.
Operator Complaints per Boarding: Transdev continues to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators and take other remedial actions to reduce the number of customer
complaints.
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD Competitive Services Internal Cost Estimate:
This estimate was prepared by the Competitive Services Department to anticipate the amount RTD
could expect to pay to outsource the “Group 29” service package to a contract operator. Due to the
recent increase in bus operator wages by RTD and its contractors, RTD anticipated proposers would
also similarly address labor challenges by increasing other wages. RTD also factored an increase in
costs for inflation. RTD Competitive Services total five-year estimate for the “Group 29” service
package was $144,179,082.
Transdev’s proposed total five-year price was $147,629,420. Transdev’s price proposal included
increases in inflation, CBA agreed upon Operator and Mechanic wage increases to address
differences between RTD and Transdev wages, and maintenance costs associated with the aging

1.B.1

2005-2007 Gillig bus fleet. (Transdev Bus Operator starting wages will increase from $18.47/hour
to $19.80/hour. Transdev C level Mechanic starting wages will increase from $21.67/hour to
$22.32/hour.)
First Transit’s proposed five year price was $166,732,373. First Transit’s price proposal included
significantly higher costs associated with starting up a new operating facility. First Transit’s price
proposal was not considered further since their proposed price was significantly higher than RTD
would expect to pay for the “Group 29” service package. Below is a breakdown of the RTD
Competitive Services estimate and price proposals received.

RTD Cost Model:
The Cost Model estimate was prepared by the RTD Finance Department to estimate the cost for RTD
to operate the “Group 29” service package in house rather than outsource to a qualified contract
provider.
The RTD internal financial analysis (Attachment B) indicates that the five-year estimated cost for RTD
to provide these services would be $165,571,112, which is $17,941,693 higher than the five-year
cost proposed by Transdev. The RTD Cost Model Estimate is based on current and projected wage
rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience providing other fixed-route
services. In addition to estimating the cost for RTD to provide the services included in the “Group
29” service package, the cost of providing a facility to serve as the operating and maintenance base
for the provision of the services is also included in the estimated cost of RTD operation. RTD
currently does not have the capacity to provide these additional services without building or leasing
additional facilities to serve as the operating and maintenance base for the provision of the services.
The Transdev total five-year proposed price represents a $17,941,693 (11%) savings over the
estimated cost for RTD to provide the service. Please see the “Group 29” - Proposer Service Cost

Funds for the provision of the 2020 portion of the first year of service under this contract will be
included in the 2020 RTD budget. Funds will be requested in future budgets for the provision of
service in future years.
RTD will require the Contractor to contract with RTD’s fuel supplier in order to purchase diesel fuel at
the locked-in fuel price each year.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with
Transdev for the provision of contracted fixed-route transit services “Group 29.”
This
contract is for three years, with two one-year options for a total of 5-years. The initial 3-year
contract amount for service is $85,326,407.00; the option year 1 amount is
$30,560,167.00; and the option year 2 amount is $31,742,845.00. The total 5-year not-toexceed amount for service is $147,629,420.00. In addition, RTD will reimburse the
contractor’s direct fuel costs in an amount estimated to be $9,614,906.00 for the initial 3year contract term; $3,356,141.00 for option year 1; and $3,435,828.00 for option year 2.
The total 5-year not-to-exceed amount for fuel is $16,406,875.00. The total 5-year not-toexceed amount for the contracted fixed route transit service and fuel is $164,036,295.00.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability
2)

Resolicit the “Group 29” service package. This is not recommended as the proposal process
has resulted in a responsive and responsible proposal that is less expensive than it would cost

ABSTRACT
As part of the FasTracks program, the North Metro Corridor will be served by the North Metro
Rail Line between Denver Union Station and Thornton. The project currently under construction
with completion in 2018 is Phase 1 which has a northern terminus at 124th Avenue. A future Phase
2 would extend this rail line north to 162nd Avenue, but is currently unfunded.
In order to fully leverage the Phase 1 investment in the North Metro Corridor, this report
evaluates market conditions and existing transit service network performance as a prerequisite
to developing a transit service implementation plan for the study area. The study area includes
eleven local bus routes, one SkyRide route, three Regional routes and one limited route. Existing
demographic profiles, proposed station area development, travel patterns, and other local and
regional factors are studied to provide context for local services, and inform the development of
a modified transit network for the North Metro Corridor.

PROJECT PURPOSE & BACKGROUND (2015)
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail connectivity in the Denver region, the
upcoming North Metro Rail Line (N Line), is designed to provide an attractive option for
commuters and other travelers in the North Metro area.
The project is expected to increase ridership within the North Metro Corridor transit network as
well as stimulate residential, retail, and commercial growth. The North Metro Corridor Service
Plan will develop an integrated bus network capable of meeting the mobility demand and needs
generated by the new N Line commuter rail service. The recommendations for this study will be
developed through a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions, service area
demographics, transit market opportunities and needs, and route performance for transit services
in the North Metro Corridor together with stakeholder input. 1

Study Area
The study area for the North Metro Corridor, as defined by RTD, borders I-25 on the west, I-76 on
the east, E-470 in the north, and Denver Union Station in the south. Northglenn, Thornton, and
Commerce City are the primary cities in the study area with parts of Federal Heights included as
well. The study area also includes some unincorporated areas in Denver and Adams Counties.

Rail Line Project Description
The North Metro Corridor is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line between Denver Union
Station (DUS) and 162nd Avenue in Adams County. As part of Phase one of the North Metro
Corridor, the N Line will operate on a 13-mile segment between DUS and 124th Avenue Station at
Eastlake. This segment with six stations is expected to open in 2018, with presently available
funding. The remaining planned section from 124th Avenue Station to 162nd Avenue will have two
stations and will be built and operated as Phase two of the North Metro Corridor though it is
currently unfunded.

Data used in the existing conditions analysis included stop level ridership, RTD financial data, RTD service
performance data, and Census data.

RELEVANT STUDIES
North Area Origin and Destination Study (2014)
The RTD North Area Origin and Destination Study used a survey of all modes to analyze travel
patterns of North Area Residents and workers, to determine origins and destinations for future
trips, time of day travel for commuters, and barriers to transit usage. This online survey, in both
English and Spanish, was made available for three weeks in March 2014. Community members
were invited and encouraged to participate through email, survey link distribution by local
governments, the RTD website, and social media. By the deadline 1,028 individuals responded.
Results from this study provide a background of transit usage patterns for North Area residents,
useful in informing service design plans complimentary to the North Metro Corridor project.
The biggest barriers to transit usage were travel time concerns and service frequency, followed
by proximity to stops. As can be seen in Figure 1 below, the most common transportation mode
for commuting is a single occupancy vehicle, even though a large portion of the survey group used
RTD for a portion of their trips. Additionally, as Figure 2 notes, probability of transit usage during
weekdays coincided with RTD weekday peak service schedules, while on weekends midday
service was most commonly used.

Station Area Masterplans—Denver North
The station area masterplans summarize the potential development plans drafted by affected
cities to leverage the station area for increased transit ridership and tax revenue. There is an
overall goal of creating a symbiotic relationship between the station areas and sustainable transit
usage, such that the stations themselves become attractive activity centers as well as broaden
transit options in those areas.
All current station area plans are geared towards transit oriented development (TOD), and include
residential-commercial mixed use development including mixed income housing. There is an
emphasis on pedestrian friendly complete streets that are well connected through a grid street
network, with multimodal street design and open space linkages. The plans envision the
development to be well integrated with the existing character of the neighborhood, while also
contributing to overall economic growth, as is evident in Figures 3 and 4 below. Increased infill,
additional senior housing, and opportunities for institutional developments are also highlighted
in the plans. Overall, the cities aim for these station areas to be vibrant, distinctive, and attractive
for residents and visitors alike.

RTD Market Size, Usage, and Segmentation Study
(2014)
The RTD Market Share, Usage, and Segmentation Study is a region-wide study focusing on District
level transit usage patterns among residents. The study found that 61 percent of total
respondents indicated RTD usage at least once in the past twelve months; 13 percent used RTD
on a daily or near daily basis. Denver County had 24 percent of their respondents who categorized
themselves as frequent riders and over half of the respondents (51 percent) indicated light rail
preference over bus services. Approximately 15 percent of Adams County respondents indicated
that they were frequent RTD riders.
Denver County had 33 percent of respondents suggesting no usage of RTD revenue service in the
past 12 months while 53 percent of Adams County respondents indicated no usage of RTD in the
past 12 months. The study did not break down market segments at a sub-county level, but this
generally shows greater transit usage in the core of the metro area such as Denver, with
significantly lower ridership in Adams County, which encompasses most of the North Metro
Corridor area. Based on a broad conclusion of this study evident in Figure 5 below, the N Line has
the potential to increase RTD usage with the introduction of additional rapid transit options.
Figure 5: Transit Usage in RTD Service Area in past 12 Months

RTD Market Segmentation Study (2014)
A similar but distinct RTD Segmentation study was conducted to help define groups of Denver
area residents based on their attitude towards public transportation and their use of RTD services.

Results from this study will be instrumental in both designing “consumer-centric” transit and
effectively communicating with consumers. Based on the response, RTD could group consumers
into five categories, which are: Practical Travelers, No Hassle Travelers, Car Travelers, Avid RTD
Users, and Conscientious RTD Users. As Figure 6 below shows, the largest group of respondents,
25 percent, was categorized as Avid RTD Users followed by Practical Travelers at 22 percent and
No Hassle Travelers at 21 percent. Based on the results, the study recommended encouraging rail
to those new to transit, using preferred media in every segment to communicate transit
information, and customize communication towards the group’s attitude towards transit and
RTD. With the introduction of the N Line, opportunities exist to attract infrequent users or nonriders into the RTD system through effective service design and targeted communication efforts.

Downtown Denver Commuter Survey Report
(2015)
The downtown Denver Commuter Survey Report discusses various demographic characteristics
and commuting patterns in downtown Denver. Commissioned by the Downtown Denver
Partnership Inc., this report summarizes survey response data. The following graphic (Figure 7)
illustrates commuter profiles, mode split, of the factors that influence commute choice, commute
activity and other commuting trends and habits of downtown commuters, included in the report.
As the N Line serves Denver Union Station in downtown Denver, this study can benefit from
understanding commuting patterns and trends of downtown Denver commuters and highlight
opportunities for future transit ridership gains.

Gold & Northwest Corridors Service Plan (2016)
RTD will open the G Line (Gold corridor) in 2017 and the B Line (Northwest corridor) opened in
July 2016. These both are commuter rail services. The G Line will provide a connection between
Union Station in downtown Denver and Wheat Ridge via northwest Denver, Adams County, and
Arvada, while the B Line connects Union Station and Westminster. RTD implemented a bus service
plan for the Gold and Northwest Corridors, in preparation for the new rail services (developed by
TMD in collaboration with RTD). The plan evaluated the performance of existing transit,
underlying demographics, and other market factors in order to develop recommendations for bus
service that better leveraged the performance of the two new rail lines, as well as changing
development patterns. A similar effort will be undertaken for the N Line in the North Metro
Corridor.

US-36 Service Plan (2015)
The US-36 corridor Flatiron Flyer Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) provides regional transit service between
Boulder and downtown Denver as of 2016, shown in Map 3. The commute shed that this service
draws from overlaps partially with the commute shed of the N Line. Previously, the corridor was
served by a total of 13 routes serving more than 10,000 average weekday boardings. The BRT
Service Plan recommended rethinking the complicated route structure to simple, more uniform
service patterns, as a strategy to make it more consumer friendly, increase ridership, and improve
overall corridor service performance.
The primary focus of the plan sought to reduce travel times, both out-of-vehicle-wait times as
well as in-vehicle-travel time. The plan also advocated for greater service reliability by enhancing
station access, incrementally improving service frequencies, and maximizing the use of new
managed lanes. The third strategy focused on increased customer accessibility of transit by
consolidating service patterns and creating clearer, more uniform and more marketable service
elements. After the rollout of the US-36 BRT service, the Flatiron Flyer, overall ridership in the
corridor has increased significantly. Lessons learned from this rollout will inform the development
of the N Line service plan, especially I-25 services such as Routes 120X and 122X.

North Metro Corridor Transit Operations Plan
(2016)
The North Metro Corridor Transit Operations Plan developed by the RTD Planning Department
includes both rail and bus service between downtown Denver and North Thornton-Hwy 7, of the
North Metro Corridor Project. This is an update of the initial draft plan published by RTD in 2011.
This plan highlights service details including corridor alignment, rolling stock requirements and
specifications, travel durations, cycle times and service frequencies. The plan also details the
locations for single and double track segments; it also discusses expected station Park-n-Ride
requirements and locations for transit transfers, bus-to-bus, as well as bus-to-rail. The Denver
Regional Travel Demand Model was used to estimate travel-demand, which guided understanding
of route performance, mode of access for different stations, distribution of peak hour loads; as
well as developing cost estimates, analysis for operation, and maintenance. The projected mode
split and ridership estimates by station, as depicted in Figure 8 below, will help determine the
unique station constraints moving forward, as well as the types of connecting services that will
have the highest chances of success.

EXISTING CONDITIONS (2015)
Market Assessment
The market assessment provides an overview of the development, demographic, and geographic
characteristics of the Denver North Metro Corridor sub region served by the new rail line and
highlights opportunities for coordinated transit service and network changes to coincide with the
opening of the N Line.

Population and Employment Density
Population
The distribution and concentration of population are two of many factors that influence the level
of transit use in an area. Higher densities tend to lead to more passengers per unit of service due
to the presence of a critical mass of potential riders and destinations within proximity. As shown
in Map 4, very high population densities are concentrated in two pockets of the study area. The
first is a residential area in Northglenn near East 117th Avenue. The second area is in Thornton
between Coronado Parkway and North McElwain Boulevard. Outside of these two small pockets,
the vast majority of the study area is comprised of low-density single-family housing with few
institutional and commercial/retail locations interspersed. This makes it difficult to provide
frequent bus services without having to sustain lower productivity and high passenger subsidies.

Employment
According to Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) data, there are approximately
65,000 jobs in the N Line study area, most of which are concentrated near the I-25 corridor. Not
all workers residing within the study area can stay local for work. Approximately 90,000 workers
that reside in the region commute to jobs outside of the study area. This trend is typical of
suburban communities, which have a net loss of workers on a daily basis. This trend will mean
that there is likely to be greater demand traveling to jobs outside of the study area to job centers
in the region such as downtown Denver, which are more easily accessed by transit. In the reverse
direction, employment is not concentrated at the N Line station areas, and the connections near
I-25 where jobs are concentrated are not as robust from the future commuter rail line. It is likely
that additional public mobility options will be needed, for “first and last mile” connections beyond
fixed route bus service to facilitate connections to and from the N Line stations.

1.C.1.a

Demographic Characteristics
Transit usage varies from neighborhood to neighborhood based on local conditions. The
demographic characteristics of the area population, as well as local mobility options play a large
part in determining customer preferences for transit. Certain demographic groups, like those with
limited vehicle access or financial constraints, typically utilize transit service more often than
others. Recognizing the geographic distribution of these population groups will enable RTD to
better meet their mobility needs. In addition, this demographic analysis supports RTD’s
responsibility to comply with Title VI Federal regulations, which require the identification and
efforts to mitigate disproportionate burden and/or disparate service impacts to minority and lowincome populations, as result of service changes.

Poverty
Individuals in poverty are much more frequent users of transit services and are an important
consideration in developing an effective transit service network for the new N Line. According to
2014 Census data an individual with an annual income of $11,000 or less falls under the poverty
line.
As is evident from Map 5, the study area predominantly consists of more affluent neighborhoods,
with lower densities of individuals in poverty, especially northeast of the N Line. Sections of the
study area with slightly higher concentrations of poverty are mainly dispersed to the southeast,
east, and west of the N Line, towards Commerce City and in between 56th and 72nd Avenues
bordering on Quebec Parkway. South of the N Line, closer to Denver Union Station in downtown
Denver, also witnesses higher densities of poverty. Figure 9 illustrates the distribution of income
groups by station area for the N Line. A station area is defined as a half-mile radius around each
N Line station with Census block groups falling in that region being used for this analysis.

Minorities
Minorities are defined as all but non-Hispanic White individuals. As Map 6 shows, minority
populations are concentrated east of the N Line, along East 120th Avenue, and further south in
Commerce City. West of the N line, minorities are most concentrated in the communities of
Federal Heights and Sherrelwood. In comparing this distribution with those in poverty, the study
area includes minorities of all income groups.

Line. It is evident from the figure that the most common groups in these station areas are NonHispanic White and Hispanic. The 48th Avenue and Brighton station has the highest proportion of
minorities whereas Thornton and 88th Avenue has the lowest proportion. Overall, it is evident that
there is significant demographic variation among the six new stations as part of the N Line.

Zero Vehicle Households
Zero vehicle households rely on transit and other alternative modes
of transportation to complete daily trips. Within the N Line study
area, most neighborhoods are characterized by single-family
households with high vehicle access. However, in certain areas such
as Northglenn east of I-25, west of Washington Street between 120th
Avenue and 112th Avenue, and in Commerce City the concentration
of zero vehicle households is more significant.

Most neighborhoods in
the study area have low
concentrations of zero
vehicle households.

Figure 11 shows the breakdown of household vehicle access by station areas. The figure shows
that the highest proportion of households have either one or two vehicles. Households with no
vehicle access are very limited, with the lowest proportion of zero vehicle households around

Seniors (Ages 65+)
The senior population, defined as persons age 65 and older, is generally more dependent on
transit for shopping, medical, and other personal trips when compared with other age groups.
Overall the study area has low to medium densities of senior individuals. Station areas near
Thornton and 88th Avenue and Northglenn and 112th Avenue contain the highest density of seniors
within the corridor. Map 8 below illustrates this distribution. As is provided elsewhere in the
region, dedicated scheduled mobility is provided by senior facilities beyond the regular fixed route
transit network.

Development Patterns
Most of the study area is planned on a grid street pattern and is dominated by single-family
residential development with commercial/retail establishments concentrated just east of I-25. A
few multi-family residential apartments are scattered in the study area along with public schools,
medical facility, and other institutional centers, many of which can be good candidates for
mobility connections to the N Line.

areas. However, future development in areas such as Thornton will include more multifamily
residential complexes and mixed use centers in addition to the traditional single family home
neighborhood development facilitating effective public transit mobility. These proposed,
approved, and active developments, especially those which provide an increase in housing
densities can be targets for building transit connections with the N Line. These developments will
also increase employment densities around the N Line, which will serve as a magnet for future
transit ridership growth in the corridor.
Other parts of the study area include the historical Eastlake area which has many opportunities
for redevelopment due to its proximity to the N Line. Additionally, Commerce City on the south
east of the study area, contains many parcels that are lying vacant near the proposed rail station,
which has been zoned, with more intensive land use densities in mind. This TOD is expected to
attract riders and enhance the utility of the N Line.

Market Typologies
The general market typologies in the study area can be broken out into commercial core,
industrial, and suburban areas. A large part of the study area is suburban in nature with low to
medium densities and has an automobile-centric development pattern. These areas are
characterized by large auto oriented streets and intersections, and limited pedestrian facilities.
Additionally, the discontinuous street pattern outside the major corridors further limits access of
transit into those neighborhoods. However, the ability to attract ridership will depend on the
ability to compete with automobile travel times and parking availability and costs, to downtown
Denver as well as to the surrounding areas with the multi-modal transit network.
There is limited diversity in land use in the study area. Outside of the large suburban residential
developments, the region sees employment centers concentrated in parts along the eastern
edges of I-25 and along the western edge of I-76. These facilities may have mobility needs during
non-traditional hours and the demand would depend on parking availability and transit access
near these locations. The retail employment centers have more potential for increased transit
ridership and are located on major mixed-use corridors. In many of these instances, alternative
last-mile public mobility may be more cost effective like station cars/vans, taxi/Transportation
Network Companies, and casual station carpooling.

Service Evaluation
Evaluating existing transit service provides a greater understanding of the role individual routes
serve within the larger transit network. Route performance is analyzed and benchmarked against
established RTD service standard metrics. This assessment includes a ridership analysis, which
helps in identifying trends and opportunities for route consolidation or service enhancements.

Transit Route Network
The fixed route bus services, which RTD offers are divided into different classes, which vary based
on service type, operating regime, and frequency. The standards for each class are based on
performance of all routes within each class. RTD evaluates performance indicators of subsidy per
boarding and boardings per hour as a part of annual route review.
As categorized in the Table 1, RTD routes within the study area fall under all service classes: CBD
Local, Urban Local, Suburban Local, Regional, and SkyRide. As defined above, CBD Local Routes
offer one-seat rides into or through downtown Denver, however Urban Local routes connect the
urban core to the greater RTD network in areas surrounding downtown and operate only on major
streets. Suburban Local routes provide transit connectivity to lesser developed areas outside of
the core service area. With Regional service, RTD focuses on meeting the peak-period demand
between suburban communities and downtown Denver, while the SkyRide routes cater to
passengers who pay premium fares and desire one-seat rides from transit nodes in the region to
Denver International Airport (DIA).
The different service classes tend to have varying frequencies, with Local, Suburban, and Urban
routes primarily operating on 30-minute peak frequencies and 30 or 60 minute off-peak
frequencies. Additionally, the SkyRide service to DIA operates with a frequency of 60 minutes all
day. Regional routes tend to have the much more focused service frequencies in the peak
commute periods than other more locally focused services.

Fixed Route RTD Service Categories 2
•

Regional: Includes routes providing high-speed service on limited access highways
from suburban and outlying communities to downtown Denver, Denver International
Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and provided at distances of
approximately 6 miles or more.

•

Local CBD: Local or Limited routes operating to/from the Denver Central Business
District.

•

Local Urban: Local or Limited routes that predominantly serve urban areas, which
have high residential and/or employment densities. About 35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population and employment density of 12 per acre
or greater.

•

Local Suburban: Local or Limited routes that predominantly serve suburban areas,
which have low to medium residential densities, medium to large lots and
homogeneous land uses. About 34% or less of route length within a ¼ mile buffer has
population and employment density of 12 per acre or greater.

•

Free Shuttle Services: Free shuttle services, known as the MallRide and the
MetroRide, operate in downtown Denver. The former travels on 16th Street between
Union Station and Civic Center Station and the latter runs between Union Station and
Civic Center Station along 18th and 19th Streets.

•

SkyRide: The SkyRide routes prove direct connection to the airport from multiple
points in the RTD service area.

Transit Service Levels
Transit service levels are measured, by frequency and span. Frequency indicates how often a
route runs and span includes the hours and days of operation. These measures are dependent on
several factors with actual usage (or market demand) being the most important. A higher demand
for transit requires an equally high transit supply. The demand and supply gap is met through
adjustments in frequencies, spans, and days of operation. Additional factors that affect transit
service levels comprise network role, connectivity to popular destinations, historical precedent,
regional significance, and operating agreements.

Frequency
The RTD network operates on one of three different “clock face” frequencies, i.e. spontaneous
use (15 minutes or better), coordinated (30 minutes), and lifeline (60 minutes or more).

1.C.1.a

The purpose of spontaneous-use frequencies is to limit wait times for passengers and diminish
the need to plan trips around the schedule ahead of time while responding to high usage. This
results in more cost-effective routes as spontaneous frequencies attract higher number of riders.
Typically, CBD Local and Urban Local routes operate with spontaneous use frequencies.
Routes that are unable to support spontaneous-use frequencies, however have sufficient demand
to support higher service levels than lifeline frequencies, usually operate with coordinated
frequencies. With coordinated frequencies, passengers have the ease of coordinating their trips
ahead of time and schedule their arrival at the stops such that wait time is minimal and overall
travel time decreases.
Areas that do not have the demand for higher frequencies are typically serviced by lifeline
frequencies. These routes are planned to provide transit coverage to communities living outside
of the developed core parts of the region. With these routes, RTD aims to not increase ridership
but instead provide crucial lifeline mobility to vulnerable populations living in those areas. As a
result, lifeline frequencies are found on Suburban Local routes associated with lower residential
density and higher auto ownership.

Span
Service policy and ridership demand typically dictates the RTD span of service. The span of service
for routes varies by service class. Wider service spans offer higher flexibility to customers for
planning trips and boosting ridership, with associated increased operating costs.
Weekday service for CBD Local and Urban Local routes begins between 4:00 AM to 5:00 AM. The
end of service is not generally fixed and varies with routes and their service areas, with some
services ending as early as 8:00 pm and certain others as late as 2:00 AM.
Weekday service for Suburban Local routes usually begins between 5:00 AM and 6:00 AM and
ends at between 7:00 PM and 11:00 PM.
Regional service generally operates only during peak hours, typically operating between 5:00
AM and 9:00 AM in the morning and between 3:00 PM and 7:00 PM in the evening. This span of
service is allocated to accommodate commuter demand travelling to and from large employment
centers. The exception is Route 120X which operates all day due to more consistent demand.

Existing RTD Bus Ridership
Boardings per Hour
RTD also measures route performance through a boardings per revenue hour metric. Routes with
higher boardings per hour characterize routes with higher productivity, i.e. where market demand
is met more accurately by service supply. An increase in demand, with the supply remaining
constant will increase productivity. However, if supply increases but the demand does not, it
would result in a lower productivity measure. A good balance between market demand and
service supply is ideal in that it can create a higher transit return on investment while lowering
the associated subsidies.

Framework and Strategies
Recommendations to align RTD’s bus network with the North Metro N Line have been tailored in
accordance with RTD’s vision to ensure the most efficient service for passengers and the best
possible resource utilization. This vision is focused towards enhancing mobility, linking economic
opportunities, limiting congestion, and providing affordable commute options. Phase I of the
three-phase recommendation strategy maintains current resource levels in terms of peak buses
and bus operators; while Phase II requires a more robust service investment and is proposed for
future implementation based on potential demand growth from the market development within
the first five years the N Line is in operation. Phase III is a potential longer term phase that is
contingent on funding to extend the N Line to 162nd Avenue.
All recommendations have been developed to attract new ridership as well as retain existing
customers, while improving operating efficiency and enhancing transit network effectiveness.
Results from service performance, ridership analysis and market conditions, were instrumental in
developing the framework for the service plan recommendations. The framework and strategies
shaped recommendations from both a top-down network effectiveness perspective, as well as a
bottom-up route optimization perspective.

Service Fundamentals for Transit Design
Service fundamentals constitute two parts, Service Design Decisions and Performance Metrics.
Service design decisions qualitatively describe in detail the reasons for individual route
performance, while performance metrics quantify individual route performance. For individual
route performance, no single metric will give a complete overview of market demand for service
performance and evaluation of an entire network provides a clearer picture.

Service Design Decisions
Effective service design decisions can prove influential in steering customers to ride transit. The
following section discusses the role of service design indicators like frequency, span, speed,
reliability, route alignment, approachability, and network have on ridership levels.

Service Frequency
Service frequency is generally considered the most important service design characteristic for
attracting new riders. Routes that have service every 15 minutes or better, (also known as
spontaneous-use frequencies), prove beneficial to passengers, as they have less out-of-vehiclewait times. Market research has shown that this frequency level encourages passengers to “just
show up and ride” rather than timing their arrival at bus stops. Services with higher frequencies
also provide more convenient and reliable network connections which will maximize overall
ridership.

1.C.1.a

Service Span
Service span is the days and time at which a route operates. Service span relates directly to
ridership as it defines when a passenger can travel and impacts both ends of a trip. A greater
service span provides customers with increased travel flexibility, thus a better transit experience.
Conversely, a greater time span, similar to expanded geographic coverage may be unproductive
depending upon the market served, and prove costly and inefficient to the transit agency.

Service Speed
A greater service speed benefits the customer by reducing in-vehicle travel times and benefits the
transit agency by lowering resource requirements. A review of service speeds includes
identification of deviations (out-of-direction travel), excessive stop dwell times (stops that are
very closely spaced or result in long delays), traffic delays, and unsynchronized travel signal delay
for potential improvements.

Reliability
Reliability is the key service factor that helps retain existing customers. A primary metric is transit
on-time performance, which is essential for passenger reliance on the service in order to avoid
extended waiting and to reach their destination at the desired time, consistently.

Alignment
Alignment refers to the path where a transit route operates. An alignment is best designed when
it balances customer access (i.e. walk distance) with service directness (i.e. quick travel).
Customers usually prefer direct service since it ensures shorter trips, higher reliability, and more
efficient and effective service. A common impact of connecting buses to rail stations is having the
bus leave the regular direct alignment to reach the station. A goal should be to minimize the
nature of the required bus route diversion through good station location/access planning. The
number of patrons riding through the station on the bus versus the potential ridership at the
station must be both considered and are influenced by the length of the deviation (impact on
through riders per new station rider) 3.

Route Spacing
Effective route spacing is crucial to maximize network access. Placing services too close together
or too far apart can affect network cost effectiveness adversely (unproductive competition) and
create issues in network synergy. Where requisite densities are present, the usual route spacing

3

The industry best practice out-of-direction model measures the minutes of out-of-direction travel for the
deviation times the number of through-riders divided by the number of new station riders. A ratio of 2 to 5
minutes is the acceptable range of impacts with 2 minutes a good trade-off and 5 minutes as the highest
acceptable impact.

1.C.1.a

is no closer than ½ a mile and no farther apart than 1 mile. Route spacing is strongly influenced
by existing street networks and the mode and service level. 4

Round Trip Cycle Time
Round trip cycle time, also known as revenue time, includes in-service running time plus terminal
recovery time to ensure on-time departure for the next trip. The relationship between cycle time
and frequency is crucial to higher efficiency. It is also desirable that route alignments and
operating speed be designed to ensure that routes have efficient round trip cycle times whenever
possible.

Network Role
As important as the design of individual routes is, the way they form a network is even more
significant. If a network is effective and efficient, it will be successful in attracting transit use for a
variety of trips and by a wide range of demographic groups.

Approachability
The approachability of a transit system highlights its ease of access and use by existing and
potential customers. A system is considered “approachable” when patrons are comfortable using
public transit and their uncertainty associated with it is reduced or limited. Extensive complexity
and service variations in a transit system can adversely affect the customer perception/attraction
of the network. Qualitative in nature, this assessment is utilized to address issues such as line
branching, short/long lines, trippers, deviations, corridor alignments, service frequencies, proper
signage, and simple user policies.

Performance Metrics
Indicators of performance assist in quantifying a route’s performance and assessing it relative to
others in the system. These performance indicators serve as crucial route evaluation tools since
they allow routes with varying boardings, service levels and costs to be compared directly with
one another as a part of RTD’s service standards. Some of the performance metric inputs are
defined as the following:
•

Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.

•

Revenue Hours: In-service hours plus recovery time, not including non-revenue time
(deadheading movements and pull-time to/from garage).

4

Industry best practice design recognizes that customers walk further for better transit with basic local bus
service drawing 80% of its riders within ¼ mile while rail and better bus (Rapid/BRT) have larger customer
walksheds with 80% coming from within ½ mile.

Network Design Strategy
The aim of the North Metro Corridor Service Plan is to create a more successful transit network
that comprises individual bus routes and a new rail line that do well independently as well as
collectively. Additionally, the plan seeks to encourage transit usage for commuters traveling from
North Metro towards downtown Denver.

Leverage North Line Operations
The construction of the N Line has provided an opportunity to rethink the regional and local bus
transit network that connects the Denver North Metro area to downtown Denver, as well as to
all areas between US-36 on the West and US-76 on the East. To obtain the maximum benefit of
this new rail service, adjacent and intersecting bus routes in this area were incrementally adjusted
to complement the rail service for maximum local and regional coverage where warranted.
Duplicative and unproductive service was removed or reallocated, route alignments were
adjusted, and bus schedules frequencies revised where feasible to better align with the frequency
of the N Line.
Recommendations are proposed in accordance with these actions and will attract additional
riders, improve operations, and enhance regional and community mobility with each plan phase.

Strengthen Bus Service Tiers
RTD operations on each service tier are defined by a target market and associated service
demand. The service tiers prominent in the N Line service area are Urban Local and Suburban
Local. Both these tiers fall in the “transit lifestyle” market in terms of land use and development
densities influencing the service performance and coverage.
Another tier that may require service strengthening in this corridor is the Regional service tier
which has approximately four routes and makes up a large portion of the demand travelling from
the North Denver region to downtown Denver and other parts of the region.

1.C.1.a

The proposed recommendations focus on increasing transit usage in lifestyle transit areas by
establishing connectivity with the N Line, while at the same time balancing existing and potential
demand with the Regional service.

Route Spacing and Prioritization
In the process of strengthening the transit network in the Denver North region, route
prioritization and consolidation were evaluated.
Route consolidation and prioritization provides an opportunity for RTD to direct limited resources
towards other faster and more reliable services. An example of this in the North Line study area
is Route AA (Wagon Road/Denver Airport). This service has a premium fare ($9.00 one-way cash
and $8.75 one-way My Ride card), making it expensive for airport employees who are the primary
riders. As a recommended alternative, this route can become an extension to Route 104, as 104L,
with local fares.
Similar recommendations have been mentioned in the subsequent sections for areas where
productive routes are operating on adjacent corridors. As these routes compete for the same
riders, prioritizing would improve service effectiveness and reduce net service cost for each route.

Route Design Strategies
For optimum performance of a transit network accompanied by best resource utilization, a clear
vision for the entire network is as essential as it is imperative for individual routes that to attract
ridership. The following strategies have been used as guiding principles to inform
recommendations for study area bus routes. This framework is expected to result in routes with
both improved operating efficiency and customer attractiveness.

Route Streamlining
Routes designed with extensive deviations tend to result in a higher operating cost and lower
ridership. While deviations may reduce walking distance making transit more attractive for a small
number of riders, they result in a degradation of service for a larger number of riders who travel
on the main corridor by creating access gaps and increasing travel time for the majority of
customers.
The N Line service plan aims to eliminate deviations unless they add value for significant numbers
of riders by serving major destinations, transit hubs, and rail stations falling within the corridor.
Additionally, the proposed recommendations look at streamlining bus transit to increase
efficiency and productivity, while facilitating network integration with the N Line.

Stop Consolidation
Even though closely spaced stops may appear to enhance service accessibility for riders, tight stop
spacing makes the service less attractive to people on the bus and may increase operating costs

1.C.1.a

by slowing service speed. Dwell time at bus stops is one of the major contributors to operating
delays and lower on-time performance, as it significantly impacts service reliability and operating
speed. A balance between efficient stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit and
reducing unnecessary delay leads to improvements in transit service effectiveness. Even though
stop consolidation is not proposed in Phase I of the North Metro Corridor project, it is
recommended that RTD continue this program throughout the bus network.

Corridor Segment Consolidation
Route Segmentation
In some cases, certain routes perform much better in specific segments. This trend may be a result
of a very long route serving large geographic areas, parts of which may not be as well suited for
transit. In such cases, separating the route into two distinct routes not only improves adherence
to set schedules, but improves efficiency. In the North Metro Corridor, Route 92 is an example of
a route with relatively low ridership from Washington Street/88th Avenue to Summit Grove
Parkway, and higher ridership for rest of the route. This service is a candidate for route
segmentation.

Low Performing Service Replacement
In areas where a route or route segment performs poorly and has limited scope of improvement
in performance, alternatives to fixed route service are considered. These alternative mobility
options include Flex Rides, special shuttles, service routes (tailored for specific trip making, e.g.
seniors), or commute oriented programs (e.g. station vans, car/bike sharing). These options
maintain service coverage as well as reduce RTD’s net subsidy.

Rail Service
Per most recent simulation from LTK consultants (June 2019), operating plan consists of a 20minute peak and 30-minute off-peak headway. This includes the same vehicles, schedule margin,
station dwell times, minimum turn times at terminals, and three added signal restrictions. In
addition, the A Line has priority in the Denver Union Station (DUS) throat and a southbound N
Line train may experience delays, due to a westbound A Line train operating behind schedule.

The approved North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor Rail Operations Plan calls for base bus service
connections to/from the new corridor stations. Included in this plan are routes 12, 48, 49 (former
northern part of Route 48), 72, 80, 88, 88L (former northern part of route 88), 92, 93L (former
eastern part of route 92), 104, 112, 114 (NEW), 120, 120L (former part of route 120), 128, 520
(former part of route 120 within Brighton), 104L (former AA), RX, as well as 41L (former
southern part of route RC).
In order to serve the new stations with connections to/from base bus service, most of these routes
will require adjustments, in order to optimize the overall bus service network. Most of these
connections will result in the need for and cost of additional vehicles and in-service hours.
Routes 104X and RX are proposed to remain on their current routing, without deviating or
extending into any of the N Line stations, yet still are considered part of the overall bus operations
network for the N Line Corridor. However, Route RX would terminate at the northern end at US85
& Bridge Street Park-n-Ride, rather than its current terminal at the Adams County Justice Center.
The following describes these changes in more detail:
Route RX –

discontinuation of routing within City of Brighton; northern terminal would be
US85 & Bridge Street Park-n-Ride

The following routes are proposed to deviate from their current routing into at least one station
each, along the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor:
Route 12 –

deviate north from current terminal at 106th & Melody Transfer Hub to
Northglenn at 112th Avenue; would require one additional all-day bus (wk)

Route 48 –

minor route adjustments; removal of deviation into Platte Garage, adding
deviation along Brighton Boulevard to access 48th Avenue and Brighton at

The following routes are proposed to have route extensions into at least one station each, along
the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor:
Route 92 –

extend route into Thornton Crossroads at 104th Ave Station; no cost; would also
include discontinuing route north of 104th/Colorado due to low ridership
(Wk/Sat/Sun) and replacing route portion with new route 93L

We understand that currently several of the routes listed above are not exhibiting a strong
ridership; however, all but route 104 are within the acceptable passengers/hr range for their
current level of operations. Route 104, as described above, is proposed to be restructured so that
it can have multi-purpose and noticeable potential for increased and steady ridership. Thus, there
essentially are no vehicles or in-service hours to ‘harvest’ in order to address the above listed
operational shortfall needs.
In addition, since parking availability, overall along the North Metro Commuter Rail corridor has
been curtailed substantially, from the original anticipated design, it will be vital to the rail line to
have effective and efficient bus route feeder service, in order to provide the needed access to it.
As no budget is assigned within FasTracks to cover these additional bus requirements and inservice hours (resources), Service Development has designed a bus operations plan, for the
upcoming opening of the North Metro Commuter Rail Corridor, which is overall revenue neutral.
Additional vehicle needs will be met through regular service change adjustments prior to the
opening of the corridor.

Conclusion
The introduction of the North Metro Corridor (N Line) presents an opportunity to maximize the
investment by tailoring complementary service that matches market demand, and
accommodates the changing urban landscape in the study area. Currently, many of the
communities served by N Line stations are lower density and suburban in nature. Travel demand
shows a significant number of commuters travel south for work, which presents an opening for
the N Line to facilitate that movement. Outside of the popular I-25 bus routes (120X/122X), most
of the routes within the study area provide basic levels of service and the corridors they operate
on are not yet suitable for high frequencies. The Service Plan recommendations evaluate the best

use of limited resources, for transit in the study area and will fully leverage the new N Line, as well
as the well-utilized I-25 bus routes.

SUMMARY
The North Metro Corridor Draft Service Plan presents the proposed changes in the existing RTD
bus service network for N Line opening in Spring 2020. The Plan includes opportunities for
improving bus transit in Phase I (initial opening of N Line) and Phase II (a 3 – 5 year period
subsequent to N Line opening, based on resource availability), as markets and mobility needs
evolve.
Presently being suburban and low density, with employment concentrated near the highways,
the study area is transitioning from an area with overall low transit usage to an increasing focus
on sustainable mobility. The two I-25 Regional routes (120X and 122X) have high ridership and
productivity indicating significant demand for transit commuting from the north to downtown
Denver. The North Metro Corridor Draft Service Plan focuses on adjusting the bus network to
complement the new N Line while minimizing adverse impacts to existing customers and
maintaining the constraint on added operating resources.
A number of existing bus routes, especially west of the I-25, to stations on the N Line, have been
incrementally extended to stimulate further demand (e.g., routes like 104 that do not connect
with the I-25 Regional transit). These extensions are also geared to provide direct east-west
service and enhance connectivity between neighborhoods in Federal Heights, Westminster,
Thornton, and Northglenn. Routes east of I-25, within the study area, were not altered
significantly to complement the N Line. Significant transit demand is observed south of US-76, in
Commerce City where routes would be adjusted for improved coverage and alignment with the
N Line.
The objective of minimizing rider impacts is met with only 1.1 percent now walking more than a
convenient ¼-mile (5-minute) and just 0.3 percent walking more than the reasonable ½-mile (10minute).
Further consideration of bus service revisions, in a potential long term Phase II, currently
unfunded option, extending the N Line to 164th Avenue were not formally analyzed as part of this
study. However, it is reasonable to presume that RTD regular fixed route service would perform
in the much-lower density of the suburban areas north of the current 124th Avenue terminus, in
a similar fashion to existing low-density areas and have difficulty in meeting minimum productivity
thresholds. Consequently, it is suggested that local mobility connections to the future 144th
Avenue and 164th Avenue stations, on the extended N Line would be best provided by
microtransit/TNC (e.g., Uber, Lyft, Bridj), or autonomous vehicle services in the future. The

availability of such affordable and reliable first-mile and last-mile services is likely to also reduce
the need for station Park-n-Ride capacity, with fewer people driving personal vehicles to the new
stations.

Re:

Service Availability – June 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.54% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons reflect a significant
decrease compared the same month (June) last year. Service delivery has improved significantly
since July 2018. Lost service for personnel related reasons follows:





June 2019 – 190.12 hours
June 2018 – 1,444.99 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,255.04 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 8,740.53 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in June were increased summer special events
(such as: PrideFest, Denver Heart Walk, Rockies home games, Pop Culture Con, and the Garth
Brooks Concert) and planned/unplanned bus bridges (such as: Juneteenth & Truck Stop Rally).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.54% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,411 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 19,288 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:
