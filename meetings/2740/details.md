#### 1. Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and Budget Transfer due to Operator Wage Increases

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts:  First Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract #14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the contract.

Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH-003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.  Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH-021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.  Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH-064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00. Group 27 – add up to $6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH-055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.

The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while these services are rebid.

It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018 Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased costs incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases for 2018:

Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00

This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services; Task Goal #1, Fiscal Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and Human Capital.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 22, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Solano seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer, noted that this had been brought up as an informational item at the committee meeting the previous month. He said that this action item would help stabilize the contractor workforce as there were concerns with the new Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that had been adopted. He added that this action item would help keep some parity with RTD’s private sector contractors.

Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services, noted that all of the information was included in the Board Report. She added that staff had conversations with its private contractors since the new CBA went into effect, and 125 out of 840 contractor operators had approached them with concerns about the disparity in operator wages. Staff is concerned that by not allowing the contactors to increase their wages there might be some cannibalization of the contractor operators as they move to work directly for RTD.

Director Broom asked if RTD’s existing contracted services contracts had escalator clauses to deal with issues like this.

Ms. Conover stated that they did not.

Director Broom suggested that future contracts have escalator clauses so that staff would not have to come to the Board every time a wage increase was needed.

Director Folska, Ph.D., echoed Director Broom’s comments and said that it should not be a surprise to staff that negotiations with Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) 1001 would occur every three years and the outcome of that negotiation would affect contractor agreements as well. She then inquired as to how much RTD’s contractors pay for the buses that they get from RTD.

Ms. Conover stated that RTD did not charge contractors for the use of RTD buses.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why the contractors did not provide the increase on their own without RTD interference.

Ms. Conover explained that the new wages amounted to a large increase. She noted that RTD’s starting operator wage was $19.40 and the contractor’s starting wage was only $17.50, so it was a big difference.

Director Folska, Ph.D., inquired as to what the range was for the contractor agreements.

Ms. Conover explained that each contract was between three to five years and they were all staggered. She noted that staff was looking at accelerating the re-bid process for the next contract so that they were quicker.

Mr. Ford noted that the increase would not be applied to the contractor’s profit margin, but would be applied to the basic wages and selected supervision of the contractor operators.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that this was about the contractors maintaining their current profit margin and passing on their costs to RTD.

Director Anderson said that if RTD gave their drivers increased wages, and there were plenty of openings for operators, contracted operators would eventually move over to RTD for jobs. She said that those in the suburbs who were served by contracted services such as First Transit for bus service would not have enough operators to maintain service, therefore she would be supporting this.

Director Lubow asked why the starting wages for contracted operators was listed between $18.00 and $18.50 per hour.

Ms. Conover stated that it would be up to the contractors to negotiate what their starting wage would be and the progression for the rest of their employees. She noted that $18.00 to $18.50 would be the target pay range.

Director Lubow asked if that meant that RTD did not know what would be spent.

Ms. Conover explained that the total amount could be less than anticipated, but it would not be more than what the Board had authorized.

Committee Chair Deadwyler declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. University of Colorado A Line Service Interruption on April 20, 2018 Presentation

Mr. Ford stated that since the April 20th event RTD has been working with its contractor to improve service moving forward and to rectify certain issues.

John Thompson, Denver Transit Partners (DTP), stated that everyone at DTP was investing in RTD and the metro area, and no one more so than Anne Herzenberg, General Manager of Denver Transit Operators (DTO).

Ms. Herzenberg thanked the Board for the opportunity to explain the April 20th event. She noted that her presentation would cover:

- Causes and Effects of Service Disruption

- Efforts to Rescue Disabled Trains

- Communication with Patrons During Event

- Plans to Prevent a Recurrence

- Improving Response to Abnormal Conditions

- Improving Communication to Patrons

Ms. Herzenberg said that the timeline of the event was:

- 3:57pm: Train 4045/46 departed DIA in service

- 4:03pm: Train 4045/46 reported a power problem at MP 18.41 (5 miles south of DIA in the single track area)

- Operations Control Center (OCC) attempted to advise train operator on how to overcome a vehicle related propulsion fault

- 4:13pm: Train 4017/18 departed DIA with passengers – OCC instructs operator to couple to the disabled train ahead and push to 61st and Pena Station

- 4:18pm: Train 4017/18 reports train disabled – “will not take power”

- 4:19pm: Two disabled trains are stranded with passengers on-board – a major service disruption began to unfold

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the problems were caused by:

- The OCC assumed the initial power problem on train 4045/46 was due to a train-related fault

- The Traction Power System (overhead catenary system) did not experience any faults and indicated a normal state at the OCC

- The overhead wires were intact and the traction power system remained energized, however a piece of the hardware assembly supporting the OCS had failed

- The “steady arm” component of the cantilever beam supporting the OCS fractured

- The free swinging steady arm made contact with the passing trains and broke the shear pins supporting the trains’ pantographs causing the trains to lose contact with the overhead wire and lose power

Ms. Herzenberg stated that the recovery effort for train 4045/46, the first disabled train was:

- 4:03pm: Train 4045/46 was disabled with passengers on board

- 4:42pm: OCC requested a bus bridge

- 4:42pm: a third train was off loaded at 61st and Pena Station and sent to rescue the train 4045/46 from the south

- Multiple efforts to couple to train 4045/46 were unsuccessful due to weather conditions and a steep grade

- 6:54pm: successful couple, southbound tow in progress

- 7:13pm: passengers on train are unloaded at 61st and Pena

- Total time passengers were on disabled train = 190 minutes

Ms. Herzenberg stated that the recovery effort for train 4017/18, the second disabled train was:

- 4:18pm: Train 4017/18 was disabled at MP 19:47 (4 miles south of DIA)

- 7:19pm: Rescue train arrived from DIA and coupled

- 7:53pm: Rescue train pushed train 4017/18 to DUS with passengers in rescue train – arrived at DUS approx. 8:51pm

- Total time passengers were on disabled train = 215 minutes

Ms. Herzenberg commented that RTD’s concerns and criticism about its communications with customers and RTD was well founded. Furthermore:

- Communications directly with passengers on the failed trains, with other passengers on the line, and with RTD was disjointed, unreliable, and inaccurate at times

- Despite considerable efforts by DTO staff:

o        Communication Systems were not used effectively

o        Efforts were confused with results (many messages were made – but often proved unreliable due to the lack of specifics or changing circumstances)

o        Our passengers were just not well informed – neither was RTD

Ms. Herzenburg said that the events lead to a major disruption because:

- During initial stages, the OCC failed to accurately assess the cause and magnitude of the problem

- Attempts to couple the first disabled train were complicated by extreme weather conditions and a steep grade

- Severe weather affected decisions that may have led to evacuating passengers on to the right-of-way

- Trains were stranded at least 4 miles from the closest station

- Inexperience - DTO personnel have not encountered this type of incident before

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that lessons learned for DTO operations included:

- Treating all disabled trains between stations as a potential emergency – understanding the potential for a prolonged event

- Operational tactics need review – focus on taking care of the passengers first – moving the train is secondary

- Limit the time passengers are stranded before evacuation is ordered. FRA and RTD view evacuation to the ground as a last option.

- Review SOPs and the EPREP  – plug gaps

- Training for operations personnel needs to be re-examined especially procedures and preparation for dealing with abnormal circumstances

Ms. Herzenberg commented that the lessons learned for DTO communications showed that:

- OCC communication systems were not used effectively

- Customers received inconsistent and unreliable information

- The OCC was slow to realize the magnitude of the problems and, as a result, important information flow was compromised

- Reliable descriptions of the service impacts were not conveyed to RTD via the ReadyOps Notification system

- DTO did not supplement the OCC with additional customer service staff until well into the emergency

- On-board and station announcements were not used effectively

- Quality matters not just quantity

- During emergencies, staff the OCC with additional communications staff

- Utilize existing systems and technology better

o        The OCC could have communicated directly with passengers on-board the disabled trains – it did not

o        ReadyOps messaging was too generic – notifications require specifics

o        Station public address and variable messaging systems were underutilized

- Review reliance on ReadyOps notification system

- Automated communications were not enough

Ms. Herzenberg said that plans to prevent recurrence included:

- Evaluating failure analysis of fractured bracket

- Improving DTO Operational Responses

- Improving Communication with RTDC Customers

- Improving Communication with RTD Management and Staff

- Continuously test operational readiness

- Consider all the input from the after-action review – apply lessons learned

- Augment training program (June 30)

o        Incorporating quarterly table-top drills into existing operations staff training program

o        Underscore emphasis on tactical decision making during abnormal circumstances

o        Emphasis on rigor of communication protocols at all levels – within the OCC, on trains, in stations, RTD notifications, Rider Alerts, etc.

o        Hands-on equipment training for field supervisors (interim completion of May 31, repeat quarterly)

- Revising DTO Operations SOPs – Completed

o        How to Rescue a Disabled Train & Emergency Management Plan

- Adding customer service personnel to OCC duty roster (May 11)

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that in summary:

- Operational readiness will be improved

- Communications with RTD will improve

- And improving communications with our customers is our highest priority

Ms. Herzenberg added that in the future DTO would treat every train issue as a full scale emergency. She commented that DTO will need to examine the situation and be very careful about their response before taking any action. She stated that DTO needed to improve all aspects of its communication as well as continue to improve its operational readiness.

Committee Chair Deadwyler thanked Ms. Herzenberg for her update and DTO’s plans to improve service in the future. She added that people realize that there will be some type of breakdown, but they do not understand being held hostage while staff tries to figure out what the problem was. She added that this incident was in her district and constituents were calling her trying to figure out what was causing the delay. She further added that RTD and DTO need to get people off stranded trains, no matter how long the delay.

Director Williams asked if a big part of the issue was the location of the stalled trains.

Ms. Herzenberg said yes. She noted that both trains were four miles from the nearest station, and the closest gate in the fence was far off. She added that both RTD and the FRA have said that evacuating passengers to the ground was the last resort. She noted that in hindsight DTO should not have attempted to couple the trains and the rescue train should have been brought in from the beginning. She added that DTO would examine the location and position where the trains broke down again.

Director Archuleta commented that the entire presentation seemed like a fancy way of saying if it breaks, it will be fixed. He added that train tickets should have a disclaimer indicating that passengers ride at their own risk.

Mr. Ford stated that RTD took this matter very seriously. He remarked that RTD was meeting with DTO and staff to provide the best customer service, and added that RTD did not want to have a system that people were hesitant to use. He added that he was on one of the trains, so he had firsthand knowledge of what happened that day. He stated that RTD was providing more oversight and recommendations to DTO to train them for how to correctly respond to these type of incidents.

Director Anderson commented that, while people were uncomfortable, luckily no one was hurt. She noted that when trains couple it is a very dangerous maneuver, and she was happy to know that no one was injured in the process.

Director Broom asked if DTO could use tugs similar to those used by airplanes to move disabled trains to the nearest station. He noted that, if there was a power issue, it would need to be diesel or battery powered, but it was something RTD and DTO should look into.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that RTD already owned something like that.

General Manager Genova commented that RTD owned a Nordco Mobile Railcar Mover but it was only for use on light rail tracks. He said that RTD had recently replaced its outdated Mercedes-Benz Unimog in 2016, but the Nordco could not be used on the commuter rail tracks because it was not FRA compliant.

Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed with Director Anderson that safety was RTD’s number one priority, but she said that the situation that occurred on April 20th was not acceptable. She stated that, when trains break down, passengers need to be removed from the stranded trains and bus bridges need to be implemented as soon as possible.

Ms. Herzenberg noted that DTO had tried to find a suitable rescue train for the past two years but they had still been unable to find one.

Director Folska, Ph.D., suggested that if DTO could not find the right rescue train they should invent one. She noted that other train companies could potentially need the same design too. She added that DTO should incorporate the Japanese way of thinking of “Look, See, Say”.

Director Sisk stated that both RTD and DTO had glossed over the 230 passengers that were inconvenienced and that was part of the public relations effort that was lacking. He said that both agencies failed its constituents and left them stranded on two trains for hours without any explanation and that was unacceptable. He added that a situation like that could not happen again and both agencies need to reach out to the inconvenienced passengers to make it right.

Chair Tisdale commented that DTO came to fall on their sword, as it was appropriate. He noted that it did not fix the problem, but DTO was taking the necessary steps to address their failure. He remarked that the biggest part of the failure was the lack of communication to the individuals stuck on the two trains and added that it was compelling for him to find out that RTD’s own COO was on one of those trains, and the only way he was able to find out any information was because he called internally to RTD staff.

Director Lubow remarked that what happened was very disappointing. She asked if DTO intended to have more emergency planning exercises.

Ms. Herzenberg said yes, and added that quarterly table top exercises would reinforce that as well.

Director Lubow inquired as to what exactly a table top exercise entailed.

Ms. Herzenberg stated that table top exercises put staff on the spot. She explained that staff would be asked how they would handle a certain emergency and their responses would then be compared against the Standard Operating Procedures (SOP). She noted that table top exercises would be recorded so staff could see what ideas were beneficial, and which ideas did not conform to the SOP.

Director Lubow asked what the difference was between table top exercises and drills.

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that drills were acted out in the field and noted that DTO had recently performed a drill on the G Line in Arvada.

Director Lubow inquired if DTO would schedule drills regularly.

Mr. Ford said yes, and he noted that was something that RTD was asking DTO to do since they are critically important.

Director Lubow noted that coupling exercises in steep grades should be at the top of DTO’s training and exercise list as well.

Director Menten asked if the broken bracket that was shown in the presentation was aluminum.

Ms. Herzenberg stated that it was cast-aluminum.

Director Menten inquired as to how many cast-aluminum brackets existed on the University of Colorado A Line.

Mr. Herzenberg said there were hundreds.

Director Menten asked if the bracket was a typical design, or if it was a custom made piece.

Ms. Herzenberg remarked that the design was used by a lot of agencies, but the investigation into the cause of the failure was still underway.

Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, said that RTD’s requirement was that DTO performed adequate preventative maintenance. He said that staff understood components would fail from time to time, but those failures should be caught before a critical situation occurred.

Ms. Herzenberg added that DTO had an extensive preventative maintenance program, and some work was completed during the day as well as at night.

Director Williams commented that there were trains that break all over the country. She added that recently her staff was in Washington D.C. and their train broke down, had to be towed, and they were stuck on the train for 90 minutes. She remarked that this was a learning experience and if RTD and DTO move and improve on the lessons learned, service would improve.

Director Walker said that, to his recollection, there have been three well known failures for the University of Colorado A Line. He noted that most of the failures had occurred near the bridge heading towards Denver International Airport (DIA) and asked if there was something significant about that area.

Ms. Herzenberg said that the area around DIA was subject to lightning, more so than other places.

Director Walker stated that the lack of communication was unacceptable and he hoped that some of the steps being addressed were also transferable to the G Line and the light rail system.

Director Hoy remarked that he agreed with a majority of the comments made, but he was concerned with the part of the process that failed. He noted that DTO’s investigation should consider if the broken component was the right piece for the system and location. He added that he was disappointed that RTD’s reputation was tarnished with this incident and it hurt when something like this happened and hoped that DTP shared in that pain. He asked if there was a cost associated with the problem to DTO, such as reimbursing RTD for bus bridges.

Ms. Herzenberg said yes, DTO reimbursed RTD for bus bridges on the commuter rail.

Director Solano asked how often DTO performed quality control testing and inspection of components.

Ms. Herzenberg said that DTO’s maintenance program was based on preventative maintenance and thar the line was checked every night. She said other checks were performed at different levels of frequency.

Director Lubow urged Ms. Herzenberg and Mr. Thompson to come back in a few months to provide the Board with another presentation that outlined what changes had been made and implemented.

##### a. RTD Board of Directors 4-20 Incident Presentation

#### 2. Service Availability Update

Mr. Ford noted that RTD continued to provide a steady level of service at 98.7%, but the agency was still having issues with driver retention and operators working 6 days. He added that RTD continuined to have challenges with bus bridges and fulfilling needs for other special events that impacted operations. He noted that staff was monitoring and working on operator retention and recruitment efforts and staff was increasing activity on those fronts.

##### a. Service Loss Memo Revised 5 15 18

##### b. Copy of lost hours revised 5 15 18

### D. Other Matters

Director Archuleta thanked Michael Washington, Transit Equity Manager, and Doug Monroe, Corridor Planning Manager, for their assistance at a meeting held at the Volunteers for America apartment building downtown. The proposed removal of their bus stop was rescinded and they will get to keep their stop.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Deadwyler adjourned the meeting at 7:15 p.m.
