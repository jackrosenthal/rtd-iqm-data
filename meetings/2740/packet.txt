Subject:

Increase Fixed-Route Contract Authority and
Budget Transfer due to Operator Wage
Increases

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to increase contract authority for the following fixedroute contracts: First Transit “Group 24” (contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract
#14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26” (contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27”
(contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases
over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to $6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these services are rebid.
It is further recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the 2018
Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased costs
incurred due to proposed private contractor operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00
 Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00
This action supports Core Goal #1, Successful Delivery of Transit Services; Task Goal #1, Fiscal
Sustainability; and Task Goal #2, Workforce and Human Capital.
BACKGROUND:
RTD currently contracts with two companies to provide fixed-route service. These two companies
are First Transit and Transdev. They operate under the terms of four (4) separate contracts, each of

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

which is for a three (3) year term with two (2) one-year options. Collectively, these contractors
provide approximately 45% of RTD’s fixed-route bus service.
First Transit provides service under three contracts:
 “Group 24” (“First Transit Commerce City”) which is operated out of the First Transit
Commerce City location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was
implemented on 8/17/14. This contract provides approximately 334,700 revenue hours of
service per year.
 “Group 26” (“First Transit Longmont”) which is operated out of the First Transit Longmont
location. This contract includes local service in Boulder and Longmont and was implemented
on 1/3/16. This contract provides approximately 189,400 hours of service per year.
 “Group 27” (“First Transit Denver”) which is operated out of the First Transit Denver location.
This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on 5/13/17. This
contract provides approximately 344,600 hours of service per year.
Transdev provides service under one contract:
 “Group 25” (“Transdev Englewood”) which is operated out of the Transdev Englewood
location. This contract includes local service in metro Denver and was implemented on
1/4/15. This contract provides approximately 339,700 hours of service per year.
DISCUSSION:
Historically, the starting wages paid for operators by the private contractors have been approximately
$1.00 per hour less than the starting wage for bus operators for RTD. In February of 2018, RTD renegotiated its collective bargaining agreement (CBA) with the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) and
increased the starting wage for bus and rail operators from $17.59 to $19.40 per hour. The starting
wages for bus operators for the private contractors are currently as follows:
First Transit Commerce City (Group 24)
Transdev (Group 25)
First Transit Longmont (Group 26)
First Transit Denver (Group 27)

$15.38 per hour
$15.71 per hour
$15.43 per hour
$15.43 per hour

Due to the low unemployment rate in Colorado and the highly competitive labor market, there is
concern that the disparity in operator starting wages between the private contractors and RTD will
entice a high number of bus operators at the private contractor operations to “jump ship” – to quit
their jobs and apply for jobs with RTD. As a result, our contract partners will lose employees and be
unable to meet their service commitments to RTD and our customers. This will result in dropped
service for our customers and a decrease in reliability, one of the primary determinants of transit
ridership. In order to mitigate a large-scale migration, it is recommended that RTD renegotiate the
existing Contract Agreements with First Transit and Transdev so that private contractor operator
wages can be adjusted to a more competitive amount relative to the new starting wage for RTD
operators and the local Denver labor market for drivers.
After extensive conversations with First Transit and Transdev, the parties have mutually agreed that
adjustments to the starting wage for First Transit and Transdev bus operators would be appropriate
given the current market conditions and the result of RTD’s contract negotiations and that the
adjusted starting wages for the private contractors should be between $18.00 and $18.50.
In addition to the adjustment to starting wages, it will also be necessary to adjust the wage scales
for existing operators as well. Wages for operator trainers, dispatchers and street supervisors will

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

also be increased as wages for these positions are typically determined based on an operator wage
plus a stated per-hour increase (eg.- the operator wage plus $1.00 per hour).
The proposed Board action will provide the necessary increases in contract authority to cover the
increases in wage costs from a proposed effective date of April 1, 2018, through the end date of the
existing contracts. Language will be included in the contract amendments to ensure that ALL of the
increased compensation resulting from this action will go towards the agreed upon wage increases
for drivers and related positions and that none of the increased compensation will go towards
corporate overhead and/or profit.
The projected timelines for rebidding the First Transit and Transdev contracts are as follows:
First Transit “Group 24” – expires August, 2019 – to be rebid in 2018
Transdev “Group 25” – expires January, 2020 – to be rebid in 2019
First Transit “Group 26” – expires January, 2021 – to be rebid in 2020
First Transit “Group 27” – expires May, 2022 – to be rebid in 2021
FINANCIAL IMPACT:
The total cost of the private contractor wage increases for 2018 is $4,998,797.00. It is
recommended that RTD transfer funds from the 2018 Board-appropriated reserve, to the above
referenced contracts, to cover the cost. The Board-appropriated reserve will be replenished in the
2018 Amended Budget. Funds for subsequent years will be included in the new 2019-2024 Midterm Financial Plan (previously known as the SBP) and in the requested budgets for those years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1) Increase contract authority for the following fixed-route contracts: First Transit “Group 24”
(contract #14-DH-003); Transdev “Group 25” (contract #14-DH-021); First Transit “Group 26”
(contract #15-DH-064); and First Transit “Group 27” (contract #16-DH-055); to cover increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases over the term of the contract.
 Group 24 – add up to $2,327,316.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH003 from $130,465,884.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on March 18, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $132,793,200.00.
 Group 25 – add up to $2,432,022.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #14-DH021 from $139,831,296.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 1, 2014, to a
revised contract authority of $142,263,318.00.
 Group 26 – add up to $2,786,932.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #15-DH064 from $70,188,522.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on July 7, 2015, to a
revised contract authority of $72,975,454.00.
 Group 27 – add up to$6,841,208.00 to increase the contract authority on contract #16-DH055 from $141,838,638.00, as approved by the Board of Directors on April 25, 2017, to a
revised contract authority of $148,679,846.00.
The total increase in contract authority is up to $14,387,479.00 over the next four (4) years while
these contracts are re-bid.
In addition, authorize budget transfers in a total amount not to exceed $4,998,797.00 from the
2018 Board-appropriated reserve to the following fixed-route service contracts to cover the increased
costs incurred due to proposed operator wage increases for 2018:
 Group 24 (contract #14-DH-003) - $1,508,841.00
 Group 25 (contract #14-DH-021) - $1,042,295.00
 Group 26 (contract #15-DH-064) - $878,518.00

Packet Pg. 5

1.B.1



Group 27 (contract #16-DH-055) - $1,569,143.00

2) Do not increase contract authority for cost adjustments to the fixed-route contracts or authorize
budget transfers to cover the increased costs associated with wage adjustments for private
contractor bus operators and related positions. This course of action is not recommended, as it
may prompt a mass exodus of employees from the private contractors and further increase our
collective inability to meet service requirements and the expectations of our customers.

What Caused the Problems?
u The OCC assumed the initial power problem on train 4045/46

was due to a train-related fault
u The Traction Power System (overhead catenary system) did

not experience any faults and indicated a normal state at the
OCC
u The overhead wires were intact and the traction power

system remained energized, however a piece of the
hardware assembly supporting the OCS had failed
u The “steady arm” component of the cantilever beam

supporting the OCS fractured
u The free swinging steady arm made contact with the passing

trains and broke the shear pins supporting the trains’
pantographs causing the trains to lose contact with the
overhead wire and lose power

u The criticism is well founded
u Communications directly with passengers on the failed

trains, with other passengers on the line, and with RTD
was disjointed, unreliable, and inaccurate at times
u Despite considerable efforts by DTO staff

uCommunication Systems were not used effectively

Why Did These Events Lead to a Major Disruption?
u During initial stages, the OCC failed to accurately

assess the cause and magnitude of the problem
u Attempts to couple the first disabled train were

complicated by extreme weather conditions and a steep
grade
u Severe weather affected decisions that may have led to

evacuating passengers on to the right-of-way
u Trains were stranded at least 4 miles from the closest

station
u Inexperience - DTO personnel have not encountered

this type of incident before

Lessons Learned for DTO Operations
u Treat all disabled trains between stations as a potential

emergency – understand the potential for a prolonged
event
u Operational tactics need review – focus on taking care

of the passengers first – moving the train is secondary
u Limit the time passengers are stranded before

evacuation is ordered. FRA and RTDC view evacuation
to the ground as a last option.
u Review SOPs and the EPREP

– plug gaps

u Training for operations personnel needs to be re-

examined especially procedures and preparation for
dealing with abnormal circumstances

Lessons Learned About DTO Communications
u OCC communication systems were not used effectively
u Customers received inconsistent and unreliable

information
u The OCC was slow to realize the magnitude of the

u Reliable descriptions of the service impacts were not

conveyed to RTD via the ReadyOps Notification system
u DTO did not supplement the OCC with additional

customer service staff until well into the emergency
u On-board and station announcements were not used

effectively

Re:

Service Availability - April 2018

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 98.7% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in April 2018. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons did increase from
181.61 hours in April 2017 to 1883.01 hours for the month of April 2018. The year to date
numbers show an increase as well from 1033.46 in April 2017 to 5,099.3 hours in 2018.
While RTD did provide in excess of 98.7% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 2707 shifts by operators working a 6th day (one of their schedule
days off). This represents approximately 21,656 hours of service being provided by a “6th
day” RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our
contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.
Contributing to our service challenges in April were multiple bus bridges and special
events. Staff continues to work with Human Resources and other departments to address
ways to improve recruitment and retention among bus operators.
