BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: March 4, 2014

Subject:

Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement
(IGA) with the West Colfax Business
Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD
Shelters & RTD Site Maintenance

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of
ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the
purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the
2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
BACKGROUND
The West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) has received a grant from Denver’s Office of
Economic Development. As a part of this grant the WC-BID is proposing to refurbish 7 older “Daytech”
passenger shelters, which currently belong to RTD, into an artistic, one-of-a-kind, functional artwork to
replace the older shelters along a portion of W. Colfax between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd. The WCBID has commissioned an artist to perform this refurbishment and will provide any and all special
maintenance needs for these shelters and other transit amenities (benches and trash receptacles). RTD’s
Facilities Maintenance currently maintains the existing shelters and provides site custodial services.
DISCUSSION
The WC-BID has requested that RTD transfer ownership of 7 of the older Daytech style shelters with
map cases & wood benches, and 2 existing trash receptacles to them for refurbishment, reinstallation
and future capital maintenance thereof. The WC-BID also has requested reimbursement from RTD for
the purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. Additionally, it is requested that RTD continue
to provide routine custodial maintenance at the proposed 7 locations, which would include sweeping,
trash removal, snow removal and periodic washing similar to that currently performed by RTD.
RTD currently has 5 shelters (of 3 different styles) at 7 of the proposed locations; a 6th shelter was
recently removed for redevelopment at the southeast corner of W. Colfax and Irving. All locations have
sufficient passenger boardings to warrant RTD shelters and site custodial services.
The proposed IGA includes provisions for constructing and maintaining transit improvements at the
following 7 locations along West Colfax; 1) Winona EB, (2) Raleigh WB, (3) Raleigh EB, (4) Meade EB,
(5) Knox Ct. EB, (6) Irving WB, and (7) Irving EB:. Key provisions of the IGA include the following:






Routine and Capital Maintenance Responsibilities
Transfer of shelters, benches, and trash receptacle ownership
Easement/License Agreements and/or ROW determinations and allowances
Resolving structural design issues
Bus Operations, Facility Maintenance, IT, Safety & Security concerns and/or needs

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

The proposed IGA includes provisions allowing RTD full and continued use of the transit improvements
by its patrons and maintenance personnel. The IGA also addresses an initial 5-year term with automatic
annual renewal provisions. Termination options are included if the WC-BID does not uphold the terms of
the IGA, which includes capital maintenance of the shelters.
An RTD Management Directive entitled “Special Design Requests for Bus Passenger Shelters” identifies a
Board Policy in regards to local governments requesting passenger shelters that differ from RTD’s
standard design. It states: “RTD agrees to share in the cost of installing another type of shelter in an
amount equal to the average cost of installing an RTD standard shelter, provided, that the local agency
agrees to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and agreements, to retain full ownership of such shelter,
to indemnify RTD from any and all damages that may arise out of public use of such shelter, and to
maintain such passenger shelter in good repair and in a clean and safe condition at all times.”
The Capital Programs Engineering staff believes this proposal is within the limits of this policy, with the
possible exception of the maintenance aspect. RTD will provide routine custodial maintenance of the
bus stops. WC-BID will provide any and all capital maintenance, which includes repairing and/or
replacing damage from ordinary wear and tear, vandalism, destruction, glass replacement and painting.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD would reimburse WC-BID for the cost of five new trash receptacles, which is estimated at $5,000.
Funding for this reimbursement is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.
The Daytech shelters to be transferred to the WC-BID are fully depreciated and have no book value.
Therefore, the donation would have no financial impact to RTD.
There would be no net impact to RTD’s shelter maintenance costs because RTD currently provides
custodial services at the seven sites, and would continue to do so under the IGA. In the long run, RTD
would save the cost of replacing the seven Daytech shelters, which is estimated at $87,000. The
timing of these savings is not known because RTD had not programmed replacement of these shelters in
2014.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business
Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2
trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash
receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local
government requests.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This would result in leaving
the local area bus stops in a poor condition that is unacceptable to the WC-BID. This could
potentially mean the loss of its grant funding. This would require that RTD continue its custodial and
capital maintenance of the 5 existing shelters. This could result in RTD needing to upgrade all the
RTD bus stops with new amenities and providing both custodial and capital maintenance at our sole
cost.
3. Delay acceptance of the Recommended Action and do not enter into an IGA. This could result in a

possible loss of the currently approved WC-BID grant, which needs to move forward with committed
action by the end of the 2014 2nd Qtr.
