#### 1. Authorization for Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the West Colfax Business Improvement District for the Transfer of RTD Shelters & RTD Site Maintenance

It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or designee to execute all documents necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) for the transfer of ownership of 7 older model “Daytech” shelters & 2 trash receptacles, and to reimburse WC-BID for the purchase and installation of 5 new trash receptacles. The cost of the trash receptacles is included in the 2014 Adopted Budget for local government requests.

Motion:              Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the March 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Cory Granrud, Park-n-Ride Design Manager, explained that the West Colfax Business Improvement District (WC-BID) approached RTD and requested that we transfer 7 of our older steel “Daytech” shelters for the WC-BID to refurbish into an artistic, one-of-a-kind functional shelter along West Colfax between Irving St. and Sheridan Blvd.  He stated that all of the proposed shelter locations meet RTD’s typical criteria for shelter installation and maintenance.  He said that as part of this agreement RTD would continue to provide routine, custodial maintenance at the locations.  Cory Granrud noted that all glass and structural components will be reviewed by RTD staff to ensure a safe environment for our patrons.

Director Anderson believes this is an excellent idea.  She sees business improvement districts (BIDs) as another partner for RTD rather than a private corporation.  She stated that BIDs are working to improve their neighborhood and make the bus stops a safer, nicer area for our passengers.  Director Anderson likes that RTD will continue custodial maintenance because she thinks that is important for our reputation.

Committee Chair James asked if short term capital costs and maintenance would be the same as in the past.  Henry Stopplecamp, Senior Manager of Engineering, explained that capital costs would not be the same as we will not have to replace the shelters.  He stated that WC-BID will refurbish, maintain, and eventually replace the shelters; this means that in the short and long term capital RTD will come out ahead.

Director Folska thinks this is a brilliant idea.  She stated that the snow removal at shelters is very important; the snow plows just pile it onto the sidewalk from the street so it makes it hard or any riders, especially those in wheelchairs, to get on the bus.  She said that she is glad RTD will still be responsible for snow removal.  Director Folska wonders if this model can be replicated in other communities.  Cory Granrud said that staff is always welcome to working with our communities but it is not something that RTD actively promotes.  Director Folska asked staff to consider promoting it sometime in the future.

Committee Chair James shared that in reviewing this action, he asked for further information about RTD’s policy in regards to bus stops.  He noted that RTD has a policy of installing and replacing shelters at locations where ridership is high enough.  He said that staff will be giving the Board an overview of those policies and highlighting possible partnership opportunities at a future meeting.

Director Bagley encouraged the other Directors to vote in favor of this recommendation.  He pointed out that this action has similarities to what was done in the Southeast corridor.  He said that RTD partnered with Denver South EDP, the Transportation Management Associates, and cities along the route in upgrading the stations.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

#### 1. TOD Update

Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of Transit Oriented Development (TOD), reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the March 4, 2014 Planning and Development Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Bagley said that as the Board may know, he and Director James have been very interested in TOD since they were elected to the Board.  He stated that TOD has really come a long way.  Director Bagley expressed his excitement about the progress of the pilot programs.  He believes that staff has done exemplary work.  Director Bagley noted that so much of TOD relies on local governments because of zoning, permits, etc.  He recognized all the work that had been done with DRCOG and cities such as Denver, Lakewood and Aurora for their stationary plans.  Director Bagley noted that TOD takes time and asked staff to keep up the good work.

Director Anderson echoed Director Bagley’s comments.  She shared that in the 30+ years she has been involved with the City of Arvada they have tried to find a way to make the Arvada TOD area into a nice place.  She noted that it was a very ugly area in the past but through everyone’s combined efforts this TOD project will enhance what Arvada had already done with Olde Town.

Director Deadwyler asked for the RTD definition of TOD.  She also asked for examples and tours of successful TOD locations within the District.  Bill Sirois noted that TOD is not one size fits all; however, there are four characteristics that are included in TODs: 1) Compact and Dense, 2) Walkable, 3) Mix of Uses (i.e. commercial, residential, retail), and 4) Transit as Central Focus.  He said that there are several places within the District that he would call Transit Adjacent Communities (TACs) where the community is near transit but it is not the central focus.  Bill Sirois stated that right now a fully built TOD is still under construction.  He shared that development really happens over a long period of time.

Committee Chair James noted that the Washington, D.C. transit system is a much more mature transit system that has had the opportunity for TODs.  He thinks the upcoming APTA Legislative trip will also be a good opportunity for the Directors to see some successful TODs.

Director Daly asked why there was a project closing delay with the Alameda Station Pilot.  He also wondered if this would affect the construction schedule.  Bill Sirois explained that this was RTD’s first foray with the developer securing financing.  He stated that there are challenges when working with lenders such as getting them to understand the project.  Bill Sirois said that it is taking longer than expected but the developer expects to be ready for closing by the end of March.  Kate Iverson, Manager of Transit Oriented Development, stated that the construction schedule is about 18 months after closing.

Director Folska thanked staff for their presentation.  She noted that it is not unusual for developers to have financing and funding delays.  She pointed out that this happened with Denver Union Station as well.  Director Folska requested that staff re-send the TOD Design Criteria to the Board that was sent several months before.

Chair Sisk asked who owned the property at 26th and Welton.  Bill Sirois stated that it is RTD owned property.  It was purchased in 1994 when the line was built.  He said that the community wanted substitute parking for street parking that was to be lost to the line; however, the lot has not been used for its intended purpose so RTD entered into an 8 year option with a developer who was looking to redevelop the Rossonian with the City of Denver.  He explained that this project has had some struggles over the years but now Civil Technology Inc. and Palisade Partners LLC applied for a Challenge Grant through the City and County of Denver.  He said that RTD chose to give them a small extension as they went through the Challenge Grant process.

Chair Sisk wondered if RTD was generally selling our properties during the TOD process and why.  Chair Sisk would like to see other opportunities for RTD to have a sustained financial plan outside of Sales and Use Tax and fare revenue.  He challenged staff to look at opportunities for RTD to retain the property to lease to developers.  Bill Sirois stated that is something staff supports and did try to pursue as part of the pilot program; however, staff saw a lot of pushback from the development community on that type of model.  Bill Sirois believes that there will be opportunities in the future and noted that RTD executed a long term lease at Denver Union Station.  He said that this is the first option staff pursues but wants to be open to other solutions if the Board decides to sell property to catalyze development.

Director Deadwyler noted that the citizens of Five Points have known about the sale of the 26th and Welton parking lot for quite some time.  She said that is one of the reasons the community is also concerned about the closing of the 29th Street Station which had additional parking across the street.  Director Deadwyler stated that the remaining parking available has fees and in an area with many low income people the fees are too high.  She asked staff to keep this in mind as they decide what to do with the 29th Street Station.  Bill Sirois said at this time staff wants to hold on to the property at the 29th Street Station to see how development germinates before taking action.

Committee Chair James commented that this is a good example of RTD being able to participate in stationary planning to benefit all parties as best they can.  He noted that last week the Central Corridor Extension Study was just launched with a public meeting that was very well attended.  He said there is a lot of interest in that area.

Director Folska asked if that was the study about what kind of transportation technology the community would like to see in their area.  Bill Sirois said the focus of the study is really about determining the operations of the central corridor.  He stated that while street cars have been raised as an issue that is not really the focus of the study.

Director Folska wondered if providing an extension for the option to purchase the lot at 26th and Welton required Board approval.  Bill Sirois explained that the extension was within the General Manager’s authority.

Committee Chair James agrees with Director Bagley that the TOD process is a good one.  He said that there is still a way to go before the Board will see a really good TOD but the Alameda Station is a great example of the progress of TOD; it could take decades but the step to build an apartment building is really a move in the right direction.

##### a. TOD Board Update 2-24-13

#### 2. CAC Update

Committee Chair James indicated that due to the meeting change, Hugh Wilson, FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, would provide the Board with an update that was originally scheduled for the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting.

Hugh Wilson shared that at the February meeting RTD staff reviewed the service changes that are associated with the Denver Union Station (DUS) Bus Concourse opening.  He said that Rob Rynerson, Senior Service Planner, taught them that it was much more complex than just moving buses from Market Street Station to DUS.  Hugh Wilson stated that the CAC also received a Northwest Area Mobility Study Update as well as a presentation from Kevin Flynn, Eagle Project Manager.

Hugh Wilson extended an invitation to the Board to attend the CAC Quarterly Meeting that will be in Arvada on March 19th.  He said the agenda will have an update from RTD staff on the Gold Line Construction as well as a presentation from Trammell Crow about the Olde Town Arvada TOD project.

Director Folska informed the Board that there is a wonderful program about what RTD is doing in Arvada on Channel 8; however, she noted that the Mayor keeps calling the Gold Line a light rail line.  She thinks it is very important for everyone to remind our communities of the difference between light and commuter rail.

Chair Sisk thanked Hugh Wilson and the other CAC members for the time and effort they put forward.  He shared that he had his two-on-one several week ago.  He thinks it is wonderful to see the energy and dedication that the members have.  Hugh Wilson stated that those meetings have been exceedingly helpful in establishing communication between the CAC and Directors.

### D. Other Matters

Director Bagley reminded the Board that General Manager Washington would be testifying to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Public-Private Partnership tomorrow, March 5, 2014.  He encouraged the other Directors to read the testimony General Manager Washington sent if they had not yet had a chance to do so.  Director Bagley stated that it provides a lot of in-depth information which is very valuable.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned the meeting at 6:49 p.m. to the Government Relations Committee.
