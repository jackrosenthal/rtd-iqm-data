## I. Chaired by Jeff Walker

Committee Chair Walker called the meeting to order at 3:30 p.m. Committee members in attendance:              Committee Chair Walker, Committee Vice-Chair Broom, Chair Tisdale, Directors Hoy (arrived late), Menten, and Mihalik

Committee members absent:              Director Deadwyler

Other Board members present:                             Directors Lubow and Folska

Others present:              General Manager Genova, Executive Manager Barbara McManus, Board Office Administrator John McKay

Committee Chair Walker introduced the committee members and the others in attendance.

Chair Tisdale said that the committee represented a significant part of the work of RTD. He said the committee’s biggest single function was the oversight of one key employee, the General Manager, and he added that the General Manager’s issues and successes are the Board’s issues and successes.

Committee Walker announced that the committee meeting was being videotaped. He stated that the day’s mission was narrow.

##### i. Committee Background

Committee Chair Walker briefly reviewed the history of the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee (GM Oversight). He said the legislature felt that RTD’s General Manager required more oversight, which lead to the creation of the committee to perform that duty.

Director Broom asked whether the committee reported to the legislature.

Committee Chair Walker responded that the committee did not report to the legislature out of obligation.

Chair Tisdale added that the committee was formed as a result of a state audit.

Director Folska, Ph.D., noted that RTD reported periodically to the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) and stated that RTD’s General Managers have given presentations to that committee.

Committee Chair Walker stated that his understanding was that RTD’s interaction with TLRC was to present information on the agency as a whole, rather than a report on the General Manager’s performance.

Director Folska, Ph.D., agreed that RTD’s involvement with TLRC may not be obligatory.

### B. Proposed 2018-2019 GM Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline

Committee Chair Walker noted the committee’s proposed timelines, as contained in documents in the committee member’s binders.

Director Hoy noted that he would not be able to attend the committee meeting scheduled for May 17.

Committee Chair Walker noted that the binders also included a timeline he and Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, had put together. He said the timeline denoted which person or group would be required to take action on certain dates. He stated that no Directors had commented on the revised version of the timeline that was distributed the previous week.

### C. Review Performance Evaluation Process & Mapping

Committee Chair Walker said that the committee was in the process of reviewing the General Manager’s goals for 2018, which was a process that was carried over from 2017. He said that Market Research Manager Dennis Yaklich, Ms. McManus, and he were working on a survey that would capture the evaluative criteria for the General Manager’s goals.

Ms. McManus noted that the draft survey was included under the eighth tab of the binder.

Committee Chair Walker said that the survey would be sent out to Directors soon and that every Director was expected to fill it out in order to provide guidance to the General Manager. He said the process would be repeated toward the end of the year, followed by an opportunity to discuss the General Manager’s performance for the entire year.

Ms. McManus reviewed the survey changes. She said Directors had commented that the previous year’s survey questions were not structured in a way that yielded effective results.

Committee Chair Walker added that the current year survey’s questions had been changed so as to directly correlate with the General Manager’s core goals.

Ms. McManus said that the General Manager’s tactical plan and the priorities identified at the joint Board/SLT retreat followed the same alignment. She said the survey was modeled to follow that same alignment, which would give Directors the opportunity to request specific information and materials to assist them in determining their individual assessment of the General Manager’s performance by the end of the year.

Director Broom noted that some Directors did not complete a survey in 2017.

Ms. McManus said she was aware of three Directors who did not complete their surveys.

Director Broom said there was not much point in Directors being on the committee if they did not fill out the survey.

Ms. McManus said that, of the three Directors who did not fill out a survey, only one was a member of GM Oversight.

Committee Chair Walker agreed with Director Broom and said he did not think people should be on the Board if they were not willing to fulfill all of the duties required of Directors. He said there would be opportunities in the survey responses to provide subjective assessments on areas in which the General Manager could improvement and in which he exceeded expectations. He said that the Directors all observed different things with respect to the General Manager’s performance, and he stated that certain Directors might not be in tune with certain aspects of the performance criteria.

Director Menten asked whether the responses of “not sure” or “needed information” were new additions to the survey.

Ms. McManus responded that the previous survey included a response that stated the Director did not have enough information to answer the question. She said the new survey would include responses that, when selected, would navigate to a separate page to elicit additional feedback. She reminded the committee that the surveys would be accompanied by a document from the General Manager listing his evaluative performance criteria, along with a self-assessment of his year-to-date accomplishments.

Director Menten said that in previous years the Directors did not see the interaction between the survey and the General Manager’s self-evaluation memo.

Committee Chair Walker added that the ability to expound on a given answer was included as an option for each survey question, rather than as a separate optional comments section at the end of the survey.

Ms. McManus reiterated that the survey was structured in the same format as the core and task goals in the General Manager’s performance evaluation. She said the format would allow Directors to gather information to formulate their responses before the survey was issued.

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that she would have no knowledge of certain actions taken by the General Manager. She said she would like better documentation of the General Manager’s actions in order to render an evaluation.

Committee Chair Walker responded that subjectivity existed in any evaluation.

Director Folska, Ph.D., answered that the General Manager’s voice was the only one at the table with respect to his self-evaluation. She said self-evaluations carry an inherent bias and noted the General Manager’s report did not include documentation from staff supporting or opposing his self-rating.

Director Menten asked for clarification on questions that were phrased as asking how the respondent anticipated the General Manager would perform on a given criterion as of the end-of-year evaluation.

Chair Tisdale clarified his interpretation of the survey question. He said the question was whether the respondent felt, based on the person’s knowledge at the time the survey was issued, that the General Manager would meet expectations by the end of the year for a given review criterion. He said the respondent would state whether they felt the General Manager would improve, stay the same, or get worse. He added that, while the General Manager may need to improve on a given area, based on current observations, the Director could still rate his performance as meeting expectations.

Director Menten said she would prefer to respond to questions based on her thoughts at the time the survey was issued.

Committee Chair Walker likened the questions to the prospective quarterly reports of a Fortune 500 company and said that respondents could state that they anticipated things to be on track at the end of the year based on current observations.

Director Folska, Ph.D., added that the Directors would know whether things were on schedule based on milestones.

Committee Chair Walker said that the retirements of senior staff or legislative action could also create additional challenges that would affect the responses.

Director Mihalik stated that he was hung up on the wording of the questions. He asked why the question was not phrased as an evaluation of the General Manager’s performance at the mid-year point, and he said he did not see the value in predicting how he would feel at the end of the year.

Ms. McManus said she might have misstated the intent of the question. She said she let the expert, Mr. Yaklich, figure out how to ask the question.

Committee Chair Walker said that, at his other job, he reported quarterly to his supervisor in order to track his goals for an end-of-year review. He said he interpreted the question as asking what the Director knew at the time the survey was released.

Director Mihalik said that the Directors responses would still answer that question. He said that responses to certain review criteria would indicate that the General Manager needed improvement at the mid-year point.

Chair Tisdale suggested that there might be questions contained in the survey to ascertain both current and future assessments of the General Manager’s performance, but he said he would review the draft survey thoroughly. He agreed with Director Menten’s statement that she wanted to assess the General Manager’s performance based on his then-current performance.

Director Menten reiterated that she did not want to rate the General Manager on his anticipated performance.

Committee Chair Walker suggested that the question regarding the agency’s fiscal sustainability was specifically worded to assess the General Manager’s anticipated performance at the end of the year.

Chair Tisdale suggested that the Directors should be asked both questions, for both current and anticipated performance.

Director Hoy asked whether the two surveys given during the calendar year would be identical.

Ms. McManus said the surveys would be worded identically, though she noted the first would measure the General Manager’s performance mid-year and the second would measure cumulative year-to-date performance.

Director Hoy said that the Directors’ predictions of future performance in the first survey were not as important as the actual results in the second survey. He said that Directors could not know at the mid-year point what they would think in the future.

Director Broom replied that the answers to the first survey would send a signal to the General Manager that the Directors anticipate a problem.

Director Hoy said that Director Broom hit the nail on the head. He said the point of the survey was not to find out what the Directors think at the time but rather to give the General Manager feedback on what he would need to do to meet expectations by the end of the year.

Committee Chair Walker asked whether Director Broom’s statement answered the Director’s questions or whether they still wanted a “how do you feel today” question.

Director Menten said she preferred to respond to the survey questions based on her feelings at the time of the survey.

Committee Chair Walker asked whether it would be helpful to Director Menten and others to add a question based on then-current performance.

Director Lubow said she felt that the survey was missing a component, one that would assess whether the Board and the General Manager felt things were working well within the agency. She said she did not know where such a question would fit within the goals. She said that, by not asking the question, the committee was not addressing the elephant in the room. She added that the problems with rail lines in 2017 were a concern.

Committee Chair Walker asked whether Director Lubow was asking for a general catch-all question.

Ms. McManus said she understood what Director Lubow was saying, but she stated that the committee only could evaluate the General Manager in 2018 on criteria approved by the committee in 2017. She said the questions should fit with the categories of his performance review.

Director Lubow said Director Menten and she had spoken with General Counsel Rolf Asphaug about changing review criteria. She said that the terms were not written in stone and that there were options available in the General Manager’s contract. She stated that it was essential to ask about the state of the agency

Director Folska, Ph.D., said that the challenge in evaluating the General Manager was that some things that were out of his control. She suggested that those elements that he could not control could be weighted differently in his review and asked whether the committee had contemplated doing so in the past.

Committee Chair Walker responded that no such weighting had been done in his time on the committee.

Ms. McManus said that something similar had been done in the past.

Director Folska, Ph.D., added that the things beyond the General Manager’s control could happen at the right time or the wrong time. She said certain external events were important but not as important as things going on within the district. She reiterated that parsing the General Manager’s direct and indirect control over certain elements was a better way to evaluate his performance.

Chair Tisdale stated that the Directors rule the forms, not the other way around. He said the Directors had the right to consider the questions and their responses, and he said that any survey that a monkey could score was not one that properly served the agency and the General Manager. He said the committee would review each question on the survey and encourage Directors to add narrative information to their answers. Regarding Director Lubow’s request to add a catch-all question about the state of RTD as a whole, Chair Tisdale said that, in a well-crafted survey, that question is itself answered by the sum of the responses to all other questions. He said each question at its heart was supposed to ask whether things were working, otherwise the questions should be revised. Regarding the desire to make changes to the criteria on which the General Manager is reviewed, Chair Tisdale noted that the committee would perform two functions in 2018: to assess the General Manager’s current-year performance based on parameters set in 2017 and to set the parameters for 2019. He said the parameters were not cast in stone, but he added that the committee formally decided in 2017 the review criteria that would be used in 2018, and he said the rules should not be changed in the middle of the game.

Director Broom stated that it would be inaccurate to say that the recapture of the $29 million credit risk premium from the refinancing of the Denver Union Station project was out of the General Manager’s hands. He stated that the General Manager’s efforts counted, adding that the General Manager could direct lobbyists’ actions.

Committee Chair Walker agreed with Director Broom. He said some results were outside of one’s control, but there were actions the person could take as well. He said the actions taken to achieve a goal should count.

Director Hoy asked about mechanics of filling out the survey. He said in previous years Directors were required to complete the survey within one sitting and that it was not possible to save one’s work. He asked whether that could be changed.

Ms. McManus said that she would check with Mr. Yaklich on that capability, but she said she believed that would be a possibility due to the fact that Directors would receive individual survey links rather than one link for the entire Board.

Director Menten asked whether the agency was required to pay for the use of the survey program it used.

Ms. McManus said that the agency used the base model of the program and would have to check on the payment structure.

Director Hoy suggested that the agency pay for the premium version if doing so would grant access to the features that would allow Directors to save their progress on the surveys.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that the committee’s conversation was useful and should be shared with full Board in order to receive richer responses to the survey questions.

Committee Chair Walker said the plan was to include the rest of the Board in the committee’s discussions. He said the committee served two functions, to create the metrics for performance for the following year and to evaluate the General Manager’s performance. He said the Board met in March to determine the agency’s strategic priorities for 2019. He said the difference between terms “task goals and core goals” and “strategic priorities” could be considered a matter of semantics, but he said there was more to it than that. He said the committee and the General Manager would formalize the goal-setting process on May 17th, the date on which the General Manager’s tasks and strategic priorities would be set. He said that was the date that the committee could interject and discuss how and whether to adjust the metrics.

Director Lubow said that Committee Chair Walker was referring to the 2019 priorities and that the task goals could only be changed at the time of a contract issuance or renewal.

Committee Chair Walker asked Director Lubow to clarify whether she was referring to the core goals.

Director Lubow said that was correct.

Committee Chair Walker said that Director Lubow’s understanding of the process was not incorrect, but he added that the core goals could be changed. He said the goals were tied to the performance measures in the General Manager’s contract.

Chair Tisdale said that he has begun the discussion of changing the nomenclature used to discuss the General Manager’s performance review process. He said that he drafted a glossary of terms, in which he would define “core goals” as being key employee competencies, whereas “task goals” would flow from and advance the strategic priorities selected by the Board. He said task goals relate to things that could change from year to year, while core goals would be things that were contractually established. He said Committee Chair Walker was correct that core goals would not change year over year because they were contractual. He said that the committee would regularly look at task goals year over year, because the agency’s priorities change.

Committee Chair Walker said he reviewed the General Manager’s core and task goals and job description. He said that there was some overlap between the core and task goals. He said the core goals could be changed and suggested that any alteration might simply require wordsmithing. He said he was not sure of elements could be changed entirely because they related to specific sections of the job description.

Director Lubow said it was her impression that the core goals could be changed. She said that in the past Directors had stated that the goals were set in stone, which she said was not accurate, and she indicated the evaluation process should be revisited. She said she was not sure of the origin of the rating tiers of “needs improvement”, “achieved goal” and “exceeds expectations”.

Ms. McManus said that the performance evaluation process was changed agency-wide in 2018, though she said the process was not far from where it was in years past. She said it was determined previously that the General Manager’s review would follow the same process as other employees’ reviews. She noted that seven years prior senior management established core goals for all agency employees to be evaluated against, and she added that previous members of GM Oversight wanted to ensure that the General Manager’s review process was the same as that for any other agency employee. She added that structure was what dictated that the core goals would not change.

Director Lubow said she was not comfortable with that restriction.

Ms. McManus said she was only giving the history of the process. She said it would be a different scenario if another category were only added to the General Manager’s core goals. She said people had made the statement that the core goals could not be changed based on how the process was set up and approved for the agency. She said she was unsure whether the same process was in place for previous General Managers Cal Marsella.

General Manager Genova stated he did not think there was a performance evaluation process for Mr. Marsella.

Ms. McManus said that, following the legislative audit, the performance evaluation structure was changed to be more inclusive to entire agency.

Director Lubow observed that the General Manager’s core goals were related to the General Manager’s specific duties, and she asked whether every employee’s core goals are related to their positions.

General Manager Genova said that was correct. He said that the core goals came about as a result of the legislative audit and were developed based on the job description of the General Manager. He said there was considerable effort to draft the goals and elicit the Board’s approval. He noted that the Board felt that the core goals should remain relatively consistent, whereas the task goals would reflect the changing priorities of the Board. He said the process was similar for other employees, where the task goals are developed between the manager and employee. He stated that the review pyramid contained in the binder influenced the priorities of the entire organization, meaning that the goals established in 2018 would flow down through the agency in the form of specific employee tasks.

Director Lubow whether a change in the General Manager’s performance evaluation rating methodology would result in a change for all employees.

General Manager Genova said the changes would not necessarily affect employees but said they could.

Ms. McManus added that, if the committee were to change what was expected of the General Manager, the changes could affect everyone down the chain.

Director Lubow said that it made sense to revisit the expectations periodically and not to be hamstrung.

General Manager Genova responded that minor revisions to his goals had been made over time. He cited the review element regarding his oversight and monitoring of Denver Transit Partners (DTP) covers monitoring DTP performance, which change he said was instituted the previous year.

Ms. McManus said that DTP monitoring was added as an element.

General Manager Genova said the change was made through GM Oversight. He clarified that he had never heard the committee contemplate going back to the General Manager’s contract to make changes to the core goals. He said the intent was never to make major changes to the core goals but rather to make tweaks as necessary over time. He said the committee felt it appropriate to add the DTP monitoring item because it was a change precipitated by changing times.

Committee Chair Walker added that the goal was not changed, only a review element under the goal.

Ms. McManus stated that the review elements could change every year. She noted that the percentage of key performance indicators necessary to achieve the goal was increased the previous year.

General Manager Genova said that the committee made a tweak the previous year to the core goal regarding the delivery of special services.

### E. Questions and Next Steps

Committee Chair Walker said that the General Manager would present his task goals to the committee at a future meeting. He said the committee would discuss whether the General Manager’s goals and the committees’ aligned and would modify elements accordingly.

Ms. McManus said that the committee developed each of the review elements under the core goal headings.

Committee Chair Walker noted that the committee’s proposed timeline of events was contained in the second tab of the binder. He said he took it that no changes were necessary because he heard no comments from the committee members.

Ms. McManus said the timeline was formulated based on what had happened the previous year. She said additional dates could be added or meeting times could be changed if necessary.

Chair Tisdale said he wanted to make sure that Director Lubow was comfortable with the scoring of the survey questions. He said the scoring methodology was set by the Board in 2010 but could be changed by a subsequent Board action. He added that the core goals remained generally consistent and the task goals were established collaboratively between the Board and the General Manager.

Committee Chair Walker explained that the General Manager would return to the committee with his tactical plans, which the committee would review and request ay necessary changes. He said that the General Manager had the opportunity to explain how and why those changes could be difficult to implement.

Ms. McManus stated that she had worked with Committee Chair Walker in setting an earlier than usual date for the first meeting of the GM Oversight committee, which would allow the committee to begin to think about the review process at the same time General Manager Genova presented his tactical plan at the April study session.

General Manager Genova added that he would receive feedback from the Board based upon his presentation that would take place later that day. He said he would return to the committee to propose his core and task goals for 2019.

Director Lubow said she was aware that Director Menten wanted the performance evaluation criteria to change, and she asked when that would happen.

Director Menten said the changes could be proposed on May 17th.

Committee Chair Walker said there was an opportunity to address potential changes earlier than that date as well.

Director Menten said she would try to distribute by the following week a modified version of one of the previous year’s review documents. She asked whether the committee agenda item regarding the approved policies had been acted upon.

Ms. McManus said that the policy documents were included in the packet for the committee’s review. She added that the materials were initially approved following the legislative audit and were included to familiarize the committee members with the historical governing documents.

Chair Tisdale added that those documents had previously been approved by the Board and, absent any changes, would govern the conduct of the committee going forward.

Director Menten asked whether the documents could be addressed, and she asked which state statutory provisions governed the General Manager’s review.

General Manager Genova stated that the impetus for the review came from a legislative audit rather than from a statutory mandate

Chair Tisdale said the committee had the opportunity to make sure that Directors’ questions and concerns were heard. He said that the issues could be put on the table, and the committee could determine whether the issues that were identified had been addressed or could be addressed in the future.

Director Mihalik said he hoped the Board would entertain the idea of separating the General Manager’s discretionary performance payout from his overall evaluation.

Ms. McManus said that was the plan for 2018.

Chair Tisdale said that the full Board would address the General Manager’s discretionary performance payout.

General Manager Genova when he would need to provide his proposed formalized goals in written form.

Ms. McManus said that the document would need to be delivered by Thursday, May 10th in order to be included in the packet for the May 17th meeting.

General Manager Genova pointed out that the performance survey would be distributed on June 4th, but he noted that his mid-year self-assessment document was not due until June 20th. He asked whether the Directors needed his self-assessment before they would be able to complete their surveys.

Ms. McManus said that the survey turnaround dates were loose but the General Manager’s due date for his document was not.

Committee Chair Walker said that GM Oversight was an important committee. He said he was nervous about being the chair of the committee but hoped that he would earn the committee members’ support. He said that he would be reaching out to committee members soon and that he was open for dialogue.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Walker adjourned the committee at 5:03 p.m.
