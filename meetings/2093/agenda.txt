RECOMMENDED ACTION
M.

U.S. 36 Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER)
Grant Contingent Commitment
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors offer a contingent fiscal commitment of $30 million to
leverage the $10 million awarded to the U.S. 36 Corridor project through the
“Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery” (TIGER) grant
program into a significant, $160 million project extending the current US 36 HOV
lanes west to Broomfield in a managed lane (BRT/HOV/HOT) configuration, based
on the following contingencies:
a.
b.
c.

The Eagle P3 project financial close matches or betters the
established budget as anticipated.
The balance of $130 million project funding is found and
committed to by the loan deadline.
In order to demonstrate local financial support to U.S. DOT and to
satisfy the 2.5% local match commitment for RTD FasTracks
corridors, local governments sign Intergovernmental Agreements
(IGAs) to commit $769,231 in local match via cash or in-kind cost
reductions to RTD’s share of the project.

Through preparation of the U.S. 36 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the
U.S. 36 communities, in concert with RTD and the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT), have been planning improvements to the U.S. 36 Corridor
for the last six years.
The planning efforts have culminated in the
recommendation of multi-modal improvements ready for implementation. Funding
for the $30 million is included in the FasTracks Financial Plan in the U.S. 36 BRT
– Phase 2 project and is programmed for expenditure in 2010 and 2011 derived
from current sales and use tax revenues, which meets the fiscal obligation
timeframe requirements for TIGER.
