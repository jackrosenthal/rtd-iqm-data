I.

Recommended Action
 Annual Review of RTD Investment Policy – Teresa Sedmak, Manager of Debt and Investments,
presented this action item. The District’s policy requires that it be reviewed annually. The three major
goals of the policy are Safety of Principal, Liquidity, and Yield. Ms. Sedmak gave a brief outline of the
policy and what it covers. At this time, staff is recommending one change to the policy brought about
by the recent volatility in the market and credit events.
It is recommended by the Financial/Administration Committee that the RTD Investment Policy
be modified to include the following language in Section 7 (Eligible Investments):
Should an owned security fall below minimum credit ratings required at time of
purchase, the Manager of Debt and Investments shall, as a prudent professional,
disclose and manage the risks associated with the security. It shall be the
responsibility of any outside Investment Advisor under contract with the District to
inform the Manager of Debt and Investments of any security that has fallen below the
aforementioned minimum standards at time of purchase.

Director Kemp spoke about the lack of options on this board report. He requested that
if there are not good alternatives for staff simply to state they do not have alternatives.
Director Ruchman wanted to see some change in the language regarding the last
sentence in the proposed change. Ms. Sedmak proposed different language, “Should
an owned security fall below minimum credit ratings at time of purchase the Manager
of Debt and Investments shall as a prudent professional, disclose and manage the risks
associated with the security whether it is managed internally or externally by an
investment advisor.”
Motion:

Director Ruchman made a motion to forward this item to
the November 18, 2008 Board Meeting Agenda with
revised language.

Second:

Director Kemp seconded the motion.

Discussion: Director Tayer asked about if there is a trigger for if something is losing value. Teresa
Sedmak said that she has no authority to sell something at a loss for the District; it would have to be
at Board direction.
Director Kemp asked about the sign off personnel and why Phil Washington is not a sign off person
before it goes to Cal Marsella since Mr. Washington is the head of the department.
Vote on
Motion:

The motion passed unanimously.

Director Pulliam left after the vote.

Holmes said the schedule for 2009 audits is being developed and he would like Board input on it.
Director Martinez was concerned about payments to subs on FasTracks contracts. Director Tayer
wanted to know about the staff position that was vacated when Barbara Willis retired. Scott Reed
mentioned that the job has been opened and applicants will begin testing November 17, 2008.

III. Annual Review – Interest Rate Swap Policy, annual Report to the Board – Interest Rate Swaps – Teresa
Sedmak gave this report. The Swap policy requires an annual report to the board. An interest rate
swap is a financial contract in which two parties agree to exchange a stream of cash flows according to
pre-arranged terms for a fixed period of time. Swaps may be utilized to produce interest savings, to limit
or hedge variable rate payments to alter the pattern of debt service payments, to lock in a current or
future fixed borrowing rate, to create additional variable rate exposure and/or to facilitate asset/liability
management.
Ms. Sedmak mentioned that there is no AIG exposure here. Currently the District is at a loss but there is
still 16 months until maturity.
Director Yamrick was concerned about disclosure. Cal Marsella clarified that the terms of any deal come
before the Board. Director Yamrick wanted the ethics policy to be included in the swap policy. Ms.
Sedmak offered to insert the ethics language from the investment policy into the swap policy and that
will require a Board action.
Motion:
Director Ruchman made a motion to
amend the swap policy to include
the ethics language from the
investment policy.
Second:
Director Martinez seconded the
motion.
Vote
On Motion: The motion passed unanimously.

November 18, 2008.

behind. Ron Dodsworth said that a lot of it has to do with bus replacement. Bus replacement was
delayed over a year because of debate by the Board. Staff expects the situation to improve with the
new buses in the fleet.
