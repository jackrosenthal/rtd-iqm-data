BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Public Opinion Polling Presentation

May 14, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
Discussion by the Board of Directors during its March 25, 2023, Retreat resulted in a policy goal to
shore up RTD’s financial position and outlook with a policy goal to create a long-term, sustainable, and
resilient funding model. During the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, Director Erik
Davidson and the Chief Financial Officer presented a Discussion Item regarding a Board revenue
diversification policy goal. To support the Board’s policy goal, on August 22, 2023, the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO) informed the Board via memorandum that a cross-matrix Revenue Diversification
Working Group (RDWG) was formed. Following a Discussion Item at the September 12, 2023, Finance
and Planning Committee meeting regarding the need to investigate revenue diversification and other
financial risk mitigation strategies, the RDWG began meeting in October 2023.
The RDWG is charged with making informed recommendations to the Board regarding opportunities for
revenue diversification, fiscal policy enhancements, and other financial measures to support the longterm fiscal sustainability of RTD in accordance with the Strategic Priority of Financial Success. This
includes an assessment of means to address possible financial impacts to RTD related to the Taxpayer’s
Bill of Rights (TABOR). One potential strategy to ensure the agency’s financial sustainability is a ballot
measure that would continue the authorization originally approved by voters in 1999 for RTD to retain
sales and use tax and other revenues (ballot measure) without imposing a new tax or increasing the tax
rate.
On September 26, 2023, the Board approved a summary scope of work and authorized the GM/CEO to
enter into a contract for consulting services for strategic advice, development of a survey instrument,
and public opinion polling related to revenue diversification and RTD finances to garner an understanding
of public opinion related to a potential ballot measure. RTD contracted with New Bridge Strategy.
DISCUSSION
During the Finance and Planning Committee meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 14, 2024,
representatives from New Bridge Strategy will present information and key findings from the public
polling, including core perceptions of RTD and reactions to a potential ballot measure. The information
being compiled by the RDWG and the polling results presented by New Bridge Strategy are exploratory,

Packet Pg. 4

and no decisions have been made on what, if any, funding avenues to pursue, including whether to
submit a ballot question to registered voters in a future election.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this Discussion Item.

Methodology

New Bridge Strategy conducted a survey among N=600 Colorado registered voters
from April 17-23, 2024.
Interviews were conducted via live telephone interviews (both cell phones and
landlines) and online. Interviews were distributed proportionally throughout the
District. Quotas were set for key demographic sub-groups, such as gender, age
and ethnicity.
The survey was also translated into Spanish by GP&P Communications Consulting
and respondents had the option of taking the survey in either English or Spanish.
The margin of error is +4.0% for the overall sample. The margin of error will vary
for sub-groups.

It’s critical that we continue to provide more transit options to relieve the pressure on our roads
and highways. Without mass transit options provided by RTD, our roads and highways will only
get more crowded and congested, impacting driving times for everyone in the area.

Providing stable, predictable funding for the District helps to ensure that transit will be available
for disabled individuals that may have no other means of getting to where they need to go.

RTD needs to be able to continue to provide local residents with choices in how they get to
school, work or where they need to go. Maintaining our transit options will help give people an

Every county in the Denver metro area received a grade of F for failing by the American Lung
Association for high ozone days. Poor air quality is associated with asthma, heart disease and
lung illnesses. By ensuring we continue to have a network of zero-emission transportation
options like light rail, we can help reduce air pollution in our communities and ultimately save
lives.

Maintaining what we have helps prevent larger repairs and expenses down the road. This

According to the Denver Regional Council of Governments, traffic deaths increased over 25

Citizens Advisory Committee Charter Adoption

May 23, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
May 29, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the attached Charter for the Citizens Advisory Committee
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is a creation of the RTD Board of Directors (Board) comprised of
17 members who are appointed by the Board and tasked with providing advice and serving as a liaison
to their communities. The CAC was created in April of 2004 by the Board with the passing of Resolution
No. 5, Series 2004. This was the same resolution that referred the FasTracks measure to the ballot for
voter consideration. As such, the initial focus of the CAC was to “monitor and provide input on the
improvements for each corridor contained in the [FasTracks] Plan.”
Subsequently, the Board passed a Recommended Action in December of 2005 to “formally establish the
“FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC)” with the mission to provide advice on the
implementation of the FasTracks Plan and promote public awareness and understanding of the project.
As the FasTracks buildout and planning phases progressed the CAC was expanded by the Board in
December of 2008 from an initial membership of 11 to a membership of 17. In January of 2016, with
the FasTracks planning phase winding down, the Board removed the phrase “FasTracks” from the name
of the committee and redefined the CAC’s role to provide the Board and RTD with general advice as
opposed to focusing solely on the FasTracks project.
Throughout its existence the CAC’s role has been defined by Recommended Actions adopted by the
Board as opposed to a centralized document, such as a charter. Last August, then CAC Co-Chairs Matt
Applebaum and John Fussa met with then Board Chair Lynn Guissinger, GM/CEO Debra Johnson, and
Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll to engage in a conversation around the role and purpose of
the CAC. That conversation produced a commitment on both sides to examine the role of the CAC and

Packet Pg. 57

16.B

to bring forward a proposal for the Board to review in 2024. Since that meeting Board Office Executive
Manager Jack Kroll researched the history of the CAC and crafted a draft charter based on the previous
Board action in 2016 regarding the CAC as well as ideas discussed amongst Board leadership, RTD
leadership, RTD staff, and CAC members. That draft charter was then discussed during a February 2024
meeting of CAC Co-Chairs John Fussa and Bryn Grynwald, RTD Board Chair Erik Davidson, GM/CEO
Debra Johnson, and Board Office Executive Manager Jack Kroll. The draft of charter has been
subsequently refined based on input from the aforementioned stakeholders and has been reviewed and
discussed by the CAC three times. Additionally, the Charter was presented to both the Executive
Committee and the full Board in April for additional input.
INFORMATION
The Executive Committee is asked to review the draft charter, offer any changes, and considering taking
an action to recommend to the full board the approval of the charter. The charter will then move forward
to the full Board as a recommended action.
The charter is built off several concepts contained in the 2016 Board action. Significant changes include:
•
•
•
•
•

Moving the CAC staff support from the Marketing and Communications team to the Board Office,
and specifically designating the Board Office Executive Manager as the main liaison with the CAC
Having the CAC review the Board’s work plans before completing its own work plan
Stating the CAC has the ability to develop operating guidelines subject to the approval of the
Board
Empowering the Chair of the Board to call for recruitment of new CAC members to fill vacancies
Requiring the Board and the CAC to revisit the charter in three years

It should be noted that the CAC will continue to receive significant support from the local affairs
consultant Catalyst, and the Board Office Executive Manger remains in close contact with Catalyst and
the CAC Co-Chairs regarding the planning and production of each CAC meeting.
This recommended action aligns with the Strategic Values of Customer Excellence and Community Value
by helping to create a sustainable and focused future for one of RTD’s best conduits for public input.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to adopting the CAC charter.

RTD Citizens Advisory Committee

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors change the
name of the RTD FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee to the RTD Citizens Advisory Committee and
revise the structure accordingly.
BACKGROUND
On April 22, 2004, the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 5, Series of 2004, directing, in
part, staff to create a FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC). On Dec.13, 2005, the RTD Board
of Directors approved the structure of the CAC including its mission and function, the duties and roles of
its members, the selection process for members, and organizational and meeting procedures for the
committee. On Dec. 16, 2008, the RTD Board of Directors increased the number of members of the
CAC from eleven to seventeen.
Since its creation in 2005, the mission of the CAC has been to review the progress of the FasTracks
Program in relation to established schedules, budget allocations, DBE goals and quality management
guidelines; to provide region-oriented advice to the Board of Directors on issues related to the
implementation of the FasTracks program; to review and provide comment on the DRCOG SB208
Annual Report; and to promote public awareness and understanding of the voter-approved FasTracks
program and its implementation.
As the District completes more elements of the FasTracks Program, opens five new projects in 2016,
and works to integrate new rail service into existing operations, the issues that input from the CAC
would be relevant and meaningful to the District are increasingly agency-wide.
Therefore, based on the CAC’s individual meetings with board members conducted earlier this year,
input from staff and extensive discussion by the committee, the members of the FasTracks Citizens
Advisory Committee recommend the Board revise the structure for the Citizens Advisory Committee as
follows:
Regional Transportation District
Citizens Advisory Committee
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is made up of residents
and business persons from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and
volunteer their time to advise the District on a range of issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Committee Role
The role of the Citizens Advisory Committee shall be to:
