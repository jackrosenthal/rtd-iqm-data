General Manager Washington shared that at the very last minute on Sunday, July 28,
2013, the Federal Railroad Administrator, Joseph Szabo, stopped through Denver on the
Amtrak and requested a tour of Denver Union Station (DUS). Dave Genova, Henry
Stopplecamp and Jeff Kay conducted the tour. He stated that DUS is a multimodal
operation center. DUS is not just a Federal Transit Administration involved project; the
Federal Railroad Administration has contributed about $150 million in the form of a
Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan. General Manager Washington
said that Administrator Szabo could not believe that we are at 50% completion for the
Eagle P3 project.
General Manager Washington informed the Board that RTD lost one of our drivers last
week who passed away suddenly. Al Shavers worked at East Metro. He shared that he
attended the funeral as did many people from the RTD family.

II.

Service Development Process
General Manager Washington explained that staff tries to present our service planning
process to the Board on an annual basis. It is very important for the Board to understand
how staff looks at our service standard criteria, the timing involved with suggesting or
recommending service adjustments and how staff goes about this based on the service
policy the Board adopted.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager, thanked the Board for letting staff have the
opportunity this evening to walk through the service development process. He hopes that
it is going to be a very worthwhile use of the Board’s time because he thinks it is one of
the critical elements of RTD’s core processes. Bruce Abel introduced Jeff Becker, Senior
Manager of Service Development, Steve Reilly, Manager of Marketing Services, and Jessie
Carter, Manager of Service Planning & Scheduling. He explained that staff wanted to have
a broader tag team approach to tonight’s presentation because what they are going to talk
about tonight involves many people and areas of RTD.
Bruce Abel explained that service development really is where we translate our mission
statement into action; it really helps provide the guidance for our resource allocation to

Packet Pg. 5

General Manager Washington began by thanking Chair Anderson for nominating him for
the APTA General Manager of the Year Award. He was unaware that he was nominated
but as he stated in his email to the Board, it is really a reflection of what the entire agency
does. He believes this is a testament to what the whole agency has done over the last
few years. General Manager Washington feels that this is really an opportunity for RTD to
really push a national transportation agenda and that is exactly what he plans to do.

6.A

meet the District’s mobility needs. Bruce Abel stated that staff cannot produce ridership;
what they can produce is service.

Director Folska asked why staff included Access-a-Ride in the Performance by Class of
Service chart since the service standards being evaluated are for fixed route service.
Bruce Abel explained the purpose is not necessarily to evaluate but to illustrate Access-aRide’s subsidy per boarding and boardings per vehicle hour. He stated this is good
information to have when staff begins resource allocations.
Bruce Daly asked staff for a further explanation of the runcut process. Bruce Abel
explained that the runcut process is where staff takes all of the pubic schedules and turns
them into pieces of work that an operate bids on. RTD must go through the process per
the terms of the collective bargaining agreement of having drivers select what piece of
work they are going to do for the next several months. He stated this is a very time
consuming processes as there are 1100 plus operators on the bus side and nearly 200
operators on the rail side that go through the process of actually selecting their work.
There are timelines associated with each of these milestones and a lot of technical work
that goes on to prepare the schedules.
General Manager Washington explained that staff gets sort of aggressive when they bring
to the Board the action to take the proposed service changes out to the public. General
Manager Washington stressed the fact that just a difference in a week or two in the
schedule can cause a ripple effect on the milestones outlined on page 20 of the
presentation. He noted that the Board action is just the second item; if that gets delayed
by a week or two it causes this ripple effect in the schedule that can impact the CBA
requirement for drivers to vote, etc.
Bruce Abel reiterated that one of the greatest challenges falls in the category of timelines.
He noted that staff has a variety of directives that impact the processes and planning. He
asked the Board to consider modifying the process that requires staff to bring a draft to
the Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting for approval and then to the
Board of Directors Meeting for approval before it even goes out for public comment. He
hopes there can be a process in which staff communicates with the Board at the same
time as the public so they have the opportunity to really work with everyone. Steve Reilly

Bruce Abel, Jessie Carter, and Steve Reilly reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with the
Board that is available in the July 30, 2013 Study Session Agenda Packet.
The key take-a-ways from this presentation included:
 How we develop the proposed service plan
 How we communicate the proposed service plan and;
 How we implement the service plan

6.A

stressed that the timeline for the final approval would remain unaffected; it would only be
the process on the front end that would change.

Director Deadwyler asked how effective staff believes the methods are for getting
information out to people. She wonders if our riders are getting information. She noted
that in her district, the current methodology is not effective. Bruce Abel replied that we all
acknowledge that the attendance at our public meetings is not what we might wish it to
be but it is not what it was in years gone by. He thinks we have seen a real change in the
way people communicate; the vast majority of our feedback now comes electronically.
The communication is designed to drive people to the website to see the specifics of the
service changes and to provide feedback to us through the website.
Jesse Carter expounded that we might have an average attendance of less than 20 people
per meeting but at the same time we are receiving hundreds of emails so there is quite a
bit of communication going on between constituency and staff.
Steve Reilly expressed we do a really good job of trying to mix the resources we have at
our disposal to get the word out in the best fashion. He stated that his team tries to be
highly visible and use the opportunities and space allocated to RTD in a very wise and
judicious manner. His team is trying to mix that up with the digital tools available to them
while leveraging and growing out digital databases. Steve Reilly explained that Marketing
tries to make the best choices possible for media placement; they look at geography,
timeline, circulation, overlap with other media, etc.
Director James stated that while he has not yet fully vetted the suggestion of expediting
the approval process his initial reaction is positive.
Director Lasater asked how long Bruce Abel has been the Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations. He wondered if in Bruce Abel’s time as AGM there had ever been a clash
between Board approval and the final product. Bruce Abel said he has been with RTD 13
years and had 35+ years in the industry. He stated that very rarely has there been a
change made during staff’s request to take the proposed changes out to public comment;
that is really the reason why staff is making the suggestion to eliminate a formal approval
prior to taking it out to the public for feedback, and allow for an active conversation with
staff and the Board regarding recommendations.
Director Lasater believes the expediency and ability to interact with the consumer is more
important than the Board having control of the process. He said the bottom line is that we

either need to make or save money from this District; he feels if we can get happy
customers we are going to be making money and subsidizing less and that is a good thing.

Director Rivera-Malpiede is pleased about RTD using Twitter, Facebook, and email to
communicate with our constituents; however, a great number of her constituents are
transit dependent and single linguistic with no access to computers. She asked what staff
has in their plans in terms of being able to communicate with these individuals. Bruce
Abel shared that staff is just getting ready to conduct some surveys on Limited English
Proficiency throughout our District so we can be more proactive in identifying what other
languages we need to be more communicative in. He said we do a fair amount of Spanish
outreach but are also aware of the fact that there are a number of other ethnic populations
other than Spanish.
Lisa Trujillo thanked Director Rivera-Malpiede for bringing the subject up. She stated that
public relations has been involved with the service change process by sending out news
releases but they need to take a more active role in the process. She said that her team
has been talking to Michael Washington regarding Title VI and Limited English Proficiency.
The plan is to implement a grassroots outreach and having more time in the process will
allow her team to do that.
Director Menten commented that she heard from many people who have signed up for
rider alerts who did not receive notification of the April service changes. She wonders if it
would be possible to use the data we have for EcoPass or FlexPass holders and do a
generic email blast to them. Director Menten also believes an ongoing system message on
the bus via overhead speaker system every few minutes that would state generic
information about upcoming service changes might be beneficial.
Scott Reed explained that the EcoPass, FlexPass, etc. lists are controlled by each employer
or program coordinator. He stated that the coordinators are responsible for
communicating that information to the riders on an individual basis. He said that RTD is
precluded from utilizing the individual contact information.
Scott Reed said that we already place Transflux Posters on all the vehicles as well as
brochures.
Director Jeff Walker stated that anything that helps extend the time that we are talking to
the public or gathering information from the public he supports.

Director Rivera-Malpiede said that as a TMA director for the past 12 years and going
through the service change process three times a year she has learned a lot. She is in
support of staff’s recommendation.

6.A

Director Hoy noted that since he has been on the Board there have been many service
adjustments, most of which have focused on reducing routes or eliminating routes. He
also commented that there have not been a lot of new routes even though our population
has grown. Director Hoy asked what sparks a new route.
Bruce Abel responded that we have been in an era of diminishing resources. He explained
that staff has not been in a position to come to the Board with recommendations for new
service. Bruce Abel shared that staff would typically like to have a 1% or 1.5% service
increase every year to maintain service levels as traffic grows, population grows, etc. He
stated that we have not had the opportunity to do that in a number of years. Jesse Carter
stated that the Origin and Destination Studies (O&D) is where most of our new routes
actually began. He said that service planning also looks at the development in the
municipal areas. General Manager Washington reiterated that as Jessie Carter stated,
staff is talking to cities, developers and do surveys; there are a lot of different things that
trigger a new route. He noted that as Bruce Abel discussed, maintenance is a big deal;
staff is continually looking to fix on-time performance while optimizing service. General
Manager Washington stated that in the 6 year strategic budget plan (SBP), there is new
service coming on-line in year 3 or 4 that will be triggered by talking to cities and
developers. Bruce Abel explained that O & D studies are done on a rotating basis; it is a
household based survey that asks people what are their public transit travel desires in
terms of origins, destinations and times of travel. He stated that these surveys are very
good predictor of successful service. General Manager Washington stated that Transit
Oriented Development will also have an impact on service.
Chair Anderson stated that she likes what staff is looking at in trying to engage the public
even more. She noted that with all due respect to Director Menten, she does not want a
recording on the bus or train playing over and over for her to listen to. Chair Anderson
feels that when she is on the bus she wants to hear what the next street is, read, and look
at her email. She thinks this is an invasion of space.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 30, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Steve Reilly elaborated that the service change period does not operate in a vacuum; the
marketing department meets with service planning continually to determine routes that
may need a boost. He explained that there is a route promotion program in which we will
send out printed literature every other month to routes that may have some challenges or
issues. This will be in the form of correspondence about their route with some sort of
incentive to try out the route. Steve Reilly stated that the goal is to get to a point where
individuals know what is going on with their route on an ongoing basis; then, hopefully
when it comes time for a service change, they will be prepared to look for their route
during the public comment period.

6.A

Director Daly asked why the Automatic Passenger Counters are not on every bus. Jeff
Becker explained that for a bus it costs about $12,000 to install and for rail vehicles it is
even higher. He stated that we are now installing them in combination with the CAD/AVL
equipment. About 25% of the busses are equipped now.
Director Folska shared that she had recently taken a ride on the new 16th street mall
shuttles. She thinks they are really nice but the air does not work, the windows do not
open, and the recordings are all wrong. Director Folska also shared that a blind woman
was trying to get on that shuttle the other day and her guide dog got stuck outside. The
people got the driver’s attention but that is not easy to do because you cannot
communicate directly with the driver. She noted that there is also a problem at Civic
Center. There are a few cut outs for busses, but if blind people are waiting where the bus
is supposed to pick them up and it stops someplace else they will miss the bus. She
knows one rider who has a sign she holds up so hopefully the driver will find her. Director
Folska stated that it is not a joke to be disabled and have the courage to use this system.
She feels we have a great system but the biggest problem that people with disabilities
have is those without disabilities are driving the system, making schedules, etc. She
believes if we start to consider people who are disabled or who cannot speak English as
the gold star standard to serve them first everything else will fall in line; we are designing
and building things for all of our customers and she thinks we need to think about our
most vulnerable customers first.
Director Tobiassen suggested that staff bring future proposed service changes such as
eliminating the approval process to go out for public hearings, to the Operations and
Customer Service Committee since it is a committee of the whole. This would give the
Board an opportunity to discuss the changes with staff prior to them being presented to
the public. He also noted that when there are changes and he receives emails, he
forwards these directly to the service changes email address; however, he does not
receive any acknowledgement of the email other than a form email. Jessie Carter
explained they do collect and tally but due to the volume of emails it would take a
dedicated resource to respond which his team does not have.

Director Bagley stated that anything we can do to enhance the process of the three
Runboard operations so we get more input from citizens and stakeholders he will support
as long as it is done in a context that works for the staff and the Board. He asked staff to
clarify the information on the slide about Service Standards by Class of Service. He asked
how the 10% and 25% minimums are calculated. Jeff Becker stated if you had 100 local
routes the bottom 10 performing routes would be the 10% minimum. Director Bagley
requested that for future presentations, this clarity is made.

6.A

Steve Reilly informed the Board that during service change periods there is a link on the
Board of Director’s page that allows constituents to email their Director about specific
service changes.
Director Solano stated that he believes the service planning team is well organized,
coordinated, etc. and he wants to accommodate them in any way the Board can; he
supports staff’s proposed changes for the service change process. He asked for
clarification as to how budgeting affects the communication process with constituents.
Bruce Abel stated that he was attempting to highlight that one of the real guiding forces in
our service is our financial capacity. He said that in relation to communication, staff is
really just hoping for more time so meaningful conversations can occur.
Director Sisk reiterated support for modifying the service change process. He also
appreciates the in-depth presentation from staff. He believes communication is vital. He
suggests working with municipalities and counties to send service change information to
residents. Director Sisk commented that there is also a certain responsibility on the part of
the consumer to come forward. Director Sisk asked how we determine service levels for
special services like BroncosRide, RockiesRide, etc. Bruce Abel explained that there are
service standard requirements for special services as well. Staff will look at costs,
revenues, subsidy per passenger, etc. He stated that over the years the RockiesRide has
diminished from serving every game to only weekend games.
Chair Anderson asked Board members to contact staff with any other questions. Director
Menten requested to be copied on all e-mails. Legal counsel Lien expressed this could be
interpreted as a meeting and recommended that Bruce Abel would compile all the
questions and provide the Board with responses.

III.

Other Matters
Director Walker shared that he and Director Hoy attended the APTA Transit Board Member
Conference in Austin. He stated that he had a chance to speak with many other Directors.
He really thinks we have a fantastic agency; he cannot say enough how blessed he is to
be part of RTD. He was selected as the Region V representative for APTA.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their presentation and the incredible work they do in
moving 325,000 people per day. She shared that she had a meeting with several of her
disabled constituents and RTD Staff for three hours trying to address the needs of these
individuals. She thought it was a wonderful meeting. She wonders how we can increase
real, effective communication with other constituents. She believes the public meetings
leave something to be desired. Director Lubow noted that in the Northwest Area Mobility
Study telephone town hall, people stated that they prefer email communication. She
wants to see a list that people can sign-up for to receive general RTD information.

6.A

Director Solano expressed concern about a Denver post article covering Kiewit-Turner. He
also asked for an update regarding a company that flooded near the Gold Line
construction. General Manager Washington stated that there will be no impact to RTD.
He said staff would provide an update on the flooding.
Director Deadwyler shared that APRI met with a group that has been meeting for over 22
years. It is a group of current and former gang members who put aside their difference
and have a yearly BBQ. She attended with Austin Jenkins (AGM – rail operations) and
Monica Caldwell (HR). Director Deadwyler said that the group appreciated RTD attending
so much they ask for us to come next year. She thanked Austin Jenkins and Monica
Caldwell for their attendance.
Director Lasater stated that he had the opportunity to meet with the Utah Transit
Authority in Salt Lake. He said that most people do not realize RTD’s Board is elected.
Director Lasater commented that they were very envious of RTD; however, UTA has
created a great rail system.
Chair Anderson congratulated Director Walker for his election as the Region V
Representative for APTA which covers a huge area. She also congratulated General
Manager Washington on his award as APTA Outstanding Public Transportation Manager
for 2013.

Director Hoy shared that he had the opportunity to speak to the group about FasTracks
and how the RTD Board interacts with management and staff. He said that other Board
members were surprised with the latitude the RTD Board gives to management. He agrees

things.

C. Updates

 MPACT64 Update - Mayor Jim Gunning and Herman Stockinger
Herman Stockinger, CDOT Director – Office of Policy and Intergovernmental
Relations, and the Honorable Mayor Jim Gunning reviewed a Power Point
presentation with the Board that is available in the August 6, 2013
Government Relations Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Lubow asked if the estimate of $200 million that transit would get
is an annual amount. Mayor Gunning stated that was correct. It will be
$200 million for 15 years.
Director Lubow commented that there has been talk about perhaps having
an education money request on a ballot. She wonders if MPACT64 worked
to determine who will go first. Mayor Gunning said that MPACT64 is
targeted for 2014 while education will be in 2013.
Director Lasater asked if there has been an analysis of the economic impact
in attracting or repelling new businesses coming to Colorado because of the
increased sales tax; he expressed that is an issue as it stands in most
municipal areas. Director Lasater is concerned it may be a detractor. Mayor
Gunning stated there was a lot of discussion about sales tax. He believes if
you speak with any mayor they will say transportation is an economic
development issue for their area; these are infrastructure benefits that will
have a return that far exceeds the sales tax.
Director Sisk thanked the Metro Mayor’s Caucus for advancing this funding
issue and resulting proposed sales tax increase. He believes it is critical for
every Board member to take the needed steps and lead in their area to

advance this. Director Sisk hopes that if there are Directors that do not
support the tax there can be a very enlightened discussion as to why they
do not support it. He believes this is an avenue to bridge the gap on
FasTracks.

Director Walker asked if there is an optimal percentage of lane expansion
that CDOT sees necessary to keep up with the growing population. Herman
Stockinger explained that it is really on a corridor by corridor basis. In some
cases the answer will be managed lanes while in some cases it might be
traffic management.
Chair Anderson thanked Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for all their
efforts. She shared that she has spent over 20 years dealing with
transportation in the state as well as this region. She believes it is a good
thing to involve the whole State; if the Denver area were to do this by
themselves it would devastate the rest of the State. Mayor Gunning
thanked Chair Anderson and the RTD Staff for their support.
Director Bagley thanked Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for
presenting to the board. Director Bagley noted that RTD is the largest
transit agency in the State of Colorado. He believes it would be very
productive for MPACT64 to have a resolution from the RTD Board to
support the effort. He is encouraging RTD to have a resolution prepared in
the following weeks as it would be really beneficial for the effort. Mayor
Gunning commented that support is great and they would welcome RTD’s
resolution. He feels there is a great deal of momentum now.
Director Deadwyler thanked everyone on the MPACT64 team for their effort
and Mayor Gunning and Herman Stockinger for their presentation. She
commented that the Board has been talking about going to the taxpayers to
ask for a .1% sales tax increase and decided to delay that. Director
Deadwyler is concerned about the split, which would give RTD less than
what we would have been asking for with the .1% increase. She wonders if
MPACT64 can look at the split and see if RTD could benefit from a little bit
more. Director Deadwyler does not want to see RTD’s projects delayed or
stopped because we are not receiving even close to the .1% we would have
been asking for. Mayor Gunning expressed one of the reasons they wanted
to do this presentation was to gather input.
Committee Chair Daly asked where the Governor stands on this issue.
Herman Stockinger explained that he and CDOT Director Hunt would not be
attending MPACT64 meetings if the Governor did not allow that to happen.
He wants them to continue the conversation, see what kind of momentum is
built, and go from there.

Packet Pg. 16

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Walker wonders if the surveys included any questions about the
public’s perception of land use and the role it plays in congestion. Mayor
Gunning stated that he could not answer that specific question. He would
need to speak with the survey’s sponsors. Mayor Gunning thinks the next
poll will be more broadly available to everyone.

6.B

 Local Update - Roger Sherman
Roger Sherman stated that much of his team’s time this summer has been
spent supporting the efforts of MPACT64. He said they will work closely
with RTD Staff and the Chair as this progresses.

Director Hoy noted that for the Westminster election Mary Lindsey was not
on the list and he though she had announced her candidacy. He wonders if
she announced but has not filed. Roger Sherman stated that he has placed
a call to verify the information for Westminster because he had noticed that
as well. He said there are several council people that have been talking
about running but have not filed.

 State Update - Jenifer Brandeberry
Jenifer Brandeberry and Julie McKenna thanked the Board for the extension
of their contract; they are very excited to be working with RTD and the
Board for another year.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that over the summer much of the conversation
has been centered around MPACT64. She said at the state level, the
Transportation Committee has been meeting and, based on last year’s
election, prioritized touring the various regions of the State to try to get new
members educated about the various statewide needs. Jenifer Brandeberry
shared that she and Julie McKenna, along with RTD Staff, will be meeting
shortly with the Transportation Committee to discuss RTD’s potential
legislative needs.
Jenifer Brandeberry stated that it is important to note the two recall
elections. She said that regardless of the outcome, just the fact that
Colorado has never had a recall election and now there are two is pretty
unreal. She believes it will change the tenor of the upcoming legislative
session. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that while the Democrats would still
be in control, if either legislator is recalled it will be by a much narrower
margin.
Director Folska said that it has been so fantastic to work with Jenifer
Brandeberry and Julie McKenna. She believes that because of their efforts it
was a very successful legislative session for RTD.
Director Bagley noted that there had been some discussion about having
tours of Denver Union Station and the West line during the legislative break.
He asked for an update. Jenifer Brandeberry explained that the Max Tyler,
Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, thought the priority for
the summer should be the statewide tours. She noted the DUS tours and

Packet Pg. 17

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Roger Sherman passed out a Metro-Denver Municipal Election Snapshot that
is available in the August 6, 2013 Government Relations Committee Agenda
Packet. He said that as he has mentioned, his team is monitoring the local
elections closely. Roger Sherman explained that we have not passed the
August deadline so they do not have a final snapshot but this is getting very
close.

6.B

tour of other RTD properties are dependent on what is open due to the
construction schedule; however, both chairs of the transportation
committees are very interested in working with RTD.
Director Lasater commented that there was just a tour of the East line. He
believes it was very informative and there was a lot to see. He suggests
that other Directors and our legislators, if interested, take the tour. He said
they would be quite amazed at what is in progress.

Committee Chair Daly asked when the recall election is being held. Jenifer
Brandeberry said September 10th, 2013.

 Federal Update - Sherry Ellebracht
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, said that as the Board is
probably aware, the Senate and House have gone on their summer break;
they will come back September 9th and have nine days of legislative work
before the new fiscal year begins on October 1st. She explained that neither
the House nor Senate passed their Transportation bills before the break so
they will have nine days to come up with a bill. She stated that the Senate
was at $54 billion and the House at $44 million so they are very far apart
($10 billion). Sherry Ellebracht reiterated that it is a very contentious
congress that has a very difficult time agreeing on anything; they have not
passed any of the appropriation bills. Sherry Ellebracht said that the House
Speaker has asked for a short term continuing resolution. She explained
that they will need to write it by September 30th or the Government will shut
down. Sherry Ellebracht believes they will come to an agreement for the
continuing resolution since no one wants the Government to shut down.
She thinks that if there is a continuing resolution that is long-term the FTA
will be given a pot of money to distribute at its discretion. She said that
Patton Boggs will work with the FTA if that happens to try to get RTD what
we were promised for Eagle P3. Patton Boggs has also been working with
the appropriators on the Hill. She shared that Congressman Perlmutter has
called Secretary Fox on our behalf and Patton Boggs is working with Senator
Bennett as well. She believes it always helps when you have our
Congressmen and Senators supporting RTD.
Sherry Ellebracht stated that there are a lot of major issues that need to be
addressed such as funding the Highway Users Tax Fund (HUTF), the debt
ceiling, etc.
Director Sisk requested that Patton Boggs reach out to Congressman
Gardner in the North Metro area. He asked for a report on Gardner’s
position if they have already reached out to him.

General Manager Washington stated that RTD would extend an invitation to
the 50% completion event to all State legislators. He also stated that we
are prepared to host any visit at any time in DUS, Eagle P3 or the East line
as long as they are dressed appropriately for the construction site.

B. CAC Update
David Lewis, Co-chair of the Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC), shared that the
Committee had their monthly work session; the focus of that session was to
debrief on the CAC Quarterly Meeting held in Westminster. He stated that the
Committee thought it was important to listen to the speakers in Westminster and
capture all the comments that were made. David Lewis said the CAC’s minutes
and comments had been sent to the Board in late July. He shared that the CAC
met with Austin Jenkins for an update on the West Line opening. They also met
with Pauletta Tonilas for a debriefing on the public opinion poll which was very
helpful.
Committee Chair Hoy thanked the CAC for coming to Westminster. He believes it
was a great learning experience for everyone. He applauded David Lewis and the
entire CAC for their efforts. He asked David Lewis to keep the Board updated on
the date and time for the next quarterly meeting. David Lewis said he would keep
the Board informed.

C. Recommended Actions

• Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying
properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail
Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under
state eminent domain law.
Motion:

Director Tobiassen made the motion to
move this item to the full Board at the
August 20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

6.C

Susan Altes, Manager of Real Property, explained that this is
the third time she has presented to the Board an acquisition
resolution and accompanying board action on the I-225
project. She stated that this project is a design-build project
so as the design moves further and further along, nearing 6080%, there are design changes that come about requiring
additional properties. She stressed to the Board that these are
very small property acquisitions.
Director Daly noted that some of the properties belong to
American Furniture Warehouse. He asked if they were
comfortable with RTD purchasing the property. Susan Altes
explained that property owners are not approached until staff
receives Board approval; however, she believes that property
owners have been involved with the public information
meeting process.
Director Bagley asked how RTD handles a situation in which
we would need to take 80% of a property and the remaining
20% remnant really becomes of no use to the property owner.
Susan Altes explained that RTD follows the Uniform Act so if
the remnant has no economic value RTD is required to make
an offer to the property owner for the remnant. She explained
that the economic value is determined during the appraisal
process; this means that a remnant could be uneconomic to
the property owner but not the market. Susan Altes stated
that this has happened before but RTD tries to resolve that
type of situation during the negotiation process. Director
Bagley asked the staff and Board to remain cognizant of the
fact that a property may have economic value, just not to the
current property owner.
Director Deadwyler indicated that she did have questions but
thought it most appropriate to meet with staff offline.

• Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride Facilities) by and between Regional
Transportation District and Stadium Management Company, LLC
Packet Pg. 22

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Discussion:

6.C

Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion
to move this item to the full Board at the
August 20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs,
explained that the environmental impact statement and
ridership modeling for the West Line identified the need for a
certain amount of parking around Sports Authority Field at
Mile High. He said that rather than spending a lot of money to
build our own parking staff had the strategy of working with
the Stadium District and Stadium Management Company
(SMC) to sublease existing parking.
Susan Altes, Manager of Real Property, explained that the
Stadium District currently leases the desired parking facilities
to SMC, so our sublease will be with SMC. The sublease will
be for 1,100 spaces in Lot M. Susan Altes stated that
currently these spaces are sold to season ticket holders so
there will be 15 days each year that the spaces are unavailable
to our patrons according to the Denver Broncos’ football
schedule. She said that SMC is also retaining rights to an
additional 15 days per year for concerts or special events that
they may use. The lease allows RTD to perform parking
management functions allowing us to implement parking
policies consistent with our other Park-n-Ride facilities as well
as keep all revenue generated. Susan Altes shared that there
are also times identified in the sublease agreement that the
number of parking spaces can be adjusted.
Director Folska inquired into the length of the sublease
agreement and the annual cost to RTD. Susan Altes stated
the sublease agreement is a 30 year term with provisions for
termination in 2016, 2023 and 2028. She explained that
Packet Pg. 23

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate
and execute all documents necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for
parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real
property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and
certain parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and
County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises will be
leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters.
Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for
FasTracks operations, and future year funding will be included in future year
FasTracks operating budgets.

6.C

there is no land available at this location for RTD to build
parking. The cost of the sublease agreement for 1,100 spaces
is $677,417 annually with an agreement that every 15th year
the property will be re-appraised by both parties and the cost
will be re-negotiated.

Chair Anderson asked who will be responsible for the
maintenance of the parking. Susan Altes said that because
RTD’s need is daily and very early in the morning, RTD will be
responsible.
Director Sisk asked if the Stadium Management Company was
a private LLC and how they came to own the property. Susan
Altes stated that SMC is the Denver Broncos Organization.
She explained that SMC does not own the property; the
Stadium District owns the property and has a lease with SMC.
Director Sisk asked if we knew what SMC pays to lease the
parking and if that was factored into the appraisal. Susan
Altes explained that the appraisal was just done on the cost to
lease the lot. She said staff would get Director Sisk
information on SMC’s costs.
Director Sisk expressed concern that tax payers funded the
stadium and parking lots and now we are using tax payer
funds to pay the Broncos for the right to use the lot.
Director Menten noted that paving the parking lot is also
included in RTD’s maintenance responsibility. She shared that
she stopped by the parking lot and it is in very bad condition.
She wonders if we have a rough idea what it will cost to get
the lot looking nice. Rick Clarke stated that staff has
budgeted $500K for paving.
Director Folska commented that $500K seems like a lot to
pave a parking lot. She asked if the Broncos would help with
the cost. Rick Clarke stated that unfortunately this cost is not
a lot of money. The amount does include some repairs to the
sprinkler system, conduits for parking management, etc. but it
is primarily repaving. He noted that as Director Menten said,
the parking lot is not in great shape. He said staff will put it
out to bid and hopefully get a lower price but they feel good
Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska asked if there was a provision in the sublease
agreement that would allow RTD to sublease the parking to a
developer of high density housing. Susan Altes said there was
not a provision for this in the sublease.

6.C

about the estimate. Susan Altes explained that the Broncos
feel the cost of paving has already been negotiated into the
sublease price.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.
Chair Anderson asked to explain her ‘No’ vote. She expressed concern that
we are subleasing a parking lot from the Broncos that we need to repair.
She understands that was included in the negotiations; however, she has
been involved in a few negotiations regarding parking lots and she would
hate for RTD to have buyer’s remorse. Chair Anderson expressed she may
change her vote at the Board meeting but needs to see more information
about how the re-paving was included in negotiations. She also expressed
concern about Director Sisk’s statement that taxpayers paid for the parking
lot and now we are paying the Broncos.
Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she was the ‘Mover’ for this action but
could decide to change her vote at the Board meeting. She explained that
this area was right in the middle of her District in a very low income area;
she does not want her constituents to think RTD is paying for a parking lot
we already own. She asked for further information as she is not feeling
settled about this action.
Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that the Metropolitan Football
Stadium District (Stadium District) is a political subdivision of the State of
Colorado that was created for the purpose of planning, acquiring land and
constructing a professional football stadium. The Stadium District is
authorized to levy and collect sales tax to fund their activities. She stated
that the Stadium District leases the parking and stadium to the Broncos; the
money the Stadium District receives from the Broncos will eventually pay off
the bonds and retire the tax. Marla Lien explained that there is nothing that
allows RTD to acquire parking, land, etc. from another state entity for free;
under eminent domain the Broncos are entitled to just compensations. She
stated that RTD has no ability short of legislative change or the Broncos
feeling very generous to force them to let us use the property for free.

D. Updates

• I-225 Rail Corridor Update
Chuck Culig, Project Manager, and Tina Jaquez, Public Information Manager,
reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with the Board that is available in the
August 6, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that she works very closely with people in
that corridor. She has heard nothing but rave reviews about the stakeholder
meetings and she congratulated the team on their success. Chuck Culig
stated that RTD’s partners at the City of Aurora have been instrumental in
the communications/meetings. He wanted to recognize them for the support
they have given RTD.
Director Solano complimented staff on the clear and concise update. He
expressed that it keeps him motivated when things are coming down the
pipeline for other areas.
Director Folska believes Tina Jaquez and Chuck Culig are really outstanding.
She applauded them and their team for the efforts and hard work. She
asked Tina Jaquez if she had any more information regarding the News 4
traffic shows. Tina Jaquez said that she does not have a lot to share about
the shows but staff definitely sees it as a goal to educate the City of Aurora
in how it will be to have trains running down the middle of the street.
Director Deadwyler stated that she wants to give Chuck Culig and Tina
Jaquez kudos for the work they have done on the I-225 project. She
expressed that there is a vast difference in what she deals with on the north
side versus the south side of her District. She applauded them for the work
they are doing in Aurora.

• Central Rail Extension Update
Andy Mutz, Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the
Board that is available in the August 6, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring
Committee Agenda Packet.
Director Walker commented that he remembers when the timing of the lights
in Denver was changed but he did not look at the reasons or goals. He
wonders if the goals have been met or problems eliminated with the change.
He also wonders if there is any chance Denver will change them to
something other than 90 seconds again. Any Mutz stated that the goal of
the study is to determine if we have missed something and if there is a way

Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their presentation. He thinks it is
great to see all the activity happening on the line.

6.C

Director Deadwyler asked the cost of the study. She also noted that if the
timing could go back to 75 seconds that would please a lot of people in the
outlying neighborhoods because they really want the 29th Avenue station reopened. Andy Mutz stated it is around $400K. He explained that with
regards to timing, it is ultimately up to the City and County of Denver and
they seem comfortable with 90 seconds. Director Deadwyler asked staff to
meet with the City of Denver to express to them that there are a lot of
people that would like to see the station at 29th Avenue returned. Rick
Clarke said that his team would get with her to discuss.

E. Other Matters
Director Daly shared that he and several other Board members went on a tour of
the East corridor with Kevin Flynn. He said it was a fabulous tour; the progress is
overwhelming. Director Daly believes he really gained a lot from the trip and thinks
his fellow Directors did as well.
Committee Chair Hoy agrees that everyone that went on the tour really enjoyed it.
He stated that it is great to see all the track laid down; it is really coming together.
Director Lubow shared with the Board that she has been dealing with the decision
by CDOT to change the minimum number of riders from two to three to warrant not
paying a toll in the HOV lane on the US36 BRT managed lanes. She stated that she
has been getting many irate emails and phone calls about this issue. Director
Lubow said that in researching the issue she learned that while there were many
reasons the decision was made, a large factor was that the private partner in this
project needs to get paid an appropriate amount of tolls per the contract. She
explained that the reason she was raising this issue is that she sees this as not the
only time there will be a problem that arises from our Public-Private Partnerships.
She mentions this so that the Board and staff can be sensitive of these
consequences and work to explain them to the constituents.
Director Deadwyler stated that she has been on the East line tour three times and it
is really fascinating. She encourages all the other Board members to take the tour.

to use the existing infrastructure that we are not seeing. In terms of the
timing, if Denver changed the timing back to 75 seconds that would solve
the Central Corridor problem. Rick Clarke stated that staff has not heard
that Denver plans to make any changes. He explained that 90 is pretty
standard; this was done because of overall traffic flows but also to help RTD
when we started running 4 car trains. Rick Clarke shared that staff did have
some concerns that was expressed to the City but this is the timing they
have chosen.

B. Recommended Actions

• Donation of Vintage Rail
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to
donate vintage rail, tie plates and wooden ties for restoration purposes to
Como Depot.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the
motion to move this item to
the full Board at the August
20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Lasater seconded
the motion.

Discussion:

Mitch Kuharski, Construction Project Manager, stated that
RTD was contacted in the summer of 2012 by Como Depot
regarding the abandoned rail historically called the Bucktail
right-of-way. The area in question, located at Evans and East
Asbury Drive, has vintage narrow-gage rail that RTD would
never utilize on our current alignment. A request for
expression of interest and information (REFII) was submitted
for advertisement in the Denver Post on May 25, 2013 and
was also sent to 15 prospective vendors. The advertisement
closed June 12, 2013. Como Depot and SRC Industries
responded. SRC Industries was deemed non responsive.

Director Lasater shared that he is very pro-history
preservation; however, the comment was made that we will
not use the rail. He noted during the East line tour the
Directors were informed that the rail line is being built from
recycled steel but he did not see a consideration for the
salvage rights. Mitch Kuharski explained that it would be cost
prohibitive. It is very labor intensive to remove spikes, pay
transportation fees to take them to Pueblo, etc.
Director Walker asked if this was the area between Evans and
Asbury just east of I-25. Mitch Kuharski replied it is just off of
I-25 and Evans.
Director Daly commented that he is amazed it is still there but
it is going to a good resting place in historic Como, Colorado.

Consent Agenda.

C. Updates

• Real Property and TOD White Paper Update
Bill Sirois, Senior Manager and Susan Altes, Manager reviewed a PowerPoint
presentation with the Board that is available in August 6, 2013 Planning and
Development Agenda Packet. Bill Sirois reminded the Board that they
presented an original white paper in May and had discussions about the
direction this outline would take. He commented that the goal is to come
back to the Board before end of year regarding the 4 dispositions outlined in
the presentation and next year with the policy changes and lesson learned.

Packet Pg. 31

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 6, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

The scope of work involves providing insurance for RTD,
obtaining permits from the City and County of Denver,
removing the vintage rail, tie plates, and wooden ties, and
landscaping impacted areas. RTD will not cover any of the
expenses.

6.D

Director Hoy stated that he is particularly interested in the 104th & Riverdale
property as the previous owner is always in contact with him. He owns the
adjacent property and has expressed interest in moving forward with RTD.
Director Hoy expressed thanks for all the work done by staff and their
unique thinking. He believes as we progress RTD will be stronger.
Director Folska asked if the property at 104th & Riverdale falls within the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). Susan answered that it does not.
Director Menten noted that the Fort Lupton property looks like it is within
District K, which is north of Baseline Road and to the east of US85. She
wonders if that is within the RTD District. Susan responded that neither one
of those properties are within the RTD District. Director Menten further
asked if the boxes within that red area on the map included in the Packet are
parcels. Susan responded that she doesn’t think those boxes have anything
to do with parcels.
Director Sisk asked if it would be possible to do a land lease on these excess
properties. Susan stated that it could be done. Director Sisk further
explained that this would be a way to capture value, maintain control over
the property, and have an income stream. General Manager Washington
reminded the Board when the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA)
was presented to them it talked about excess property. If we sell excess or
surplus property we would move those funds to the FISA. This was one of
the Risk Allocation Matrix (RAM)/FISA account items that was brought to
the Board. Staff is moving ahead aggressively with this process.
Committee Chair James expressed that he is pleased with the overall
process. He thinks it is very interesting to hear General Manager
Washington say that staff is moving forward aggressively as that is another
buzzword from the Fiscal Sustainability Task Force. Committee Chair James
likes the pilot idea as an opportunity to create lessons learned that can
enhance the process for the other portfolio properties; there are many other
properties we will need to acquire as we build the system so doing this

Director Bagley asked when the appraisals were done on the 4 pilot program
properties. Susan explained 3 of the appraisals were done within the last 60
days. The other one was done approximately 3 years ago as part of the
West corridor and will need to be updated for FTA purposes. Director
Bagley then asked if there were appraisals on the other 3 properties that
were done previously. Susan answered yes. Director Bagley questioned
how those appraisals compared today versus prior. Susan explained that
Smokey Hill (cut off at Havana & Alameda) and 104th & Riverdale show an
increase. However, Fort Lupton has no previous appraisal and she expects
Zuni will have no major difference in value.

project in a deliberate manner and learning is a great idea. Thank you very
much for your help.

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager and Genevieve Hutchison, Senior
Transportation Planner reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with the Board
that is available in the August 6, 2013 Planning and Development Agenda
Packet. Genevieve Hutchison emphasized that there are two different
projects being implemented on the East Colfax Corridor. One is led by the
City and County of Denver and one by RTD. One is a long-term study
looking out to 2025 and one is the next 2-3 years. One has money for
implementation and one does not. Director Bagley expressed his enthusiasm
to see both of these projects going on. Director Bagley asked for
information on the coordination between RTD and Denver. Genevieve
Hutchinson explained that both project management teams are coordinating
very closely with each other.
Director Folska asked if we are at capacity for ridership on the 15 and the
15L. Jeff Becker answered that we have been adding buses to both the 15
and the 15L to increase capacity and ridership. Director Folska further
asked how much more capacity is available on that route. Jeff Becker
explained that you can continue to add more buses but by improving the
performance of the buses you can acquire more capacity without adding
buses. Director Folska would like to learn more and will be setting up a
meeting for further discussion.
Director Tobiassen asked if the new articulated buses will be running on the
Colfax Corridor. Jeff Becker stated that they would run on the 15L.
Director Tobiassen further asked if the dwell times will be improved because
the buses are low floor buses. Jeff Becker explained that it does help the
dwell times by encouraging people to get off and on. Director Tobiassen
explained that the buses run so frequently they get stacked and there is
room for improvement. Jeff Becker elaborated that very frequent routes can
cause bunching of buses but streamlining priorities and investment is helping
lead the way to improvements.
Director Walker asked if the bicycle movement is part of the 15 and 15L
transit priority study. Jeff Becker replied no. Director Walker further asked
if bicyclists are being factored in the travel times. Jeff Becker responded
that any time there is mixed traffic it usually slows things down. He stated
that staff is looking at bypass lanes and things like that. Genevieve
Hutchinson elaborated that staff is not considering putting a bike lane on
Colfax.

Director Folska asked how many articulated buses have been purchased.
GM Washington explained they will bring that action to the Board next week
for approval to purchase nearly 100 over a 3 year period.

D. Other Matters

Director Menten asked what committee has the 16th Street Mall renovations,
specifically the pavers. GM Washington replied that usually falls under the Planning
and Development Committee. Director Menten stated that she would be preparing
some questions related to this for next month’s meeting.
Committee Chair James suggested watching the morning news August 7, 2013 for
the Garden Block on the 16th Street Mall sponsored by the Downtown Denver
Partnership using planters from the Denver Botanic Gardens.

C. Updates

 DTP and John Laing WIN Program Contribution
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede stated that RTD is privileged to have
Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and John Laing at the meeting to present a
WIN program contribution. She said that as many of the Board members
know, the WIN program has been recognized from the top down for being
such an innovative and amazing program that has empowered our
community members to actually get positions of depth.
General Manager Washington reiterated that the WIN program is a model for
the country in terms of investing in human capital. The program identifies,
assesses and trains people for work on our projects as well as other regional
projects. He said that all of our partners have been very active from the
beginning along with great support from Directors Rivera-Malpiede and
Deadwyler, the full Board and RTD Senior Leadership. General Manager
Washington stated that one of the things that are so important to RTD and
our partners is really having an impact within the community where we are
building. DTP and John Laing have stepped up in a huge way to support the
WIN efforts. He believes this program is a wonderful success and really
changing lives.

General Manager Washington acknowledged our WIN steering committee.
He thanked them for the work they do with the program.
Greg Amparano, DTP Executive Project Director, thanked the Board for the
opportunity to speak about such a wonderful project. He has always
believes that when WIN could provide a valuable service to contractors and
employers it would be a sustained success. He said that he is happy to
report that as far as DTP is concerned the WIN program has achieved that.
Greg Amparano shared that DTP has met their goal of 10% of direct field
hire personnel coming from WIN and they currently have 40 persons
employed on the Eagle P3 project. He stated that DTP is very proud to be
part of the founding membership of this groundbreaking program.

• Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program Update on Participation Statistics
Kenn Hardin shared that with the help of such great partners, the WIN
program now has nine active cohorts for a total of 193 participants. He
stated that does not include the many individuals who were not quite ready
for jobs so RTD sent them to training so they can return to us for
employment at a later time. Kenn Hardin reminded the Board that the WIN
program is not just about job placement but it is really a career development
program. This program trains people for careers in the transportation
industry.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede explained that Chair Anderson was out of
town so she was unable to attend the meeting; however, she asked
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede to extend her deepest appreciation to
everyone that supports this program. Chair Anderson is such an advocate
for the WIN program and is so excited about its success.
Director Deadwyler thanked Greg Amparano and David Rushton for their
continued support of the program. She knows it means a lot to the people
receiving training. Director Deadwyler also thanked Kenn Hardin and Martell
Dyles. She thinks they are doing a great job.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 13, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

David Rushton, Director of John Laing, thanked the Board for having him
here. He said that on behalf of John Laing and John Laing Charitable Trust
he is thrilled to be making a contribution to the WIN initiative. This is the
first check in a three year commitment that John Laing is making to support
the program. He believes that this is a program that is enabling people to
get back to work for the long term. David Rushton shared that it had been
interesting to speak with Kenn Hardin and see his absolute motivation and
desire to have the program succeed. David Rushton said that the Charitable
Trust also supports a program called the Princess Trust in the United
Kingdom which is very similar. The goal is to get young people who do not
have many opportunities trained and supported for the long term. He stated
that he is very happy to support a program like this in the United States.

Director Hoy stated that RTD really does many great things but this one is
almost over the top. He believes it is so important to give people a chance
in life and this program does just that. He stated that everyone involved
should pat themselves on the back. Director Hoy shared that this program
really touches him emotionally because it is such a great outreach. He does
wonder what type of person we are looking for or what characteristics make
someone a good candidate. Martell Dyles stated that there is an assessment
potential participants take so we can assess their interest and skills. He said
we tend to look for someone that already has our great wrok standards such
as being on-time, good communication skills, etc. Martell Dyles said it is
also a goal that the majority of people we place are within our target areas
along the corridors. Kenn Hardin reiterated that this program was truly
created for people who want to change their lives and enter into an
opportunity for a career pathway that would lead to something better. All of
the 40 participants on the Eagle P3 project are learning skills, developing
career pathways, and looking at what they will do next. Kenn Hardin said
that because of this, we are really looking for people who are ready to
change their lives for the better and are really committed to the program.
Director Folska stated that this is an outstanding program. She really likes
that we are working with people in the communities where the tracks are
being laid. She wonders if any of the participants are union employees.
Martell Dyles stated that there are participants that are union employees.
He explained that staff also utilizes the unions in the State and Metro region
as training partners, sources of employment, etc.
Director Solano asked if the WIN training is geared solely toward blue collar
work. Martell Dyles explained that we do work with participants in the
construction trade but we also do engineering training, Microsoft Office
Suite training, CAD software training, etc. Kenn Hardin stated that many of
our contracts have a percentage of participation within their professional
services contract. He also said that last year we started an internship
program with engineering students; they were having trouble getting jobs
right out of school so this program makes them very qualified for
employment through experience.
Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede shared that both she and her Committee
Co-chair, Director Deadwyler, have had the honor and privilege of working
with the WIN program from its inception. She stated that this was the brain
child of General Manager Washington. She believes this program is quite
innovative. She said that this could not have become a reality without our
partners. She thanked Greg Amparano because she believes he was really a
catalyst for the program. Committee Chair Rivera-Malpiede thinks this is the
most outstanding partnership in the country. She expressed what an honor

Director Deadwyler expressed concern that in her community there are
people who are just looking for a job. She had a different vision for the
program where we would help these individuals with the hope that if they
got hired they would chose to build their skills. She is worried that we are
only hiring field workers within the community that already have experience
versus the people that are just looking to get started in the industry. She
wants to make sure we are opening doors to more of the individuals that do
not yet have many skills. General Manager Washington explained that part
of the program is an assessment piece that assesses the participant’s
potential skills; even if they may not have the skills developed already or be
highly trained, the goal of the program is to work with them so they are
ready for a job.
Kenn Hardin introduced two WIN participants, Azim Adams and Sheila
Mungai, who are both working on the Eagle P3 project. He asked if they
would like to share their experiences. Azim Adams stated that he was
referred to the program in January of 2011 and was hired by June of 2012.
He shared that construction has been a whole new experience for him. He
feels everything has been working out really well for him and he is honored
to be part of the program. Sheila Mungai shared that she already had the
administrative skills but this was an opportunity for her to move into a new
direction; through the program she has had the opportunity to become an
auditor and she really appreciates the opportunity.

B. Recommended Actions

• Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
enter into a contract for the provision of Access-a-Ride Call Center services
with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years, with two one-year
options for a total 5-year amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal
represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in
response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-026, to provide “Access-aRide Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled
to be effective October 1, 2013.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion
to move this item to the full Board at the
August 20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director James seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel stated that as was mentioned in the packet, the
Access-a-Ride program currently involves several contracted
entities. He said that this action is to re-procure the services
of the call center. Bruce Abel explained that we issued a
Request for Proposal in the spring outlining the services the

Director Folska asked who was responsible for doing the
customer service training for First Transit. Larry Buter
explained that the process is for First Transit to hire a training
manager that is responsible for all training activities. Each
employee undergoes core training that is one week in the
classroom and one week behind the computer. He said that
RTD monitors the classroom activities and listens to calls to
ensure they are adhering to policy and providing excellent
customer service.
Director Solano asked what prompted us to look for a new call
center. He wondered if the current call center was not
performing as well as we would like. Bruce Abel said that the
expiration of our existing contract is the reason we are looking
for a new contractor; it did not have anything to do with
performance. He explained that we do monitor hold times,
transaction times and a variety of other call center functions
on an ongoing basis.
Committee Chair Tobiassen noted that since Access-a-Ride
serves the disabled community it would be in everyone’s
interest to encourage First Transit to hire people with
disabilities. He believes this is a great opportunity to help the
disabled community and get them involved in RTD and
Access-a-Ride. Bruce Abel stated that First Transit has

that were evaluated by the evaluation committee. The
recommendation is to award the contract to First Transit, the
incumbent contractor.

• Award Contract to Supply 52 – 60’ Low-Floor Articulated Buses

Motion:

Director Folska made the motion to move
this item to the Full board at the August
20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Rivera-Malpiede seconded the
motion.

Discussion:

Dean Shaklee stated that this recommendation is to go out to
purchase 52 articulated buses from New Flyer of America.
These will replace the 9100 Series NABI articulated buses that
are 13 years old. He explained that they have exceeded the
FTA useful life of 12 years and have on average 380K miles.
Dean Shaklee said that we are also experiencing an excessive
amount of rust and coercion on the structure of the buses.
Bruce Abel said that we did issue a Request for Proposal in
multiple configurations to get pricing varying technologies
including clean diesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), hybrid
and electric. He said that staff wanted factual information to
engage in lifecycle costing for the various propulsion systems
that are in the market today. He stated that based on the
evaluation committee’s scoring, staff is recommending an
award to New Flyer for clean diesel.
Director Hoy commented that we have the NABI buses now
and New Flyer is the recommended choice this time. He noted
that the pricing for these two companies was very similar so
he wondered if there was some other factors that made New
Flyer the recommendation. Dean Shaklee explained that the
evaluation committee reviews 4 areas; New Flyer had a score
of 88 out of 100 while NAVI had a 77. He said an important
factor in consideration was delivery schedule since this
purchase includes the buses for the Downtown Denver
Circulator.

It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to award a contract to New Flyer of America Inc. for the purchase of 52 –
60’ low-floor articulated buses and associated spare components in the
amount not to exceed $34,636,614, with an option to purchase up to 140
additional articulated buses over a five year period.

6.F

Director Lubow thanked staff for the comparison with the
different technology options; however, she said it seems like
the cleaner technologies cost more. She wonders when clean
air trumps economics. Dean Shaklee said that the clean diesel
and CNG emissions are almost equal; however the
infrastructure needed for CNG would be very expensive.
Bruce Abel explained that staff is always engaged in balancing
between cost and benefits. He said that we do have a fleet of
9 hybrid buses so we could evaluate the technology. He
explained that despite the improvement in the miles per gallon
the cost delta was a 20 to 30 year break even for no
meaningful improvement in the air pollution. Bruce Abel
stated that staff does see the industry moving toward electric
and that will probably be the technology that replaces these
buses when the time comes.
Director Solano asked if these buses would be able to burn
bio-diesel. Dean Shaklee stated that the engines are certified
for bio-diesels.
Director Daly asked for an explanation of the effect of the
altitude on CNG engines. Dean Shaklee explained that the
engines run hotter so they will not last as long and they also
have less power. Additionally, the quality of gas in Denver is
not the same as it is at sea level.
Committee Chair Tobiassen asked for the advantages and
disadvantages of going with low floor buses. Bruce Abel
explained that the advantage is ease of boarding while the
disadvantage is that we do lose 4 seats. Dead Shaklee stated
that the buses also have a wheelchair ramp instead of a lift.
He believes these are superior buses for the passengers.
Director Tobiassen asked if there were any stop modification
that needed to be done because of the ramp. Dean Shaklee
stated that there are no necessary changes.

Director Daly thanked staff for a very good technical
explanation on the fuel system we will be using. He said
many people are recommending CNG or electric but the
explanation of why we are going with clean diesel is excellent.
He asked who the parent company of New Flyer is. Dean
Shaklee stated that New Flyer is actually the largest bus
manufacturer in the United States. They started in Canada
and moved into Minnesota.

• Award Contract to Supply 103 Cutaway Buses for access-a-Ride Service
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his
designee, to award a contract to Supreme Bus for the purchase of up to
103 new cutaway buses for the access-a-Ride service in the amount not
to exceed $5,228,589, with an option to purchase up to 350 additional
cutaway buses over a five year period.
Motion:

Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion
to move this item to the full Board at the
August 20, 2013 Board meeting.
Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel explained that this action is to move forward with
the replacement of our access-a-Ride vehicles due to the fact
that they have reached or exceeded the end of their useful life.
He said that we extended an Invitation for Bid (IFB) on June 4,
2013 and four companies submitted bids. Bruce Abel
explained that in an IFB if the companies meet our
specifications we go with the low bid. He stated that initially
we purchased 12 smaller vehicles in an attempt to improve
our gas mileage and determine if the fleet measured up to all
the sales promises. Bruce Abel said that we did not have a
positive experience so we are not moving forward with the
option to purchase those additional vehicles. This reprocurement is an effort to better match our service needs.

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Aug 13, 2013 7:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if these buses will have the
new CAD/AVL system. Dean Shaklee stated that they will
have all the bells and whistles; the buses come pre-wired for
CAD/AVL. He said that we will install the fare box, Smart
Card, etc.

6.F

Director Lubow asked why these buses have a useful life of 5
years but our larger buses are 12-13 years. Dean Shaklee
explained that these vehicles are built on Fort E-350 chassis
and are not designed to last as long.

Director Folska asked why we are not purchasing electric or
hybrid vehicles in this case. She believes there is a company
in Colorado that manufactures them. Dean Shaklee stated he
is not aware of Ford making a hybrid E-350. Bruce Abel
explained that there is a manufacturer making vehicles with
alternative power sources but they have been in and out of
business for the last several years; staff does not have
confidence that they will be a long term viable option.
Director Rivera-Malpiede said that she really appreciates the
information about DBE participation and that it did require an
FTA certificate.
Director Deadwyler expressed concern over the securement
system in the vehicles. She noted that many people are
moving to scooters rather than wheelchairs and she has heard
there is a problem securing the scooters in our current
vehicles. Bruce Abel said the IFB was specified with the most
current securement system on the market. Lou Ha confirmed
that these new vehicles will have the capability to secure
scooters as well.
Director Solano asked if we have considered if it is more cost
effective to lease these types of fleets given that the service
life is shorter. Bruce Abel said that staff has done some cost
analysis to determine if it made sense to buy vehicles with
longer life but there was not a benefit; he said he is not aware
of any analysis done of the benefits of buying versus leasing.
Director Solano believes this is something we should consider.
Director Folska asked whether we were purchasing the
vehicles, who will actually be driving them. She wonders if
we lease the vehicles to our access-a-Ride providers. Director
Folska also requested figures for what we pay each provider to
operate the vehicles. Bruce Abel stated that we supply the
vehicles to our access-a-Ride service providers as part of our
management contract with them. General Manager

Washington said the cost varies by provider but staff would
get the numbers.

Committee Chair Tobiassen asked if the vehicles are wired for
CAD/AVL. He also stated that he is very impressed with the
$50K price tag. Bruce Abel explained that we have a different
system on the Paratransit side but they will have that system.

C. Updates

• Access-a-Ride Driver Training Review
Larry Buter said that he will be covering two items, the audit of our
Paratransit operator training and Access-a-Cab service.
Larry Buter stated that information regarding the audit was included in the
August 13, 2013 Operation and Customer Service Committee Agenda
Packet. He explained that training consists of core training and PASS
(Passenger Assistance Training) training. He informed the Board that during
the audit it was confirmed that each contractor is training the operators to
proficiency. He shared that is was recommended that RTD evaluate the
pros and cons of 1) contracting out the PASS portion of the training to one
entity or 2) bringing the PASS portion of training in house to RTD. Larry
Buter said that as soon as the results were shared with the contractors they
did take immediate steps to improve any areas identified.
Director Folska stressed that the work staff is doing is outstanding. She
believes that while there is always room for improvement she has been
really impressed with the dedication of the RTD staff. She noted that there
are really two parts to training; there is the training for our operators, call

Director Menten wonders if we have ever considered
purchasing F-350s. She asked if we run into issues with snow
or burning up transmissions because the E-350 is two-wheel
drive. Dean Shaklee stated that we do not have issues with
the E-350s.

center representatives, etc. and then there is the training for our customers.
She thinks if our goal is to move people from Paratransit to fixed routes we
need to get the customers more involved in transit travel training. Director
Folska recognizes that we have hired Via Mobility to do that but we need to
do a better job of disseminating the information. Larry Buter stated that Via
now employs someone that spends 20 hours per week at Easter Seals to
invite Access-a-Ride applicants to sit with them and learn about the travel
training program. He said that you would be amazed at how many people
refuse the offer. He stated that we are trying to reach out to the public by
phone and mail; additionally, Via is working on a video of success stories
that organizations can use. Director Folska believes our efforts thus far are
completely inadequate. Bruce Abel said that any suggestions to improve our
outreach efforts would be appreciated.
Director Lubow expressed concern because there seemed to be one provider
that had fairly serious weaknesses identified in the audit, such as two
students falling asleep during training and the trainer being not a good
communicator. Bruce Abel said that what staff was trying to communicate
to the Board was that all programs were successful but to varying degrees.
He said it was identified that much of the success of the training was based
on the success of the teacher. That is why there was a recommendation to
have a central location so there are not varying degrees of teacher
competency. He said the course of action that was deemed most
appropriate is that RTD will increase our monitoring efforts.
Director Menten asked for the cost of the audit and if it was complete.
Larry Buter said that the cost was $13,000; KFH had two individuals that
sat through each carriers training.
Director Deadwyler asked what type of training is required for drivers on
RTD’s policies and procedures, specifically when it comes to free ride
passes. She said she has had a number of complaints when the drivers have
refused the passes even when it is clearly written on the ticket that they are
valid for Access-a-Ride service. Larry Buter stated that operators are trained
in all passes that are accepted. He said that this does come up periodically
and when that happens he works with the contractors to notify all
operators. Larry Buter also stated that every operator has on their person a
driver alert book that has a section on the passes that are accepted; each
driver can also contact dispatch if they are unsure.
Committee Chair Tobiassen said that he would like to commend the Accessa-Ride staff. He shared that when he first got on the Board, the Access-aRide complaints were very high. He believes that staff has really turned it
around; he hardly ever gets complaints and the few he receives are
responded to very quickly.

Access-a-Cab Update
Larry Buter said that several Directors expressed concerns about the phone
calls they were receiving from constituents that indicated the cab simply just
did not show up. He stated that staff is trying to mitigate these issues;
whenever they are made aware of a cab not showing up they take
immediate steps to contact the cab company to find out what went wrong.
Larry Buter informed the Board that the cab companies are not mandated to
provide accessible transportation; there are some accessible vehicles but
when a sufficient number of people call it becomes difficult to schedule.
Larry Buter explained that starting September 1st, people with electronic
wheelchairs will be able to schedule their trip up to 24 hours in advance. He
said this does require manual intervention so they want to start with a small
group. Once the process is smooth and effortless it will be opened up to
everyone. Larry Buter stated that this will not completely eliminate the
problem but it will definitely improve the service.
Director Deadwyler thanked Larry Buter for the update. She is one of those
individuals that experiences the no shows or lateness of a cab after you
have called the company 10 times. She has been told that the private
contractors that operate the accessible vehicles have a choice of whether or
not to pick up a passenger with a wheelchair.

Director Folska believes that Access-a-Cab is a way to help people use fixed
routes and addresses the last mile program. If people have something they
can count on then it encourages them to have a reliable job. She thinks
staff is being innovative and cutting edge and really appreciates that.

• Radio and Computer Aided Dispatch and Automatic Vehicle Location
(CAD/AVL) Project Status Update
Eric Farrington stated that he included more detail in the report that is
available in the August 13, 2013 Operations and Customer Service
Committee Agenda Packet based on questions from last month. He said
that installations will be complete on all fixed route in service buses this
week and next week installation will be complete on buses that are out-ofservice for repairs.
Director Deadwyler noted that there was a yellow dot in the report. She
wants to make sure it is working properly since Eric Farrington informed the
Board at the last meeting that we needed to bring someone in to work on
the system. Eric Farrington stated that the yellow dot is in the report
because staff is not where they expected to be as it relates to testing;
however, the system itself is working quite well.

• Smart Card Project Status Update
Judy McMurphy introduced Raja Viswanathan. He is the new project
manager from Xerox. Judy McMurphy stated that he has been a huge asset
to the team and RTD is very lucky to have him.

Judy McMurphy said that staff has just completed training with the
handheld smart media readers. She explained that her team is working with
the marketing department and fare inspectors to begin a campaign in
educating our general public about tapping procedures, etc. so they
understand the expectations.
Judy McMurphy informed the Board that Xerox is working with us to replace
the stanchions on the buses. This is what holds the card readers.
Judy McMurphy explained that there was a glitch in the Retail Point of Sales
(RPOS) testing due to a delay in delivery of the software. She stated that
the time originally planned for testing was used to do a demonstration of the
device. Judy McMurphy said she got some great feedback and questions
that will be incorporated into future training.
Director Daly asked why the stanchions needed to be replaced. Judy
McMurphy said that the way the weld was completed originally had single
welds at three different points on the base; it was determined that if the
weld was completed all the way around it will stand up to vibrations and use
better.
Director Menten noted that the report mentioned an SMT meeting with the
Denver Mayor’s Office and the City and County of Denver. She expressed
concern in working with these organizations to use one card for rec centers,
libraries, etc. while we have our own bugs to work out. General Manager
Washington explained that this is an initiative coming out of the Mayor’s
Office to provide transportation to children at the City’s expense. He stated
that staff see this as part of the grow ridership objective that came out of
the Board Retreat. General Manager Washington stated that this has been
placed on hold but staff will come back to the Board with more information
as things develop.

understand their responsibility in managing the cards. She recognizes that
this will be an ongoing training.

Bruce Abel stated that as his team has informed the Board since standing up
Phase I in January there have been challenges. He explained that the
outcome of the tests that are part of Phase I will determine the timeline
going forward and some of those test have not yet taken place. Bruce Abel
stated that staff wants to get all Phase I issues addressed before moving to
Phase II; additionally, the renewal of the EcoPass programs with begin in the
Q4. He explained that because of these factors they have re-timelined
Phase II to Q3/Q4 of 2014.
Director Deadwyler asked how far behind schedule we are for Phase I.
Bruce Abel stated that Phase I was stood up on schedule with the
implementation of the EcoPasses, CollegePasses, etc. in January.

 Update on 6 Hour Special Events Pass - No Back Up
Bruce Abel said that as the Board may recall in June 2012 staff brought
some policy changes to the Board relative to the Smart Card Program, one
of which was changing the day pass to a 6 hour pass. This change was
implemented with the opening of the West corridor. He shared that in
speaking with customers, the Broncos, Rockies, etc. we have learned that
this is not an adequate timeline. He stated that staff is going to move
forward with changing it from a 6 hour pass to a 12 hour pass.
Director Folska asked if the Fare Task Force was up and running. Bruce
Abel said that the members have been identified and are getting ready for
the first meeting. He shared that staff did hold a meeting with the people
from Boulder and Boulder County.
Director Lasater thanked staff for listening to the customers. He shared that
he has received quite a few comments that the 6 hour timeframe just does
not work. He feels they should have no problem with 12 hours.

D. Other Matters
Chief Tarbert explained that the CERT program has training that occurs every
month and this month covers the advanced classes. This allows CERT graduates to
come back and get further training. He shared that there is a FEMA course to train
a citizen how they can respond to an active shooter situation on August 31st and

Director Hoy stated that he has been on a handful of buses where the
readers were not working. He is wondering if that is a multitude of issues or
just one issue. Beverly Scott said that there has been a slight uptick in
readers not working over the last week. She stated that the issue is the
same whether the reader is on a bus or platform. She explained that this is
a single issue that staff is well aware of and is working to fix.

6.F

Director Hoy shared that he has spent the last several days at Park-n-Rides with 36
Commuting Solutions. He stated that it seems there are a much greater number of
happy customers. He believes this is due to getting the schedules fixed. He thinks
that we need to consider how we can get people onto the buses that do not use
them now. Director Hoy said there was a woman who had to give her car to her
mother when she came into town to watch her children over the summer; she told
him that she felt like she was being forced to take the bus but after riding it she
will never go back to driving. Director Hoy believes if we can just get people to try
the bus they will like it.
Austin Jenkins reminded the Board that the Light Rail Rodeo will be at the Elati
facility this weekend.
Director Deadwyler thanked the Board staff for the new system. She thinks it is
fantastic.
General Manager Washington informed the Board that late last week we were
contacted by the U.S. Department of State and asked to host a very high level
Ethiopian delegation. They would like to visit RTD to look at our light rail facilities
and best practices as they build out the first sub-Saharan light rail. General
Manager Washington stated that this is a very technical group of engineers and
trainers that will be meeting with Capital Program and Light Rail Operations. The
visit will be on August 20th and he will brief the Board on the outcome.

C. Updates

• Second Quarter 2013 Internal Audit Report
Kevin Parker, Senior Internal Auditor, introduced Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop,
RTD’s new Internal Audit Manager.
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that she joined RTD at the beginning of the
third quarter. She was with the City of Aurora as the City Auditor for many
years. Prior to her work with the City, she worked in the UK as an internal
auditor, external auditor and finance director. She comes to RTD with a lot
of experience.
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop stated that since joining RTD she and Kevin Parker
have been working on the annual audit plan/schedule. There are 20 items
on the audit plan and they have completed 8 so far and are working on an
additional 5. She said that the summary audit report was included in the
August 13, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Packet.

Director Deadwyler participated via telephone conference call but had to leave the call
early.

Director Lubow noted that the conclusion of the Lamar Advertising audit
was to arrange an internal meeting to ensure all earned advertising revenue
is received and accounted for. She could not tell if there really was a
problem from the conclusion. Kevin Parker explained that we are trying to
address some of the controls that were not operating or functioning well;
RTD does not always know how much money should be coming in from
Lamar. He stated that this does not appear to be a serious concern because
the contract guarantees a minimum amount of revenue. Kevin Parker said
that part of the issue is companies often work with Lamar for other types of
advertising so they submit their payments in one lump sum. He believes in
the internal meeting staff has come up with some creative ideas as to how
to better control the advertising.
Director Folska noted that we receive $3 million from Lamar whether or not
they sell that much in advertising. She asked what happens if they sell
more. Director Folska has concerns that we may have a lost opportunity for
additional revenue. Kevin Parker stated that historically, Lamar has not quite
met their minimum advertising goal. He explained that we do get a
guaranteed minimum and then a percentage of everything above that
amount.

• Second Quarter 2013 Investment Report
Brenden Morgan stated that the investment report is available in the August
13, 2013 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Agenda Packet. He
said this report is similar to what has been presented in past quarters.
Brenden Morgan explained that interest rates remain low but RTD has
continued to meet or exceed our benchmark rate of returns.
Director Tobiassen asked if we do swaps anymore. Brenden Morgan stated
that we do not have any swaps.

• Fiscal Sustainability Recommendations Update
Terry Howerter shared with the Board that a Fiscal Sustainability Task Force
was commissioned in November of 2010. This Task Force delivered several
recommendations that staff and the Board have been implementing over
time. He stated that we continue to review and implement additional
suggestions.
Doug MacLeod shared that RTD’s sales and use tax dropped significantly
between 2007 and 2009. He said that RTD took steps to try to mitigate the
effects but the Board and staff recognized that we needed a Task Force.
Doug MacLeod explained that the Task Force recommendations were made
in June of 2011 and all were accepted by the Board. The list of completed

Packet Pg. 55

recommendations includes removing the volatility from the sales and use tax
projections, service optimization, funds balance policy, sales and use tax
exemptions, and technology and energy innovation. The list of ongoing
recommendations includes sales and use tax compliance reviews, naming
rights, and partnerships and privatization. Doug MacLeod stated that staff is
working with the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) to finalize an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) which establishes the terms between
RTD, DOR and RTD’s contractor. He explained that once the IGA is
complete RTD will go out with a Request for Proposal (RFP) with the goal of
having the contractor on board by the end of year. Doug MacLeod shared
that staff has been meeting with the Board approved corporate sponsorship
and naming rights consultant, IMG. He anticipates Scott Reed coming to the
Board in the third or fourth quarter with further updates. Doug MacLeod
stated that staff also continues to work on the items identified at the Board
Retreat.
Marla Lien reminded the Board that there was legislature passed this year on
parking. This is not a direct revenue enhancement but will allow potential
offset of an expenditure. She said that RTD also signed the US 36 Phase II
IGA with CDOT and with the North I-25 IGA we were able to relieve about
$250K of expenses that we paid on the I-25 managed lanes. She also said
with US36 IGA we have bus on shoulder operations that will save cost and
improve travel time efficiency. Marla Lien stated that while we do not
receive any direct revenue, at such time as the project pays the debt by the
toll roads concession, any excess revenue must be put into transit
enhancements in the corridor.
Director Menten noted that currently the Department of Revenue keeps
some of the sales tax collected on RTD’s behalf as a fee for their collection
services. She asked if the IGA will take into account some of the work we
are doing on their behalf. She is concerned that we are not getting any
consideration from the state for the leg work we will now be doing. She
also asked when the IGA will be complete and if the Board will have the
opportunity to see it word for word before it is executed. Doug MacLeod
said we should have the IGA finalized by the end of the 3rd quarter. He
explained that it has to go through several levels of review at the
Department of Revenue. Terry Howerter explained that the monthly fee we
pay the Department of Revenue is for the overall collection process. He
stated that our arrangement with the DOR is that we will look for specific
audits we would like to do; if we found something we would give the DOR
its share as they do with us when they find something. Terry Howerter
stated that an IGA on this level would not come to the Board word for word.
Marla Lien explained that the amount of the IGA would be within the blanket
amount of the General Manager’s authority but staff would present it as an
informational item.

General Manager Washington stated that we have come a long way from
when we were making projections in house. He said the recommendations
from the experts are that you cannot make the projections in house; you
need to get a third party. General Manager Washington stated that this third
party forecast is the best thing out there. Terry Howerter explained that this
also gives RTD credibility when we go out to issue bonds and new debt in
what we are projecting for our sales and use tax.
Director James reiterated the reason for hiring a 3rd party is that it is
important to establish credibility. He believes the choices we have for the
3rd party are the same economists that use the same technology with the
same data. He stated that we can choose another consultant but it would
not be much different than the one we have. Terry Howerter said Director
James was correct.

• June 2013 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod reviewed the Monthly Financial Status report with the Board
that is available in the August 13, 2013 Board Packet. He stated that
ridership was up 2.4% or 188K. He said that if you removed the West Line
from the numbers we would be down 0.4% from last year. Doug MacLeod
stated that fare revenue is up 6.5% or $588K for the month and 4.3% yearto-date. He noted that as part of the West Line opening credit and debit
card sales were installed on all ticket vending machines. He explained that
those are making up about 55% of sales to they are being well used. Doug
MacLeod stated that sales and use tax is up 4.3% for the month and 2.7%
year-to-date so we are getting closer to Leeds forecast of 3.7%. Doug
MacLeod informed the Board the fund balances are on track with where we
expect to be at year end and that operating expenses continue to be under
budget. He also highlighted that our cost recovery ratio has to be at 30%;
RTD’s ratio through June was 59.7% so we are well above where we need
to be.
Committee Chair Walker expressed that he is curious to see how ridership
will look in the August report.

Director Lubow asked if we have been looking at how accurate the CU
Leeds School of Business has been in their forecasts. She wonders if it is
more accurate than the model we were using before. Terry Howerter
explained that the forecast changes as thing change throughout the year but
as there are many factors, it is difficult to track them to an amount. He
stated that this is a much better model than the in-house model RTD was
using previously. Terry Howerter said that that he would not say the model
is more accurate but more professional and better managed.

August Board Meeting Agenda Review
Chair Anderson walked through the August Board agenda. General Manager Washington
shared that they had contacted the Board members who had expressed a concern with the
sublease agreement between RTD and the Stadium Management Company LLC. While
they understand the issue that has been raised by Director Sisk, RTD has no legal standing
to ask for the parking lot to be free. Director Anderson added that if we look at the total
cost to condemn the land and build a parking lot, it would be more expensive than this
lease. General Manager Washington added that right now, there is not much usage but he
expects that as the school year kicks in, many of the students at the Auraria campus will
figure this out and start to park there.
General Manager Washington shared that the question had been raised about lease versus
purchase for the access-a-ride cutaway buses. CFO Terry Howerter had provided an
analysis which was sent to the Board members today. Director Hoy shared that with CNG,
the buses would lose 20% of the horsepower and combined with the air would not make
CNG a good choice at this time. General Manager Washington stated that the trend is
moving toward electric which is another variable to consider.

III.

Exception for Board Member Travel
Chair Anderson introduced this item. The current Board policy allows for Board members
to travel to two conferences where the registration costs are paid from the Board office
budget. Board members who would like to travel to an additional conference may submit
a request to the Chair of the Board for written approval assuming that they have sufficient
funds in their travel budget.
This year, a number of Board members have already attended two conferences. Chair
Anderson stated that she has been approached by a number of Board members who are
interested in attending a third conference (Railvolution) and/or the APTA Annual
Conference where General Manager Washington will receive the 2013 Outstanding
Manager of the Year Award. Railvolution is a very educational and informative rail
conference for Board members, especially as we introduce light rail, commuter rail and
other rail technologies into our multi-modal operations. The APTA Annual award is an
honor, not only for Phil but for the whole RTD Agency of which the Board members are

documents necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium
Management Company (SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports
Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to the Stadium all
located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises
will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters.
Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks
operations, and future year funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating
budgets.

the governing body. Where possible, she is encouraging Board members to attend APTA
Annual in support of our General Manager.

Motion:

Director Hoy made the motion to approve a one-time
exception in 2013 to the current policy to allow Board
members who have already attended two conferences
and have available funds in their budget, to attend the
Railvolution and/or APTA Annual Conference.
Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Vote on
The Motion:

Director Hoy expressed that we have a conscientious
group of Directors who should be able to manage their
travel to their travel budget. He does not think the
current policy to request approval has value if the Board
members have funds in their account. Director Daly
stated we might have had more of a concern when the
travel budget was reduced during our budget austerity
program. Chair Anderson expressed this is really a
check and balance by having someone to approve that
third trip. This is a good check to have in the policy.

The motion Passed.

Chair Anderson requested Paula Perdue to please
communicate this exception to the Board and work
with the Board members regarding their available funds.

Other Matters



General Manager Washington shared that RTD has received word that the
disbursement of the $141,766M from the FFGA allotment for FY2013 is on the way.
General Manager Washington shared that the grant for livability for the 16th Street Mall
(pavers) was approved. More details to follow.

Because of the importance of these conferences, she asked the Executive Committee to
approve a one-time exception for 2013 to our current policy that will allow Board members
who have already attended two conferences and have available funds in their budget, to
attend the Railvolution and/or APTA Annual Conference.

Chair Anderson asked if the questions by the RTD Board related to the 16th Street Mall
had been answered. Paula clarified that Director Menten had indicated she will bring
her questions pertaining to the 16th Street Mall back to the next meeting. General
Manager Washington indicated that staff can explain the agreement between RTD and
the Downtown Denver Partnership.
General Manager Washington reminded the committee of the Halfway Opening for the
Eagle P3 project to be held on August 22. He will provide details on the bus to the
event. Mayor Hancock has confirmed he will be in attendance. Chair Anderson
indicated that Mayor Williams had indicated her plans to attend. General Manager
Washington stated they will look at the list of people who have confirmed.
Chair Anderson shared that she was a member of the APTA Nominating Committee
that met in Dallas, Texas this week to look at the candidates for the Executive
positions. This was a fascinating experience and she learned how this committee
follows the Bylaws of APTA, seeks diversity, and tries to make sure this is a wellbalanced process. General Manager Washington was one of the nominees for APTA
Vice Chair. She recused herself from the voting for a potential conflict of interest but
expressed the importance of this committee doing what is in the best overall interest of
the organization. The Nominating Committee approved Phil Washington for the
position of APTA Vice-Chair. The Nominating Committee will take forth their
recommended slate. They discussed the next step in this process which will probably
culminate in a vote at the APTA Annual event in October. General Manager
Washington indicated the current 3-year process includes 2 years up for CEO/GM, and
1 year for Board of Directors or Business unit group. Chair Anderson concluded by
saying she thinks General Manager Washington is a good choice. He has done a good
job with innovation, diversity, the WIN program and has produced great results that
can be applied in his role as APTA Vice-Chair.
Director Walker inquired about the Ethiopia Delegation to Denver and asked if RTD was
the only transit agency they will be visiting. General Manager Washington indicated
this was his understanding. General Manager Washington indicated that they are
planning to build the first rail in the Sub-Saharan Rim. Director Daly noted how
wonderful it is that RTD has received the kind of recognition from as far away as
Ethiopia that they would want to come talk to RTD. Director Daly noted that Colorado
has a high population of Ethiopians, many of whom are bus drivers.
Director Daly noted that Minneapolis is addressing some of the same concerns of the
effect of electromagnetic interference on sensitive medical equipment.
Chair Anderson shared that the Eagle P3 Elected officials briefing went well today.
She and Director Hoy were in attendance. Director Hoy commented people are
anticipating seeing the train. Chair Anderson shared that when she attended the rail
conference in Philadelphia, she had a chance to go to the factory to see the trains
being built. She also rode the train straight from the airport to the hotel and marveled
at how easy the process was. General Manager Washington indicated he will check

Public Participation

Ricky Martinez, RMR, stated that he does not support the injustice that Rocky
Mountain Reinforcement Company has put him through. He received a pay cut and
they had several safety infractions.



Louis Apolinar who also worked for RMR referenced that RMR has been hired on
two RTD projects, DUS and Eagle. He also received a pay cut and has to scramble
to pay his bills. He is just looking for justice and dignity for the RMR employees.



Jim Toweill with the ironworkers commented they have not heard back from the
Board. This is an ongoing issue with RMR. If RMR is hired to work on the North
Metro project and this has federal funds, this could be an area of concern. He
passed out a handout about RMR. A copy of this handout can be found in the
Board meeting file located in the Board office.



Doug Gregg, Denver, complimented this Board on being one of the hardest working
Boards that he has seen. He also asked about the collection of pictures that were
at the Denver Union Station. He shared a problem that he had with pickup to get
to the Board meeting.

The General Manager Annual Award Recognition was a great event. It was good to
see all of the people receive these well merited awards. She was especially
impressed with the driver who has driven for 33 years without an accident.
June 27, they had a second Northwest Mobility Town Hall meeting. She believes
this was more successful than the first. She and Directors Hoy, Lubow, and Sisk
participated.
Chair Anderson noted a number of upcoming events: Directors Hoy and Walker will
participate in the Annual Board Support conference in Austin along with two
members of the staff. Director Walker is running for Region IV representative and
Director Hoy is on a panel looking at the Board’s oversight role during procurement
and construction.
She attended the NAMS meeting. They discussed rail options for Northwest area.
Chair Anderson attended the North Metro Quarterly meeting. She thinks General
Manager and his staff did a great presentation and she did not hear any crankiness.
Other Board members in attendance were Director Hoy, Solano and Lubow.
Chair Anderson attended the MAX program reception on Sunday. Other Board
members who attended were Directors Bagley, Walker and Sisk. It is exciting to
see the middle level managers get together and share experiences.

to herself, Directors Folska and Rivera-Malpiede were in attendance.
She attended the DRCOG Sustainable Community meeting this morning.

General Manager Washington shared that the North Metro quarterly meeting with
the stakeholders on July 11 was well received. They discussed the North Metro
RFP. There will be a Northwest Quarterly meeting on July 18 where they will also
discuss the RFP for North Metro and the Northwest Mobility Study.
General Manager Washington attended the Conference of Minority Transportation
Officials National Conference which was held in Jacksonville, Florida. He did a
number of presentations. The Colorado Chapter is most aggressive and had much
to share about the DUS and Eagle P3 project.
The 2013 Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is meeting in Denver this week.
The agencies currently participating in this program are Denver, Los Angeles and
Dallas. This was a brainchild of General Manager Washington and Art Leahy in LA
as a way to share best practices and knowledge sharing across agencies. They are
looking to add Atlanta to this group. His goal is to have a MAX program for every
quadrant of the country. He expects his counterpart, CEO Gary Thomas from
Dallas, to attend the graduation services on July 18.
The 2013 APTA Leadership program is also meeting in Denver this week. They
have a number of presentations and sessions planned. The GM and his staff will be
actively participating on panels and other discussions for APTA Leadership.

Director Rivera-Malpiede has also been invited to participate on two panel
discussions. The APTA Leadership is a 12-month program where the participants
will graduate at the annual APTA meeting in October. Jenni Barket, Legal Counsel,
currently is RTD representative.
General Manager Washington has been asked to be the keynote speaker at
Colorado Futuretek Luncheon on July 20. This organization works with training
youth and underrepresented minorities high school students including providing
internships, etc.
General Manager Washington announced we will be celebrating the 50%
completion of the Eagle project in August, 2013. We have the only PPP in the
country for transit program so all eyes are on us. He spoke to FTA Administrator
Rogoff about this event and invited him to attend.
General Manager Washington announced the DUS Bus Terminal Opening on May 9,
2014. This is ahead of the internal anticipated completion date. This date has
been set and includes the moving of Amtrak in DUS. They stood up an activation
team about a year ago. The grand opening will be May 9, the shutdown of Market
Station will be May 10 and the cutover will be coordinated with the runboard of
May 11, 2014. We are coordinating with DUSPA and USA who plans to open the
hotel and retail facilities in late July.
General Manager Washington shared that around August 1, 2013, DIA will be
moving the Sky ride drop off point to the west side as they shift the work to the
Eastside. This will probably remain until sometime in 2014. They will work with
DIA to make sure proper signage and notification of the change is in place.
Next Monday and Tuesday, Sound Transit will be visiting to learn about how RTD
integrated new lines into our existing system. He has often stated we have
become the farm agency for the transit industry and this demonstrates that more
and more agencies want to emulate our success.
General Manager Washington shared that DRCOG Executive Director Jennifer
Schaufele had asked him, to provide a non-voting staff member to the DCCOG
Board. He has appointed Bill Van Meter as that representative.

Questions/comments from Board members:
 Director Daly inquired if the downtown Denver circulator will be operative at the
grand opening of the DUS Bus terminal. General Manager Washington replied he
hoped so but there is work to be done.
 Director Daly referenced the comments made from the RMR representatives during
public hearing and asked if our compliance team could get with them to share the
information they had provided to the Board. General Manager Washington stated
he would look at this.
 Director Lubow asked about the request for a non-voting member on the DRCOG
Board. General Manager Washington stated he imagine it is to provide staff

expertise with their staff on a number of things. He has been in discussion with
Jennifer for 6-8 months now.
Director James commented that this sounds appropriate. DRCOG is working on
some demand management things and the coordination between RTD and DRCOG
makes sense. Pertaining to Union Station coordination, Amtrak may be on a critical
path. Marla Lien responded that Amtrak and RTD have been meeting and have
resolved most of the critical points. They are planning another meeting around
September and hopefully we can iron out those last few issues.
Director Menten inquired about the MAX program. General Manager Washington
shared it is a program that was started by him and the CEO in Los Angeles and
later Dallas to put together best practices and the sharing of information. This has
saved millions of dollars for the agencies.
Director Folska inquired about the circulators and the street modifications to the
bus bowls. She expressed a concern that if bikes are allowed in this bus bowls it
can be a problem for the visually impaired community.
Director Sisk inquired about the US 36 problem that occurred this morning when
US 36 was closed in both directions. His concern was on our notification process
and how do we communicate this to our users. Scott Reed, AGM communications
indicated they used various media-riders alerts, posted on website, social media,
and dispatched where accessible.
Director Rivera-Malpiede indicated it is important that we have good
communications on these changes to the location for SkyRide at DIA.

Discussion:

Director Lubow thanked the General Manager for
inclusion of some of the comments into his goal;
however, the measurement standard for the “grow the
ridership” goal is not yet a measurement standard that
we can say yes we met that goal. She would like to
see the “grow the ridership goal” at the strategic
planning advance for 2015.
General Manager Washington explained that the reason
why she does not see the measurement goal in this
document is because these are his goals for 2014. In
the meeting, she had given him the task to define that
measurement in 2013. He has a team that will be
looking at this in 2013 and will come back to the Board
in the fall (October) to discuss a possible measurement
goal that can be applied in 2014 per his goal for exceed
expectations.
Director Folska stated she is excited about the “grow
the ridership” goal.

Director Bagley reminded the Board that the Railvolution conference will be in
Seattle in late October. This is one of the most important conferences the
members can attend to stay abreast of changes around rail, economic development
and impacts and especially transit TOD. He knows a number of Board members are
planning to attend (i.e. Directors Bagley, James, Sisk, Rivera-Malpiede and Chair
Anderson).
Director Bagley thinks focus on the state of good repair as a safety item is
important.
Director Bagley attended the MAX Program reception and had a chance to talk to a
few of the participants. They stated this is a very productive program where they
have a chance to learn and share ideas-some of them felt it was more worthwhile
than Leadership APTA. It is important that we invest in human capital.
Director Menten referenced a previous Executive Committee meeting where they
discussed having Board members to prepare a trip-tic when they attend
conferences or travel outside of the district using RTD funds. She stated she
believes it is a good idea to have a policy in place to request a trip report and this
adds to the accountability. It also allows information to be shared with Board
members who are unable to attend.
Director Walker shared he too had a chance to speak to some of the MAX
participants. This is a good way to do industry knowledge exchange. He also
referenced some article he had read around the use of P3’s that he found thought
provoking.

Subject:

Donation of Vintage Rail

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail, tie plates and wooden ties for
restoration purposes to Como Depot.
BACKGROUND
The vintage rail is located in a land locked area between Evans and East Asbury Avenue. The adjacent
properties include high density housing, storage units and a paint distribution store. The existing rail is a
mix of narrow gauge 80-90 pound connected to wooden ties with plates and steel spikes. RTD has
never or will ever use this weight of rail or our existing light rail service. With no long term plan for
restoration or use, a constrained budget, the opportunity for removal and re-use was considered in the
fall of 2012.
In summer of 2012, RTD was contacted by the Como Depot stating their desire to remove the rail,
wooden ties and plates, restore and reuse them in a historical round house located in Como, Colorado.
The Como Depot, a non-profit historic organization, is in process of refurbishing the historic roundhouse
and hotel which dates back to 1879. Como Depot has partnered with several entities which include
CDOT, State Historical Fund, Colorado Preservation, Denver South Park and Pacific Historical Society,
Park County and South Park National Heritage Area.
Pursuant to receiving this letter, RTD staff recommended to the Board of Directors that the vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties be donated to Como Depot. RTD staff developed an advertisement method,
described below under Discussion, and compiled a historical report which is attached.
DISCUSSION
The contracting method for transfer of the vintage rail and components was a Request for Expression of
Interest and Information (REFII). REFII No. 13JB008 was issued on 05/25/2013 and copies of the REFII
were provided to 15 prospective vendors in addition to being advertised with the Denver News Agency.
The vendor list was:
Como Depot
SRC Industries, Inc.
Railroad Specialties
United Railroad Service Co.
North American Rail Products
Pikes Peak Historical
Littleton Museum
Colorado History
Lakewood Historical Society
Colorado Historical Foundation
Arvada Historical Society

Packet Pg. 74

11.A

Jefferson County Historical
Forney Transportation Museum
Colorado Railroad Museum
Advertisement was closed on 06/12/2013 with two proposals received, one from Como Depot and SRC
Industries, Inc.
On 06/24/2013 the RTD project team met and discussed the following:
•
•
•
•

Como Depot more than qualifies them for the project of the Buchtel Vintage Rail, Tie Plate and
Wooden Tie Removal.
Como Depot is willing to accept all aspects listed in the REFII 13HJB008 for the removal of the
vintage rail.
Como Depot funding will rely on donations and volunteers for all aspects of the REFII.
Como Depot partners include State Historical Fund, CDOT, Colorado Preservation, Denver South
Park and Pacific Historical Society, Park County, South Park National Heritage Area, with others
contributing their time and funds for the Depot restoration.

The contract for ownership transfer would be zero dollars, this proposal, if accepted would result in no
expenses for RTD. RTD will not receive any funds in return for these vintage rails, tie plates and
wooden ties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No impact to RTD’s current or future budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to donate vintage rail,
tie plates and wooden ties for restoration purposes to Como Depot.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to donate vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties to Como Depot. Instead, leave the property as is
and do not disturb the vintage rails, tie plates and wooden ties. This alternative is not recommended
as RTD has no long-term plan or budget for restoration or reuse of these items.

Award of Access-a-Ride Call Center Services

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract for the provision of Access-aRide Call Center services with First Transit, Inc. This contract is for three years, with two one-year
options for a total 5-year amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal represents the most
responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals (RFP) 13-DH-026, to
provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services. The contract to provide this service is scheduled to be
effective October 1, 2013.
BACKGROUND
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that public entities operating a fixed route system
also provide paratransit service to individuals with disabilities that is comparable to the level of service
provided to individuals without disabilities. RTD adheres to the U.S. Department of Transportation, Part
37 regulations (Transportation for Individuals with Disabilities) which regulate paratransit services. All
policies regarding services were developed in concert with a citizen advisory committee comprised of
individuals from the disabled community. The original design of the Access-a-Ride program was adopted
by the RTD Board of Directors and was forwarded to the Federal Transportation Administration for their
approval.
The current Access-a-Ride structure consists of one Call Center Contractor and four Service Provider
Contractors. First Transit operates the Call Center while MV Transportation, Horizon Coach Lines, Via
Mobility, and Global Transportation provide the service. In addition, all paratransit eligibility functions
are handled by Easter Seals of Colorado.
On May 29, 2013, RTD issued a Request for Proposals (RFP) soliciting technical and price proposals to
provide Access-a-Ride Call Center Services. This service represents the re-bid of service currently
provided by First Transit. The RFP was mailed to 11 firms that indicated an interest in proposing on this
service. In addition, announcements were placed in transit publications. Proposals were due on June
28, 2013.
DISCUSSION
Four (4) proposals were received in response to RFP 13-DH-026 for the Provision of Access-a-Ride Call
Center services. Proposals were received from First Transit, MTM, SCR, and Veolia Transportation.
It is the recommendation of the evaluation committee formed to evaluate proposals received in response
to RFP 13-DH-026, that RTD award a contract for Access-a-Ride Call Center service to First Transit.
This recommendation is based upon the evaluation of the proposals according to the evaluative criteria
as set forth in the RFP for this procurement. The evaluative criteria established for this procurement
were: a) understanding/approach and organization for implementation (40%); b) experience of firm and
individuals proposed for key positions and disciplines (30%); and c) price (30%).

Packet Pg. 77

11.B

The evaluation team consisted of Carolyn Conover, Senior Manager of Contracted Services; Larry Buter,
Manager of Paratransit Services; Brian Matthews, Manager of Special Services; David Terada, ITS
Administrator; Joy Volz, Paratransit Quality Assurance Supervisor; and Chris Sills, Paratransit Safety and
Training Compliance Officer.
The members of the evaluation team individually reviewed the technical proposals submitted by the four
proposers. Each team member evaluated the proposals on how well the proposal met the evaluative
criteria set forth for the procurement and assigned a score for “Understanding and Approach” and for
“Experience and Proposed Key Positions.” Based on the average of the individual scores received in
these categories, First Transit was the highest rated technical proposal followed by Veolia Transportation
and MTM. SCR was the lowest rated technical proposal. The score for the “Cost” element of each
proposal was calculated by the RTD procurement staff and was then added to the technical score of
each proposal to determine the overall score or rating of each proposal. The total overall scores resulted
in First Transit being the highest rated proposal followed by MTM and Veolia Transportation. SCR was
the lowest rated proposal. First Transit received an overall total score of 91 (out of 100); MTM received
an overall total score of 79. Veolia Transportation received a total score of 77 and SCR received an
overall score of 74. It was the consensus of the evaluation team that First Transit presented the best
proposal in terms of understanding of the project, proposed management team, proposed
organization/business plan/approach to deliver the requested service, and proposed price.
First Transit was the lowest priced proposal. The difference in price over the five-year period between
First Transit and MTM was $497,683. The overall rating represents the evaluation process conclusion
that the strengths of the First Transit technical proposal outweighed the strengths of the MTM, Veolia,
and SCR proposals. While the strengths of the MTM proposal included an experienced General Manager,
the proposal was determined to be weak in the areas of pay scale for reservationists and for not
identifying a Training Manager. The strengths of the Veolia Transportation proposal included an
experienced Firm, General Manager, and proposed use of “Reveal,” software designed to improve
efficiencies. However, the proposal failed to identify the Scheduling, Reservations, or Dispatch
Supervisors. In addition, the evaluation committee felt that the Veolia Transportation proposal
inadequately scheduled enough resources for both the reservations and dispatch departments. Finally,
the strengths of the SCR proposal included an experienced General Manager, scheduling software
experience, and experience with providing both paratransit and Medicaid transportation services. The
evaluation team was concerned with SCR’s proposed Assistant General Manager who did not meet the
minimum years of experience required in the RFP. In addition, SCR proposed installing “Opti-Run,” a
software designed to assist with creating driver schedules to match service demands. The Access-aRide Division purchased this software several years ago, thereby making the SCR proposal less
advantageous to RTD.
A key strength of the First Transit proposal was the proposed management team. Under this team’s
leadership, the Access-a-Ride Call Center consistently meets RTD expectations. The team is
experienced in providing Call Center service for RTD and there will be no need for startup and,
consequently, no disruption of service when transitioning to the new contract. First Transit proposed
“Info Manager” software designed to monitor system performance and allows staff to make necessary
adjustments. In addition, First Transit proposed to provide up to 50 Mobile Data Tablets for use in the
anticipated non-dedicated vehicle component of the Access-a-Ride program.

RECOMMENDATION

Packet Pg. 78

11.B

It is the recommendation of staff that First Transit be awarded the Access-a-Ride Call Center Contract
for three years with two one-year options for an amount not to exceed $11,074,125. This proposal
represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to Request for Proposals
(RFP) 13-DH-026, to provide “Access-a-Ride Call Center” Services.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The recommended action is based upon the evaluation committee’s determination that the recommended
firm’s proposal represents the most responsive and responsible proposal received in response to the RFP
issued by the District. This determination is based upon the evaluation of technical and price issues
consistent with the evaluative criteria established by RTD and communicated in the RFP document.
An RTD internal financial analysis indicated that the estimated cost to provide these services would be
higher than the prices offered by the recommended service provider. The estimated cost was based on
current and projected wage rates and other operating expenses based on RTD’s current experience
operating the Telephone Information Center (TIC).
Funds for the provision of the first year of service under this contract are included in the adopted 2013
amended budget and in the 2014 requested budget. There are no proposed start-up costs, and
therefore, there is no start-up cost impact on the 2013 budget. Funds will be requested in future
budgets for the provision of service in future years.
ALTERNATIVES:
1)
Award the contract to First Transit, Inc., as recommended
2)
Award the contract to MTM, the second ranked proposer. This is not recommended as it
does not reflect the outcome of the evaluation team’s evaluation process and RTD’s
procurement process.
3)
Resolicit the RFP. This is not recommended as the proposal process has resulted in a
responsive and responsible proposal and is less expensive than the RTD internal cost
estimate (ICE).

Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 and March 26, 2013 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for
the I-225 project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, additional
acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary in those areas for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.

Packet Pg. 83

12.C

The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride
Facilities)
by
and
between
Regional
Transportation
District
and
Stadium
Management Company, LLC

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real
property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to
the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises
will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this
lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year
funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
BACKGROUND
The West Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement, October, provides for RTD to lease parking
spaces from the stadium for RTD parking. The Full Funding Grant Agreement by and between the
Regional Transportation District and the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit
Administration acknowledges this commitment.
DISCUSSION
The lease of approximately 1,100 parking spaces, known as Lot M, will be for a term of thirty (30)
years. There are provisions in the lease for early termination of the lease in whole or in part in the 3rd
Sublease Year (2016), the tenth Sublease Year (2023) and the 15th Sublease Year (2028). The lease
can be extended twice, each for an additional fifteen (15) year period.
The lease will provide that RTD may retain any and all revenues generated from the parking of vehicles
within the Subleased Premises on all dates during the term with the exception of SMC Event Days. The
SMC shall have the exclusive right to use the Subleased Premises in connection with any event to be
held at the Stadium for fifteen (15) days, guaranteed, and may designate another fifteen (15) days
during each calendar year. SMC shall provide RTD with a written schedule of the dates which SMC
designates as the SMC Use Dates as soon as practicable after SMC’s receipt of each National Football
League schedule and will provide at least thirty (30) days prior to any of the other optional fifteen (15)
days. RTD will notice patrons of the dates parking is unavailable at this location.
RTD will be obligated to provide any and all services necessary for RTD’s operation of the Subleased
Premises during the term.
The lease will also contain provisions for possible redevelopment of the site by SMC. RTD will make
certain improvements (primarily re-paving) on the lot consistent with standards at other RTD parking
facilities and as specified by the lease.

Award Contract to Supply 103 Cutaway Buses
for access-a-Ride Service

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to Supreme Bus for the
purchase of up to 103 new cutaway buses for the access-a-Ride service in the amount not to exceed
$5,228,589, with an option to purchase up to 350 additional cutaway buses over a five year period.

BACKGROUND

RTD uses the cutaway buses for its access-a-Ride service. The buses are based on the cutaway van
chassis and have an average service life of about 5 years. The new buses will replace existing buses
that are five, six, and seven years old, and have reached the end of their service life. The Invitation for
Bid (IFB) for the bus procurement was issued on June 4, 2013. Sealed bids were received on August 6,
2013.

DISCUSSION
Four companies submitted their bids, Supreme Bus, Intermountain Coach, Colorado West and Arizona
Bus Sales. The bidders submitted their costs as follows.

Supreme Bus
Intermountain Coach
Colorado West
Arizona Bus Sales

Bid Price
$50,763
$51,049
$52,167
$52,452

Supreme Bus was found to be the most responsive, responsible low bidder after all submittals and
options had been evaluated.
The new cutaway buses will be based on the Ford E-350 chassis. They will be fully ADA compliant.
They will be equipped with a wheelchair lift and wheelchair tie-down equipment for two wheelchairs.
In addition, they will be equipped with a security camera system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT

Packet Pg. 97

12.E

This contract is for the purchase of 103 cutaway buses in the amount not to exceed $5,228,589. The
funding for this contract is approved and available in the District’s 2013 Adopted Budget.
The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 350 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, Supreme Bus has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of
its DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

Authorize the General Manager to award the contract to Supreme Bus for the purchase of
103 cutaway buses to be used for the access-a-Ride service. This is the recommended
alternative.

2.

Award the contract to Intermountain Coach, the second lowest bidder. This is not the
recommended action as it would contradict with RTD’s procurement practice.

3.

Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit bids. This is not desirable as it would
result in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost of the project.

Award Contract to Supply 52 – 60’ Low-Floor
Articulated Buses

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to New Flyer of America Inc. for the
purchase of 52 – 60’ low-floor articulated buses and associated spare components in the amount not to
exceed $34,636,614, with an option to purchase up to 140 additional articulated buses over a five year
period.

BACKGROUND
RTD’s existing 9100 Series NABI articulated buses have exceeded their FTA service life of 12 years. The
buses are 13 years old and have accumulated on average 380,000 miles of stop-and-go transit service.
Their structures have experienced heavy damage due to rust, corrosion and fatigue. They have become
unreliable and require intensive maintenance to keep them in service. The adopted Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP) calls for the replacement of the 9100 Series buses over the next three years, 40 buses in 2013,
40 buses in 2014 and 18 buses in 2015.
On May 28, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the Downtown Denver (18th/19th Street) Circulator
service plan. Twelve (12) of the requested New Flyer articulated buses will be expansion buses to be
used for this service. This initial order includes forty (40) buses to replace forty (40) existing 13-year old
2000 Model Year NABI buses, and twelve (12) expansion buses to be used for the new Downtown
Denver (18th/19th Street) Circulator bus service.
The Request for Proposals (RFP) was issued on February 27, 2013 for the procurement of articulated
buses. The RFP solicited proposals that offer buses in different power configurations: clean diesel, CNG,
hybrid electric and battery electric. Proposals were received on May 17, 2013.

DISCUSSION
Proposals were received from four companies: New Flyer, Nova Bus, North American Bus Industries
(NABI) and BYD Motors.
The proposers submitted their costs as follows.

New Flyer

Clean Diesel

$637,000

CNG Bus

Staff has performed an in-depth life cycle cost analysis of the different power configurations to
determine the most cost effective and efficient propulsion power system for the new buses.
The hybrid buses are $173,974 (for the series hybrid) or $209,706 (for the parallel hybrid) higher in unit
cost than the diesel buses. Accordingly, RTD would only be able to purchase thirty (30) to thirty-one
(31) hybrid buses for the available budget instead of the forty (40) replacement vehicles desired.
Based on RTD’s experience of 20% better fuel economy for the hybrid buses and its current diesel fuel
purchase price, it would take between 34 and 41 years for the return on investment (ROI) on the hybrid
buses. This far exceeds the twelve (12) year useful life of the vehicle. Accordingly, hybrid vehicles were
eliminated from further consideration.
Current generation electric buses are running on batteries exclusively. They are twice the unit cost of
the diesel buses. They are still experiencing issues such as short operating range – only 155 miles
between battery charges and less than half of RTD normal operating range requirement of 400 miles,
and heavy bus weight. Accordingly, the current electric vehicles were eliminated from further
consideration.
The CNG buses are $61,519 higher in unit cost than the diesel buses. Currently, CNG fuel is about 50%
lower in cost per diesel gallon equivalent than diesel fuel. In order to convert to CNG operations, RTD
must also invest in new CNG stations and safety modifications of existing maintenance and parking
facilities. The CNG stations required for fueling CNG vehicles at two RTD divisions, Platte and East
Metro, are estimated to cost upward of $3,540,000 per each division. The facility modifications to these
two divisions alone to bring them into compliance with fire codes for safe operations of CNG fuel are
estimated to cost up to $8.8 Million for Platte and $12.3 Million for East Metro. The total facility
upgrades for the two divisions are estimated to result in a $28.1 million investment. This analysis does
not include RTD’s Boulder operating division nor any of the four (4) private contractor operating
divisions.
The CNG analysis by staff indicates:





Savings in CNG fuel cost will be more than offset by the higher cost of bus purchase and
upgrading the maintenance and parking facilities.
Prices of natural gas and diesel fuel have been historically extremely volatile. There is no
guarantee that the current pricing advantage of natural gas over diesel fuel will continue into the
future.
There are no significant air quality impacts to convert from diesel to CNG operations. Both new
clean diesel and new CNG buses have significantly lower emissions than the older buses they
replace. The emissions of new clean diesel and CNG buses are considered to be the same.
The CNG facility upgrade will take at least two years to implement. Going with CNG buses will
delay the bus procurement process at least two years.
In the past CNG buses showed higher maintenance costs than diesel buses. However, in the last
several years, CNG engine technology has improved. Even though CNG buses require certain new

Packet Pg. 101

12.F



costs for CNG related maintenance such as CNG engine sparkplug replacement and high pressure
fuel system maintenance, staff has assumed CNG and diesel maintenance costs to be equivalent.
The reliability and durability of CNG engines are still questionable at high altitude and cold
weather conditions, coupled with the usage of low energy natural gas available in Denver metro
area.
High altitude conditions cause loss of engine power and hotter engine operating
temperature. Cold weather causes CNG engine starting problems. Denver’s natural gas has lower
energy content than the rest of the country. Low energy gas causes engine operating issues.
CNG is a combustible gas at very high pressure (3,600 pounds per square inch of pressure).
Safety and security for the operation of CNG are of concern.
The high cost CNG stations and associated facility upgrades may become obsolete in 12 years at
the end of life of the buses under this procurement. Electric vehicle technology appears to be the
preferred technology of the future. A number of electric buses are currently in production or
under demonstration by bus manufacturers. As electric bus technology is still in its infancy, it
currently has issues such as high purchase cost and low operating range. In the upcoming years,
it is expected that the technology will advance and production processes will improve, allowing
the bus cost to come down and the operating range to increase.

There are risks that the very large investment in CNG facility upgrades and CNG buses may not pay off;
that the savings on CNG fuel may not be realized due to commodity price fluctuations; that the CNG
technology may become obsolete to better engine technologies currently being demonstrated such as
electric vehicles; and that CNG operational difficulties may be experienced under RTD’s high altitude,
cold climate and low energy natural gas usage. Based on the above considerations, staff has
recommended that RTD stay with clean diesel technology as a good public policy.
The proposals were also rated according to their proposed costs and company technical ability.
New Flyer submitted the highest rated proposal in both costs and technical ability. New Flyer’s proposal
is the most responsive, responsible, lowest cost and best value proposal. New Flyer meets and exceeds
RTD technical specification requirements. New Flyer has the experience and qualification in the
manufacture of transit buses, being the largest and financially stable manufacturer in North America.
New Flyer offered a lifetime warranty against bus structure corrosion damage. New Flyer proposed a
delivery schedule that meets the implementation timeline for the Downtown Denver (18th/19th Street)
Circulator service.
The articulated buses are low floor for ease of passenger boarding and de-boarding. They will be
equipped with a wheelchair ramp and two wheelchair access areas to allow for ADA compliance. Their
clean diesel engines will meet the latest EPA regulations and will reduce exhaust emissions up to 90%
from the level of the existing buses. The buses will be equipped with an automatic passenger count
system and a security digital camera system. The articulated buses for the base transit service will have
two passenger doors and 57 passenger seats. The articulated buses for the Downtown Denver
(18th/19th Street) Circulator service will have three passenger doors and 46 passenger seats. In addition,
the circulator buses will have the exterior BRT package. They will have a progressive and modern look
with aerodynamic and streamlined appearance.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This current contract is for the purchase of 52 articulated buses and associated spare components in the
amount not to exceed $34,636,614. The funding for this contract is approved and available in the
District’s 2013 Adopted Budget.

Packet Pg. 102

12.F

The contract allows RTD the options to purchase up to 140 additional buses over a five year period.
Pricing for additional option buses will be based on the initial base pricing plus an inflationary price
adjustment computed using the US Department of Labor’s “Producer Price Index” or PPI which is
published monthly.
Additional buses to be purchased from the options will require separate
authorizations from the RTD Board of Directors.

DBE PARTICIPATION
There is no DBE requirement for transit vehicle purchases. Each vehicle manufacturer is required by the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to submit a DBE plan for FTA approval. As part of the required
proposal submittal documents, New Flyer has submitted a certificate attesting to FTA’s approval of its
DBE plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1.

To authorize the General Manager to award a contract to New Flyer for the purchase of 52diesel articulated buses and associated spare components. This is the recommended
alternative.

2.

Award the contract to New Flyer for 52 CNG articulated buses.
This is not the
recommended action as it would delay the bus purchase at least two years due to the long
process to construct the CNG fuel stations and modify the maintenance and parking
facilities. CNG requires higher bus purchase costs and multi-million dollar facility costs,
which will offset the CNG fuel savings. There are risks of operational difficulty for CNG
buses in RTD’s high altitude and cold weather conditions, in addition to the availability of
only low energy natural gas in Denver metro area. In addition, no funding has been identified
to finance the necessary capital improvements.

3.

Do not authorize the award of the contract and re-solicit proposals. This is not desirable as it
would result, at the very least, in a delay of the delivery of the buses and may increase the cost
of the project.
