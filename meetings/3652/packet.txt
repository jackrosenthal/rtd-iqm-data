Committee Meeting Date:
General Manager and CEO Total Compensation Analysis
Results

September 9, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the January 30, 2024, Board meeting, the Board adopted the Seventh Amendment (amendment)
to the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager Employment Agreement. The amendment requires
the Board to retain an external consultant to conduct a total compensation study (Total Compensation
Study) no later than October 31, 2024, and to take appropriate action consistent with the Compensation
Philosophy adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023. Such Board action must include review of the
Total Compensation Study findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of the
Compensation Philosophy principles, consideration of any information provided by the General Manager
and CEO (GM/CEO), and consultation with the GM/CEO prior to the Board taking any action. Such
review and action does not require the Board to adopt an adjusted base salary or other compensation
increase
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for a total Compensation Study and
360° Assessment instrument consulting services solicitation and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a
contract for such services. The Board Office subsequently worked with the Chief People Officer (CPO)
and the Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for quotations, qualified firms to
conduct the Total Compensation Study. On July 9, 2024, RTD entered into an agreement with RKL
Virtual Management (RKL) to conduct the Total Compensation Analysis.
The RKL team attended and presented during the Performance Committee’s meetings on July 22, 2024,
and August 8, 2024, to provide updates and seek feedback on the Total Compensation Study in
progress. RKL also sought feedback from Directors as well as the GM/CEO on a proposed list of peer
entities from which to seek compensation data for purposes of comparison. RKL further coordinated
with the CPO to obtain internal benchmarking data to assist with the internal equity analysis. RKL
submitted its final report to the Board Office on August 30, 2024, which was subsequently distributed
to the Board and GM/CEO.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 3

1.C.1

RKL based the design of its survey on best practices as well as the Board-approved GM/ CEO
Compensation Philosophy. The survey RKL distributed sought information related to eight areas of
compensation. RKL received 14 responses from 23 identified public comparators.
In analyzing the responses, RKL found RTD’s GM/CEO compensation to be at market in five areas,
lagging the market in two areas, and above the market in one area:
Type of Compensation
Base Salary
Annual Increases
Compensation Philosophy
Variable Compensation
Health/Life Insurance
Retirement Benefits
Paid Leave
Perquisites

Lagging Market

With respect to health/life insurance and perquisites, RKL found that RTD was specifically lagging the
market in the following areas: dental insurance, vision insurance, paid wellness days, vehicle allowance,
and executive allowance.
With respect to paid leave, RKL found RTD was leading the market by allowing the GM/CEO to sell back
more accrued but unexpended Paid Time Off (PTO) days than peers allow on average.
RKL’s internal equity analysis found “RTD’s internal equity compensation practices appear to align with
selected peers and market standards. Additionally, this analysis suggests the
GM/CEO’s compensation is equitable when compared with other executive roles within the
organization.”
Ultimately, RKL concluded “that the current compensation of RTD’s GM/CEO is reasonable and
competitive when benchmarked against similar positions in the market.”
The Directors are asked to discuss the findings and provide input as to whether to take any action in
response to the findings. If action were to be taken by the Board, the Performance Committee would
take up the matter during its October 7, 2024 meeting.
This discussion aligns with all four strategic priorities (Customer Excellence, Community Value,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success) as the GM/CEO’s performance is directly tied to the
agency’s success in fulfilling its strategic priorities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from this discussion.

When asked about the other types of perquisites comparator’s CEO may receive, the following
were mentioned:

• Executive allowance
• Transit bus pass
On average, these perquisites represent an additional $10,000 to their CEO’s total compensation.

Total Comp Survey: Internal Equity
Internal Equity Differentials
• 2022 Compensation Study prescribed a 20% differential between a supervisor’s pay and their
subordinates pay. RKL recommends that there be at least a 20% differential, but is more
common to aim for around 30 – 35%.
• Average differential in base pay between comparator’s CEO and their most senior direct reports
was 75%.
• Average differential in base pay between RTD’s GM/CEO and their top 2nd & 3rd mostly highly
paid senior leaders is 70%. When compared to the top 7 highest paid senior direct reports the
differential becomes 65%.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
General Manager and CEO 360° Assessment Tool Project
Check-In

September 9, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the Board meeting on January 30, 2024, the Board approved the 2024 General Manager and
CEO (GM/CEO) Performance Assessment Framework. The approved framework was developed in
conversations among the current and immediate past Board Chairs, the Performance Committee, the
Executive Committee, the Chief People Officer, and the GM/CEO. Throughout those conversations a
consensus was reached to retain an external consultant to work with the GM/CEO and the Performance
Committee to develop and conduct a 360° Assessment of the GM/CEO performance as well as assist
the Board in the development and execution of its final performance assessment of the GM/CEO.
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for a total Compensation Study and
360° Assessment instrument consulting services solicitation and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a
contract for such services. The Board Office Executive Manager subsequently worked with the Chief
People Officer and the Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for quotations,
qualified firms to develop and deploy a 360° Assessment Tool, as well as create and administer the final
GM/CEO performance assessment. On July 9, 2024, RTD entered into an agreement with RKL Virtual
Management (RKL) to develop and conduct the 360° Assessment and assist the Board with the final
performance assessment of the GM/CEO.
During the Performance Committee’s meetings on July 22, 2024, and August 8, 2024, RKL presented
updates on the projects they were selected to complete. To identify the performance components to be
evaluated by the 360° Assessment Tool, RKL reviewed the GM/CEO’s job description and RTD’s
organizational values and spoke with all members of the Performance Committee and the GM/CEO
regarding their perspectives of the aforementioned. Additionally, RKL conducted a brief survey to collect
additional feedback from Directors. Through the feedback received, RKL has developed an initial set of
questions to be included in the 360° Assessment Tool, which assess how the GM/CEO is performing
relative to the Board-approved 2024 GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework.

Packet Pg. 49

1.C.2

The Performance Committee and GM/CEO have also previously discussed who would serve as raters and
provide feedback related to the GM/CEO’s performance as well as the process for selecting those raters.
RKL seeks the committee’s and the GM/CEO’s consensus on the rater selection process.
Separate from the 360° assessment process, in November 2024, each Board member will be asked to
complete a final performance evaluation form for the GM/CEO. This form will be developed by RKL in
September 2024 and will focus on assessing results in the performance areas agreed to in the Board
approved 2024 GM/CEO Performance Assessment Framework.
DISCUSSION
RKL has shared a document outlining the 360° Assessment Tool in its current form. This document
includes draft information on the following: the process for selecting raters, the inquiry areas, the
questions, and the rating scale. During the September 9 Performance Committee meeting, RKL will
provide additional insights as to the process and method used in the development of the tool, following
which, the members and the GM/CEO are to provide their collective input on the aforementioned. The
Board Office will accept additional feedback on the 360° Assessment Tool through September 17,
2024.
The 360° Assessment Tool is slated to come before the Performance Committee for final review and
concurrence during the Committee’s October 7, 2024 meeting. The 360° Assessment Tool will then be
distributed to the agreed-upon raters on October 9, 2024 to be returned no later than October 23, 2024.
The results of the 360° Assessment will be provided by RKL to the Board Office and the GM/CEO no
later than October 31, 2024. RKL will then present the results of the 360° Assessment during an
executive session at the Committee’s November 18, 2024 meeting.
This discussion aligns with all four strategic priorities (Customer Excellence, Community Value,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success) as the GM/CEO’s performance is directly tied to the
agency’s success in fulfilling its strategic priorities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from this discussion.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Community and Paratransit Surveys

September 9, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
John McKay, Executive Business Partner
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
In adopting the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan (Plan), the Board established four Strategic Priorities and the
associated Success Outcomes the agency will strive to achieve:
Strategic Priority
Success Outcome
Community Value: RTD Strives to be a strong
community partner, providing value to customers Establish baseline for community
as well as to the broader Denver Metro region value index and increase by 5%
while sustaining planet Earth

50% of outcome is that RTD
spends less money than it receives;
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the
50% of outcome is that the
management of all financial resources
community believes that it sees
value in RTD’s spending
RTD contracts with a third-party survey consultancy to conduct annual surveys to gauge agency
performance related to the Strategic Priorities of Customer Excellence and Community Value. The
consultancy administered community value as well as paratransit customer surveys in June and July
2024.
Additional intercept surveys for bus and rail customers took place between August 19 and August 30,
2024. The results of these surveys will be highlighted in a future Discussion Item.
DISCUSSION
Community Value Survey

Packet Pg. 97

1.C.3

Methodology: Surveys were mailed to a random sample of US postal service addresses within the RTD
service area. The surveys were available in English and Spanish and were administered from June 19
through July 12, 2024. Language assistance services were made available in an additional 20
languages. Lastly, for customers who are blind or visually impaired, assistance was made available
through the agency’s Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Office to complete the surveys.
Survey Results: Perceived Value and Community Net Promoter Score
Community opinion of RTD’s personal value and value to the region has improved year-over-year and is
higher than the national average. Results show that 86% of community members believe that RTD
provides value to the region, up from 84% in 2023. 68% believe that RTD provides value to them
personally, and 36% have a good or very good overall opinion of the agency. In comparison to the
national average, RTD’s value ratings for community value and personal value are 21% and 29%
greater, respectively. RTD’s Community NPS increased 22 points year over year and is significantly
higher than the national average as of 2023.
For reference, NPS is a measure of customer satisfaction with a product or service. Customers are asked
to respond to the question of whether they would recommend the product or service to friends or
relatives on a 10-point scale. The score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of individuals
responding with a rating of 0-6 (detractors) from those responding with a rating of 9 or 10 (promoters).

Key Factors: The three most important factors impacting community members’ perception of agency
value are depicted as follows. These factors are unchanged from 2023.
•
•
•

Providing access to places of employment
Providing affordable transportation options
Reducing traffic congestion

Among these factors, only providing access to places of employment is considered a key driver pursuant
to an analysis of the response data.
Customer Excellence Survey – Paratransit
Methodology: Sampling for the paratransit customer survey was derived from active customers who
were contacted by a combination of text message, email, and mail for survey distribution. The survey
ran from June 18 through July 19, 2024.
All customer surveys were available in English and Spanish. Language assistance services were made
available in an additional 20 languages. Lastly, for customers who are blind or visually impaired,
assistance was made available through the agency’s ADA Office to complete the surveys.

Packet Pg. 98

1.C.3

Customer Characteristics: Respondents are representative of the Denver metro area. Regarding
demography, paratransit customers are most likely to be women and over 55 years of age and are likely
to be Caucasian, while more than 30% of paratransit customers are Hispanic, Spanish, or Latino/a/x or
Black/African American. More than half of the respondents, or 52%, reported household incomes of less
than $25,000. Close to half of paratransit customers use RTD’s services for medical appointments.
Among respondents, 62% primarily use traditional Access-a-Ride complementary paratransit service for
trips whereas 12% rely more heavily on Access-on-Demand, a demand response service provided
through partnerships with transportation network companies and taxi operators.
Survey Results: Satisfaction Measures and Customer NPS
Overall satisfaction for paratransit services has improved year-over-year, with 80% of respondents
reporting they are satisfied or very satisfied with Access-a-Ride overall. The percentage of dissatisfied
and very dissatisfied Access-a-Ride customers decreased, from 13% in 2023 to 5% in 2024. Similarly,
only 6% of respondents in both 2023 and 2024 reported being dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the
service provided.
Compared to 2023, the paratransit customer NPS score for 2024 increased 39 points, to 59.
The list below represents the most important factors identified by customers for each mode:
Access-a-Ride
Vehicles arrive in scheduled window
Fare price
Ease of scheduling a trip
Travel time

Access-on-Demand
Fare price
Ease of scheduling a trip
Ability to get to places I need to go
Travel time

A key driver analysis indicates that travel time is a new area of opportunity for improvement in 2024-25.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The ongoing management of the Plan will not result in any direct financial impact at this time.
