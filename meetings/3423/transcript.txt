session before we move to the executive session? All righty, I don't see any hands.
Our next meeting date is Wednesday, November 30 at 1:00 PM. As a reminder that because of the
Thanksgiving holiday, the packet for the November 30th meeting will be published on Monday, November

Johnson, excuse me-- 2022 performance appraisal and 2023 compensation pursuant to the employment

In a moment, the committee will meet in executive session to receive legal advice regarding personnel
matters related to the General Manager and the CEO's 2022 performance appraisal and 2023
compensation pursuant to the employment agreement. Please note that the committee will reconvene in
open session after the executive session ends with no further business on the committee meeting
agenda. I will now entertain a motion to move into executive session pursuant to section 24-6-402 (4) (f)
(i) CRS for personnel matters related to General Manager and CEO Debra Johnson's 2022 performance
appraisal and 2023 compensation pursuant to the employment agreement and pursuant to section 24-6402 (4) (b) CRS for legal advice on the same.
PEGGY CATLIN: So moved.
SHONTEL LEWIS: So moved, Director-MARJORIE SLOAN: Sloan.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, Director Sloan. And the second.
PEGGY CATLIN: [INAUDIBLE]
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, Director Catlin. Thank you. So we have Director Sloan and Director Cat and as-Director Catlin, excuse me-- as a second. In order for us-- is anyone opposed to this motion?
OK, I didn't think so because five Directors must vote in the affirmative for the motion to pass. So if we
could just get a vote from the five Directors on the committee. I have Director Sloan.
MARJORIE SLOAN: Aye.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, thank you. Director Dishell?

BOBBY DISHELL: Aye.
SHONTEL LEWIS: Chair Buzek?
VINCE BUZEK: Aye.
SHONTEL LEWIS: And oh, me. Sorry, Aye. Oh, Director Catlin. Sorry, you went video and then me. Did
we lose Director Catlin?
VINCE BUZEK: She already went to the executive session.
SHONTEL LEWIS: There you go. So maybe that's an affirmative. I don't know. Is that OK, General
Counsel?
MELANIE SNYDER: I think she dropped right after you said that. You called for whether there are any no
votes, and so I think that's when she dropped. So I do think the record shows that she was in agreement.
SHONTEL LEWIS: OK, so would all those entitled to participate in the executive session please move
into the other meeting instance at this time?
