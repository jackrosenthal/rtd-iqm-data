BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: January 8, 2020

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

January 8, 2020

Board Meeting Date: January 14, 2020

Subject:

May 2020 Service Changes Discussion

DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions aimed at addressing an
operator shortage which has resulted in increase in loss of service and service unreliability. As presented
in the December 19, 2019 Board of Director’s Study Session, this proposal seeks to reduce the number
of operators necessary to provide RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching our service offerings
to our operator headcount. The Board adopted Service Standards were used as a guiding policy in the
development of this plan, which include consideration toward ridership performance and service
duplication.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Re:

Service Availability – December 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.58% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in December 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (December) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:





December 2019 – 82.59 hours
December 2018 – 124.27 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 3,599.17 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 10,100.03 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in December were special events and unplanned
bus bridges (events include: AB Overloads, Broncos Ride, Parade of Lights, and New Year’s Eve
Fireworks).
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.58% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it
was necessary to cover 2,640 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled
days off). This represents approximately 21,120 hours of service being provided by a “6th day”
RTD operator and does not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor
partners, First Transit and TransDev.
