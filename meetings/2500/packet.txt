Issues
• Revenues are down from the 2015 APE/ financial
plan forecast each year through 2025
• Total revenues are below the 2015 APE forecast until
2034
• As was done in 2015 APE, FISA is completely
depleted to cover O&M in this planning horizon
• As was done in 2015 APE, BASE revenues will be
used to balance FasTracks through 2040
• Currently still working on balancing APE/ financial
plan, so all assumptions may not hold for final version

Background on Charging For RTD Parking
• Originally RTD could charge for parking.
• 2006 legislation halted pay parking option.
• 2007 legislature relaxed constraints – lead RTD’s
current parking program.
• 2013 legislature allowed daily parking fees only at
non-District facilities.
o SB 13-027 – to encourage third parties to build
structured parking for daily public use.

Attachment: Parking Management Briefing 7.26.16 (2858 : Parking Management Briefing)

3.1.a

Limited Authority to Charge For
Parking at District Parking Facilities
RTD may charge a parking fee at a District parking
facility in only three circumstances:
1. Vehicles registered to address outside the district
2. Vehicles parked for more than 24 hours
3. Reserved Parking
C.R.S. Sec. 32-9-119.9 (1)(a)

Packet Pg. 14

Attachment: Parking Management Briefing 7.26.16 (2858 : Parking Management Briefing)

3.1.a

Non-District Parking Facilities
A non-district parking facility may charge all
parkers every day but RTD has limited authority
at a district facility.
“A public or private entity may lease, own, or
operate a parking lot or structure available for use
by the public at a transit station. Unless operated
under a contract with RTD that specifies terms of
use and operation and provides RTD with a share
of the revenues it generates, it is not a district
parking facility.”

shifted to lots without parking charges.

poor performance.

Anticipated Patron Response to
Parking Charges
• Based on economic principles and other agency
experience.
• Limited transit agency studies have been
completed.
• Patron response depends on:
• Free or paid parking at trip destination;
EcoPass; parking lot utilization rate; and
station accessibility.
11
Packet Pg. 22

Anticipated Patron Response to
Parking Charges (cont.)
• Calculations also include a range of assumptions
regarding sensitivity: will patrons who object to parking
charges
o find another way to ride RTD?
o no longer utilize RTD?
o choose RTD as the best choice among the
alternatives?
• All calculations are in a range, to reflect variability
in patron responses.

Risk Assessment
Identifies pros and cons associated with third party
management. “In general terms, entering into a 3rd party
management agreement with a private entity might
provide valuable benefits, such as upfront capital and
expertise, but could also carry more risk than selfoperation.”

parking charges can be feasibly implemented at RTD
facilities, and multiple scenarios would be revenue
positive.

2008 Board Approved Plan Guiding
Principles
•

Recover the cost of service from those who use the
service.

•

No general fund subsidy, financially self sustaining.

•

Adopt a higher fee for “out-of-District” patrons
o Reduce the financial advantage enjoyed by
patrons residing outside of RTD’s taxing
authority.

•

Manage demand at busy facilities with incentives to
“shift” use to underutilized facilities.
22
Packet Pg. 33

Current Parking Management
Program
• All facilities in each corridor (avoids bypassing).
• First day is free for “in-District” patrons.
o $2.00 per day for second and subsequent
days.
• $4.00 per day every day for “out-of-District”
patrons.
• 30 days maximum stay.
• “In-District” can buy reserved parking for $42/mo.
o Reserved from 5am to 10am weekdays.

Differences in the Projects Lead to
Unique Considerations
• RTD helps cities create opportunities for improved
land use over surface lots.
• Differences in funding, ownership, federal interests,
other parking demands, and prior agreements.
• RTD will continue to negotiate and recommend
parking plans appropriate for each individual
location.
• Factors to consider when evaluating each plan
include capital contributions, federal funding,
ownership of land, facility and spaces, O&M
responsibilities and funding.

Takeaways from Partnered Projects
• RTD may negotiate agreements for shared use and
allow a third party to charge for parking, but not share
in revenues.
• Revenues from parking should be used to offset O&M
costs, capital contributions, loss of use, etc.
• Agreements should ensure protection of RTD-funded
parking and flexibility to adjust parking management
based on board policy, changes in enforcement
techniques, or new statutory authority.
• RTD needs consistency in management approach to
avoid confusion for our passengers.

Packet Pg. 47

Summary
Universal Pay for Parking Study
• Operationally feasible and revenue positive.
• RTD can implement with legislative change or
partnering.
Current Parking Management Program
• Usage and revenue has increased in managed
facilities and for out-of-District usage.
Partnering Projects
• RTD may negotiate agreements for shared use
and third party pay parking, provided RTD

protects its investments.

Proposed Policy Guidance
• Protect RTD investments and ensure
availability of parking for transit customers.
• Offset O&M, capital investments, land
acquisition, loss of use, cost of management
with revenue.
• Balance flexibility for future changes in priorities
and technology with retaining adequate control
of the facility.
• Emphasize consistency in customer experience.

• Consider whether to return to the legislature
or develop guidance on partnering.
• Gather Board feedback and input regarding
parking policy.
• Go to universal charging or maintain status
quo (no pilots).
