### B. General Manager presents his 2019 Core and Task Goal Plan

Committee Chair Walker asked General Manager Genova to present his proposed 2019 goals.

General Manager Genova said that the document before the committee was in the same format as the previous year’s document. He said each goal was identified, and the categories of performance were listed under each goal. He noted that, in order to have achieved expectations, the he would have to meet each element under the broader goal, though he would be rated as needing improvement if he were to fail to achieve any single element of the “achieved goal” criteria. He stated that there were five strategic priorities included in the document, whereas in previous years the General Manager was evaluated on three task goals. He said no changes were made to the core goals themselves.

Director Menten noted that she would suggest changes to certain goals at the appropriate time during the committee meeting.

Committee Chair Walker said the committee would let General Manager Genova present his goals first, and in doing so, he could possibly address some of the things that Director Menten sought to change. He asked Director Menten the goals to which she would propose changes.

Director Menten said that her proposed changes were highlighted on the documents she distributed.

Committee Chair Walker suggested that the General Manager should go through all of the goals first, at which point the committee could discuss changes. He asked whether the General Manager should review the core goals.

Chair Tisdale said that it might be beneficial to set the table first.

Director Deadwyler said that, because the goals were the same as in previous years, it would make more sense to look at the modifications first.

Chair Tisdale suggested that the committee review all of the core and task goals and then discuss modifications.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, asked the General Manager whether any of the elements underneath the core goals had changed.

General Manager Genova replied that he had made no changes.

Committee Chair Walker said that the committee would discuss the tasks goals.

General Manager Genova stated that Task Goal #1, Enhance Safety and Security, was the same bullet that was discussed during the joint Board/SLT strategic planning retreat in March 2018. He said his proposed review criteria under the “achieved goal” were: Fostering a safety culture, continuing with the requirement for a safety core goal for all employees, reporting of on-the-job injury data, introducing safety roadshows, initiating a safety audit of bus operations, increasing safety presence; and initiating live video capability on buses. He noted that he would need improvement if he were to fail on any one of those elements.

Director Menten said she thought live video capability was already available on buses.

General Manager Genova said that video recordings were logged on buses and, in the event of a known incident, transmitted to a repository via Wi-Fi once the buses returned to the shop. He said that security could not see into buses or light rail trains in real time, though he said this capability was available on commuter rail trains.

Chair Tisdale summarized that this was a change from recorded video capabilities to a live video system.

General Manager Genova explained that security would be able to see a live view in the in command center if they became aware of an incident. He said that, with the exception of the 29 newly purchased vehicles, the current light rail vehicles would need a complete hardware change to add live-view capabilities, whereas the buses required changes to existing network connectivity rather than hardware.

Director Menten stated that the goals were purposed partly on driving the budget.

General Manager Genova clarified that whatever the Board adopted would drive the budget.

Director Menten asked the cost of the added patrols and the live video system.

General Manager Genova said the live-video capabilities would run $250,000 to $500,000 per year. He said the agency was looking at ways to package the purchase of all cellular data for the agency, not just for security, which would be more cost effective.

Director Menten asked whether there would be any additional cost for subcontractors for the additional patrols.

General Manager Genova said that was a possibility, though he said the cost would depend on the Board’s wishes. He stated that additional resources would be deployed on the bus side based on available data. He said that additional dollars would be helpful if the Board wanted to make improvements to the patrols and that the estimated cost for adding transit patrols to certain bus routes would run under $500,000. He indicated that increasing RTD’s security presence by placing an officer on every light rail train was a priority, particularly because there had been an increase in recent incidents. He said the cost would be $1.5 million annually to add an officer to every train and that the security presence could be phased in, though he said he would push the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) to finance the initiative.

Chair Tisdale asked whether General Manager Genova meant he would add an officer to every train or to every train consist.

General Manager Genova said that the agency operates two-car, three-car, and four-car train consists and that an officer would be added to each consist. He said that another benefit of having officers committed to certain light rail lines was a sense of ownership, as seen on the commuter rail lines. He also said the officers would get to know the patrons, and he stated that fare inspection approached 100% on commuter rail.

Director Deadwyler said that the goal stated the security presence would be increased but not to a specific level. She asked whether a 50% increase would be appropriate.

General Manager Genova said that some kind of qualifier could be added.

Committee Chair Walker said he had conversations about goal setting with Dennis Yaklich, Marketing Research Manager, and Lou Cripps, Senior Manager of Asset Management. He said that the goals were being set without being tied in to the budget and suggested that the questions being asked could better be served later on as the 2019 budget was taking shape.

Director Mihalik said it was understood that the goals were all dependent upon the Board’s approval.

Director Deadwyler said she understood but reiterated that she felt the goal was vague. She asked whether the goal could be scratched out later if it was determined that the budget would not allow for an increase in security.

Chair Tisdale said that was his question as well.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that might be her question as well. She said that the committee would approve the goals, and the finance staff would then set the budget to be responsive to those goals. She said she wanted to clarify that that process was occurring at that time and that a decision needed to be made. She said that the finance staff would alert the committee if any goal could not be worked into the budget.

Chair Tisdale said that Ms. McManus was correct. He said it would help if the goal contained some sort of metric, which would then indicate how much the attainment of that goal would likely cost and would allow the agency to determine whether funds were available. He stated that the goal-setting process needed to sync with the budget process. He suggested that the goal be set somewhat ambiguously at first and that numbers could be plugged in later on.

Director Deadwyler said her concern was that in years past Directors stated at the General Manager’s end-of-year review that they were not aware that the General Manager had performed certain tasks. She said that she did not want the committee to forget to plug in a number at a later date, and she stated the General Manager’s performance could not be measured without a metric.

General Manager Genova suggested that a number be inserted during the goal-setting process in the committee rather than revisiting the goal later on. General Manager Genova said that the cost of increasing security presence on light rail by 50% in 2019 would be $750,000.

Committee Chair Walker said he was concerned about setting conflicting goals or setting goals for which there was not enough money to accomplish.

General Manager Genova said he was cognizant of the budgetary considerations during the drafting of the goals each year. He said that only a limited amount of money was available for any of the goals, and he mentioned that five strategic priorities were identified during the joint Board/SLT strategic planning retreat, which he said would impact the budget and cause the agency to spread out the available funds among the five priorities.

Director Deadwyler said that was why the metric was important to her.

Director Mihalik said that the items under discussion, the approval of funding for an increase in security presence and the approval of funding for live video on buses, seemed to him to be Board goals, meaning that the Board would have to approve the funding. He recognized that there was work that went along with implementing those programs.

General Manager Genova said that staff needed to consider the budget during the project prioritization process, which required them to shift a lot of objectives. He said the midterm budget was practically a one-year plan. He added that the goals of the General Manager were the goals of the organization, and he said that, while he himself was evaluated on the goals, the goals were the agency’s way of setting targets to accomplish.

Director Menten asked about the language regarding safety being a goal for salaried employees. She also asked about safety roadshows for represented employees.

General Manager Genova responded that the represented employees were not evaluated as salaried employees were. He said safety was a core goal for all employees and that safety was considered in everything the agency did.

Ms. McManus said that a safety goal was added to all employee performance evaluations in 2017.

Director Menten asked for clarification on the review element involving the safety audit program for bus operations.

General Manager Genova said that the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) issued comprehensive rules regarding state safety oversight for light rail, but he noted that no such rules existed for bus operations. He said the complete oversight cycle took three years to complete. He stated that he wanted to add the same type of audit process to the bus system, using the same methodology and systems as with the light rail system.

Director Menten asked whether RTD’s auditors would oversee the program.

General Manager Genova said that Safety, Security, and Asset Management would handle it.

Director Menten said that the committee needed to cover as much ground as possible within a reasonable amount of time during the meeting.

Regarding the timeline of events for the review of the General Manager’s goals, Committee Chair Walker noted that the General Manager would come back to present changes on the June 26th meeting for the committee’s approval. He said the committee would be in communication with the General Manager to ensure that the committee was satisfied with the changes to the goals.

General Manager Genova said that was true, unless the committee came to a consensus during that same committee meeting.

Chair Tisdale said he wanted to go back to a broader point. He said the strategic priorities had been expanded from three to five and that one could visualize the goals on a pie chart with smaller pie pieces than in years past. In reality, though, he said that it was not so simplistic, because certain strategic priorities flowed into one another, and there were certain elements under one goal that impacted others, such as fiscal sustainability and asset management. He said he wanted to emphasize that point because it impacted the budget, and he stated that the concept that spending $100 to implement a given goal would necessarily cause a subsequent reduction of $100 available for other goals was inaccurate.

Director Deadwyler said she agreed with that thought. She said that the committee was determining outcomes, regardless of whether the goals overlapped. She reiterated that the first element regarding live video on buses was very specific, but the element regarding increased security presence was less accurate. She said that determining whether the General Manager exceeded expectations required specificity.

Committee Chair Walker asked if the General Manager had a number in mind.

General Manager Genova said that he did not but could insert one.

Committee Chair Walker moved on to Task Goal #2, regarding service and human capital.

General Manager Genova said that he would specifically address the second-to-last bullet, regarding “incrementally optimized service through the runboard process to bring balance regarding service delivered and headcount available”.

Chair Tisdale said this sounded like right-sizing.

General Manager Genova said that he saw that term as being negative and preferred the term “service optimization”. He said the agency was faced with large vacancies in operator headcounts, which was the cause of dropped runs on the current service plan. He stated that adjustments had been made to the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to help improve recruitment and retention, though he noted the agency had historically never been at or below 90% headcount. He said the problem needed to be addressed from both sides, meaning that the agency needed to look at the areas that were meeting service standards and to balance out the services offered with the human capital available. He said the “exceeded expectations” criterion would mean restoring the headcount to historical levels.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the measurements had been used as evaluative criteria in the past.

General Manager Genova said they were new. He said similar numbers had been used under another goal the previous year, but with higher percentages.

General Manager Genova said that the reduction of mandating was also a goal criterion, and he noted that mandating was one of the biggest issues behind the entire goal, specifically increasing human capital but at the same time making sure service was being adjusted and directing staff to reduce mandating. He said about 70-75% of the operators were being mandated, most of whom were mandated four or five times per month. He said the goal was to reduce those numbers to 50% of operators being mandated no more than twice per month.

Director Menten asked whether the Board could see the chart that depicted the agency’s historical headcount.

General Manager Genova said he would provide that, as well as information on mandating.

Committee Chair Walker said it was his understanding that having 100% headcount was not optimal, because some operators wanted to work extra shifts.

General Manager Genova said that the headcount for certain positions fluctuated month by month.

Chair Tisdale asked whether the General Manager’s goal met or exceeded any reductions in mandating specified in the CBA.

General Manager Genova said the CBA contained several provisions designed to reduce the amount of mandating. He said there was no specific number or benchmark because there were many variables. Moving on to Task Goal #3, General Manager Genova said that the “achieved goal” criteria were the same as the previous year’s.

Director Menten said that one of the review criteria dealt with minimizing debt. She suggested a change to one of the General Manager’s core goals that would require him to “aggressively pay down debt”.

General Manager Genova said that he could look into Director Menten’s request.

Committee Chair Walker asked what “aggressive” meant as the term related to the General Manager’s goal.

Director Menten said that the committee wanted SMART (meaning specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-limited) goals.

General Manager Genova said he would speak to Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, to make sure the proposed change to the goal could make a meaningful statement.

Director Broom noted that the Board approved all issuance of debt. He stated that bonds were callable but featured premiums if called early, which would require the agency to budget the funds to accommodate that early call. He said he was trying to determine how the General Manager would have much influence on the agency’s debt going up or down. Director Broom said the General Manager proposed items in the budget, such as buying a certain number of vehicles through certificates of participation (COPs), and said that refunding opportunities were a function of the marketplace. He said debt was typically reduced during refunding opportunities.

General Manager Genova noted that certain refunding opportunities were no longer available due to changes in tax law.

Director Menten suggested that efficiencies could be found in agency expenditures that would go toward debt payments.

General Manager Genova said that either an efficiency or use of a reserve could satisfy that criterion.

Director Menten said that her proposed change to the goal would require efficiency savings to be placed into a reserve.

Chair Tisdale said the decision of what to do with the money was more of a policy decision. He agreed that paying down debt was a good idea, but he said what happened to savings was up to the Board, rather than a task or a core goal for the General Manager.

Director Broom said that most likely opportunities were when sales tax exceeded what was budgeted. He said that the Board should determine what to do with surplus funds.

Director Menten asked whether debt reduction should be a goal for the General Manager.

Director Broom said the disposition of surplus funds should be a decision of the Board rather than that being responsibility of the General Manager.

Committee Chair Walker said that the requirement for the General Manager could be included, but he said that doing so could restrict the use of funds for some other beneficial purpose if there were a mandate to pay down debt.

Director Menten disagreed.

Committee Chair Walker said that every debt payment minimized debt.

Director Deadwyler agreed with Director Broom. She said that the General Manager would meet his goal if he were to pay down the agency’s debt. She said she did not agree with removing that requirement.

General Manager Genova said that he took the committee’s direction as being to strike Director Menten’s suggestion for the addition of a criterion regarding the aggressive reduction of debt

Director Menten said the decision to reduce debt never came from the Board but rather was decided by staff.

Director Deadwyler said that the Board was always told where the money would go.

General Manager Genova said that staff presented recommendations, but the Board could always direct staff to do something else.

Committee Chair Walker said that staff recommendations were just recommendations and that the Board could do what it wanted. He said most Board decisions were in line with staff recommendations.

Director Deadwyler said that the Directors did not dispute what staff told them.

Committee Chair Walker said that not every Director felt that way.

Director Broom said one would hope that would be the case. He said staff knew the best interests of the organization.

Director Deadwyler said that minimizing debt should not even be a question, because that was part of the staff’s job.

Committee Chair Walker said that anything above and beyond should be up to the Board.

Director Mihalik asked whether there was a mechanism to measure how the General Manager could exceed expectations by reducing debt.

Committee Chair Walker said that the Board could require the General Manager to reduce debt by 10%, but he said he did not know whether such a number was achievable.

Director Mihalik said that he agreed with the idea of divorcing the reduction of debt from the determination of where the money would go. He again asked if there was a mechanism in place and if one was warranted.

Committee Chair Walker said there was a mechanism in that staff saw opportunities for the agency to identify uses for reserves. He said the agency recently chose not pay down other debt in order to pay the operators.

Director Mihalik asked for a measurement rather than a mechanism.

Committee Chair Walker said that adding a measurement might make the review criterion out of the realm of achievable.

Director Mihalik said that was a fair point, but he said he was just trying to get the discussion back to the original question.

Director Menten said that she would like to add “increase reserves” as a review criterion. She said that the reserves were used twice during the committee meeting two days earlier. She asked whether increasing reserves was already a review criterion.

General Manager Genova said he would review the core coals. He said that handling reserves was part of the budget process and was a policy decision regarding how best to use the agency’s resources. He said the reserves could be increased in some years and not in others. He stated that the agency sought to build reserves both in the annual and midterm budgets.

Director Menten said that the agency was experiencing an economic peak, which she said was the appropriate time to increase reserves. She noted the Board took action two days earlier to spend money from the reserves.

Committee Chair Walker moved on to Task Goal #4.

General Manager Genova said that this goal, transportation transformation, was a new goal for the agency. He said this was an opportunity for the agency to look at alternative service delivery approaches or pilot programs and as examples he noted the State Highway 119 project, the commencement of the Colfax construction project, the completion of a bus rapid transit (BRT) study, the identification of first/last mile pilot programs, the advertisement of requests for proposals (RFPs) for system optimization and a comprehensive system analysis. Regarding system optimization, General Manager Genova said that agencies had done this over the years and had increased ridership by putting resources where the riders were. He said that the agency could review the entire network to lay out the most efficient grid, particularly with respect to bus service areas and frequencies. He said an RFP would be issued and would cost about $1.5 million, and the turnaround time would be 18 months from the time of the award. He said he envisioned heavy stakeholder involvement, with working groups working alongside RTD staff, augmented by public participation and stakeholder input.

Chair Tisdale said he had hesitation with the last part of the General Manager’s proposal. He said the notion of having a whiteboarding process, and the notion of having the public come in without the benefit of guidance and mentoring from staff, was a scary prospect, and he considered the Pass Program Working Group to be a parallel. He said the policy derived from the whiteboarding process could be divisive, similar to the recommendations of the PPWG, and he suggested that activist groups might become involved. He said that certain districts would likely see outsize benefits.

General Manager Genova said the point was well taken and the plan would need to be developed and presented to the Board.

Director Hoy said he agreed with what Chair Tisdale had said and stated the process could be totally out of control.

Director Broom suggested that the agency wait until after the buildout of light rail lines was complete before tearing the system apart. He said new patrons had recently come on board who needed to become more familiar with the system.

General Manager Genova noted that former Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, Bruce Abel, would be working part time and would be involved in the process. He said that he had perhaps given too broad an explanation of the whiteboarding process, and he said staff felt the timing was good to do a comprehensive analysis of system.

Director Broom asked whether the program was in the budget.

General Manager Genova said that it was included in the budget. He said the project would begin in 2019 and would be an 18-month process, finishing sometime in 2020, with implementation in 2021. He said a number of agencies had done this and that some areas, such as Houston, were seeing increased ridership.

Committee Chair Walker noted that the committee needed to review one more task goal, at which point Director Menten’s changes could be considered.

Director Deadwyler said that it sounded as though, by engaging with the public, the decision-making was being taken away from the Board. She said there was no specificity. She said she disagreed with the proposal and questioned whether seeking public involvement would yield useful results. She said that only activists, not the members of the public who could provide useful insight, would participate.

General Manager Genova said that her point was taken.

Director Menten asked whether transit vouchers, particularly in areas where fare subsidies fell outside of acceptable levels, were included in the discussion about alternate transit options.

General Manager Genova said that the pilot concept might be broader than that. He said that such a proposal would be getting down to a certain level of detail not covered by the pilot, and he stated the program might involve an agreement with the private sector or others for novel approaches, such as replacing the Call-n-Ride service with a company such as Lyft or doing a tech layover that would create efficiencies.

Committee Chair Walker said he did not mind big, messy public meetings. He said he had been involved in some and that good ideas came out. He said that opening up the process did not mean that all of the recommendations would necessarily be implemented.

General Manager Genova said that the pilot would not be like the PPWG, where the participants were given principles and guidelines. He said the pilot would be more process-driven, engaging stakeholders in different ways and soliciting a good amount of input.

Committee Chair Walker said that, in such a program, both RTD and the public would learn and people outside of industry would gain knowledge.

Director Deadwyler asked how participants would gain knowledge if they did not participate.

Committee Chair Walker said that not all of the participants were agitators. He said that in the last bullet point under Task Goal #4 contained the phrase “advertises and awards” in the “achieved goal” language. He said the award was beyond the General Manager’s control.

General Manager Genova agreed and said that “awards” should be changed to “recommends”.

Director Menten said that she would have a change later on regarding grants.

Director Deadwyler suggested a change in the verbiage of the goal, from “gains” to “obtains”.

Director Broom asked about the Volkswagen settlement.

General Manager Genova said that RTD would be competing with other transit providers for the available settlement funds.  He then proceeded to Task Goal #5.

Chair Tisdale asked whether the goal was any different from the previous year.

General Manager Genova said the goal was the same as before.

### C. Review committee requested changes to GM Core and Task Goals for 2019 presented by GM Genova

Committee Chair Walker said that, if everyone was amenable, the committee would take up Director Menten’s suggested changes.

Director Menten said she had sent the committee an email earlier that day that summarized her proposed changes. She said that the only aspect of Core Goal #1 regarding the successful delivery of transit services she sought to change was in the “exceeded expectations” portion. She proposed a change to require the General Manager to achieve both 90% of performance measures and the provision of outstanding and noteworthy special services.

Committee Chair Walker asked why Director Menten requested the change.

Director Menten said she expected the agency to provide outstanding and noteworthy service every day.

General Manager Genova asked whether she was specifically referring to special events, as opposed to regular service, and she said yes.

Ms. McManus noted that the special events serviced by RTD changed from year to year.

Chair Tisdale said that he interpreted Director Menten’s suggested change as applying to the provision of special services only. He said the thing that gave him pause was that the suggested change was made to the “exceeds expectations” criteria, but no corollary change was made to the “needs improvement category. He said the philosophical issue was that, to be rated as needing improvement, the General Manager needed only to fail on any one of the “achieved goal” criteria, whereas in order to exceed expectations, the General Manager would be required to exceed in all of the extra criteria. He said that, if Director Menten’s suggested change were adopted, he would suggest a change in which the General Manager would have to fail on all of the “achieved goal” criteria in order to be rated as needing improvement.

Director Broom said that he had heartburn about special events. He said the agency was short on operators, and he felt the operators were being overburdened in order to provide those special services, which was not in the best long-term interests of the agency.

General Manager Genova said that providing special services was challenging, especially for impromptu events like marches. He said stakeholders were not shy about calling their Directors.

Director Deadwyler said she understood Chair Tisdale’s point that, if the General Manager were to fail on any one evaluation criterion, he would not be able to exceed expectations.

Chair Tisdale said to miss on any one element would mean that the General Manager’s performance would need improvement. He noted that Director Menten had only proposed requiring multiple “exceeds expectations” on certain goals.

Director Deadwyler said that in her career she had to meet certain goals in order to receive a bonus. She felt there was nothing wrong with requiring the General Manager to meet all elements in the “exceeds expectations” category

Chair Tisdale said his point was about the fairness of such a scenario.

Director Deadwyler said she would discuss the topic with Chair Tisdale at another time.

Director Mihalik said that he did not want to minimize what it took to deliver special services, but he said that, if the agency met 90% of performance measures, the other goals should fall in line.

General Manager Genova said that special services were delivered in addition to the regular service. He said the performance measures tracked the achievement of regular daily service goals, and none of the measurements accounted for special services.

Director Mihalik asked how much of the special service was mandated.

General Manager Genova responded that much of it was mandated, though he said the extent would depend on which day an event fell. He said that providing service for nighttime Broncos games was particularly difficult because the time during which service was necessary deviated from the agency’s normal hours of service.

Committee Chair Walker agreed with Chair Tisdale, saying that “achieved” meant “achieved”, and he said that the attainment of any other goal would exceed expectations. He said the question was why someone would have to win a game by four points when one would do. He noted that the General Manager’s discretionary performance payout was not attached to his performance rating and would be determined through a separate decision.

Director Menten asked whether what Committee Chair Walker was saying was that the Board would not use this as a performance measure.

Committee Chair Walker said he would be a no. He clarified that the committee, rather than the Board, decided on the General Manager’s goals.

Chair Tisdale added that the Board would address any discretionary performance payout separately and that the committee would not make a recommendation on the amount.

Director Menten said she would like to leave the item open to the committee’s next discussion.

Chair Tisdale said he personally thought that Director Menten had good ideas about additional “exceeds expectations” criteria.

Director Menten said that she did not feel that the two “exceeds expectations” criteria did not address teambuilding and said they were more outward-facing criteria. She suggested that an internal survey should be conducted that would assess whether the agency had moved past its silo issue and whether employees felt they were being listened to, which would translate to better service.

General Manager Genova asked whether Director Menten was suggesting that all of the criteria would need to be met for him to have exceeded expectations.

Chair Tisdale said that Director Menten was suggesting that the General Manager would need to exceed expectations on element #3, plus either element #1 or #2. He said she was not contemplating removing the first two goals. He said that #3 was a legitimate point to be made, that the General Manager should show that the agency was a cohesive team. Referring to the earlier discussion, he said that the General Manager should only have to exceed expectations on one element. He said he did not mind adding another “exceeds expectations” criterion, which he said would show that the Board appreciates the leadership of the General Manager.

Committee Chair Walker said he read the change as requiring the General Manager to achieve all three criteria in order to exceed expectations.

Director Menten said she was not impressed with criterion #1 or #2, but she said that criterion #3 said something.

Committee Chair Walker said he did not disagree.

Director Mihalik said he agreed with the idea of putting out a survey as long as it was structured appropriately.

Director Broom said it would depend on how the questions were worded. He said that he would like to see a baseline before adding the survey to the General Manager’s goals, because he said he would need to see how the General Manager improved over time.

Committee Chair Walker said that a baseline would be nice. He noted that the agency had a salary freeze for years, which would have affected employees’ responses.

Ms. McManus added that the agency employed surveys on a regular basis, noting that the last one was done through former employee John Elias.

General Manager Genova said that survey was the last major one issued.

Ms. McManus asked whether there was a schedule for conducting surveys and how often they were issues. She said there was a considerable cost.

General Manager Genova said that to have a numerical goal without a baseline would be arbitrary. He said that employees might give negative feedback because of the amount of an annual raise.

Committee Chair Walker said the number of responses would also be a factor.

Ms. McManus suggested that the survey could be structured so that the elements were internal to the departments. She said the high approval rating of the CBA showed that employees were happy with the process, and she added that another element might be employee recognition, which she said the Directors did not really see. She noted that there were employee picnics and other such functions that the Directors did not regularly attend, and she noted that the Directors could ascertain the employees’ assessment of the agency if they were to speak with the employees directly.

Director Broom asked how the rank and file employees would recognize the Board members.

Ms. McManus said that Directors in the past would visit with employees for hours. She said she did not feel that a survey would be a good answer, because, as Director Broom had said, the survey would only generate negative comments, because the survey would present the employees an opportunity to give them.

Committee Chair Walker added he did not know how much weight the survey responses should have, especially when the Board also influenced the agency. He said the Board should perhaps be part of the survey.

Ms. McManus said that employees volunteered to do tasks for the agency outside of work hours, which she said showed employee engagement. She said the agency could be better at communicating what was going on.

Director Menten, speaking to core goal #3, returned to the goal of aggressively paying off the agency’s debt load. She noted that beefing up reserves was not in any of the goals. Regarding core goal #4, regarding equal employment opportunity, she said she had long envisioned requiring graduation from the disadvantaged business enterprise (DBE) and small business enterprise (SBE) program. She said there were people who wanted to occupy a privileged position, which she said was not fair. She stated she would like to see the agency put a graduation requirement in place and wanted to open up the topic for discussion.

General Manager Genova said that federal rules would not allow such a requirement.

Director Menten asked whether the agency’s DBE and SBE for certain projects were determined solely by the agency or whether they were federally mandated.

General Manager Genova said that the agency set the goals and the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) concurred and regularly reviewed the agency’s historical targets. He said the DBE targets applied to projects with federal funding and SBE was for non-federal projects.

Director Menten said she felt the agency was paying more on contracts and that the programs were a form of reverse discrimination, which she said she would discuss with Congressman Perlmutter. Regarding core goal #5, she said she wanted to add a requirement that the General Manager conduct quarterly public outreach meetings, to be held at night and on a rotational basis within the district.

Director Broom said that telephone town halls seemed to get more people involved than district meetings. He said people would prefer to dial in than to attend meetings.

Director Menten said that a live video stream could also let people know more about the agency.

### D. Review SMART Goals

Committee Chair Walker said that the committee did not discuss SMART goals specifically.

Ms. McManus said that the SMART goals were being contemplated in the committee’s discussion.

### E. GM Committee to provide consensus on final goals and recommended action to bring to the full Board on June 26th

Ms. McManus said that the committee could reconvene on June 5th. She said that in that meeting the committee could come to consensus on the core goal changes, after which the General Manager could present his amended goals at a later date, possibly on June 26th, in order to move forward with a recommended action to the Board at the June 26th Board Meeting. She asked the General Manager whether that would give him enough time.

General Manager Genova said that he could make the minor goal changes discussed by the committee in time for the June 5th meeting and would make additional changes based on the consensus of the committee.

Ms. McManus reiterated that the committee had not reached consensus. She suggested that the committee complete its work sooner rather than later in on account of the budget process.

Director Mihalik asked how much a survey of agency employees would cost.

General Manager Genova said the last one cost between $30,000 and $50,000. He said it took a lot of effort to get people to respond, and he said the agency wanted at least a 50% response rate.

Director Menten said that all that was needed was a box and some index cards.

Ms. McManus responded that it depended on what the agency hoped to achieve from the survey.

General Manager Genova asked for clarification whether, in the follow-up meeting, all of the core goals were up for discussion.

Director Menten said even the task goals were up for discussion.

Ms. McManus said that in order to stay on task the committee would have to reconvene before June 26. She said the committee needed to reach consensus on the committee’s recommended action to the Board.

Director Broom suggested that the committee could reconvene on June 26th prior to the Board Meeting.

Ms. McManus said that the next two weeks would not work and suggested a tentative plan for June 5th. She reiterated that the General Manager could not present changes to the goals if the committee did not come to consensus on the changes to the goals.

Committee Chair Walker said the follow-up meeting should be quick.

General Manager Genova said he would provide a redline version of the amended goals.
