I. Park Meadows Mall Presentation
Pam Schenk with Park Meadows talked about how excited they are to be able to
offer a ride-for-free program for their employees beginning November 16th through
December 28th. She provided a display of the plans at Park Meadow to provide a
pedestrian access area that will support their development plans for new
businesses that would offer after-hours services. Pam emphasized these plans
have been in the works for some time. The need for access control is to ensure
Park Meadows will remain economically viable by effectively managing the limited
parked spaces for the customers who frequent the mall.
Cal Marsella further elaborated that the $350,000 request was for access control
and egress. He indicated that during his trips to the mall, the west area where
RTD will touchdown gets full quickly and some form of parking access
management is required. He pointed out that the Park Meadows Mall provides
significant sales tax revenue to the district.
Several Directors expressed their concerns over the message that this will send to
riders of the RTD system that they are not wanted at Park Meadows Mall and
how it may tarnish RTD reputation. Directors McMullen, Daly, Yamrick and
Christopher felt strongly that the wrong message was being sent to the RTD
riders and felt other options needed to be explored rather than gate access
control. In general while all of the Directors felt some discomfort with this plan,
they felt that it was in the best interest of our riders to approve this action so that
plans could continue for the pedestrian bridge to Park Meadow Mall.
MOTION:

Director Daly made the motion to
approve the proposed access control
system for County Line Station to Park
Meadows Mall.
Director McMullen seconded the motion.

VOTE ON
THE MOTION:

The motion passed ten in favor (Brohl,
Busck, Chacon, Elfenbein, Kinton, Kemp,
Pulliam, Quinlan, Ruchman, and Tayer)
and four against (Christopher, McMullen,
Daly and Yamrick). Chair Martinez was
absent.
Chair Chacon declared the motion
PASSED.

II. Low Floor Alternative Analysis
Lloyd Mack provided a presentation on vehicle access which looked at several
other agencies for platform heights and accessibility. He reviewed in particular
five agencies that have subsequently modified their stations: Dallas, Portland,
Salt Lake City, San Diego and Santa Clara. He shared some of the issues that

Summary of the FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting held on Tuesday, November 13, 2007

Denver experienced at the various platform stations such as driveway access to
garage entrances off Stout Street, no curb at the Auraria Station, and possible
issues with ADA requirements. He also shared how in the New Jersey HudsonBerger line, they had admitted that low floor does not work well in weather
conditions with snow over 12 inches.
Lloyd Mack also discussed other measures RTD is taking to address concerns on
customer relations. In checking the records, there are only 4 known situations
with operators at ramps and this has been addressed. They have also enlisted the
support of 12 senior volunteers who ride the rail using the ramp and report back
on any encountered customer relation issues. Lloyd Mack also indicated that the
purchase of the 55 light rail car proposed can be maintained at the existing Elati
facility and are compatible with the existing fleet of cars.
Director Kinton expressed his continued concern over the need to provide better
access for handicap, people with bad knees trying to climb on the rail, bikes,
strollers, and other riders or potential riders who may need better accessibility.
Director Kinton wanted to know what was the driving force behind other agencies
modifying their platforms and are we locking RTD and future boards in a situation
that cannot be changed?
Director Kinton offered up his FLAT (floor lower access technology) amendment
to be added to the language in the recommendation for the purchase of the fiftyfive light rail vehicles.

MOTION:

Director Daly made the motion to
purchase the fifty-five light rail vehicles
with the modification to add the language
from Director Kinton’s FLAT amendment.
