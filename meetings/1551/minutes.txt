Call to Order:
Chair Martinez called the Financial Administration and Audit Committee
meeting to order at 7:03 p.m.

I.

Recommended Actions
Chair Martinez asked if the Board members were against moving all three action
items at once. Since nobody objected, he called for a motion to move all three
items as one.
Salaried Employee Insured Benefits
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the 2011 Plan Year Salaried Insured Benefits Budget
and authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement with the
Insurance Carriers.

The 2011 Salaried Employee Insured Benefits Budget is $7,194,130. The District’s
expected cost for 2011 is $6,784,179. It is important to note, however, that our
2010 actual expense is coming in below 2009 actual by -6.53%. This is due to the
success of the 2010 implementation of the Cigna self-funded options and the carrier
change for the District’s life/disability coverage. This is a significant achievement
considering that the medical trend for employer-sponsored group plans has been
estimated to increase from 7% - 11% each year.
Resolution No.___, Series 2010A and 2010B Certificates of Participation
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the execution and delivery of an annually renewable
Lease Purchase Agreement (the “Lease”) with RTD Asset Acquisition Authority
(the “Corporation”) and related documents pursuant to which there will be
executed and delivered Tax-Exempt Certificates of Participation, Series 2010A
and Taxable Certificates of Participation (Direct Pay Build America Bonds),
Series 2010B (collectively, the “COPs”).
Resolution No.___, Series 2010A and 2010B Sales Tax Revenue Bonds
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the
“Resolution”), authorizing the issuance of Regional Transportation District TaxExempt Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks Projects), Series 2010A and
Regional Transportation District, Taxable Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks
Project) (Direct Pay Build America Bonds), Series 2010B (collectively, the
“Bonds”).

II.

Sales & Use Tax Forecast Update
Terry Howerter, CFO, gave the board a brief update on Sales Tax forecast. It
was decided that RTD will use CLC’s forecast which come out quarterly to do
short term forecast. The CLC recently issued the September 2010 Economic
and Revenue Forecast for 2010 through 2012. Please refer to the charts on
pages 27 and 28 in the minute notebook.

III.

2011 Budget Update
Doug MacLeod, shared with the Board that since the presentation of the 2011
Requested Budget, the following items have been revised and will be included in
the November presentation of the 2011 Recommended Budget: Sales and use
taxes have been revised for the September 2010 Colorado Legislative Council
(CLC) forecasts, ADA service hours have been revised to meet expected 2011
service needs based on additional information and, 12 full-time positions have
been reduced from bus operations.
Director Christopher asked how much of an increase for 2011 are we looking at
over 2010 when adding ADA and Access-a-Cab. Bruce Abel will provide that
information after he looks at the particular numbers.

IV.

August 2010 Financial Status Report
Todd Nikkel mentioned that this information was provided in the packets and
asked if there were any questions.
Director Martinez wondered if there is any correlation with ridership decline and
specific routes such as late buses or no shows and asked if we see a reduction
in ridership from those particular routes. Bruce Abel responded that ridership
declines are across the board.

V.

Other Matters
No other matters were discussed.
