It is recommended by the Contracted Operational Services Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to exercise the option with Startrans

access-a-Ride. The option price is $50,320 each for a total award of $3,170,160.

It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service/Marketing Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the implementation of volume discounts on the purchase of
one-Day passes. It is recommended that for purchases of 100 to 999, RTD will offer a
10% discount. This results in recommended prices for Local, Express, and Regional
Day passes of $4.00, $7.00, and $9.00 respectively under the current fare structure.
For purchases of 1,000 and over, it is recommended that RTD offer a discount of 20%,
