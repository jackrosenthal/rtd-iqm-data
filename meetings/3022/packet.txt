BACKGROUND
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) is comprised of residents
from around the region. Members are appointed by RTD Board of Directors and volunteer their time to
advise the District on a range of transit issues that affect citizens and impact the region.
Recruitment for citizens interested in serving was publicly advertised through the RTD website, local
publications and stakeholder e-mail distributions. Applicants were asked to submit an application
explaining why they wanted to serve on the Committee; describing what unique experience and skillset
they would bring to the Committee; listing affiliations and volunteer activities they believe will add value
to the Committee; and a providing a statement of personal objectives/goals if accepted for CAC
membership.
A total of 35 applications were received. Four current members’ terms expired on July 31, 2020. Two
are ineligible for reappointment and two have requested a reappointment. In addition, there are three
vacancies due to resignations.
The Nominating Committee decided, based on attendance, participation at meetings and maintaining
Committee consistency to recommend reappointment of the two current members who requested
reappointment. The Nominating Committee then carefully reviewed each application received to fill five
remaining positions.
The following current members are recommended for reappointment to an additional three-year term
expiring July 31, 2023:

Re:

August Board Report

On July 16th, Governor Jared Polis announced a statewide mask order which requires every
Coloradoan over the age of 10 to wear a mask in public. This Executive Order (110) expires
after thirty days. The mask order was already mandatory for employees, contractors, and others
providing services for mass transportation and operations.
The following day, the Governor, Senator Winter and Rep. Gray announced the appointments to
the RTD Accountability Committee. Board Chair Rivera-Malpiede, Board Director Guissinger,
Sherry Ellebracht and BBMK worked closely with the House and Senate Transportation Chairs
to ensure a diverse committee membership to incorporate the unique perspectives of all the
constituents that the District serves. BBMK will continue to provide updates to the legislature as
the Accountability Committee work progresses to ensure that legislators are informed about this
collaborative effort.
Recently, the Office of the State Controller released an interim report that provided further
clarification on the allocation of the federal CARES act funding. The State has fully allocated
the $1.67 billion Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF) pursuant to the CARES Act. $1.1 billion or
70% has already been transferred to agencies and sub-recipients for expenditure.
BBMK has been meeting with candidates running for the General Assembly to assess interest in
transportation issues and to brief them about the District.
There are currently 15 ballot initiatives being circulated which have not yet collected enough
signatures to be placed on the ballot. These 15 ballot initiatives have until August 3rd to collect
enough signatures, otherwise they will not appear on the 2020 ballot. 4 ballot initiatives
previously out for circulation have passed their due date without the necessary signatures,
meaning they will be left off the 2020 ballot. These 4 initiatives were Initiative #83 Tax Credits
for Voting, Initiative #104 Approval Voting, Initiative #105 Election day as State Holiday, and
Initiative #106 Vouchers for Campaigns. For more information on the ballot initiatives out for
circulation please visit the Secretary of State website.
We sincerely appreciate the Boards willingness to schedule legislative meetings with our team
and look forward to a busy Summer and Fall.
Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or need anything.

Federal Update for August 4 Meeting of Communications and Government
Relations Committee

In the remaining two weeks before their month-long August recess, the House and Senate are
focused on crafting another COVID relief / economic stimulus package.
Senate Republicans continue to struggle to reach consensus on what that COVID bill may contain.
They were expected to release the draft text of their bill last week but intra-party disputes on
priorities left them still negotiating by week’s end. Having passed their comprehensive relief
package (the HEROES Act) back in May, House Democrats continue to advance many of their 12
FY 2021 appropriations bill through the chamber. This week, the Transportation/HUD bill will
come to the House floor as part of a seven-bill appropriations minibus.
Passage of Another COVID Relief Bill is Congress’ Last Major Legislative Priority of the
Summer
Last week, both a leaked outline of the Senate bill and Senator McConnell’s remarks on the Senate
floor reveal that Senate leadership want to fund a narrow set of priorities to support return-toclassroom plans, childcare, and a limited second round of cash payments to individuals. Even with a
relatively modest $1 trillion proposal, McConnell has been met by headwinds from many in his own
party who believe that another budget-busting relief bill is irresponsible or who support other
priorities not included in McConnell’s package.
It is still not clear whether additional transit funding will be included in Republican-led bill. Keep in
mind that any bill that ultimately achieves the support of the majority of Senate Republicans is
simply the starting point for negotiations with Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi. The House
HEROES Act included $15.75 billion for transit, a number now widely viewed as insufficient, given
the growing economic impacts of record-high number of COVID cases seen in many States.
We continue to advocate with our Congressional delegation for additional relief funding,
documenting how CARES Act funding from early April has been essential but is quickly being
obligated, while farebox and sales tax revenues remain at historic lows.

Federal Update

1.C.4.a

FY 2021 Appropriations Bills are Stalled in the Senate, Almost Guaranteeing a Continuing
Resolution by September 30

The Senate Appropriations Committee was set to begin its work on its FY 2021 spending bills in
June, but disputes over additional funding to address the pandemic stalled its work. If Congress can
reach an agreement on a COVID relief / stimulus package before the August recess, Senate
appropriators may start working on FY 2021 bills in September. However, it is not likely that any
FY 2021 spending bills will pass both chambers, complete conference negotiations, and be sent to
the President before the start of the Federal fiscal year on October 1. Therefore, we expect
Congress to pass a short-term spending bill – a Continuing Resolution – to keep the Federal
government operating and give lawmakers additional time after the elections to complete one or
more full-year FY 2021 appropriations bills. There is every reason to believe that RRIF CRP fix
included in the House bill will be included in the final Transportation/HUD bill that is ultimately
enacted.
Similarly, with no action in the Senate yet on the transit and rail titles of a surface transportation
authorization bill to succeed the FAST Act, we expect Congress to pass a short-term extension of
the FAST Act before program authorizations expire on September 30.

Later this week, the House will vote on its second FY 2021 appropriations minibus, which will
include the Transportation/HUD appropriations legislation. Included in that bill is some fiscal relief
for transit agencies: the Federal share for transit formula grants is increased to 100 percent for
obligations made in FY 2021. The bill also includes the RRIF CRP fix directing US DOT to return
the credit risk premium paid on the Denver Union Station RRIF loan and appropriating the funds
for such payment.

• Two highest priorities: Equitable Access and Reliability
• Geographical Access also highlighted, but focused on equity populations outside of
major urban centers

• Next highest priorities: Convenient Stop Locations, Long Service
Hours, Easy Transit Connections
• Concerns about how changing fixed routes will impact Access-aRide service – requests for RTD to establish a policy to retain
Access-a-Ride services even if fixed routes are eliminated
• Resource Efficiency, Fast Trips and Frequent Service were also
mentioned as lower-tier priorities
