##### a. 2016 Resolution - 014 Appointment of Pension Trustee

#### 2. Refunding of 2007A FasTracks Bonds

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the refinancing of the Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Brenden Morgan, Senior Manager of Debt and Investments, explained that these bonds were originally issued in 2007 to partially refinance the Series 2006A FasTracks Bonds for a savings in interest expense.  He added that recent changes in interest rates have created an opportunity to reduce the interest expense by $11.1 million dollars.  He noted that RTD Fiscal Policies require a minimum of 3% savings, and the current amount is well in excess of that.

Director Folska asked if there was a specific timeframe for the refunding of the bonds.  Brenden Morgan noted that the timeframe is not outlined, but it should occur this year.  He added that RTD will save $15.5 million between today and 2036.

Committee Chair Menten remarked that this action item does not extend the debt, it only refinances it.

##### a. 2016 Resolution - 015 Authorizing the Issuance of Sales Tax Revenue Bonds Series 2016A

#### 3. 2016-013 : Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of 2016 to amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2) reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System only are detailed as follows:

1)      De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million.  Originally appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned debt issuance for fleet purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement Fund.

2)      Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million.  As a result of #1 above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in 2016.

3)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated Fund be reduced by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016.   Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.

4)      Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million.  In place of new financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement Fund be reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016 in combination with #3 above.  Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service coverage.  Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $15.0 million.

5)      Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million.  As a result of the above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decline $1.4 million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base System include:

1)      Increase to other income of $9.0 million.  It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as collateral.

2)      Increase to investment income of $0.39 million.  A revision to estimated investment income is made due to higher market interest rates.

Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are detailed as follows:

1)      Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs.  This revision is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.

2)      Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and unrestricted fund balance of $0.5 million each.  The reduction to each of these funds is a direct result of the reduction to operating expense and is not a use of these fund balances.

The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0 million to $2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

Operating and non-operating revenue estimates are revised as detailed below:

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 16, 2016 Board Meeting.

Director Anderson seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, explained that staff is asking the Board to amend the 2016 Amended budget for necessary actions and correction.  She commented that on the Base System, staff has appropriated $50 million in new financing.  Staff determined that RTD has limited capacity for additional debt and the agency must maintain our debt service coverage.  She indicated that this will result in a reduction to interest expense of $450,000.  She commented that in place of debt issuance, staff plans to use $11.8 million of the Board-Appropriated Fund, $15 million of the Capital Replacement Fund and then pay-go for the remainder by reducing expenses.  She added that staff is also proposing an increase to other income of $9 million from the release of TABOR reserves by pledging the Blake building as collateral.  She explained that this is a fairly common practice among municipalities and legal has approved the transaction.  This is a portion of RTD’s TABOR reserve and the end result of these actions will be an estimated reduction of the unrestricted fund balance of $2.1 million at year end.

Jannette Scarpino stated that for the FasTracks side, staff will need to reduce budgeted operating expenses in Capital Programs by $8.8 million due to a budget submission error.  She stated that the true increase to Capital Programs is $700,000 which includes third party betterments that will be reimbursed by the City of Aurora.

Jannette Scarpino added that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) recaps the effect of the proposed amendment and staff’s best estimates at this time.  She commented that this will set the model for the next six years.

Director Folska asked for further explanation as to where the other income of $9 million was coming from.  Jannette Scarpino stated that the $9 million that is proposed in the amendment is coming from the release of TABOR reserves by pledging the Blake building as collateral.

Heather Copp remarked that staff is planning to take $9 million out of the $20 million in reserve and then collateralizing the Blake building which is estimated at $13.4 million.  That amount will be added to the other income line item.

Director Lubow indicated that she is worried about using the Blake building as collateral.  She asked what would be the risk in collateralizing RTD’s home office.  Heather Copp stated that there would not be any risk.  She added that the TABOR reserve will always be sitting in the bank.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that the TABOR reserve is only to be used for declared emergencies.  He noted that the term declared emergencies is not defined, but it does not include things that one might consider to be an emergency such as an economic shortfall or economic conditions.  He commented that what constitutes reserves could be cash, property interests or a mixture.  He added that many organizations have a blend of readily called upon cash, which is what staff is proposing.

Director Sisk commented that he spoke with Heather last week about his concerns and the issue for him is that taking money from the Board-Appropriated fund raises a few red flags.  He added that while it is a savings account, it illustrates the difficult financial position that RTD is in.

Director James reiterated that this action item is reclassifying assets and liabilities without changing the risks associated with them.

Director Francone thanked staff for their work.  She added that staff heard the Board’s concerns about RTD’s debt ratio and they have found a creative solution to balance the books.  She noted that today’s Wall Street Journal has an article which summarizes the current financial market and the efforts that RTD is making is in line with what is happening in the general financial community.

Committee Chair Menten stated that she is happy with this resolution but she does not like that the Blake office was added as collateral.  She asked how many times TABOR had been challenged.  Rolf Asphaug noted that it was only challenged once by Douglas Bruce.  He stated that in the court decision, it is permissible to put property interests in the TABOR reserve.

#### 1. Presentation and Discussion of 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan

Heather Copp stated that originally the SBP and the APE were up for approval this month, but staff wanted to give the Board additional time to review these items since there was a quick overview at the Study Session in July.  She added that the SBP and the APE are intertwined, especially in regards to debt service coverage.  She noted that staff did not want to approve one without the other because next year the two will be presented as one complete package.  She noted that Jannette Scarpino will discuss the SBP and Susan Cohen will review the APE.

Jannette Scarpino explained that staff has discussed the SPB development and assumptions since April of this year.  She noted that the SBP has been developed in concert with the APE and staff has sharpened its assumptions.  She commented that no new debt will be issued throughout the term of the SBP in order to maintain RTD’s debt service coverage.  She added that the fleet will be financed by the Board-Appropriated Fund and Capital Replacement Fund in 2016.  The fleet will also be financed by previously issued bond proceeds, use of the Capital Replacement Fund in 2022 and grant revenue.  She noted that the fleet replacement has been reduced in magnitude from the original request by $40 million.  She commented that the Board-Appropriated Fund will be replenished in 2017 and staff will also be establishing an operating reserve fund.  She added that staff has also incorporated a minimum/must have projects list for both Capital and Expense projects.

Jannette Scarpino remarked that staff is not asking for approval of the SBP tonight.  She noted that the final version will be brought to the Board for approval on September 20, 2016.  She stated that no service reductions are proposed, sales and use tax forecasts return to the CU Leeds baseline forecast in 2017, diesel is estimated at $2.00 per gallon, gas is estimated at $2.65 per gallon, there is no new financing, debts are reduced, and the Board-Appropriated Fund and the Capital Replacement Funds are replenished.

Jannette Scarpino noted that factors outside of RTD’s control such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, supplies as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP.  She stated that there may be additional expenses or reductions that are not anticipated, but the SBP will be used as a guide for the 2017 budget.  She added that staff will continue to be challenged by changing economic conditions and the unpredictability of consumer spending behaviors.

Director Bagley referred to Exhibit 4 and asked for more information about the Burnham Yard Property Acquisition and the Burnham Yard Site Development since they were both deferred.  He stated that this location is the choke point and has significant impacts to the Southeast and Southwest light rail corridors and asked if RTD defers this acquisition, would the current price point be jeopardized.

General Manager Genova stated that these two items are on the deferred list, but staff does not have a timeframe for when it will be brought back.  He noted that in terms of jeopardizing the price, it remains to be seen.  He added that it is a large area and a huge facility, but under RTD’s capability to obtain parcels for transit needs, that site is reserved for us.

Director Bagley added that he would be more comfortable if RTD had the expenditure to purchase the property from Union Pacific.  He stated that it is important to acquire and it should not be allowed to languish.

Director Hoy asked about the impact that all of this will have on the FISA account.  Heather Copp stated that the SBP has no impact on the FISA account.

#### 2. Presentation and Discussion of 2017-2040 APE/Financial Plan

Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance and ECM, stated that through 2019, RTD has a committed capital cost of approximately $5.6 billion dollars.  She remarked that most of the ongoing projects will be open for revenue service by the end of this year with some closeout work remaining in 2017.  The projects with remaining scope through 2019 are: North Metro, Southeast Rail Extension, Flat Iron Flyer and the Northwest Rail.

Susan Cohen explained that the proposed changes to the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) are primarily for the US 36 BRT.  She commented that funding for incremental costs of specialized BRT vehicles were deferred until 2030 and the Church Ranch Road relocation was removed.  Other project budget savings include the completed environmental and planning work under budget, miscellaneous projects completed under budget and program wide capital cost reductions.

Susan Cohen added that the financial plan overview shows revenue changes from the 2015 APE forecasts and highlights tight debt coverage.  She noted that once RTD issues the bonds for FasTracks this year, RTD will not be able to issue debt until 2023.  She commented that while the FasTracks plan is in balance, there are limited opportunities for long term completion of corridors on FasTracks and the Base System.

Heather Copp mentioned that the key here is it takes longer to reach the revenue that staff wants.  She noted that after 2035, staff will see a significant jump in revenues.  She added that this is a snapshot in time that will change next year and noted that RTD’s significant challenges are between now and 2025.

Director Lubow inquired about the US 36 costs that were deferred while the Broomfield project is proceeding and asked how these changes occurred.  Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, stated that Church Ranch was relocated in 2006-2007.  He noted that the Church Ranch relocation project being referenced is not a complete removal of the project, it is just being removed from now through 2019.  He commented that staff encountered unanticipated physical challenges trying to relocate the platforms 1300 feet to the west.  He remarked that this project will remain on the books, but when staff ran through the design build project with CDOT, it was determined that it will be much easier to accomplish once the highway is built out to its ultimate configuration.  He stated that the Broomfield project is a lower cost project that will deliver immediate improvements to RTD’s passengers.

General Manager Genova stated that staff is following up with our stakeholders to discuss the details of these items.

Director Hoy asked why staff is putting funds into the FISA account only to take it back out for operating expenses.  Heather Copp explained that any savings RTD receives must go into the FISA account.

Director Anderson stated that the FISA account was set up so that if RTD found money it did not need; it would be placed into reserves. She added that it would be irresponsible to have a vast reserve and cut operations.

Director Bagley stated that the FISA account was meant for all of the FasTracks corridors and extensions.  He remarked that the funds in the account were never specified to a specific corridor.

Director Lubow indicated that she thought the FISA funds were to be used for US 36 and North Metro.  She added that this is another example of the corridors in the north being the last to be served and stated that it is concerning and a problem.

##### a. 2016 APE Adoption 080916 v3

#### 3. Quarterly Investment Report

Brenden Morgan explained that RTD’s investment policy is conservative in nature and the policy’s three primary objectives are: safety, liquidity and yield.  He stated that the two line graphs show a performance comparison of RTD funds relative to the benchmarks laid out in RTD’s investment policy.  He added that the large increase in return is in relation to the short term interest rate hike in 2015.

##### a. Copy of INVESTMENT REPORT JUNE 2016

#### 4. June 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report

Doug MacLeod, Controller, stated that staff had estimated the sales and use taxes for June because staff received the actual figures late last week.  The sales and use taxes were estimated to be down 1.2% for a total of $49.6 million, but the actual numbers came in at $52 million putting RTD over budget for the month.  Heather Copp noted that this is the first time RTD has exceeded the estimates in over a year.  Doug MacLeod added that even though RTD is 1.4% below budget, ridership continues to be lower than what was estimated which continues to drive lower fare revenues.

##### a. 063016 RTD MFS Final

#### 5. Smart Media Technology Update

Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations stated that the smart media technology updated was included in the August 9, 2016 Board Packet.  She added that staff should receive the cyber security assessment on Friday and staff will develop the next steps once the review can be completed.
