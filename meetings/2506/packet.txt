Salaried Pension Trustee Appointment

Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approves the attached Resolution No. ______ appointing Derrick Black to a term expiring 12/31/2017 as
a trustee for the Salaried Employee Defined Benefit (i.e., Pension) Plan and Salaried Employee Defined
Contribution Plan.
BACKGROUND
On May 31, 2016, the Board approved amendments to the above Plans to provide for appointment of
the same four employee trustees for each of the plans, with two trustees being employee participants in
the Pension Plan, and two being employee participants in the Defined Contribution Plan. The resolution
further provided that the three existing employee trustees serving both plans were to remain as trustees
with revised termination dates to assure continued staggered terms, and that after acceptance of
applications and screening in accordance with the Plans, an employee who is a participant in the Defined
Contribution Plan be appointed to replace retired trustee Marla Lien.
The application and screening process has now been completed, and employee Derrick Black is
recommended for appointment as a trustee to the Plans.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action and approve Derrick Black to serve as a trustee on the Plans in
accordance with the attached resolution. This is recommended because the employee has applied
and been screened for the position, and will replace the retired trustee assuring continued
representation going forward.
2. Reject the Recommended Action and the attached resolution, and require the screening
committee to return with a revised recommendation. This is not recommended since the
committee has reviewed applicants and performed its function in accordance with the Plan
requirements, consistent with the goals of existing Board resolutions.

RESOLUTION No. _____ SERIES OF 2016
APPOINTMENT OF TRUSTEE TO THE RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ PENSION TRUST
AND RTD SALARIED EMPLOYEES’ DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN TRUST

Whereas, RTD maintains the RTD Salaried Employees' Pension Plan and Trust ("Pension Plan"
or "Pension Trust") for salaried employees hired by RTD before January 1, 2008 and the RTD Salaried
Employees' Defined Contribution Plan and Trust ("Defined Contribution Plan" or "Defined Contribution
Trust") for salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008, which may collectively be referred to
as the "Trusts"; and,
Whereas, two RTD Board Directors and five salaried employees serve as the same sets of
trustees for each of the above Trusts as further described below; and,
Whereas, on January 8, 2008 the RTD Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 1 Series of
2008 providing that a screening committee composed of the Board Chair, the Chair of the Salaried
Employee Pension Trust Fund and the Finance Chair (i.e., Chair of the Finance Administration and
Audit Committee) will screen applications from the middle management salaried employee class and the
senior management salaried employee class and will bring recommendations back to the Board; and,
Whereas, on May 31, 2016, in Resolution No. 008 Series of 2016, the RTD Board of Directors
amended the Pension Trust and the Defined Contribution Trust, to end the “senior” and “middle”
management distinction, and instead authorized the Board of Directors to appoint two employee
Trustees who participate in the Pension Plan and two who participate in the Defined Contribution Plan,
in addition to the two Board members who are appointed to the Trusts and the Chief Financial Officer
who is a permanent member of the Trusts, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts; and
Whereas, in the above Resolution the RTD Board of Directors further reappointed two existing
employee Trustees participating in the Pension Plan and one employee Trustee participating in the
Defined Contribution Plan, to serve as the same set of trustees on both of the Trusts, leaving one
vacancy for an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Contribution Plan to be selected by the
Board; and
Whereas, in accordance with the above Resolutions the Board accepted candidates for the
vacant position whose applications were screened, with a recommendation brought back to the Board;
and
Whereas, in accordance with the above Resolutions the RTD Board of Directors now wishes to
appoint Derrick Black to serve as an employee Trustee participating in the Defined Contribution Plan to
serve as a trustee on both of the Trusts, with a term expiring 12/31/2017.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:

Subject:

Refunding of 2007A FasTracks Bonds

CFO/AGM,

Finance

Date: August 4, 2016
&

GM
Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Resolution Number __ (the “Resolution”), authorizing the refinancing of the
Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds.
BACKGROUND
RTD issued the Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds to partially refinance the Series2006A
FasTracks Bonds to realize a savings in interest expense.
Recent changes in interest rates and the approaching 2017 call date on certain of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds have created an opportunity to again realize a reduction in interest
expense.
DISSCUSSION
With long-term interest rates near historic lows, RTD has the potential to advance refund a portion of
the remaining outstanding Series 2007A FasTracks Refunding Bonds (“Series 2007A Bonds”),
subject to market movement, a savings of approximately $11.1 million (8.06% of principal). RTD
policy requires a minimum of 3% savings which allows some flexibility in regards to changes in
interest rates between now and the date the new refunding bonds are sold. The Series 2007A
Bonds are callable November 1, 2017 at par.
Staff has recommended the adoption of this resolution to take advantage of the opportunity for RTD
to reduce its overall interest expense related to the Series 2007A Bonds in the coming years. While
the potential refunding savings are significant, it is important to note that such savings are net of a
cost resulting from (a) the inability to invest proceeds of the new refunding bonds at a return equal to
the interest expense of the Series 2007A Bonds, and (b) the length of time between the sale of the
new refunding bonds and call date of the Series 2007A Bonds (“Negative Arbitrage”).
Absent a change in interest rates, the savings to RTD improves with the passage of time, due to a
reduction in time proceeds of the new refunding bonds must be invested prior to redeeming the
Series 2007A Bonds. Despite the cost associated with the Negative Arbitrage, the potential savings
from a refunding of the Series 2007A Bonds exceeds the typical threshold for a refunding by RTD.
The Board is being requested through the Resolution to authorize the inclusion of the Series 2007A
FasTracks Refunding Bonds in the current refunding project authorized by the Board in May 2016.
Drafts of documents including the Indenture, the Continuing Disclosure Agreement, the Preliminary
Official Statement and the Bond Purchase Agreement are available for review in the Board Office.

Packet Pg. 7

1.B.2

RTD is receiving the advice of First Southwest Company, as independent financial advisors and
Sherman & Howard L.L.C. as Bond Counsel in regard to the Bonds. The Bonds will be underwritten
by a team including Goldman Sachs, Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Piper Jaffray, and Harvestons Securities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Costs associated with the refunding are considered “costs of issuance” and will be funded out of
proceeds. These costs include underwriter, rating agency, financial advisory, attorney and printing
fees. The length of the refunded bonds will not exceed the length of existing Series 2007A Bonds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the execution of documents, including the attached Resolution No.__, Series of
2016, authorizing the refinancing of the Series 2007A FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is
the recommended action.
2. Do not authorize the execution of documents; including the attached Resolution No.__, Series
of 2016, authorizing the issuance of the District’s refinancing of the Series 2007A
FastTrack’s Refunding Bonds. This is not the recommended action as it would not take
advantage of the interest expense savings currently available to the District.

RESOLUTION NO. ___, SERIES OF 2016
WHEREAS, on May 31, 2016, the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the
Regional Transportation District (the “District”) adopted Resolution No. 009, Series of 2016 (the
“Bond Resolution”) authorizing the issuance of its Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, Series 2016A (the
“2016A Bonds”); and
WHEREAS, all capitalized terms used herein shall have the meanings given to
them in the Bond Resolution; and
WHEREAS, the 2016A Bonds were authorized to be issued in order to (a) finance
additional costs of the FasTracks project (the “Improvement Project”), pursuant to the authority
conferred at the 2004 Election, (b) refund all or a portion of the outstanding 2010A Bonds and
2012A Bonds (the “Refunded Bonds”) if it is determined by the General Manager (the “General
Manager”) or Chief Financial Officer (the “Chief Financial Officer”) of the District that such
refunding would achieve interest rate savings and effect other economies for the District (the
“Refunding Project” and together with the Improvement Project, the “Project”), and (c) pay the
costs of issuance of the 2016A Bonds and related costs; and
WHEREAS, due to a change in market conditions, it may now be advantageous
for the District to also refund all or a portion of the outstanding 2007A Bonds with the proceeds
of the 2016A Bonds; and
WHEREAS, the Board wishes to additionally authorize the refunding of all or a
portion of the 2007A Bonds with the proceeds of the 2016A Bonds if it is determined by the
General Manager or Chief Financial Officer that such refunding would achieve interest rate
savings and effect other economies for the District.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Amendment to 2016 Amended Budget

CFO/AGM,

Date: August 4, 2016

Board Meeting Date: August 16, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended that the Board of Directors adopt Resolution No. ____, Series of 2016 to amend
the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System for the inclusion of 1) de-appropriation of debt, 2)
reduction of estimated interest expense, 3) use of the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) use of the
Capital Replacement Fund, 5) reduction to the estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance; and
amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project for the inclusion of 1) reduction of
budgeted operating expense, 2) reduction to the Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement
Fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect the Base System only are
detailed as follows:
1) De-appropriation of new financing proceeds of $50.0 million. Originally
appropriated in the 2016 Amended Budget, the planned debt issuance for fleet
purchases is rescinded to be replaced by use of the Board-Appropriated Fund
and Capital Replacement Fund.
2) Reduction to estimated interest expense of $0.45 million. As a result of #1
above, estimated interest expense will be reduced in 2016.
3) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund of $14.8 million. In place of new
financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Board-Appropriated Fund be reduced
by $14.8 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016. Use of fund
balances instead of debt is necessary to preserve on-going debt service
coverage. Net of a previously scheduled contribution of $3.0 million to this
fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is $11.8 million.
4) Reduction to Capital Replacement Fund of $18.0 million. In place of new
financing proceeds, it is proposed that the Capital Replacement Fund be
reduced by $18.0 million to support planned fleet purchases in 2016 in
combination with #3 above. Use of fund balances instead of debt is necessary
to preserve on-going debt service coverage. Net of a previously scheduled
contribution of $3.0 million to this fund at year-end, the actual fund usage is
$15.0 million.
5) Reduction to unrestricted fund balance of $1.4 million. As a result of the
above changes, the unrestricted fund balance is projected to decline $1.4
million to $2.1 million at year-end 2016.

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.3

Other estimated (not appropriated) revisions to the 2016 Amended Budget affecting the Base
System include:
1) Increase to other income of $9.0 million. It is proposed that TABOR reserves in the
amount of $9.0 million be released in exchange for providing the Blake building as
collateral.
2) Increase to investment income of $0.39 million. A revision to estimated investment
income is made due to higher market interest rates.
Revisions to appropriations in the Amended Budget that will affect FasTracks Project only are
detailed as follows:
1) Reduction of $8.8 million in budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs. This revision
is necessary to correct a request made in the Amended Budget in error which resulted in
overstatement of budgeted operating expense in Capital Programs of $8.8 million.
2) Reduction to Board-Appropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund, and unrestricted fund
balance of $0.5 million each. The reduction to each of these funds is a direct result of the
reduction to operating expense and is not a use of these fund balances.
The result of these revisions is a decrease in the District-wide appropriation of $45.0 million to
$2.299 million as summarized below from the attached Exhibit I.

DISCUSSION
Base System
RTD staff has completed its development of the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan for the Base
System and determined that certain revisions were necessary to the 2016 Amended Budget as
previously approved. It was determined that the planned 2016 $50 million COP (Certificates of
Participation) debt issuance for fleet acquisition would negatively impact RTD’s ability to meet
projected debt service coverage requirements, which is already being challenged by overall lower
revenue estimates. In order to support the planned fleet purchase, it is proposed that both the
Board-appropriated reserve fund and capital replacement reserve fund be utilized in lieu of the COPs
to complete the fleet purchase obligation. In the 2017-2022 SBP, restoration of both reserve funds
to their previous levels is projected to occur as quickly as possible, no later than 2020.
The result of these revisions will be to lower the Base System unrestricted year-end fund balance by
$1.4 million to $2.1 million. Also, non-issuance of the COPs is estimated to lower interest expense
on the Base System by $0.45 million.
Revenue revisions for the Base System include an increase to other income of $9.0 million from
release of TABOR reserves in exchange for collateral of the Blake building. Replacing TABOR
reserves with real property or other assets will allow RTD to access $9.0 million in cash in those

Packet Pg. 15

1.B.3

accounts (we will revise the RTD Fiscal Policy Statement for 2017 to allow both cash and other
assets to be pledged for this reserve). This is an approach used by several other municipalities.
The $9.0 million will be used towards fleet acquisition in 2016 as well as overall balancing of the
2016 Amended Budget. Investment income is also revised upward by $0.39 million based on
higher interest rate forecasts. Revenue is estimated and not appropriated by the Board in the RTD
budget.
FasTracks
A reduction of $8.8 million to operating expense in FasTracks Project is proposed to correct an
overstatement that resulted from a request made in error for I-225 operating expense in the
previously approved Amended Budget. The reduction affects the Capital Programs department.
The result of this revision will be to lower the FasTracks Project Board-appropriated fund, capital
replacement fund, and estimated unrestricted year-end fund balance by $0.5 million each because
these funds are calculated at two months of operating expense which is being reduced by $8.8
million. This does not represent a use of fund balances, but rather a reduction based on calculation
of required amounts.
On a District-wide basis, the unrestricted year-end fund balance is projected to be $11.4 million,
down from $13.4 million in the previously approved Amended Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for the Base System to reflect: 1) de-appropriation of $50.0
million in new financing proceeds, 2) reduction of $0.45 million in estimated interest expense, 3)
reduction of $14.8 million to the Board-Appropriated Fund, 4) reduction of $18.0 million to the
Capital Replacement Fund, and 5) reduction of $1.4 million to the year-end unrestricted fund
balance. Amend the 2016 Amended Budget for FasTracks Project to reflect: 1) reduction of
$8.8 million in operating expense, and 2) reduction of $0.5 million each to the BoardAppropriated Fund, Capital Replacement Fund and year-end unrestricted fund balance. This is
the recommended action.
2. Request staff to revise the proposed amendments to the 2016 Amended Budget and amend
with revisions.
3. Do not amend the 2016 Amended Budget. This is not recommended, because the 2016
Amended Budget would not reflect other adjustments necessary to balance the 2016 Budget
and the 2017-2022 SBP, preserve debt service coverage, and correct previously budgeted
operating expense.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Capital Improvement Policies 1, Budget Policies 13 and 14
BACKGROUND
Capital Improvement Policy 1 of RTD’s Fiscal Policy Statement states that “On an annual basis, RTD
will prepare and update annually a six-year Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) including projected capital
construction and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund the capital
and operating programs.”
The SBP is RTD’s six year financial plan. Updated annually, it provides important cash flow planning
information used to determine the District’s operating, investing and financing activity as well as
services that the District can provide using projected financial resources. The first year of the SBP
serves as the basis for the preparation of the annual budget.
Each year during the SBP process, operating costs are estimated and capital projects are developed
to support the goals and objectives of the District. Estimates of other expenditures, such as principal
and interest payments on long-term debt, are also developed as part of the overall costs to the
District. The other major component of the SBP is the estimate of available revenues during the sixyear time period. These estimates of costs and revenues are brought together to insure that RTD will
have adequate resources to meet cash flow needs.
Per RTD Fiscal Policy Statement, RTD will contract with a qualified third party to provide sales and
use tax forecasting containing projections for the short term (one year), medium term (SBP) and long
term (FasTracks APE). RTD has contracted with the University of Colorado-Leeds School of Business
for this service. See “sales and use tax” in Discussion below.
Capital and operating/maintenance projects are evaluated based on their relative costs and benefits,
relative need, and to what extent they meet the RTD mission statement; projects are constrained to
operate within the forecast of revenues and funding sources available for their completion and
operation.
The SBP also provides the basis for the District’s application for federal transit funding through the
Transportation Improvement Program (TIP), prepared by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments. The TIP is a list of all roadway and transit projects in the region that receive federal
funding. RTD cannot receive federal funds for projects unless the qualifying SBP projects are
included in the TIP.

1.C.1

The 2017-2022 SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System 0.6% sales and use
taxes. Projected FasTracks future expense and projects for the period 2017-2022 are presented
separately in the FasTracks financial plan.
DISCUSSION
The attached SBP incorporates the 2016 amended budget and includes all known adjustments and
best estimates at this time. The SBP is being presented to the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee on August 9th for discussion; final presentation will follow on September 20th with staff
recommendation for Board adoption on September 27th.
Exhibit I
Exhibit I (attached) summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow through the extension of
the 2016 Amended Budget. The column titled “Adjusted Amended Budget 2016” in Exhibit I
incorporates revenue and expense adjustments approved in the Amended Budget and by
amendment to the Amended Budget, and subsequent known items.
The SBP is balanced through the six year period after incorporating into the projections 1) the
March sales/use tax forecast from CU-Leeds School of Business, 2) minimum/must-have SBP
requested projects including minimum fleet requirements, 3) reductions, eliminations or deferrals
of non-critical SBP requested projects, 4) use of the Capital Acquisition reserve fund to support
planned fleet purchases, 5) restoration of reserve funds, and 6) no new debt issued. No service
reductions are proposed in the SBP through this period.
Exhibit I summarizes the 2017-2022 projected cash flow activity based on the staff
recommendation incorporating the following:
 Revenue estimates:
 Fare revenue of $117.5 million in 2017 is projected to be unchanged from 2016. The
year 2016 is budgeted to have an 8% fare revenue increase due to the fare rate
restructure and increase. Future fare revenue increases are planned for 2019 and
2022 per the Board policy of consideration of a 10% fare rate increase every 3 years.
After 2016, which contains a 1.5% ridership increase, the SBP conservatively assumes
no increase in ridership through 2022. (Line 1)
 Sales and use tax incorporates the March semi-annual update from the CU-Leeds
School of Business for the years 2016-2022. The year 2016 is budgeted using the
low growth Below-Trend forecast and years 2017-2022 is projected using the medium
growth Baseline forecast. (Line 2)
o CU-Leeds presents probabilistic high and low forecast bounds in their forecasts
that incorporate possible errors, computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning
that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval between low and high forecast
values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted. The upper
bound estimate is 6.8% higher than the medium baseline forecast. This shows
that it is not impossible or unrealistic that revenue could grow somewhat
strongly over the next 2 years. Likewise, economic threats pose downside risk
to the forecast with a 6.8% lower bound.
 Grant revenue estimates are based upon past trends, formula allocations, known
proceeds, and recent congressional actions. Amounts are escalated at the area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) (obtained from Moody’s) or as identified. (Line 3)
 Other income consists of on-going advertising revenue, joint venture revenue, and IGA
and miscellaneous rental income, escalated at the CPI beginning in 2017. (Line 4)

Packet Pg. 28

1.C.1

 Operating expenses (excluding depreciation):
 Operating expenses are increased at area CPI rates and also adjusted for known items
and necessary reductions. The area CPI rates follow: (Line 6)
2017:
3.0%
2018:
3.1%
2019:
3.0%
2020:
2.7%
2021:
2.7%
2022:
2.7%
 Service increase consists of the cost of new CMAQ-funded service projects to be
operated by RTD in years 2016-2019 to include service enhancements on Routes L
and 324, Route 73 extension, Superior and Broomfield call-n-Ride services, and
Anschutz Medical Campus Shuttle. These services are included in the DRCOG TIP.
RTD costs will be reimbursed in full by CMAQ grant funds and contributed funds from
the applicable municipalities. Determination will be made in future years whether to
continue such service at RTD’s cost. (Line 7)
 Costs of operating the West Line, DUS Bus Concourse, Free MetroRide I-225, the HLine extension and SERE are allocated from Base to FasTracks based on resource
drivers on a full-allocation basis in years 2017-2022, and thus, Base total expenses are
reduced by the amount of the allocation. In years prior to 2017, the allocation was
made on an incremental basis, to be changed to full allocation including administrative
and support costs beginning in 2017. (Line 8)
 Expenses include the Collective Bargaining Agreement at a negotiated amount through
2017 plus an adjustment at the CPI in to capture current higher costs, and then
escalated at the CPI rate for 2018-2022. (Line 9)
 Diesel fuel is forecast at an estimated lock price of $2.00/gallon in 2017 and then
escalated at the national CPI rates as follows: (Line 10)
2018:
3.0%
2019:
2.8%
2020:
2.5%
2021:
2.3%
2022:
2.3%
 Gasoline is forecast at $2.65/gallon in 2017 based on recent average prices plus an
upward adjustment, and then escalated at the national CPI rates above. (Line 10)
 In the line item for expense projects (O&M), the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have operating and maintenance projects (also termed
“expense projects”), detailed in Exhibit III, 2) an amount for new operating projects
brought into the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be determined
from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV. (Line 11)
 The FasTracks service increase, or “rubber tire” service based on the 2004 FasTracks
Financial Plan whereby FasTracks will fund enhanced bus service on the Base System,
increases by the CPI rate serially each year. (Line 12)
 Interest income is based on current yields adjusted for expected changes in investable
balances and forecasted interest rates per forward rate curves. (Line 15)
 Interest expense is calculated by individual debt instruments outstanding during each year
(for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization schedules.
Interest expense is forecast only on existing debt balances because the plan assumes no
new debt issued through 2022. (Line 16)
 In the line item for capital expenditures, the following are included: 1) specifically
identified minimum/must-have capital projects plus the minimum required new fleet,

detailed in Exhibit II; dollar amounts of the new fleet will be determined so as not to
exceed cash flow constraints determined in the SBP model, 2) an amount for new capital
projects brought into the SBP based on available cash flow; specific projects will be
determined from the deferred project list in Exhibit IV, and 3) COP- or bond-funded carryforward capital expenditures. (Line 19)
The Fiscal Policy Statement establishes a Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement
fund.
 Staff recommends that funding of the Board-appropriated fund be maintained at a
minimum of $3 million each year until the fund reaches a balance of $35 million,
projected to occur in 2021. (Lines 20 and 33)
 Staff recommends that the capital replacement fund be replenished to $21 million
in 2018, maintained at that level until 2022 when the entire balance is used to
support fleet expenditures. (Lines 21 and 34)
The Fiscal Policy Statement in Fund Balance Policy 4 allows for the designation of an
unrestricted operating fund used to respond to unanticipated events, including revenue
shortfalls. The unrestricted operating reserve is established in 2017 and funded with
available cash flow. The plan will apply available dollars toward the operating fund so it
reaches a minimum $25 million in 2020, $40 million in 2021, and $50 million in 2022.
(Lines 22 and 35)
 The Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted operating reserve fund (and not the
capital acquisition fund) in total are targeted to achieve three months of operating
expenses of approximately $100 million.
A placeholder is established for Transfer to FasTracks for Base System support of
FasTracks operations. Any transfer to FasTracks is not expected to occur until after
2022. (Line 23)
Financing proceeds represent COPs issued for bus and light rail vehicle acquisition in
accordance with fleet schedules, net of grant funding and use of capital acquisition fund.
No new debt is issued during the SBP term in order to maintain required debt service
coverage. (Line 25)
Principal payments on debt are derived from individual debt instruments outstanding during
each year (for current debt and future debt as applicable) by using debt amortization
schedules. Principal payments are forecast only on existing debt balances. (Line 26)
Other line items consist of the roll-over of the unrestricted fund ending balance at
12/31/15, estimated changes to restricted reserves, and the use of previously-issued COPbond proceeds for future year capital expenditures. (Lines 29, 30, and 31)
The SBP is balanced during the six-year period as shown by the positive unrestricted yearend fund balance. The objective is to maintain a nominal unrestricted year-end fund
balance of $2 million each year through 2022 while supporting a minimum critical level of
capital and expense projects and restoring reserve fund balances. (Line 32)

As required by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), RTD must review its SBP for any Title VI
impacts (disproportionate impacts on minority and low income communities). Any service changes
specified in the SBP will be reviewed for Title VI impacts during the service planning process prior to
final recommendations on service changes. For the capital component of the SBP, Title VI impacts
are reviewed on improvements that are over and above the state-of-good-repair elements (repairs,
replacements and rehabilitations) of the capital program. The Title VI review will be provided and a
statement from the Planning Department to this effect is attached.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The staff-recommended SBP provides RTD with a plan for maintaining a positive unrestricted yearend fund balance in each year of the SBP while substantially growing reserve fund balances.
However, uncontrollable economic factors, such as sales tax revenue, cost of fuel, materials, and
supplies, as well as economic conditions will continue to have an impact on the SBP and may
challenge staff to present new options and solutions during the 2017 budget period.
Current key financial (fund balance) indicators for the SBP are:

In 2013, Rail Operations and the Planning Department
Districtwide
determined that eighteen (18) Light Rail Vehicles (LRVs)
would need to be purchased in order to meet the demands of
the existing LRT system and accommodate the opening of the
I-225 line in 2016. This analysis led to the current
procurement of twelve (12) vehicles that was included in the
2015-2017 capital budget plan. In order to bring the spare
ratio to a desired 20% minimum and meet the anticipated
growth in ridership, we need to purchase seventeen (17)
additional vehicles by 2020 (2 will be purchased by
FasTracks). This will increase the fleet from 184 to 201. The
order for these vehicles was placed in 2015.

In the years of 2016 and 2017, RTD will receive a FASTER
grant stipend from CDOT for State of Good Repair type
projects. These funds will be used to fund RTD projects that
would otherwise have been funded by RTD Base system
funds. However, as part of this stipend, CDOT expects RTD to
provide an additional $150,000 of grants to local governments
for transit projects. The funds from this SBP request will be
added to the SBP Local Government pool so that RTD can
meet the terms of the FASTER stipend and have a meaningful
pool of funds to respond to local government requests.

Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost
all computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby
meeting PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be
used with mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient
source and use of products. The vendor manages the data
and payments and sends a single payment for all transactions
during a given time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data
and analytical tools regarding the transactions on the
application. Industry standards for cost structure are an initial
small set-up fee then a % of mobile ticketing sales.

This project was approved in the 2015-2020 SBP for $2.5M
Northwest Rail
Environmental
Line
Clearance/PE for BRT @ with the expectation of an additional $1M from a DRCOG
grant. This request is to accelerate the project in order to
SH 119
implement the recommendations of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study (NAMS) given that no funding has been
identified for implementation of the Northwest Rail. RTD has
been awarded $1 million in DRCOG Transportation
Improvement Program (TIP) funds for this project. The
recommendations from the Northwest Area Mobility Study
(NAMS) include the implementation of BRT on the key arterial
roadways in the northwest area including SH 119. This
Environmental Assessment will perform NEPA level analysis
and Preliminary Engineering.

Planning

Northwest Rail
Bus Rapid Transit @ SH Project is to construct approximately 18 miles of Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) in the SH 119 Corridor to connect Boulder and Line
119
Longmont in accordance with the recommendation of the
Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS). It is anticipated that
approximately half of the total costs for this project would be
grant-funded. The establishment of BRT in the corridor would
raise ridership from approximately 1,900 to approximately
5,000 daily weekday riders in 2035. Detailed cost estimates
and design will be established through the upcoming
environmental clearance study and preliminary engineering,
previously approved in the SBP. The project is anticipated to
take two years to construct.

Capital Programs

Property Survey
Records System-Wide

Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any
Districtwide
property right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it
utilizes an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the
location of that property right on the ground, and prepare
Right-of-Way maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The
contract with Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs
has surveys, Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information
on adjoining properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records
regarding RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of
this information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which
could be equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of
information. These documents also include information on
utilities that cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-nRides, and other properties.

Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and
local municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD
has been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently,
these systems are used mostly used by the Telephone
Information Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and
CAD/AVL. RTD is also getting started on projects like realtime train arrival information, which would also need GIS
support.

project. RTD would be required to provide a 25 percent local
match of $250,000. Given the results of the Northwest Area
Mobility Study, which showed substantial bus ridership
increases from modest capital improvements made to arterial
corridors, there has been much interest from other areas of
the District for RTD to make arterial BRT investments in other
corridors. The purpose of this study will be to examine the
potential for arterial BRT investments throughout the entire
District and prioritize for future capital investment those
corridors which perform the highest.

include:
- additional bus transfer facilities
- pedestrian improvements
- bike access improvements
- improved bike storage
- expanded or new drop off/pick up areas
- transit speed and reliability improvements on bus routes
connecting to the station
The plan would identify potential partnerships with other public

assets not in a state of good repair and other projects, work
with engineering and designers to make our assets more
resilient to major weather events like floods, blizzards, etc.,
along with being part of the current sustainability processes.
Process Improvement & Quality Assurance Analyst
This position would participate in managing change throughout
the District by supporting operations in deviation management
(investigations, root cause analysis) corrective and preventive
actions, process improvement, performing internal audits, and

1 FTE: Continuous
Improvement Manager

RTD Policy Analysis staff began piloting the training and
support in November 2015 based on the City and County of
Denver's Peak Performance model. By the end of February
2016, 140 employees have received the four-hour "Green
Belt" training and another 28 employees the week-long "Black
Belt" training with principal efforts focused in Platte Bus
Maintenance and Customer Care pilots. These pilots have
identified more than 100 potential innovations to date with an
estimated $750,000 in soft dollar (efficiency) savings and
more than $20,000 in hard dollar (capital) savings. Last year,
Denver’s program realized $4.5 million in savings through the
program. Staff has also begun Continuous Improvement
Alliances (CIA) pilots in Rail Operations and will soon conduct
"Rapid Improvement Event" workshops on specific issues
affecting the agency, e.g., the hiring process, performance
management, etc.

The ADA Manager continues to boost involvement on
accessible design (plan reviews, site visits, and inspections)
District-wide. The need for a perspective on accessible design
has been well received and needs more and continued
attention and support. This proactive approach ensures
compliance and mitigates potential problems. This
effort/involvement has been effective in identifying and
preventing costly and litigious issues from escalating, but
efforts are spread thin and not all projects receive this type of
attention.
Currently whenever RTD acquires or disposes off any property Districtwide
right (fee simple, easement, or license agreement), it utilizes
an external survey firm (Jacobs) to establish the location of
that property right on the ground, and prepare Right-of-Way
maps, legal descriptions and exhibits. The contract with
Jacobs will expire at the end of 2016. Jacobs has surveys,
Computer Aided Design (CAD) files, information on adjoining
properties, subdivision plats, ALTA surveys, legal
descriptions, and other electronic and paper records regarding
RTD properties going back to 1997. The extent of this
information is estimated to be 2 to 4 terabytes, which could be
equated to 76,000 to 152,000 bankers boxes of information.
These documents also include information on utilities that
cross or service RTD stations, rail lines, Park-n-Rides, and
other properties.
Organizations that have assets in various geographic
locations typically utilize Geographic Information Systems
(GIS) to record and analyze their asset base. Utilities and local
municipalities are examples of such organizations. RTD has
been using GIS systems for about 15 years. Currently, these
systems are used mostly used by the Telephone Information
Center (TIC), Scheduling (Transtar), and CAD/AVL. RTD is
also getting started on projects like real-time train arrival
information, which would also need GIS support.

Information Storage Unit RTD relies heavily on its storage units to house 95% of all
District information and computing services. A wide range of
Replacement
departments and applications use these storage units to store
mission-critical data.
Computer data storage, often called storage or memory, is a
technology consisting of computer components and recording
media used to retain digital information. It is a core function
and fundamental component of computers. The central
processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates raw
information by performing computations. In practice, almost all
computers use a storage hierarchy, which puts fast but
expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and
slower but larger and cheaper options farther away.
In computing, a portfolio of storage products, including online
storage, near-online (nearline) storage, storage networking,
archiving, de-duplication, storage and backup software are
required to run the Enterprise.

features of the interface will include:
● General:
○ Integration with RTD website, email communications, text

Mobile Ticketing

This project is a GM initiative to enhance fare products by
Blake Street
offering a mobile application for the purchase and use of fare Office
and parking products. Mobile ticketing applications are
available from many third parties and can be used on any
mobile device. There is very little need for infrastructure or
customization of software. A user simply downloads the
mobile ticketing application to their device and purchases and
manages any of RTD's fare products or pays for parking. The
user purchases the product needed with a credit card and
receives the value of their payment on their mobile device for
immediate use. The user then activates (validates) each ride
by simply selecting the fare product to be used each time a
boarding occurs. The mobile application vendor maintains the
software and is the administrator of payments thereby meeting
PCI compliance. Any of RTD's fare products may be used with
mobile ticketing which offers a single, convenient source and
use of products. The vendor manages the data and payments
and sends a single payment for all transactions during a given
time period to RTD. Vendors also provide data and analytical
tools regarding the transactions on the application. Industry
standards for cost structure are an initial small set-up fee then
a % of mobile ticketing sales.

Contract Tier1/Tier2
Support for Oracle
Platform

RTD needs technology to operate efficiently and to compete
Civic Center
effectively. But as reliance on IT grows, the resources needed Plaza (CCP)
to support this increasingly complex IT environment may not.
In many areas, IT resources are limited and can be quickly
overwhelmed. We have seen from prior instances that if we
fall behind in keeping up with things such as backups, patches
and security, the odds greatly increase that RTD will face an
IT outage or another problem down the road that will
negatively impact RTD business. For instance, once RTD rolls
out real-time information to the customer and we have an
outage, it will negatively impact customers' view of RTD.
Another example is constantly keeping up to date with security
patches which, if not applied, will leave security vulnerabilities
open in the system. Managed Services support will help IT to
keep current with all these patches on a regular basis.

Information

BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenditures to date and all planned expenditures through the
year 2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for boardapproved projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction, the major effort of the
APE has shifted from developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the
Board-approved budgets for those projects and ensuring that RTD will have the future financial capacity
to operate the corridors and meet its debt service obligations. Therefore, the FasTracks financial plan
provides an overall long-term financial plan for RTD, and includes forecasts for both FasTracks and the
base system through 2040. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2015 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.6 billion, and approximately
$4.3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2015.
Since most of the funded FasTracks projects are complete or under construction and are being managed
within the Board approved budgets, the project cost changes to this APE are relatively small. The
changes primarily reflect updates to project scope and timing, or work that has been completed under
budget, as shown on the attached presentation.
The project cost changes for the 2016 APE are summarized below:






Changes to the timing and project scope for the US 36 BRT:
o Funding for incremental cost of specialized BRT vehicles deferred until 2030
 Full opening day fleet for Flatiron Flyer was procured and is in service
o Removal of the Church Ranch platform relocation from the project scope
o Addition of additional vertical circulation at the Broomfield station, to be completed by
2018
Increase in unit cost for the additional light rail vehicles
Additional funds required for project closeout staffing
Projects with environmental and planning work completed under the 2015 APE budget:
o Northwest Rail Segment 2
o Southwest Corridor Extension

Packet Pg. 57

1.C.2





o Central Corridor Extension
Other projects completed under the APE budget:
o Existing Corridor Improvements (Southeast, Central, CPV)
o Railroad ROW
o Communication System Upgrades
o Northeast Area Transportation Evaluation (NATE)
Reduction in program-wide capital costs

Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE would require identification of funding
sources for construction and operations, and would require approval of the Board. Therefore, the APE is
a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes approved by
the Board are incorporated.
The FasTracks financial plan incorporates updated revenue forecasts that show a decrease in short and
medium-term revenue forecasts for both FasTracks and the base system. With these updated forecasts,
annual revenues are projected to be lower than the 2015 APE forecasts in each year through 2025. In
addition, the total cumulative revenue forecast is lower than the 2015 APE forecast through 2034.
Between 2035 and 2040, total forecast revenues are projected to be higher than the 2015 forecast.
This reduced revenue forecast is expected to have multiple impacts on the financial plan. RTD’s net
debt service coverage is expected to be close to the 1.20x Board policy limit through 2022. As a result,
once the remaining FasTracks debt approved in May 2016 is issued, RTD will not have the capacity to
issue additional bonds or Certificates of Participation (COPs) until 2023. In addition, the FasTracks
Internal Savings Account (FISA) and base system funding will be needed to fund FasTracks corridor
operations and maintenance between 2020 and 2030. After 2030, FasTracks revenues are projected to
cover all operations and maintenance of the FasTracks corridors. At that time, positive fund balances
begin to accumulate on both the base system and FasTracks, with the larger share accumulating on the
base system.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The project cost changes in the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation are projected to result in a total cost
savings of $14.7 million. Approximately $1.2 million of these savings will be offset by the loss of a
CDOT FASTER grant for the Church Ranch platform relocation. The net savings of $13.5 million will be
restored to the FISA between 2016 and 2018.

INFORMATION
Please find the District’s investment report for the second quarter of 2016 attached.
The U.S. economy and household spending continued to expand at a moderate pace during the second
quarter of 2016. The U.S. unemployment rate declined modestly over the period to 4.9% and general
inflationary pressures remained tame.
In order to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Federal
Reserve chose to leave the federal funds target rate range (0.25% - 0.50%) unchanged during the first
quarter. The Federal Reserve stated “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby
supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.”
The District’s Investment Policy (the “Policy”) is conservative in nature and seeks to satisfy the three
primary objectives of: safety, liquidity and yield, in that order of importance.
The Policy specifies that:
“Quarterly reports shall outline the District’s total investment return and compare the portfolio’s
performance to a publicly available index of securities having similar quality and duration characteristics
to the portfolio or sub-portfolio being measured. For the liquidity tier of the portfolio (cash and cash
equivalents), the specified index shall be the 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index as published by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch for the period being measured. For the enhanced cash portion of the portfolio
(securities maturing between 90 days and 5 years and with a target duration of 1 year), the designated
performance benchmark will be the Merrill Lynch 1-year U.S. Treasury Note Index.”
The total return on the liquidity and enhanced cash tiers of the District’s unrestricted portfolio and
investment benchmarks were as follows:
Liquidity Tier:

2nd Quarter

1.C.3

The yield of the District’s unrestricted portfolio through the second quarter of 2016 was 0.70% which
would produce annualized earnings of $1,603,492. The current yield for the month of June was 0.90%.
Historical performance of RTD Liquidity Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy benchmark is
reflected in the following graph:

Historical performance of RTD Enhanced Cash Tier investments relative to the Investment Policy
benchmark is reflected in the following graph:

Information

The Smart Card Program continues to gather taps for EcoPass (business and neighborhood) and
CollegePass riders since the program’s launch on January 2, 2013. There are approximately 256,000
active cards in circulation. During the month of June, 2016, 1.14M taps were recorded, which are
consistent with taps recorded in May 2016 where 1.12M taps were recorded.
The Stored Value MyRide Card is a product that can be purchased by the general public currently
enrolled in the public pilot program to pay for transit fares on fixed route buses and rail platforms. Stored
Value is provided on reloadable plastic cards encoded with RTD fare products. These cards can be
loaded with certain dollar amounts and used much like a gift card. Once the card is loaded, it can be
used to board bus or rail until the dollar amount on the card is less than the fare needed. Additional
value can be loaded onto the card at RTD sales outlets.
Starting the morning of Monday January 4th, cards were being dispersed to the public pilot program
participants at the RTD retail outlets. For the first twenty-nine weeks and as of July 24th, a total of
1,890 cards were issued of which 1,500 (79%) were full fare and 390 (21%) were discount cards.
The average initial stored value loading is $45.01 with a total value loaded including reloads of
$213,800. There have been 70,050 boardings using these MyRide cards with fare payment value of
$153,300 Of these boardings; 69% were local, 28% regional and 2% airport.
All bus installations are completed. All 186 Light and Commuter Rail platform validators have been
installed and are operational, to include 5 new validators on the B Line. More platform validators will be
installed on the Gold Line.
Last month several questions were asked regarding the vendor. First, it was asked if Return on
Investment (ROI) was used as part of the selection criteria. It was not. The following criteria and
weighting were utilized in the selection process.
Compliance with Technical Specification
Cost ( including options)
Qualifications and Experience of Firm
Project Management Plan
Key Personnel

The second question was regarding what other transit entities are currently using a similar Xerox product
and what is their experience. We were able to contact three current users, there is a fourth user, but
we were not able to reach them. All had similar experiences as RTD as far as integration and PCI
compliance issues.

For a variety of reasons, there have
been a small percentage of cards in
circulation that require an
administrative action to extend their
usability. Remediation was made to
some of these cards in March 2016
which yielded positive results.
Challenges continue to remain and for
this reason, the status is shown as
yellow.
This MyRide portal allows the public to
self-administer their MyRide cards.
The MyRide web portal cybersecurity
vulnerabilities are being remediated.
To address Cybersecurity issues and to
extend the life of the system, the
