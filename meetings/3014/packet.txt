BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Paul J. Ballard, Interim General Manager and
CEO

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

N Line Bus and Rail Service Change Final

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan package as revised and summarized in Attachment A. This
will result in a net neutral base system cost, and an estimated N Line Commuter rail service cost of
$27.4 million annualized; and further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute
contract amendments, as necessary, for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #5 – Increase Ridership
BACKGROUND
As part of the overall FasTracks program to enhance rail service in the Denver region, the upcoming
North Metro rail line also known as the N Line will represent significant milestones in achieving improved
connectivity and travel times for RTD customers. The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan (North Metro)
contains recommendations for developing a restructured bus network capable of connecting the
commuter rail service to RTD’s greater network of services. Recommendations in this proposal were
developed using a comprehensive assessment of existing conditions; service area demographics; transit
market research; route performance and analysis; and stakeholder input.
The N Line service area borders I-25 on the west, I-76 on the east, E-470 in the north, and Denver
Union Station in the south. Northglenn, Thornton, and Commerce City are the primary cities in the study
area with parts of Federal Heights included as well. The service area also includes some unincorporated
areas in Denver and Adams Counties.
The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line between Denver Union Station (DUS) and 162nd
Avenue in Adams County. As part of Phase one of the North Metro Corridor, the N Line will operate on a
13-mile segment between DUS and 124th Avenue Station at Eastlake. This segment, with six stations, is
expected to open in 2020 with presently available funding. The remaining planned section from 124th
Avenue Station to 162nd Avenue will have two stations and will be built and operated as Phase two of
the North Metro Corridor though it is currently unfunded.
DISCUSSION
The N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan aims to build a network with bus and rail services that are well
connected and easy to use. To fully ensure that the transit network makes the most effective use of
limited operating resources, it is important that the proposed service change adhere to the RTD Service
Standards and be consistent with RTD’s vision for a regionally integrated transit network.

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

Providing good connections to the N Line Commuter Rail stations utilizing the service currently in the
area, required extending nearby route services into the new stations, resulting in the need for additional
resources. This is due to the amount of added distance to serve the stations in the corridor. However,
the increased resource expenditure does not result in a higher level of service frequency, though it is
hoped that higher levels of ridership will increase the warrants for additional service in the future.
Additionally, the cost impacts of the proposal are offset by savings found in the previous B and G Line
Bus and Rail Service Plan in terms of vehicle requirements (bus) and service hours.
It is important to note the reasoning behind the approach to this service plan as stated in the North
Metro Corridor Final Bus Operations Service Plan:
Route Design Strategies
For optimum performance of a transit network accompanied by best resource utilization, a clear
vision for the entire network is as essential as it is imperative for individual routes to attract
ridership. The following strategies have been used as guiding principles to inform
recommendations for study area bus routes. This framework is expected to result in routes with
both improved operating efficiency and customer attractiveness.
Route Streamlining
The N Line service plan aims to eliminate deviations unless they add value for significant numbers
of riders by serving major destinations, transit hubs, and rail stations falling within the corridor.
Additionally, the proposed recommendations look at streamlining bus transit to increase efficiency
and productivity, while facilitating network integration with the N Line.
Stop Consolidation
A balance between efficient stop spacing to maintain convenient access to transit and reducing
unnecessary delay leads to improvements in transit service effectiveness. Even though stop
consolidation is not proposed in Phase I of the North Metro Corridor project, it is recommended
that RTD continue this program throughout the bus network.
Route Segmentation
In some cases, certain routes perform much better in specific segments. This trend may be a
result of a very long route serving large geographic areas, parts of which may not be as well
suited for transit. In such cases, separating the route into two distinct routes not only improves
adherence to set schedules, but improves efficiency. In the North Metro Corridor, Route 92 is an
example of a route with relatively low ridership from Washington Street/88th Avenue to Summit
Grove Parkway, and higher ridership for rest of the route. This service is a candidate for route
segmentation.
Low Performing Service Replacement
In areas where a route or route segment performs poorly and has limited scope of improvement in
performance, alternatives to fixed route service are considered. These alternative mobility options
include Flex Rides, special shuttles, service routes (tailored for specific trip making, e.g. seniors),

Packet Pg. 4

1.B.1

or commute oriented programs (e.g. station vans, car/bike sharing). These options maintain
service coverage as well as reduce RTD’s net subsidy.
Rail Service
Per most recent simulation from LTK consultants (June 2019), operating plan consists of a 20minute peak and 30-minute off-peak headway. This includes the same vehicles, schedule margin,
station dwell times, minimum turn times at terminals, and three added signal restrictions. In
addition, the A Line has priority in the Denver Union Station (DUS) throat and a southbound N
Line train may experience delays, due to a westbound A Line train operating behind schedule.
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Five public hearings were held during the public comment period, which extended from August through
September of 2019. There were 60 participants in attendance at the public meetings and a number of
comments heard through RTD’s service change website. Letters from the municipal, civic and
community organizations were also received both in support and showing concern for the proposal.
Comments from these meetings and the service change website, along with letters received are
summarized in Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the N
Line Bus and Rail service change:
Route 120 – 120th Avenue/Brighton: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
Route 128 –Broomfield/Wagon Rd: Route patterns changed to serve Wagon Road park-n-Ride
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The base system cost impact of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan is estimated to be net neutral. The
operating and maintenance costs of the N Line is $27.4 million and to be paid from the FasTracks
budget.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed N Line bus and rail service changes
has found no disparate impact or disproportionate burden.

The 41L will compete with the N Line, which is confusing. Weren’t you getting rid
of the R already because of that conflict?
Can we move Mountview stop to connect to the 32?
Would love a way to connect from Brighton to main systems on the weekend.
Is the 39L going away?
What is the 120L time span?
Are we on track for Q1 2020?
Will train frequency be shortened to 15 minutes in the future?
When will route schedules be published?
In regards to routes you’re not currently changing, what will be the impacts to
frequency after the N Line opens?
Will 122X change if the N Line takes ridership away?
Does the 120L run on weekends?
Will 120L run though Brighton PnR on weekends?
Where will the 120L start and stop?
What is the access to the 104th Station?
Studies show that parking does not increase ridership, and lots of people would rather
take the bus because it is cheaper than the train.
RTD should do a better job of reaching out to less-engaged communities.
We need to have more people at these meetings; do bus riders know about these
meetings?
What is the parking situation at the 124th Station?
How much do special events impact schedules to serve customers after standard
hours?
Is the Rockies bus still running?
How would we know if there’s special service for a large event? I don’t see it on the
RTD app.
We need a phone number where you can call to get information, or we need the
special service notifications more visible on the app.
Route 62 is the only route that has special service listed online.
Are the rails grounded?
So this isn’t considered light rail?
What is the seat configuration of the N Line?
Do the N Line cars have steep steps like the light rail or level boarding?
Will any more buses be going to Eastlake Station?

There’s no mention of change to the 39L, please make that more clear.
Did you get rid of route 17 to Red Rocks, or is it now the 125?
When will the parking spaces be open at Thornton PnR?
Are any parking expansions planned for other stations along I-25?
Was the Riverside Cemetery entrance issue resolved with the N Line?
Are there tentative dates or milestones available to the public?
Do we have a risk registry?
What happens when you extend north of 124th? Will the N Line be shut down during
construction?
Why is the proposed schedule for route 92 shorter than it is now?
Please explain the 92 & 93L frequency.
When will the Commerce City station be open?
Will FlexRide be available at any stations?
Does the RTD provide special service for soccer games?

Will these trains have the same PIDS systems as the A Line?
When will phase 2 begin?
Bus to bus transfers are a harder sell than bus to rail. Why not connect 114 to
Eastlake?
80/80L is only 6 miles long. Lots of development west of the western terminal. Would
be very cheap to extend the route further west.
Why is 520 the way that it is?
Could 48 frequency be increased in the peaks?

BOARD INITIATED ACTION ITEM
To:

Board of Directors

Date: July 9, 2020

From:

Angie Rivera-Malpiede, Board Chair & Director,
District C

GM

Date:

July 9, 2020

Board Meeting Date: July 14, 2020

Subject:

Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct Final
Report and Revised Code of Conduct

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The Chair of the RTD Board of Directors presents to the Operations and Customer Service Committee a
motion to approve the final report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Code of Conduct (Ad Hoc Committee)
and the revised RTD Code of Conduct (Code), attached.
This Recommended Action supports the following General Manger’s Goals:
Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership
Task Goal #4 – Strengthen Safety and Security
BACKGROUND
The Code was first approved by the Board in 2016, at a time when large transit agencies across the
country were adopting similar codes. Over time, staff recognized that revisions to the Code were needed
and presented those revisions to the Board for approval, following considerable debate, in April 2020.
The Ad Hoc Committee, composed of RTD staff and key stakeholders from the community, was formed
shortly after and was charged with ensuring that the Code would:
• Continue to work toward preserving the safety, cleanliness, and accessibility of RTD’s system;
• Be enforced fairly, consistently, and equitably; and
• Address public safety needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Committee discussed each rule and provision of the Code at length. The Committee members were
asked to cite their specific questions and concerns regarding the Code and suggest realistic changes to
address those concerns. The suggested changes were vetted by the Committee and incorporated into
the attached version of the Code, which must be readopted by the Board before going into effect.
ALTERNATIVES
1) To approve the final report and Code.
2) To amend the final report, the Code, or both.
3) To postpone action on the adoption of the final report and Code.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the adoption of the final report or the Code.

RTD Code of Conduct
for Persons on RTD Vehicles, Facilities or Property
December 20, 2016
Revised July XX, 2020
1. Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering transportation safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and costeffective transportation throughout the District to all constituents. RTD strives to ensure that everyone is
treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for the safety, convenience,
and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules
prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles
(including RTD buses, access-a-Ride vehicles, call-n-Ride vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail
vehicles), facilities (including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and
fountains, and administrative, operational, and maintenance facilities), or property. Prior to
enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited
by this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement
ranging from a verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5:
“Enforcement”). Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the
Americans with Disabilities Act (see Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”).
2. Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016 by RTD’s Board of Directors and
thereafter amended on July XX, 2020.
3. Prohibited Conduct:
A person (including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever, including but not limited to
companies, clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from
committing, attempting to commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit,
the following acts on any RTD vehicle, at any RTD facility, or on RTD property unless otherwise specified
in this Section:

Fares / Locations
1. Being within any RTD fare paid zone without prior payment of the proper fare.
2. Riding an RTD vehicle without proper fare or complying with RTD fare payment
management systems (including but not limited to failure to obtain and keep evidence
of payment such as transfers and tickets, validate a mobile ticket, and failure to tap
smart card media in accordance with RTD procedures).
3. Failing to possess or to purchase upon request fare of transportation when at an RTD
transportation facility or station or failure to validate a mobile ticket prior to boarding an

4. The ADA and Reasonable Modification:
Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), transportation entities are required to make reasonable
modifications to their policies, practices, and procedures to avoid discrimination and ensure that their
programs are accessible to individuals with disabilities. In accordance with this directive, RTD will make
every effort, to the maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to,
and benefits from, its services. RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and
procedures applicable to its transportation services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure
accessibility for people with disabilities. There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and
procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility. A modification to these policies and procedures
may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has access our services. Examples of
reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under the Accessibility section. When making
a reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:
•Cause a direct threat to the health and safety of others
•Create undue financial and administrative burdens
•Constitute a fundamental alteration to a service
• Be more than necessary to provide equal access to an RTD service
Any questions or concerns on reasonable modification should be directed to RTD’s Division of Civil
Rights, ADA Managers Office: 303-299-2221.
5. Enforcement:
RTD will comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
in the administration of this Code of Conduct.
If violations of this Code of Conduct appear or are claimed to be caused by a disability, RTD
personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
Enforcement will be conducted in a fair and reasonable manner. A person who engages in any of the
above prohibited conduct may be warned and/or ordered to immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility,
or property by a law enforcement officer, an RTD Transit Security Officer, an RTD Bus/Light
Rail/Commuter Rail Line Supervisor, or other authorized RTD personnel. Such personnel are
authorized to issue an order to the person to exit RTD property for up to the remainder of the service
day.
Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to
do so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.

September 2020 Service Change Update

Information

DISCUSSION
This is, in part, an effort to inform the Board of Directors of staff’s intent to implement incremental
changes to service, as a part of the September 2020 operator vote, which is required in the Collective
Bargaining Agreement. The CBA identifies three periods each year (January, May and September) where
the employer agrees to provide operators the opportunity to vote different work schedules.
As reported by various departments within the District, we are still heavily impacted by policies relating
to COVID-19. Our current social distancing policies limiting capacity on transit vehicles make the return
to “normal” service levels more than difficult at this time. More to the point, ridership remains at a third
of former levels, largely affected by reduced commuter activity and low employment center occupancy.
However, in accord with our Collective Bargaining Agreement, we must give our transit operators the
opportunity to vote new work schedules. At the same time, staff will make incremental changes to our
services in an effort to increase on-time performance; implement the long-awaited N Line service plan;
and make room for the return of school service. The following are the key changes staff will make in the
September Operator Vote:
•
•
•

Introduction of the N Line Bus and Rail Service Plan under COVID-19 protocols, which
provide Saturday Levels of service for both bus and rail. N Line rail will operate on a
30-minute all-day frequency
Minor schedule adjustments to increase on-time performance on the following services:
15, 21, 30, 31, 83, 204, 326, NB, H, R and W Lines
Return of school tripper service operated via Special Service Order, to maximize
flexibility, as school districts complete their plans for the upcoming school year

These changes will be produced using our normal processes to ensure that information will be posted to
our customers both online and in print. We will monitor customer response to the implementation of
these changes, and propose adjustments and service alternatives, as appropriate, in future service
change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service, when possible;
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided.

Service Performance 2019

DISCUSSION
RTD’s Mission is "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." This has led to
developing a family of services to match different travel markets. RTD Service Standards & Policies are
used to establish performance requirements for each class of service and identify shortcomings and
successes. The attached report highlights routes that are underperforming due to subsidy per boarding or
boardings per hour so that we can assess the necessary adjustments to improve sustainability.

Service Performance 2019
Networked Family of Services

RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean,
reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service development and
performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or demand? Should service
be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s general approach is as follows.
Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all the services together in a network to
accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match the level-of-service with demand, thus improving
performance and sustainability.

RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help
make judgments about performance. Each rectangle
labeled by service type represents the domain for routes
that meet or exceed the 10% minimum/maximum
performance requirements for that service class. So this
is a case where it’s bad to be “outside the box.”

Subsidy per Boarding or Effectiveness

Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures

the budget—and is presented on the y-axis as subsidy

The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all
less subsidy
classes of services, illustrating both absolute and relative
performance.

Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak periods
and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership significantly exceeds the
minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange, dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings
per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to justify 15-minute frequency, and the
green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues, boardings
and costs—both operating and amortized capital—are included. For complete, detailed information see RTD’s
Transit Service Policies & Standards (under Reports).

Overview

1.C.2.a

Definitions
• Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
• Vehicle (Train) Hours: In-service vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
• Fare Revenues: A new revenue allocation model was implemented in 2017. Revenue allocation is based on
cash fare equivalents, fare zones, rider surveys and total fare revenue. The average fare for local bus service
is calculated as a basis, then local cash fare equivalents are calculated by fare zone. These average fares are
then applied to boardings by route, class and zone.
• Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus depreciation
on all RTD assets, excluding interest and any costs attributed to future projects. RTD’s cost allocation model
allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak vehicles; accounting line items are assigned
to the most relevant variable.
• Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Transit Service Policies & Standards that the least productive 10% of
routes based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for marketing,
revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The performance charts illustrate the
acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting the 10% minimum/maximum for each class of
service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming
the data have a normal distribution and using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence
intervals; however, the standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the
current year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Up through 2017 RTD determined bus service (not rail) boarding counts from farebox
data. In 2018 RTD changed to using Automatic Passenger Counters (APCs) to determine boardings. For the
year 2018 bus boardings were 13% higher using APCs instead of the farebox. This adjust must be made when
comparing ridership before and after 2018. Also, in 2018 the new fare revenue allocation model was
implemented.

Comparison by Class of Service

Bus boardings and service hours reasonably match each other as shares among the service classes. Rail and
Mall services carry many riders relative to the resources they require, while FlexRide and Access-a-Ride are the
opposite. The Subsidy per Boarding (cost-effectiveness) and Boardings per Hour (productivity) charts also
reflect these balances, though rail has a lower cost-effectiveness and higher productivity than bus services.

It is useful to compare all of the classes of service together to help judge the equitable distribution of services
throughout the District. One size does not fit all, so there are a variety of services classes to meet a variety of
market needs, each with its own performance expectation or standard. Customer market share by class of
service is depicted in the Boardings chart and resource allocation is depicted in the Vehicle Hours chart. Since
a boarding may be a transfer and over 50% of all customer trips include at least one transfer, there is overlap
among the classes which is not captured in the chart. Often a customer’s trip could not be completed without
the connectivity that RTD purposefully designs into its networked family of services. The map illustrates RTD
services by service class and the underlying density warrants for service coverage.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain
The following provides the status of these routes as of June, 2020 listed in route number order.

Route 27 East Yale Ave – This service has been modified to increase its efficiency. The new Route 27 – East
Yale service now operates between University Hills and Ulster - Tufts. The former Route 27 west of
Englewood Station to Wadsworth and Hampden is now a western extension of the Route 35. The former
routing east of Colorado Boulevard is now an extension of the Route 46.
Route 31L North Federal Limited - This route has been discontinued with the implementation of the G Line bus
and rail service plan.
Route 32 32nd Ave/City Park – Current ridership and subsidy continue to perform below standards, likely due
to changing demographics east of the CBD. With the move of the VA Hospital, this service continues to
perform below standards.
Route 33 Platte Valley — This service was replaced in August 2019 with the new Platte Valley FlexRide service.
Route 53 North Sheridan - New service implemented with the G Line Rail and Bus Service plan, replacing the
former routing of the Route 51 north of US 36.
Route 55 – New service implemented with the G Line Rail and Bus Service plan; discontinued with the May
2020 Service Change due to low ridership performance.
Route 55L – Service replaced in the G Line Bus and Rail Service Plan with portions of the Route 55 and the new
commuter rail access to the downtown.
Route 67 Ridge Road – This service meets the productivity standard, but falls slightly below the subsidy
standard. It was recommended for discontinuance in 2012, but it was retained due to the absence of
alternative services in the SW Jeffco area.
Route 72L Quaker St via Ward Ltd — This route was discontinued with the implementation of the G Line bus
and rail service plan.
Route 80L West 80th Limited – Significantly under performing in both ridership and subsidy standards, this
route has been merged with Route 80 in the G Line bus and rail service Plan.
Route 104X Commerce City Denver - Serving a relatively small commuter market, this service saw a decline in
ridership and an increase in operating cost which has pushed its subsidy per boarding below 10% standard
although it meets the productivity standard.
Route 112 West 112th Avenue – Currently this route exceeds the 10% boarding per hour standard, but falls
slightly short of the 10% standard for subsidy per boarding. Route restructure in May 2018 made to improve

the efficiency of the route. This service is proposed to be modified in the upcoming N Line Bus and Rail Service
Plan.
Route 116X South Simms – This service meets productivity standard, but has performed below the subsidy
standard since the introduction of the W Line light rail service. A slight reduction in operating cost shows
decrease in subsidy per boarding for 2018. Further service modifications were approved for the May 2020
Service change.

Route 128 Broomfield/Wagon Road - Route falls short on both subsidy and boardings standards. Route
restructure occurred in May 2018 to improve overall efficiency. Further adjustments are proposed in the N
Line Bus and Rail Service Plan.
Route 131 Iliff – Current service falls below the subsidy per boarding standard for Urban Locals. However, the
boardings per hour performance has improved over 2018 figures.
Route 139 Quincy – Meets productivity standard, but is just below the 10% subsidy standard. Will be
monitored.
Route 145X Brighton/Denver Airport - This service continues to fall below the subsidy standard, but meets
productivity standard.
Route 157 CCA/Buckley — A service reduction was made in August 2018 to improve productivity. There was a
slight increase in productivity, but a large increase in operational costs has worsened the subsidy per boarding
and it does not yet meet standards. A service reduction was proposed for the May 2020 service change, but
was modified after the public input process.
Route 169L Buckley/Tower DIA Limited – Due to the length of this service and surrounding land use, it falls
short of the subsidy standard, but significantly exceeds the productivity standard. The route was truncated at
Smoky Hill/Pheasant Run in 2018 , in an effort to increase effectiveness and come into compliance with the
CBA.
Route 228 Louisville/Broomfield – January 2019, route was extended to serve the Kestrel Development, which
should increase ridership. This service will be reviewed for further service modifications.
Route 236 Boulder Junction/US 36 & Table Mesa - Service was introduced in January 2017. This service was
eliminated with the January 2020 service change, due to continued poor ridership performance.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned and retimed for January 2014 and performance improved
somewhat. It remains below subsidy and productivity standards and will continue to be monitored.
Route 483 — This service was implemented in April 2016 with the University of Colorado A Line bus and rail
service plan. The route is a combination of a segment formerly on the Route 153 in Southeast Arapahoe and

the Route 410 in Parker. Service meets productivity standards, but falls slightly below the subsidy standard.
Will be monitored.
Route CV Pine Junction/Conifer/Denver – This route is below subsidy standard, but above ridership standard.
Major service re-structure occurred in August 2018. Additional, service adjustments were adopted in the May
2020 service change proposal.

Route R/RC/RX Brighton/Denver —Service was added in January 2011 and ridership has increased modestly,
but it still does not meet service standards. Two midday trips were discontinued January 2019, due to low
ridership and to improve subsidy performance. Further changes will be made to these services with the N line
Bus and Rail Service Plan slated for 2020.
Interlocken FlexRide – Low performance has been impacted by employee/employer occupancy and fuel
pricing.
Lone Tree FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. Both ridership and
productivity improved slightly from 2016. However, the City has their own Lone Tree Link service since 2015,
which competes for ridership between the Lincoln rail station and several large employers. With the opening
of SERE in 2019, the Link service was reduced and the FlexRide will be reevaluated.
Louisville FlexRide — Meets productivity, but is significantly below subsidy standards. RTD is working with City
on marketing service and adding a shopping trip to help ridership.
Platte Valley FlexRide - New service replacing former Route 33 – Platte Valley.
Wagon Rd FlexRide – New service introduced in November of 2019, ridership has grown to 2.5 boardings per
hour in April-May 2020.
A Line – This service is within the overall rail ridership standard, but falls slightly short of the subsidy per
boarding standard. The service will be monitored and evaluated for service adjustments.
G Line – Service introduced in April 2019 though the bus feeder network was not implemented until August of
2019. Ridership and subsidy levels fall short of the overall rail standard. The service will be monitored and
evaluated for service adjustments.
R Line – Continues to falls short of the ridership standard, with additional service added to Saturday due to
FTA contractual requirements associated with the Southeast Rail Extension project. Modifications of the
service were proposed and adopted in the May 2020 service change.

DEVELOPING THE MOBILITY OF THE FUTURE

• Strong support for service to social equity populations
• Limited support for achieving a low cost (to RTD) per boarding metric
• TWG and AC strongly supported high frequency service to areas with
transit-supportive land uses over spreading service throughout the
District
• All groups favored the idea of a regional transit backbone provided
by RTD and exploring local community partnerships to operate/pay
for local service
• Board of Directors is not yet well aligned around the other near-term
service investment philosophies

• Service provided south of Lincoln is more than warranted
• Rail capacity provided along R line is more than required – two-car trains
required because of SCADA software limitations
• Desire to break trains in low-demand periods to better match service to demand
• Five independent train lines merging at I-25/Broadway results in 20 train
trips/hour – high risk of train delays in this segment
• Ridership drop-offs in fringe periods
• Reported train congestion at RidgeGate in peak periods (12 train trips/hour)
• Need for longer overnight maintenance window

BACKGROUND
This is an update on the General Manager’s Core Goal #2: Address Transit Equity:
• Create a Plan to Strengthen Relationship with Disability Community.
RTD staff met and discussed different ways to improve our relationship with the disability community
through our existing ADA committees. A proposed plan was created and submitted by the initial
deadline of May 15, 2020.

Attachment: ADA Committees At RTD (4256 : Update on GM Core Goal #2: Address Transit Equity)

FROM:

Within the past few years, RTD has increased efforts in our communication and engagement with the
disabled community by establishing a new Advisory Committee for People with Disabilities (ACPD)
and restructuring our existing ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC).
The 13-member ACPD committee explores ways to improve RTD services for people with disabilities.
It focuses on ADA-related issues with regards to fixed-route bus services, rail services, employment
and communications at RTD.








ACPD members are selected through an application process. Members are assigned 1, 2 and
3-year terms to create staggered terms and create continuity as members reach the end of their
terms. Each member may apply for a second 3-year term after a one-year hiatus. No person
shall serve more than two terms.
ACPD members elect a chairperson and a co-chair from among its members. The chairs will
each serve a two-year term.
ACPD is an advisory group; therefore, its decisions will take the form of recommendations to
a Steering Committee comprised of RTD AGMs or Senior Managers.
The purpose of the ADA Steering Committee is to provide and support a multi-directional
communication channel for RTD senior leadership to identify, discuss, direct, and
communicate RTD responses to ADA-related concerns.
ACPD meetings are held on a quarterly basis.

Although, ACPD has been operating successfully within the last couple of years, the following are
some alternative improvements that we are considering implementing that we think can enhance the
efficiency of ACPD and bring about positive changes:


Propose that ACPD meet every other month



Propose that an RTD Board member appointed by the Board Chair be added to the
ACPD Steering Committee as a member and bring forward a periodic update to the
Board during the Civil Rights Committee update meetings.



Propose that ACPD provides a copy of the meeting minutes to the RTD Board

It should be noted that ACPD and RTD staff work to ensure a successful division of labor between
ACPD and APAC so that the two advisory committees are not giving advice on the same topic. To
promote communication between the two advisory committees, RTD makes every effort to make
committee appointments such that one member is serving simultaneously on both ACPD and APAC.
APAC is also comprised of 13-members and it is geared towards promoting an effective, efficient, and
customer-responsive paratransit services at RTD. APAC members consult with RTD staff on issues,
trends, needs, policies, and resources pertaining to Access-a-Ride services throughout the district and
offer a unique perspective with the goal of continuously improving those services.

APAC members are also selected through an application process. Members were initially assigned 1, 2 and 3-year
terms to create staggered terms and create continuity as members reach the end of their terms. Each member may
apply for a second 3-year term after a
one-year hiatus. No person may serve more than two terms.
APAC meetings are conducted by a third-party facilitator
This is an advisory group; therefore, its decisions will take the form of recommendations to the RTD staff
APAC meetings are held every other month
APAC provides a copy of their meeting minutes to the RTD Board
APAC provides periodic report to the RTD Board of Directors

APAC provides valuable input on paratransit-related matters, including improved vehicle design for a new fleet purchase.
Both APAC and ACPD committees include community members with disabilities, advocates for the disabled, travel
trainers, and representative organizations.
Although, APAC went through a major restructuring about 4 years ago, we think that there is an opportunity to recommend
some new changes that would essentially enhance the efficiency of APAC:





Propose that APAC adopts a Steering Committee made up of at least 5 RTD Senior Managers or AGMs

Propose that an RTD Board member appointed by the Board Chair be added to the Steering Committee
member of APAC and bring forward a periodic update to the Board in the Operations & Customer Service
Committee, it's sponsor
Propose that APAC adopts the same format that ACPD uses to make recommendations or bring concerns to RTD’s
attention

Handout (a) – RTD TAM Plan Elements

1. INVENTORY

Revenue vehicles

These are the assets classes needing to be addressed in the agency TAM Plan
and is the foundation to robust Asset Management System (AMS).

Infrastructure
Facilities
Equipment
Systems

An inventory answers these basic questions:
• What assets do we own? – Unique Identifier
• How old are our assets – In Service Date
• How long should our assets last? – Estimated Useful Life
• What is it going to cost to replace? – Estimated Replacement Cost

What condition are the assets
in?

Condition assessment is a broad term used by the FTA, as a result, the
condition assessments are prescriptive based on the asset type. Types of
Condition Assessments include:
• Physical Condition
• Performance
• Age

3. DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS

What tools and processes do we
use to prioritize funding around
those assets described in our
inventory?

On an annual basis, RTD executes a process which prepares and updates a sixyear Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP) including projected capital construction
and improvements, service levels and operating costs, and revenues to fund
the capital and operating programs. Part of process includes prioritizing the
projects into three funding categories:
• Compliance
• Renewal
• Enhancement
The Asset Management Plan (AMP) is the primary source for the Renewal
category. The AMP is a list of asset renewals generated by the inventory data
and prioritized by the Asset Management Working Group (AMWG).

4. PRIORITIZED LIST OF INVESTMENTS

What is the result or output of
those decision support tools and
processes?

The output of the annual Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP) process is two
primary lists of projects: Capital Projects & Capital Maintenance Projects. Each
of these lists is subdivided into three funding categories: Compliance, Renewal,
and Enhancement.
The AMP is a list of asset renewals generated by the inventory data and
prioritized by the Asset Management Working Group (AMWG). The GM/CEO is
the Accountable Executive (AE) and must approve the prioritized list of
investments.

2. CONDITION ASSESSMENT

5. TAM AND SGR POLICY

What are the guiding principles
for asset management efforts at
our agency?

The intent of the policy is to improve how RTD manages assets from now on - it
is therefore forward-looking in nature and represents our vision and shared
commitment for good Asset Management at RTD. The Asset Management
System applies to the entire organization and directs the short, medium, and
long-term plans for assets to achieve our agency purpose of moving people.

Packet Pg. 170

1.D.2.a

Handout (a) – RTD TAM Plan Elements

6. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

How are we going to execute
the TAM plan at our agency?

RTD has chosen ISO 55000 as the framework on which to build its Asset
Management System. An established standard auditable by an outside party
creates transparency and trust with the riding public, taxpayers, and governing
bodies.

7. LIST OF KEY ANNUAL ACTIVITIES

RTD identifies two types of asset management activities:
• Those ongoing asset management activities that RTD performs as part
of ‘business as usual’, and
• Those activities specific to achieving ISO 55000 certification.
TAM activities are a subset of these targeting the specific TAM elements.

8. IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES

What resources do we need to
execute TAM plan activities at
our agency?

Resources from across the agency are involved in RTD’s Asset Management
activities, including the Board, CEO/GM, the Senior Leadership Team, the Asset
Management Division (AMD), Bus Operations, Rail operations, Capital
Programs, Finance and Administration, Communications, Planning, and General
Counsel.
The AMD acts as the asset management subject matter experts that serve an
enabling function to the agency.

9. EVALUATION PLAN

What is the agency doing to
ensure that the TAM plan
delivers the intended results?

There are two primary areas of the Evaluation Plan; the TAM Plan itself and ISO
55000.
The current TAM Plan provides the baseline for evaluating future TAM Plans
produced by the Agency. RTD intends to regularly review its asset
management maturity, setting maturity targets in its Strategic Asset
Management Plan.
RTD intends to evaluate the degree to which it is meeting the requirements for
ISO 55000, and therefore its readiness for an ISO 55001 certification audit,
through the following measures and sequence:
1.
2.
3.
4.

ISO Mock Audit

ISO Surveillance Audits

Attachment: Service Availability Memo - June 2020 (4257 : Service Availability June 2020)

TO:

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.86% of all scheduled hours of bus
service in June 2020. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflects an
improvement as compared to the same month (May) last year. Lost service for personnel
related reasons follows:
•
•
•
•

June 2020 – 7.61 hours
June 2019 – 190.12 hours
Year to date hours for 2020 – 1551.60 hours
Year to date hours 2019 – 2255.04 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in June were bus bridges and the COVID-19
pandemic and the pandemic service reduction.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.86% of all scheduled hours of service in the month,
it was necessary to cover 0 shifts with RTD operators working a 6th day (one of their
scheduled days off). This represents approximately 0 hours of service being provided by a
“6th day” RTD operator. Additionally, our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev,
covered 0 shifts, or approximately 0 hours of service, with operators working a “6th day”.
Additional information regarding bus operator headcount follows:
