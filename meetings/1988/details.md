### B. State of the District Address (Phil Washington)

Phil Washington, General Manager, provided a presentation on his State of the District address reviewing the 2014 goals, achievements and challenges as well as identifying 2015 goals and anticipated challenges for each department.

General Manager Washington shared that this annual presentation is key as it lets the Directors and staff know where RTD has been, where we are, and what the challenges are for the near future.

General Manager Washington stated that the District remains sound.  RTD faces many challenges that are being addressed with opportunities that are achievable.  He said that the State of the District is one of learning, empowerment, accountability, interoperability, and achievement.

The full presentation of the State of the District Address is available in the December 9, 2014 Financial Administration and Audit Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.

Director Menten asked for the benefits of hosting the National Transportation Institute’s training on the new changes to the Disadvantage Business Enterprise (DBE) regulations.  She wondered if this meant complementary passes (comps) would be available for all employees since the registration fee is $450.  General Manager Washington explained that when an agency hosts a conference the usual is around 10 comps.  He said that this conference will be a great time to develop staff and that the registration is well worth it.

Director Menten asked staff to expand on the fact that there were no protested contracts during 2014.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, clarified that this meant no other bidder legally challenged the award of a contract.

Director Solano inquired regarding the State of Good Repair of the 16th Street Mall shuttles since RTD has not been able to buy new ones.  Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, explained that RTD was not successful in the attempt to replace the 16th Street Mall shuttles.  Staff sent another bid and has received two proposals that are under review by the maintenance and procurement staff.  Bruce Abel said that in the interim the maintenance staff is going above and beyond doing what is necessary to keep the 16th Street Mall shuttles on the road.  This includes essentially manufacturing parts that are not available anymore.

Committee Chair Walker called for a 5 minute recess at 6:32 p.m.

Committee Chair Walker resumed the meeting at 6:38 p.m.

#### 1. 2014 State of the District Address

##### a. State of the District final 12-9-14

#### 1. 2014-015 : Investment Policy

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopt the Investment Policy Statement (the “Policy”), attached.

Motion:               Director Bagley made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, explained that this item was postponed from the November 18, 2014 Financial Audit and Administration Committee Meeting.  Terry Howerter introduced Brendan Morgan, Manager for Debt and Investments.  Brendan Morgan explained that staff solicited the expertise, knowledge, and recommendations of its investment advisor in revising the Policy.  He noted that the recommended changes, which are highlighted in the Board of Directors Report for the Investment Policy Recommended Action, are mainly in response to changes made to Colorado State Statutes in 2014.

Director Lubow thanked staff for providing more information on this matter.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

##### a. Investment Policy Markup

##### b. Investment Policy Final

#### 2. Approval of 2015 Final Performance Measures

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors adopts the 2015 Final Performance Measures proposed recommendations for Goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3.  The final recommendations for these goals are made after the 2015 Budget is adopted in November to reflect budget estimates.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Bagley seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, reminded the Directors that goals 3.1, 6.2, and 6.3 are finalized after the 2015 Budget adoption in November because these goals are contingent upon budget amounts and available resources.

Director Menten noted the drop in estimated revenue on the West line.  She asked if any of the figures on these goals included updates from naming rights.  Phil Washington, General Manager, replied that staff is still working on naming rights and that the performance measures do not include any revenue from them.

Director Folska asked about the naming rights status, specifically how much longer does RTD work with a contractor before they deliver.  Scott Reed, Assistant Manager for Communications, replied that staff is working closely with IMG, the contractor for naming rights.  IMG has been aggressive in pursuing naming rights and agreements.  Scott Reed pointed out that the naming rights project is a fairly large ticket item built into 2015 budgets.  Committee Chair Walker asked that any further discussion on the naming rights be taken offline as it was not relevant to the approval of the 2015 Final Performance Measures.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. 2015 FINAL performance measures

#### 3. 2014 - 017 : Recommendation for Passage of Resolution Regarding Defense of RTD Management Trustees Appointed to RTD/ ATU 1001 Trusts

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution authorizing retention of defense counsel and payment of all defense costs, and procurement of insurance if available for management trustees appointed to the RTD/ATU 1001 Health and Welfare and Pension Trusts, without reservation of rights of recovery of such costs regardless of any determination of liability, to the extent such defense costs are not covered by the trusts or their insurers.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, asked Marla Lien, General Counsel, to present this recommended action to the Directors.

Marla Lien explained that the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) call for the RTD/ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust and the RTD/ATU 1001 Pension Trust to be administered by three management appointed and three ATU appointed trustees.  As new appointees step into the trustee roles, staff recommends that they be protected from liability.

Director Lubow asked regarding the timing of the recommendation.  She wondered why staff is recommending this now.  Marla Lien explained that there are past lawsuits.  She said that it is important to take into consideration the fiduciary responsibility asked from the trustees as Phil Washington, General Manager, asks new people to take on that role.  Director Lubow wondered if providing defense counsel and payment of defense of cost is typical of other agencies.  Marla Lien replied that she could not speak to that as she was not aware of many major trusts with the 3 management appointed and 3 Union appointed trustees.

Director Lubow asked if this protection would only come into play if the contract was breached.  Marla Lien replied that if the insurance picks up the defense then RTD will not have to.  However, the insurance is limited and at times the allegations made will leave the person without defense.

Director Solano recalled from the State of the District presentation that one of the positions in the Legal Department is a risk manager lawyer.  He wondered if this person reviewed any arising issues.  Marla Lien clarified that the Risk Manager, currently Robert Medina, is not an attorney. She said that she reviews with him any arising issues.  If the issues are not provided for, then staff adds it to RTD’s fiduciary structure.  As an example, she noted that RTD has a fiduciary structure to protect the Directors.

Director Deadwyler asked if the appointed trustees were competent enough to foresee when and if they are getting themselves into trouble in order to avoid problems before they happen.  Marla Lien replied that Phil Washington appoints the trustees and she provides legal feedback.  Phil Washington added that he believes the three appointees are very competent.  He said that he appointed people whose combined skillset are necessary to understanding health and welfare pension funds:

- Understanding of Accounting and Finance: Doug MacLeod, Manager for Financial Reporting

- Understanding of Union Issues: Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations

- Understanding the District and its Employees: Beverly Lindsey, Employee Liaison.

Phil Washington explained that any action by the trust requires a unanimous decision by the three management-appointed trustees and the three Union trustees.  He added that it is hard to say if the composition is typical since he has not seen anything similar in the nation.  Phil Washington said that regardless of what other agencies do, it is the right step for RTD to provide defense for employees in the trustee position.

Director Anderson agreed with Phil Washington.  She noted that legal protection is the Director’s obligation and duty to the staff serving as trustees.  She explained that this would protect trustees if sued personally.  She added that any of the Directors could be sued, yet the fiduciary structure indemnifies the Directors.

Director Menten asked which party, RTD or the Union, wanted to have this trustee setup.  Phil Washington said that this item has been part of the CBA for probably 30 years.  She asked if RTD could renegotiate the contract with a 30 day notice.  Phil Washington replied that we could.  Director Menten said that it seems like the CBA is flawed.  She added that due to contract wording, tax payers are contributing money into a health insurance plan for employees that do not exist.  Director Menten said she would vote no due to the potential cost to tax payers and the potential of putting RTD employees in legal jeopardy.

Chair Sisk agreed with Director Anderson’s comments.  He noted that Director Menten made a good point, yet revising the CBA is another issue to be dealt with separately.  He looks forward to voting yes on this recommended action.

Committee Chair Walker agreed with Chair Sisk.  He noted the point made by Director Menten.  He added that he doubts he would be a Director if he was not protected as he has seen his name on a couple of lawsuits.  Committee Chair Walker said that the Directors owe this legal protection to the employees.

Director Lubow recalled her unpleasant experience being personally sued while working in a Federal position.  She added that the department took time to decide if it would protect her, which was very stressful.   Director Lubow said she would vote yes because the employees need to be protected.

Director James agreed with Director Menten about the CBA; however, he noted that in the short term, legal protection of the employees appointed as trustees is the right thing to do.

Director Deadwyler said that she would vote yes.  She asked if staff is concerned that trustees may be sued due to CBA flaws.  Phil Washington replied that the flaws on the CBA are not a cause of concern.  He noted that anyone can sue anyone.  Marla Lien added that lawsuits happen when funds run low and people get angry.

Director Solano asked if the Risk Manager position is still necessary.  Marla Lien replied that the largest part of the Legal Department’s budget is risk management as it covers many facets across the District: workers comp, bus and rail, property, fiduciary claims based on Title VI and Title VII, among others.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED.

#### 4. 2014 - 016 : Resolution No. ___, Series of 2014 Appointment of Trustees to the RTD Pension Trust and Defined Contribution Plan

Motion:               Director Folska made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board Meeting.

Chair Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:               There was no discussion on this item.

Committee Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 5. Enhance IT Disaster Recovery Capabilities

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary actions and to execute all documents necessary to partially fund Information Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems.  This is an amount of approximately $1.2 million.

Motion:               Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the December 16, 2014 Board Meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:                Director Hoy shared his concern with funding the enhancement to IT Disaster Recovery capabilities with funds from the sale of property that should go to the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).  He stated that using these funds would not hold true to the agreement to funding the FISA.  He noted that he is not speaking against buying the necessary IT equipment, yet he suggested to not use funds that are from the sale and proceeds of the Alameda & Havana land.

Motion to

Amend:                Director Hoy made the motion to amend the recommended action to read as stated by Marla Lien, General Counsel:

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorizes the General Manager to take all necessary actions and to execute all documents necessary to partially fund Information Technology’s Disaster Recovery (DR) infrastructure and systems. This is an amount of approximately $1.2 million.  Funding is to exclude land sale proceeds as a source of funds for the IT Disaster Recovery equipment.

Director Lubow seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Deadwyler disagreed with the amendment.  She believes that the IT situation is critical and RTD should use the money from the sale of the land to repair.  She said she understands why reserves for FasTracks and base operations are needed, yet IT should be updated so the agency does not experience a similar problem in the next couple of years.

Director Lubow agreed that IT needs to be taken care of after the mini crisis a few weeks ago.  She said that she was concerned that using the money from the  FISA would take away from the unfunded corridors.  This would mean $1.2 million not going to the northern communities.  She pointed out that from the Board of Directors Report it was not clear what would be obtained with $1.2 million.

Director James agreed with Director Hoy in that the IT system is an emergency that needs to be solved.  He said that using money from the reserves is consistent with the purpose of having reserves.  He asked if the stated use of FISA fits funding something like IT systems. Director Hoy replied that the FISA is meant to fund all of FasTracks: not just the Northern Corridor but all unfunded corridors and extensions.  He stated that the FISA is not intended to fund computer replacements.  He added that contingency money is there to fund emergencies.  Director James said that this answered his question.

Director James asked staff what the rational was in using the FISA.  Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, noted that there is a need to fund the IT Disaster Recovery enhancements.  He noted that there are 3 funds that staff and Directors would like to fund to $30 million:

- Board Restricted Fund, which the Board can authorize expenditures from.

- Capital Acquisition Fund

- Unrestricted Fund, which fluctuates with revenue and capital projects expenses.

Terry Howerter said that the Unrestricted Fund is where funds would usually be drawn from for items such as the IT Disaster Recovery enhancements.  He added that this fund in 2015 would only have $8.6 million to use without going to the Board and requesting from the Capital Acquisition or Board Restricted Fund.

Director Anderson stated that she is against the amendment.  She said that RTD has a real emergency.  Without IT, she noted, RTD cannot run FasTracks, buses, trains or anything.  She added that she does not see anything in the near future that will need FISA funding.  She expressed her concern over the approved budget and the lack of deep reserves.

Director Bagley asked staff how much money is in the FISA and where the funding came from.  Terry Howerter replied that there is $21,509,000.  He said that about $9 million came from the Southwest extension Union Pacific tracks relocation.  The selling of air rights contributed $5.5 million.  Director Bagley reiterated that almost half of the funding came from the relocation of the Union Pacific tracks because it was better to do the project as one.  He stated that he is a regionalist and voted for delaying this project despite it benefitting his district, so he will be voting against the amendment.

Chair Sisk recalled that the budgets for 2015 and 2016 have appropriated moneys for IT Disaster Recovery Enhancements.  Terry Howerter explained that there is appropriated money for State of Good Repair and replacement of assets, not for Disaster Recovery.  He added that the Disaster Recovery took about 3 days on the email outage.  If the Disaster Recovery storage units would have been in place, recovery would have taken place in a few hours.  Chair Sisk asked if staff was suggesting there is not any money for Disaster Recovery.  Terry Howerter replied in the affirmative.  Chair Sisk inquired if this outage was completely unforeseen by IT staff.   Staff does have a roadmap for maintenance and replacement.  He added that the server that went down was scheduled for replacement in January. Chair Sisk asked if the funds to replace the item will still come from the 2015 budget.   Terry Howerter replied that the funds budgeted for the replacement will still come from the line item for January.  He said it was a “rob Peter to pay Paul” situation.

Director Lubow asked if the Unrestricted Fund would be the most appropriate place to use for funding the IT Disaster Recovery Enhancement.  Terry Howerter said that as CFO, his goal is to fund all three funds to $30 million as soon as possible.  He added that the sale of the land parcel was an unbudgeted item.  His suggestion is to use these funds.  Director Lubow asked if this item could be funded out of Capital Acquisitions.  Terry Howerter replied that it would be a possibility if the Board desired to do that.

Director Solano said that when he first was elected as a Director two years ago he recommended work on the IT situation and was blown off.  He stated his concern over the “rob Peter to pay Paul” situation.  He said that projects keep getting shaved for other projects.  He mentioned the dual line project that was taken out of the budget for North Metro as an example.

Committee Chair Walker asked how much is in the Unrestricted fund.  Terry Howerter said that 2015 year end projection is $8.6 million.  Committee Chair Walker asked if it matter where the funds to cover the IT Disaster Recovery Enhancement came from.  Terry Howerter replied that it did not matter as long as the Board approves the transfer of funds from the funded accounts (the Capital Acquisitions and the Board Restricted Fund).

Director Lasater said he consulted with his IT staff.  From their conversations he concluded that it will be expensive to put the IT Disaster Recover Enhancements in place.  However, the best way to go about the problem is to outsource it to professionals who do IT systems full time, professionally.  Director Lasater suggested migrating to Cloud Technology.  He said that it might be expensive but it would be less expensive than RTD trying to do it ourselves.

Director Anderson asked what the Capital Acquisition Fund is expected to be at 2015 year end.  Terry Howerter replied that it is projected at $15 million.  Director Anderson noted that by that time RTD will still be deciding on capital projects.  She said that it sounds like there is no free money anywhere.
