GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A. Authorization for Contract Amendment with White Construction for Elati Maintenance
Facility
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to award a contract amendment not to exceed $200,000 to White
Construction Group for additional enhancements to the Elati Light Rail Maintenance
Facility. This action would increase the current contract amount of $5,357,417.64,
including previously awarded change orders, to a new contract total of
$5,557,417.64. Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2011
Proposed Amended Budget for the FasTracks Light Rail Maintenance Facility Project.
B. I-225 Property Acquisition Phase I
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for
construction of the I-225 Segment 1 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.
C. RTD-CCD East Colfax Transit Project Intergovernmental Agreement
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
complete an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between RTD and the City and County
of Denver (CCD) for RTD’s participation in the East Colfax Transit Project (ECTP).
Funding for this project is included in the 2011 Proposed Amended Budget through a $2
million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), with $1 million local match
provided by CCD. There would be no net financial impact to RTD.
D. Recommendation for Transfer of Funds from RTD to Denver Union Station Project
Authority
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that: (1) RTD enter into
an Agreement to obtain FASTER grant funds from the Colorado Department of
Transportation (CDOT) in the anticipated amount of $4 million for use in the historic
Denver Union Station (DUS) which may be administered in conjunction with Denver Union
Station Project Authority (DUSPA); (2) transfer funds from 16 Chestnut LLC or a related
entity for construction of a roadway and pedestrian access at 16th Street and the

Consolidated Main Line (CML) to DUSPA; and (3) grant the General Manager authority to
execute any agreements or amendments necessary for this purpose, which may provide
for advance of grant funds prior to receipt from CDOT and may provide transfer of funds
from RTD to DUSPA.
E. Oracle ERP Developer Contractor
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his delegate, to execute all documents
necessary to award a new 3 year contract, for the amount not to exceed of $495,000,
for Oracle ERP Developer services to Access Data Consulting Corporation, contract #
11DC001. The contract is being brought to the Board because it is a Personal Services
contract per RTD Resolution No.27, Series of 1985.
F. Approval of August 2011 Service changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors approve the August 21, 2011 Service Change package as revised and
summarized in Attachment A resulting in a net annualized cost of approximately
$272,000, and, further, to authorize the General Manager to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.
XII.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
G. Authorization to Approve IGA for funding for the Broadway/Euclid Transportation
Improvements in Boulder
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to partially fund the transit
related improvements associated with the pedestrian/transportation improvement project
located on Broadway at Euclid with the City of Boulder in the amount not-to-exceed
$570,000. Funding for the project is included in the 2011 Proposed Amended Budget.
It is further recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $570,000 from the Broadway & Euclid
capital project in the 2011 Proposed Amended Budget to expense to facilitate proper
accounting for the IGA.
