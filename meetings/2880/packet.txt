BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 5, 2019

From:

Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer

GM

Date:

June 5, 2019

Board Meeting Date:

Subject:

August 2019 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2019 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting
in an annualized base system cost savings of $856,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
Task Goal #1 – Fiscal Sustainability
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and finances allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions.
Alongside the implementation of the Board adopted G Line Bus Service Plan, these service proposals are
submitted in an effort to maintain the existing transit network in accordance to RTD’s Service Standards
and Policies. Included is a proposal to discontinue service on the Route 33 – Platte Valley, due to low
ridership and replace the fixed route service with the proposed Platte Valley FlexRide. Proposals affecting
the Broomfield, Golden, Superior FlexRides are also submitted in this proposal. Additionally, a number of
service changes aimed at increasing on-time performance and service reliability are also included. We will
monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments
and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATION
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following proposals have been significantly modified:
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue: minor adjustment to downtown routing near Wewatta and Delgany
Streets.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $856,000.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. Our evaluation of the proposed August 2019 service changes has
found no disparate impacts.

Atch A – August 2019 Service Change

Local
Route 3L – East Alameda Avenue
Route 83 - Cherry Creek/ Parker Road
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add an exception bus stop at Speer Boulevard/Washington Street, to serve a developing
high density neighborhood. This change would also provide an alternative to Route 1 on 1st
Avenue. No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 4 – Morrison Road
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Implement Saturday service, based on strong weekday midday ridership performance (30
passengers per hour), which will address a life-line weekend neighborhood transportation
gap. Cost impacts anticipated to be an estimated 728 hours and $105,600 annualized.
Route 6 - East 6th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Running time analysis and schedule adjustments, focused on peak periods. No cost impacts
anticipated.
Route 10 – East 12th Avenue
Service Standard type - CBD Local – (10% - 15.2 pass. per hr. / 25% - 22.3 pass. per hr.)
Add one trip and respace all trips from 9th/Clermont to downtown Denver between 7:30am
and 8:30am, in an effort to relieve passenger capacity issues. Additionally, 5 westbound
Route 10 morning trips which currently terminate at 15th Street/Delgany, will instead turn
right from 15th Street onto Wewatta Street, and terminate at Wewatta/17th Street adjacent
to the Wewatta Pavilion at Denver Union Station. Cost impacts anticipated to be an
estimated 255 hours and $21,000 annualized.
Route 31 - Federal Boulevard
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Early morning and late evening trips will be curtailed on the route’s long-distance pattern
from the existing 112th Ave (FRCC) terminal to 106th & Melody. This is due to a request
by Front Range Community College for RTD to vacate its existing on-campus bus terminal
used by route 31, low ridership on the far north segment of the route to FRCC, and the need
for operator restrooms to be open for the route’s late evening trips. (Pending outcome of
operator test bus). No cost impacts anticipated.
Route 33 – Platte Valley
Service Standard type - Urban Local – (10%-12.2 pass. per hr. / 25%-19.1 pass. per hr.)
Discontinue service due to low ridership and replace with new Platte Valley Flex Ride. Due
to low ridership performance, it proposed that this route service be discontinued. Current
ridership performance stands at 10.3 passenger per hour, which falls below the Urban Local

FlexRide
Broomfield FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2016, the Broomfield FlexRide expanded the service area and added a 2nd vehicle
which was funded by a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant applied for by the
City and County of Broomfield. The grant was for 3 years. In 2015 the Flex Ride had
averaged 4.0 boardings per hour operating with one bus and a small service area. The grant
doubled the FlexRide service area. The average boardings per hour from Aug 16-Feb 19
has been 2.9 boardings per hour. Recommendation is to discontinue the 2nd vehicle and
reduce the FlexRide service area to operate with one vehicle. Recommended service area
will have the FlexRide east boundary at Sheridan. Service times for the reduced area will
continue to be 5:30am – 7:00pm. The City and County of Broomfield applied for a new
grant to keep the expanded service area and the 2nd vehicle. If this grant is approved prior

Golden FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2017, the RTD and the City of Golden agreed to a Cost Share Agreement in which
the city agreed to pay for 1 additional vehicle on the Golden FlexRide route. Prior to this
agreement, the RTD FlexRide operated the flex route every 30 minutes with 1 bus. The 2nd
bus on the FlexRide route has the service at every 15 minutes. There are 2 other buses that
operate the “on demand” service in Golden. The boardings per hour for 2018 was at 6.2
boardings per hour. Recommendation is to keep the 2nd bus on the FlexRide route.
Anticipated cost impacts are estimated to be $132,677 including fuel.

Superior FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
In August 2016, the Superior FlexRide began service. The FlexRide was funded by a
Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ) grant applied for by the Town of Superior. The
grant was for 3 years. The average boardings per hour from Aug 16-Feb 19 has been 3.4
boardings per hour. Recommendation is to keep the Superior FlexRide. Anticipated cost
impacts are estimated to be $162,830 including fuel.
Platte Valley FlexRide
Service Standard type – FlexRide–(10%-2.0 pass. per hr. /25%-2.9 pass. per hr.)
FlexRide service will replace Route 33 – Platte Valley. Trips will match the Route 33 with
the same times and alignment except that the route will use Lipan rather than Kalamath.
Service will be operated with a small, 14 seat, shuttle type bus. Anticipated cost impacts
are estimated to be $145,000 annualized, including fuel.

Board of County Commissioners

Regional Transportation District (RTD)
Attn: Customer Care Division
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202

To Whom It May Concern:
As staunch supporters of enhanced transit in the Denver Metropolitan area. And, like RTD, as
the Board of County Commissioners move into our own 2020 budget discussions and the
impacts facing our County, we understand the challenges that lay ahead for Boards such as
yourself as you look at the areas you serve.
However, like the City of Golden, there is a concern with the adjustment to fare structure and
proposed service cuts for the W Line and support Golden ' s Resolution No. 2658: A Resolution
of the City Council of the City of Golden Recommending Adjustments to Regional
Transportation District Fare Structure and Service Cuts Affecting the W Rail Line.
As you are aware, the W Line terminates at the Jefferson County Government Center, which is a
location where citizens access a wide range of government services. RTD chose to make this
stop a regional, the only one on the W Line, rather than a local stop, resulting in increased fares
for many of the citizens of our community that can least afford to pay higher rates.
We respectfully ask that you reconsider the decision to make the Jefferson County Government
Center a regional stop and continue to engage the community in identifying ways to increase
ridership and serve the community.

May 2019 RTD Service Change Recommendations for W Line

Purpose of Agenda Item: This item is presented to Council as follow-up to
Council's discussions over the past month regarding potential May 2019 service
changes by the Regional Transportation District (RTD) . The item includes a draft Council
resolution for discussion on February 28th and repeats some previously presented
background material.

Background: RTD evaluates its overall service plan for busses and rail three times a
year. This effort is intended to match the level of service provided within the district to
available resources. Potential service enhancements or reductions are identified and
presented to the public in a series of public meetings, prior to board consideration and
action . In the past, the City of Golden has requested adjustments to the RTD
recommendations, most recently in August 2017 to request that RTD hold off on
reducing the frequency of trains for non-peak (mid-day) hours rail service from 15 minute
to 30 minute frequency. Based in part on our request RTD did not reduce "mid-day"
weekday or Saturday service frequency in those changes that went into effect in January
2018.
On January 19th, 2019, Council was notified by the local RTD Director that a further
Saturday service reduction is under consideration. If enacted , this service reduction
would change the frequency of Saturday "daytime" service from every 15 minutes to
every 30 minutes to match Saturday evening and Sunday all day service. RTD staff
estimates that this service reduction would save approximately $134,000 a year based
upon the reduction from 7 all day trains to six. The recommendation is based upon
Saturday ridership levels below RTD standards.
City Council discussed the infomiation from RTD on January 241h and provided direction
to staff. The primary recommendation was that Council felt a meeting in Golden,
attended. by RTD representatives, would be necessary in order to effectively
communicate about the proposed changes, as well as other local issues related to the
RTD system and operations. The other topics discussed that evening included Golden's

Packet Pg. 13

on-going support for transit mobility options and a serious concern about the existing
fare structure and map that places the W Line end of line station just outside the
boundary of having a trip downtown from this station be a "local" fare. The significant
price differential between a local fare at $3.00 and the current "regional" fare of $5.25 for
a trip to downtown Denver is a significant deterrent to ridership.

Attachment: Atch B Jefferson County and Golden Letters 04.22.19 (3859 : August 2019 Service Changes)

Following that January 24th, 2019 Council discussion , a community meeting was
scheduled and held on February 13th in City Council Chambers. The meeting was
attended by several staff and board members from RTD, all of City Council, and a
number of Golden citizens. Each Councilor commented on the record for RTD in support
of changing the fare structure and/or map, in opposition to the Saturday cuts, and in
continued support of transit alternatives.

Alternatives: As a result of the February 13th community meeting and City Council
comments, the attached draft resolution has been prepared for Council discussion and
potential action. Council's meeting comments are already on the record but Council may
wish to take the more formal step of adopting a resolution.

Recommendations: Staff recommends that City Council discuss the draft resolution
and determine whether to use the resolution as a more formal response to RTD before

1.B.1.b

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF
GOLDEN RECOMMENDING ADJUSTMENTS TO REGIONAL
TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT FARE STRUCTURE AND
SERVICE CUTS AFFECTING THEW RAIL LINE
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden and its residents and businesses contribute significant amounts
of tax dollar resources to the Regional Transportation District (RTD) system; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden is a staunch supporter of enhanced transit in the Denver
Metropolitan area; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines, individually contributed
local funds to the 2013 establishment of the combination Call and Ride/Flex Route service at the end of
line station ofthe W Rail Line, which service is one of the most successful elements ofRTD' s Call and
Ride program; and
WHEREAS,
the City of Golden, with the Colorado School of Mines and Jefferson County, are
currently funding a two year pilot program to add an additional Flex Route bus daily, so that the flex route
bus matches the 15 minute headways of the W Line and thereby further enhance ridership of both services
by addressing first and last mile challenges; and
WHEREAS,
Light Rail service to the W Line station in Golden is already burdened by the fare
structure which requires a regional fare from this station to downtown Denver, and therefore should not be
further discouraged by service reductions; and
WHEREAS,
the Golden City Council recognizes the budget constraints faced by the RTD
board, and wishes to make constructive recommendations to both improve system usage and manage costs,
as well as increase local marketing efforts and ridership incentives.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF GOLDEN,
COLORADO
The Golden City Council hereby recommends that the Regional Transportation District Board of
Directors commit to give the most serious consideration to the below recommendations that provide the
opportunity to enhance W Line usage as well as improving local transit for our committed community.
a.

Commit to consider the long-term ridership, system operations, and fiscal implications of
adjusting the fare structure such that the W Line end of line station at the Jefferson County
Government Center is in fare zone B, under the current fare structure. In addition, City Council
urges RTD to take the opportunity, of more overall system transit lines being operational, to
review the entire fare structure related to station locations.

b.

Delay for an additional year those proposed W Line service cuts related to reduction of
headways in Saturday periods currently scheduled for fifteen (15) minute headways in order to
continue to seek ways to boost weekend ridership to match the growth in weekday ridership.

c.

In conjunction with these two recommendations, City Council commits to continue to seek
ways to promote and encourage transit use for the benefit of the community and the entire
region.

Public Meeting Comments
Wednesday, May 29, 2019
RTD Administrative Offices
Rooms T&D
12:00 NOON
Staff in attendance included Jessie Carter, Jeff Dunning, Cooper Langdon, Dan Menter, Brian
Matthews, Pat Heye, Sage Thornbrugh, Miguel Aguilar, Maux Sullivan and Tegan Rice. There were
additional RTD staff member from the Communications Department including Laurie Huff,
Christina Zazueta and Lisa Trujillo. There were 6 members from the public in attendance, along
with Director Peggy Catlin with the RTD Board.
Dianne Lyons - was complimentary of the Flex Ride services that connect to the W Line. Says
they work much better than the Call N Rides used to. She was happy that the G Line was finally
open, but disappointed that it doesn’t connect to the Ward Road Park N Ride. Was interested in
further details about the discount program and appreciative of the update that was given during
the beginning of the meeting. Is especially interested as her son is currently paying a lot of money
for a monthly pass and so that program could really help once implemented. Wanted further
details about exactly how it will be implemented. Was wondering why RTD implemented
commuter rail and didn’t just stick to Light Rail. She really likes the Light Rail and bus service and
doesn’t understand why RTD “switched” to commuter rail. She later made a comment based on
another attendees statements that there should be an educational pamphlet or something to
teach people how to use RTD Next Ride and My Stop because they’re wonderful services and
really help people to know when the bus will get there so they know if it’s delayed or not.
Thomas Quinlan - appreciated the disability card he has through RTD to get a discounted fare.
He relies on RTD services a lot. Wanted to know what stops were being eliminated from the 66
for stop consolidation. Was especially concerned about the stop on Panama Drive that is proposed
to be removed as he uses that stop frequently. Discussed his concerns with buses not being on
time or not even showing up at all. He can’t rely on the bus due to these issues. He also discussed
his displeasure with people getting on the bus that smell like marijuana because he said it causes
him to have a seizure due to a traumatic brain injury he sustained.
Berda Steen - said she attended the meeting because she wanted further details about the
discount program and when exactly it would be implemented. She also expressed her concern
about the 15 bus stop on 15th between Stout and California. She said that frequently there are
cars parked there or in the way of the bus stop, so the bus is unable to pull all the way to the
curb to let passengers off. She was concerned that this is unsafe and especially difficult for those
with limited mobility.
Paolo Salazano - had several concerns. Expressed that he does not believe our on-time
performance data as it is inconsistent with his experience. Wanted to see more detailed report of
the data. It was mentioned that he could get that information via the quarterly reports which are
online. He mentioned that both bus and rail are unreliable and was concerned about the number
of dropped bus trips. He said that only 1/3 of the trips he takes are on-time and cited a recent

Streetsblog article that discussed the rail on-time performance. He also wanted to know what
impact the lawsuit between RTD and DTO will have on the rest of RTD service. Wanted to know
why there is still a driver shortage and what RTD is doing to address on-time performance.
Carol Streamer - was concerned that there aren’t enough Route 11 stops on Mississippi.
Mentioned there used to be one near the shopping center and IHOP. Staff said that no stops have
been removed. Maybe one of the stop signs is missing that staff will look into that.
Samantha Garrett - had questions about the 36L and its reliability. Says it’s either late or early
and she ends up waiting a while for the next bus. Stated that there should be more frequent
service and that it should be more reliable. Expressed interest in getting more involved to do what
she can to help make things better.
Wednesday, May 29th, 2019
RTD Administrative Offices
Rooms T&D
6pm
Staff in attendance included David Menter, Pat Heye, and Christina Zazueta. There were nine
members from the public in attendance.
Miriam Garcia (interpreted by friend Andrea Martinez) - requested that the current route
31L make a better connection with the B-Line and stated that the route 31L should be retained
even in the August runboard.
Staff explained that in August, as part of the 2016 board-approved G-Line integrated bus and rail
plan that route #31L would be discontinued. Staff explained that for customers desiring to travel
to/from points along north along Pecos, that they could transfer from bus route #19 at the Pecos
Junction Station and take either the B or the G Line to reach DUS. For riders desiring to travel
to/from points along north Federal, they could transfer from bus route #31 at the Clear Creek
Federal Station and take the G Line to reach DUS. In addition, bus routes #19 and #31 would
also be pulling into the Stations to make good connections. Even though a transfer would be
involved, staff explained that riders would have far more trips and times to choose from – as
opposed to having just the 3 morning and 3 afternoon trips currently offered by the 31L.
Laura Gallegos - also asked that Route 31L be retained.
Rocio Aguilar - also asked that Route 31L be retained.
Elmer Smith Jr. - asked that Route 43 retain the bus stops currently proposed for elimination
on Martin Luther King Blvd & Ivy. He stated that he uses the 43 daily and has trouble walking.
He said the bus stops at Ivy are very close to his home.
Glenda Bartels - was concerned about the elimination of Route 33. Staff explained details of
the new Flex-Ride service that would take its place.

1.B.1.c

Carol Young - expressed a concern and a question about why the G-Line bus changes weren’t
implemented when the G-Line started. Staff explained that RTD wanted to open the G-Line just
as soon as possible following final regulatory approvals, and the final rail approvals did not come
in time to be able to line up with the May bus runboard. The Commenter also complained that
the RTD ‘NEXT RIDE’ app regularly does not work and gives false info. It regularly says ‘no bus
on route’. In addition, the Commenter complained that bus stops were too dark and needed
night-time street lighting or bus stop lighting along 26th Avenue in Wheat Ridge and Edgewater.
Commenter also said that the bus stop on 26th Ave, Eb, at Benton was unsafe, it was on too
narrow of a sidewalk, and needed to be improved. Commenter also complained that MALL
SHUTTLES ‘bunch-up’ too often and that they should be more actively managed. She said she
ended-up walking the entire distance of the MALL at rush hour recently before a shuttle appeared,
and then there were 4 in a row travelling nose-to-tail.
Ethel Williams - wanted to know why Route 31 would not always terminate at FRCC. Staff
explained that after hours Route 31 would operate as far north as 104th Ave. Staff explained the
hours of FRCC (it closes at 10p weekdays and 5p on weekends) and that FRCC administrators
were increasingly concerned with campus security. She also stated that the bus stop on
Broadway, Sb, at 6th Ave needed night-time street lighting or bus stop lighting.
Gordon D. - expressed a concern and a question about bus on-time performance (OTP). RTD
staff explained how OTP data is captured by the fleet and that staff looked at performance reports
monthly and that those reports lead to some action to help improve OTP at most every runboard
change. For example, in the August runboard, there are at least 7 routes that have running time
adjustments noted in the flyers, and these changes are intended to help adjust on-time
performance. Stop reductions, as proposed by route 66 in the August runboard, is another way
staff is working to help improve bus route reliability and speed service. Gordon also complained
that RTD’s Nest Ride app often provides erroneous information and that Google maps transit
information is better. Gordon also complained that operator turnover seemed especially high on
the FF4, and that operators needed more training about the routes and route turns they were
driving. FF4 operators regularly pass up riders at the Wewatta/Delgany & Park Ave bus stop.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: June 4, 2019

From:

Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager of
Bus Operations

GM

Date:

June 4, 2019

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2019

Subject:

Service Availability May 2019

RTD fixed-route bus operations provided slightly over 99.61% of all scheduled hours of bus service in
May 2019. Lost service hours for personnel related reasons, reflect a significant decrease compared the
same month (May) last year. Service delivery has improved significantly since June 2018. Lost service
for personnel related reasons follows:





May 2019 – 160.17 hours
May 2018 – 2,196.24 hours
Year to date hours for 2019 – 2,064.92 hours
Year to date hours 2018 – 7,295.54 hours

Contributing to our service/staffing challenges in May were extreme weather, special events, May
Service Change and planned/unplanned shuttles (bus bridges). Special events and service disruptions
included: Cinco-de-May Festival, Jazz Fest, SERE opening, Colfax Marathon, Rockies, and the Bolder
Boulder. The Bolder Boulder is a significant event requiring over 200 buses moving in excess of 12,000
patrons.
While RTD did provide in excess of 99.61% of all scheduled hours of service in the month, it was
necessary to cover 2,483 shifts with operators working a 6th day (one of their scheduled days off). This
represents approximately 19,864 hours of service being provided by a “6th day” RTD operator and does
not include the mandated service hours provided by our contractor partners, First Transit and TransDev.

Mandated operators came in at 187 and operators volunteering for work are at 143 for
April. Mandates for the year so far are 358 and volunteers at 422. The uptick in mandates
and volunteers are attributed to preparing for the SERE opening as well as burn in for new
LRV Denver VIII Vehicles. The total for the year is at 358 which is 52% below the
mandates for 2018 at this time that came in at 664.
Red signal violations for April came in at 7 which is equal to the amount of red signals in
April 2018. Year to date is still lower than 2018. 18 red signal violations in 2019 comparted
to 26 in 2018.
The average mean distance between LRV related failures for April is 32,014.97 miles,
exceeding our goal of 25,000 miles.
The average time (hours) between Maintenance of Way (MOW) failures for April 25,851.60
due to no delay hours for the month of April. Exceeding our goal of 2,500 hours.

DISCUSSION
Attached is the Performance Report for the First Quarter of 2019. These year-to-date measures provide
a framework in which RTD determines how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of
the District within its mission statement objectives. Of the 41 performance measures tracked for the
GM, RTD met 33 of the goals in the first quarter. The following is a discussion of the exceptions.
Goal 3.1 – Maintain System-Wide On-Time Performance
Regional on-time service at 87.6% did not meet goal of 88.0% but was improved over both 2017 and
2018. Several Regional routes are performing below goals, all of which operate north of Denver on
highways. Growing congestion on these freeways and interstate highways are impacting service
delivery. An action plan is being developed by Bus Operations to address performance issues on these
routes.
Goal 3.2 – Maintain System-Wide Service Availability
Commuter Rail service availability of 96.5% fell slightly below goal of 97.0%. Communication errors
arose with PTC radios when Denver Transit Partners/Operators started running 4-car consists instead of
2-car consists on the CU A Line; the issue has been resolved.
Goal 5.1 – Improve ADA On-Time Performance
ADA OTP of 84.6% was below goal of 86.0%. For 2019, the goal of 86.0% will reflect passenger
OTP, which is consistent with fixed route. A combination of not being able to maintain adequate
staffing levels along with a high rate of operators on FMLA is the primary root cause of the deficiency.
Staff is meeting with the carrier’s corporate divisions in order to discuss their plans moving forward.
Goal 5.3 – Improve ADA Courtesy
Average ADA complaints per boarding of 0.002 was higher than goal of 0.001. Staffing challenges are
leading to a higher number of complaints but the higher number over year-end 2018 is also the result of
rounding (0.0014 at year-end vs. 0.0015 at Q1).
Goal 6.3 – Increase in Fare Revenue and Total Revenue
First quarter fare revenue and total operating revenue were up 5.4% and 2.9%, respectively, over the
same time last year but are currently short of the budgeted annual goals of 14.2% and 13.6%. These
goals for 2019 are annual measures and we will continue to monitor this revenue.
Goal 6.5 – Bus Operator/Mechanic Headcount within Authorization
Both bus operator vacancies and mechanic vacancies exceeded their goals at year-end due to attrition,

retirements, system growth, and full employment in the strong local economy. Progress was made in
the first quarter in reducing bus operator vacancies but bus mechanic vacancies have grown mostly in
the body shop which offset improvements in general repair.

ADA Paratransit Advisory Committee (APAC)
1st Quarter Summary 2019

Update: Route Match – Schedule and Expectations

APAC members were advised that RTD staff had been given a demonstration by Routematch of an improved
mobile app called Mobility On-Demand (MOD). This was RTD’s first look at the Mobility On-Demand app,
but it appeared more robust than Amble. RTD is going to continue to investigate the app and wanted
APAC’s feedback before deciding on whether to move forward with it.
II.

Information: RTD Marketing/Communication Strategy –

APAC would like to know how RTD communicates with clients about what is new, changing, and/or how to
use Access-a-Ride.
RTD will invite representatives from Marketing to the July 9th APAC meeting to present data and answer
questions.
III.

Update: Trip Length – Members wanted to know how a manifest trip length was established? Are
there a limits? What is the right limit/maximum trip length/time to expect?

As explained during the meeting, there is no such thing as a “maximum trip time”; even for fixed route,
trips could exceed 2-hours depending on where a rider is going. Access-a-Ride schedules approximately
2700 trips a day. Scheduling of these trips begin with Route Match, an algorithm builds the schedules and
schedulers review/revise them accordingly.
Once a month, RTD audits trips to see if they exceeded expected travel times by comparing the trips to the
amount of time that the same trip would have taken on fixed-route. Results show an above 95% accuracy;
often trips take less time on Access-a-Ride than they would have on fixed-route.
IV.

Update: Rapid Transit impact on Access-a-Ride - If a bus route is taken away due to rapid transit,
will there be impacts to eligibility?

Staff shared that only if RTD lacks or removes a fixed route, and a client is no longer ¾ of mile from a route
that they would lose access to the complementary paratransit system. One doesn’t lose the eligibility to
the program, they may lose access to the door-to-door complementary service if they are more than ¾ mile
from a stop/station/route.
Planners will be invited to attend APAC’s July 9th meeting to share a presentation regarding future plans, as
well as on rapid transit planning.

V.

Discussion: Survey Questions –

RTD is working with BBC Research (the research vendor) and their call service in Davis, California. They will
make phone calls and offer an online option (maybe online once called).

Packet Pg. 68

Attachment: APAC Summary (3837 : Access-a-Ride/Cab 1st Quarter 2019 Report)

I.

1.C.7.e

RTD is offering those who take a survey may voluntary submit their name for one of ten $100 gift
certificates.
Other Topics

Feedback: Trip Negotiation
 This started recently, personal experience is that is good.
 It is great to be able to hear the message about trip negotiation up front (rather than hearing it
while on hold, with another message popping in).
 Message doesn’t let people know they can reject/not accept the time provided. But, they can do
this when they get to the agent.
 RTD’s telecom people are looking at the stutter in the message; it was not in the original.
 Why are records kept for denied trips? This data is reported to the federal government along with
all trip data.
Update: Close door, secure wheelchair policy
RTD is changing its policy; RTD’s policy was to secure the wheelchair then close the door. This issue has
come up several times on the APAC. RTD did some nationwide research and found that no other similar
systems were doing it the way RTD was doing it (secure wheelchair then close door). RTD changed the
policy to close the door then secure the wheelchair. Drivers are being retrained now and riders will start
seeing the change over the next 90 days.
 Could this be at the driver’s digression? No, it is more reliable to have one consistent
process/policy; ensures wheelchairs will be secured.
 Experienced a driver leaving the engine running. This is not policy, policy is driver turns off the
engine and removes the keys.
Update: Ambulatory Vehicle Acquisition
RTD is investigating acquiring ambulatory vehicles next year. The goal is to have some of the fleet be
ambulatory vehicles, similar to a current contractor who has some now. RTD wants APAC’s feedback on
the options. Currently, RTD is looking at mini-vans or SUV types (sedan types back doors were too low);
looking at Dodge Caravan or Ford Transit Connect mini-van options – they are boxier, which is good.
ACTION: Paul will schedule an APAC showing of a vehicle at an RTD facility; in the next 2 months. He will
email or call APAC member when the date and location is set. Jody will make sure to mail the email to
William Gross.



When is RTD going to remove the 600 type busses? When they have lived their operational life
span (approximately 2 years-ish).
Several drivers have shared the rumor that RTD is getting rid of the 600s, would be good for RTD
to correct this rumor (not true).

Update: APAC Terms Ending
Two APAC’s members’ terms will end following the July 9th APAC meeting – Diane Bomar and Carol
Buchanan. This leave four vacancies (2 vacancies already exist). Please reach out to anyone interested.
Applications are currently available on the RTD website and will remain open until June 14th.

Contracted Fixed-Route Quarterly Report – 1st
Quarter 2019

Information

RTD currently provides 45% of its fixed route bus service via four contracted bus divisions currently
operated by First Transit and Transdev. With bus divisions located in Longmont, Denver, Commerce
City and Englewood, our contract partners provide fixed route bus service throughout the RTD District.
The performance for First Transit and Transdev is measured on the following performance indicators:
Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000 miles, Passenger Accident Ratio per 100,000 miles, OnTime Preventive Maintenance Inspections, On-Time Performance, Miles Between Lost Service Road Calls
and Operator Complaints per Boarding.
Because of their commitment to excellence, dedicated corporate support and detailed problem solving,
First Transit and Transdev as a group, met all of the Board of Director adopted 2019 key performance
measures through the 1st quarter 2019. The following is a more detailed discussion of fixed route
contractor performance through the 1st Quarter of 2019.


PREVENTABLE VEHICLE ACCIDENTS PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 2.0 Preventable Vehicle Accidents per 100,000
miles through the 1st quarter. First Transit Denver did not meet this goal (2.12) but are
addressing identified trends through enhanced training and safety pep-rallies. First Transit and
Transdev continue to utilize bus operator monitoring technology and post-accident investigations
for retraining of operators. The contractors continue to emphasize safety with all employees at
monthly safety meetings, through periodic campaigns, and with daily reminders at their facilities
and on the street.



PASSENGER ACCIDENT RATIO PER 100,000 MILES
The contractors, as a group, met the target of ≤ 0.18 Passenger Accidents per 100,000 miles
through the 1st quarter. All six passenger accidents that occurred during the 1st quarter were
classified non-preventable. Transdev did not meet the goal (0.31) however, all four of their
passenger accidents were classified as non-preventable. All of the bus operators involved in
passenger accidents were provided retraining on the proper procedures for addressing passenger
safety. First Transit and Transdev continue to raise awareness of passenger safety through
campaigns and safety meetings to reduce the number of passenger accidents per 100,000 miles.



ON-TIME PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INSPECTIONS
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 98% of Preventive Maintenance
Inspections completed as scheduled through the 1st quarter. Competitive Services staff will
continue to monitor the contractor operations to ensure PMIs are completed on-time.



ON-TIME PERFORMANCE
The contractors, individually and as a group, met the target of 86% Local On-Time Service
through the 1st quarter. RTD and the private contractors continue to campaign routes and

Packet Pg. 71

1.C.8

operators with low on-time performance with a strong focus on first time point departures. On a
monthly basis contractors review the OTP report and meet with operators of low performing
routes to discuss factors that are impacting their ability to reach 86% on-time performance.
Running time issues are forwarded to RTD Service Planning and Scheduling for review.
The contractors will continue to address on-time performance issues with operators, but always
tie safety to the discussion. It’s better to be a few minutes late than to have an accident.


MILES BETWEEN LOST SERVICE ROAD CALLS
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of 30,000 Miles Between Lost
Service Maintenance Road Calls through the 1st quarter. Competitive Services staff will continue
to monitor the contractor operations to ensure this goal is being addressed by completing
preventive maintenance inspections on-time, working off defects in a timely manner, monitoring
repeat issues, providing additional training for mechanics, and taking a pro-active approach to
maintaining the buses in their fleet.



OPERATOR COMPLAINTS PER BOARDING
The contractors, individually and as a group, exceeded the target of .0004 Complaints per
Boarding in the 1st quarter. The contractors continue to investigate and address customer
complaints with operators. The contractors utilize onboard video surveillance as a coaching tool
to assist operators in improving customer interactions. In addition, the steps noted above
regarding on-time performance should help address some customer complaints. The contractors
also continue to address complaint trends with all operators at monthly safety meetings.
The contractors continue to take a variety of actions over and above contract requirements to
address their operator hiring/retention challenges which include hiring bonuses, wage increases,
incentives to take on additional work, employing a full-time recruiter, and mentoring programs.

Customer Comment Analysis - 1st Quarter
2019

Customer comments through the 1st Quarter of 2019 for both RTD and the private contractors showed
improvement over the same period in 2018. The total number of operator-related comments for the
District as a whole for the 1st Quarter of 2019 was 4,105. The total number for the same period in
2018 was 4,575. Specific customer comment categories showing improvement in 2019 include “Bus
Did Not Show,” “Bus Early,” “Bus Late,” “Improper Procedure/Operator,” “Incorrect Information” and
“Passed Up Passenger At Stop.” The customer comment categories of “Careless Driving/Operator,”
“Discourtesy/Operator,” and “Fare Dispute” showed increases over 2018. RTD and the private
contractors review customer comments on a daily basis and implement corrective action as needed to
address deficiencies and improve performance.
Recapped below is an analysis of the customer comment trends through the 1st Quarter of 2019. Also
included is a comparison of customer comment data for the same period in 2018.
As noted in previous reports, over the past few years the implementation and enforcement of a variety
of policies and operating requirements have impacted the number of customer comments received.
Examples of the policies and operating requirements that have impacted customer comments include
securement area/priority seating issues, fare enforcement campaigns, improved Customer Care
availability, introduction of SmartCards and day passes, and changes to bus service associated with the
implementation of additional rail service (the University of Colorado A Line and B Line commuter rail
service and the W Line and R Line light rail service).
Accordingly, based upon recommendations from RTD staff, the Board of Directors has made
modifications to the performance goal for customer comments to account for these factors. In 2014,
the performance goal was set at .0004 comments per passenger boarding and remained at that level for
2019.
RTD staff, as well as the private contractors, monitor and address customer comments on a daily basis.
RTD and the private contractors investigate all customer comments using a variety of tools, including
CAD/AVL “flashbacks” and video review and address/discipline operators as needed. Many times the
results of the investigation reveal that the comment is not supported by factual data. Some of the
reasons for the “Not Valid” classification include the following:
 Bus was on time (between 1 min early to 5 min late) per “flashback”
 Operator followed proper procedure
 Passenger presented insufficient fare
 Passenger had no proof of eligibility for a discounted fare
 Passenger presented an expired transfer
 Passenger presented a counterfeit pass
 Buses were running late District-wide due to weather

1.C.9



There was no video evidence to support the comment

RTD and the private contractors continue to work collectively in a variety of different areas to address
customer comments.
 Bus routes with poor on-time performance are monitored by both RTD and private contractor
personnel to determine if the problem is related to the operator or the running time of the route.
 Meetings are held on a monthly basis with contractor and RTD personnel to discuss challenges,
solutions and best practices in the areas of bus maintenance, operations, safety and training.
 RTD conducts refresher training for all operators on an annual basis, and a component of the
training is customer service. The private contractors conduct mandatory monthly safety meetings
wherein they discuss customer service issues and provide suggestions for improving passenger
interactions.
 RTD and private contractor trainers spend time at Civic Center Station and Denver Union Station
the first week of each runboard to provide assistance to operators who may need some
refreshers on station procedures or have questions on their routes.
 RTD has also reached out to the disability community (Colorado Cross Disability Coalition,
Colorado School of the Blind, Atlantis, DRMAC Transit Accessibility Task Force, RTD Advisory
Committee for People with Disabilities-ACPD) to get feedback on ways to improve RTD service
for passengers with disabilities.
 Operators are recognized for the good customer service they provide. Operating Divisions post
commendations on a bulletin board in the drivers’ room and some provide additional means of
recognition.
 RTD increased operator wages effective March 1, 2018, and the Contractors increased operator
wages effective April 1, 2018. Both RTD and the Contractors have seen an increase in
applicants and employee retention. With the increases in headcount, additional strategies are
being implemented to help reduce the amount of dropped service and the associated comments.
 Trends in customer service challenges are also addressed through bulletins, campaigns, and other
communications to ensure that RTD and Contractor employees are aware of our customers’
concerns.
Historically, and in 2019, the following comment categories generated the highest number of customer
comments:








Bus Did Not Show
Bus Early
Bus Late
Careless Driving/Operator
Discourtesy/Operator
Improper Procedure by Operator
Passed Up Passenger at Stop

All of these comment categories are what RTD considers “operator related” and are included in the
comment numbers that are tracked and reported to the Board of Directors on the Quarterly Performance
Report.
The high comment categories are routinely reviewed to determine the factors, both internal and external,
that are impacting the number of comments. The input received from both RTD and private contractor
operations is noted below:

Packet Pg. 76

1.C.9

Bus Did Not Show – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 52.9% compared to the
same period in 2018. RTD and the private contractors are showing strong improvement regarding
operator headcount. Continuing efforts to reduce operator vacancies will help ensure that service is
provided per published schedules. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 4.02 comments per
day. The comparable number for 2018 was 8.54 comments per day.
Bus Early – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 13.5% compared to the same
period in 2018. “Flashbacks” for “bus early” comments often show buses running late. It is possible
passengers see the prior bus running late and assume it is their bus running early. Operators are
addressed whenever the CAD/AVL playback confirms that the bus was running ahead of schedule. The
YTD average in this category for 2019 is 4.27 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018
was 4.93 comments per day.
Bus Late – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 6.7% compared to the same period
in 2018. Improvements to staffing levels have resulted in improvements in this category. Improving ontime performance continues to be a challenge for a variety of reasons including construction, traffic and
heavy ridership delays; service reductions, which result in the same number of passengers on fewer
trips. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 6.69 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 7.17 comments per day.
Careless Driving/Operator – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 0.3% compared to
the same period in 2018. On a regular basis, video recordings are reviewed and undercover ride checks
are performed to determine if operators are driving in an unsafe or inappropriate manner. In addition,
RTD and the private contractors have “G-Force Activated” event-recording systems (Drive Cam, Smart
Drive) installed on the buses. These incidents are also reviewed on a daily basis. Operators continue to
be counseled and retrained, as needed, to improve driving performance. Also, periodic safety campaigns
are conducted to reinforce safe driving habits. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 3.44
comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 3.43 comments per day.
Discourtesy/Operator – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 19.3% compared to the
same period in 2018. In the majority of cases, video evidence confirms that the operator followed
proper procedures and treated the customer with respect. In many cases, operators are shown
enforcing or explaining policies (requesting proper fare payment, requesting space in the priority seating
area, addressing inappropriate behavior) in a polite and respectful manner and the passengers react in a
negative manner. Operators are counseled and disciplined if video evidence confirms that they treated
passengers in a discourteous or inappropriate manner. Operators are also given suggestions for handling
similar situations in the future. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 9.07 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 7.60 comments per day.
Discrimination – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category remained the same compared to the
same period in 2018. Investigation into discrimination-related comments usually shows the operator not
at fault. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.23 comments per day. The comparable
number for 2018 was 0.23 comments per day.
Fare Dispute – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category increased 28.4% compared to the same
period in 2018. The implementation of the new fares, fare equipment and mobile ticketing presented
challenges for some customers and operators. Investigations into “fare dispute” comments often show
that passengers presented an improper/incomplete fare and are not happy with the operators’
enforcement of the fare policies. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.96 comments per day.
The comparable number for 2018 was 0.74 comments per day.

Packet Pg. 77

1.C.9

Improper Procedure/Operator – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 16.1%
compared to the same period in 2018. RTD and private contractor training and operations personnel
meet on a regular basis to ensure all operators are receiving consistent and up-to-date information. In
addition, the on-going refresher training provided to RTD operators and the monthly safety meetings held
at the private contractor divisions provide operators with information about accommodating the needs of
RTD passengers to the best of their abilities. In cases where video evidence shows operators are not
following proper procedures, appropriate coaching activities are taken. The YTD average in this category
for 2019 is 5.62 comments per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 6.70 comments per day.
Incorrect Info/Operator – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 15.4% compared to
the same period in 2018. The combined efforts of the General Superintendent of Transportation,
Operations Managers, the Bus Operator Training teams, Street Supervisors and Dispatchers continue to
provide operators with up-to-date information to answer customer questions and address customer
concerns. Although RTD and the private contractors have seen an influx of new operators, their impact
on this category is minimal, thanks to annual refresher training, assistance from Street Supervisors and
trainers, and improved communication. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 0.37 comments
per day. The comparable number for 2018 was 0.43 comments per day.
Passed Up Passenger At Stop – 1st Quarter 2019: Comments in this category decreased 15.0%
compared to the same period in 2018. In many cases, “flashbacks” for these comments will confirm
buses are on route and either on time or running late. It is possible the passenger was not directly at the
stop when the bus arrived. Many comments indicate the passenger was running to the stop as the bus
passed. Operators are reminded to stay vigilant and watch for passengers that may not be waiting
directly at the bus stop. In addition, operators are directed to contact RTD Dispatch whenever a
passenger is passed up due to the bus being full. The number of “Pass Up” comments from passengers
with disabilities and/or those using mobility aids represents a small number of the total “Pass Up”
comments (37 of the total 845 = 4.38%). Information regarding overcrowded routes is forwarded to
the Service Planning & Scheduling Department for review and adjusted, as needed, and as resources will
allow. The YTD average in this category for 2019 is 9.39 comments per day. The comparable number
for 2018 was 11.04 comments per day.

Information

RTD currently provides FlexRide service in 21 distinct service areas throughout the District. The first
quarter of 2019 began on a high note with the renaming of Call-n-Ride to FlexRide. This change
included putting 32 new buses into service complete with the new FlexRide name and an updated
graphics design. Additionally, the FlexRide advance reservation time was reduced from 60 minutes to
10 minutes.
Listed below are the 1st Quarter Performance Statistics for the FlexRide service.

Ridership
Total FlexRide ridership for 2019 was less than the prior year. One of the factors contributing to the
decrease is low fuel prices, which gives customers a low-cost alternative to using the FlexRide service.
Customer Comments
The 1st Quarter 2019 has shown a decrease in overall comments in comparison to 2018.
Customer comments are reviewed on a daily basis. Those comments that are considered operator
related (within the operator’s control) are monitored for trends and improvement.
The number of other non-operator related customer comments received regarding FlexRide service
(requests for new service or a change in service which can include boundary changes, service day and
hours, web site issues, no return calls, etc.) are as follows:
1st Quarter 2019 = 102

Packet Pg. 81

1.C.10

1st Quarter 2018 = 122
Preventable Accidents
Preventable accidents increased in the 1st Quarter of 2019 primarily due to new drivers. Contractors
have retrained “at risk” operators identified as being involved in minor accidents and have increased the
number of “ride-alongs” performed by operations specialists and training staff.
Productivity
A number of FlexRide areas continue to show satisfactory productivity. Most of these serve business
parks that connect with the light rail (Arapahoe, Meridian, North Inverness and South Inverness) or
communities where residents have embraced the service (Golden and Superior). Staff continues to
monitor FlexRides with low productivity and work with the local municipalities and RTD Marketing to
identify strategies for improving ridership. The attached “2019 Special Services 1st Qtr Report”
provides the productivity numbers for each of the FlexRides and some other special services for which
RTD provides cost-share funding. The acceptable level of productivity for FlexRide service is 3.0
boardings per hour.

exceptions not addressed are noted and reviewed during the next visit to ensure exceptions have been
corrected.
Scheduled visits for the contractors are no less than quarterly and on-going on an as-needed basis. This
audit schedule was implemented in March of 2016.

Security Statistics & Fare Inspection Summary
Fourth Quarter ~ January 1, 2019 through March 31, 2019

Fare inspectors, security officers, street supervisors, and police officers, conduct fare inspection on-board buses
and light rail vehicles. RTD’s policy is to provide a warning to first time offenders and then to issue a citation if
that person is contacted a second time without fare. The chart below shows the actual number of patrons
without fare that resulted in warnings or citations. The variation in numbers from month to month may be due
to several factors, including special events or other security security-related incidents.

On-Board Enforcement
Transit security officers are assigned to Light Rail and Commuter Rail to check for proper fare and to provide
security. The table below shows how many patrons were contacted for the quarter and the percentage of
patrons that did not present valid fare.

Prepared by Steve Martingano
Deputy Chief RTD Transit Police

Police Officers are placed on bus and rail vehicles that have been identified by operators, supervisors, dispatch
logs and patrons as having a high perception of fare evasion, fare disputes or other problems.

Light Rail Operations
The below chart shows the plain clothes police fare enforcement observations for light rail. There is a slightly
higher fare evasion rate observed by the plain-clothes program than for the rail station sweeps and bus
enforcement because of the following factors:
Fare station sweeps are conducted by uniformed security officers; these officers require all patrons to
have fare before boarding vehicles
Rail operators do not have any interface with patrons, while bus operators do ask for fare
Plain-clothes police officers do not have a deterrence factor as uniformed officers, thus they inherently
find more violations of fare evasion.

Approval of General Manager's 2020 Core &
Task Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2020 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation document.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and
Staff Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals consistent with the
RTD employee evaluation process as well as elements of the approved GM contract approved in 2018.
This action item formalizes that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2020 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 4, 2019 GMOC committee. This approval will move to the June 11, 2019 Finance,
Administration & Audit Committee and then to the full Board for final approval on June 18, 2019.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation memo which identifies the five
core goals for 2020 and the 5 task goals for 2020. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for
2020 is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2020 Goals.

Packet Pg. 90

2.B.1

ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2020 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2020 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.
3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.

Proposed Core and Task Goals for 2020

This memo presents the proposed 2020 GM core and task goals in a memo, bullet point
format. For each core and task goal, the overall goal is listed followed by the criteria for
needs improvement, achieved goal, and exceeded expectations. The task goals are based
on the five strategic priorities from the 2019 Board/Senior Leadership Team retreat in
March 2019, the subsequent 2020 tactical plan, and the Board input/comments received
from the Board at the April 23 Tactical Plan Study Session presentation. Fiscal
sustainability applies to all goals. A common theme regarding the Board comments were
around the Address Transit Equity strategic priority including service coverage and
demographics. There are a number of specific goals to address these comments under
the strategic priorities of Address Transit Equity, Enhance Current and Future
Transportation Methods, and Increase Ridership. The proposed core and task goals will
be discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee
meeting. This memo includes agreed upon changes as discussed at the May 14, 2019 GM
Oversight and Performance Management Committee meeting.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing of the price increase due to the
2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period
to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019
and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
GM Goals
 GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management
BACKGROUND
When the Board passed the new fare structure and pricing in September 2018, they requested that staff
continue to work with stakeholders on implementation issues particularly in the area of the CollegePass
program. Based on the Board’s direction, RTD staff has had many meetings with stakeholders over the
last 6 months and have looked into the many requests that we received. For example: Could we allow
CollegePass and EcoPass holders at the age of 19 and under to be priced at the 70% Youth discount?
Would we be open to having the tap data that is used for pricing to be audited? Would we be willing to
phase the price increases for CollegePass over 5 years instead of 3 years?
Staff has researched various options and has agreed to have the tap data audited by our financial
auditing firm on a three (3) year basis. In addition, we looked at the option of applying the youth
discount to the CollegePass program and phasing the price increases for the CollegePass over 5 years
instead of 3 years. Although we will not be pursuing the youth discount for CollegePass at this time,
there is merit in looking at expanding the phase-in period for CollegePass. The results are below. We
looked at applying the 5 year phase-in period to the CollegePass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and EcoPass as
these pass programs have similar program attributes and financial impacts to the customer and RTD.
DISCUSSION
Staff has spent the last several months working with our consultants to model the impacts of spreading
the implementation of the EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass pricing changes over 5
years instead of 3 years. Currently the increase for EcoPass, Neighborhood EcoPass, and CollegePass
increases are capped at 20% in years 2019 and 2020 with the entire increase implemented in year
2021. This was a proposal from the Pass Working Group and was adopted by the Board.

Packet Pg. 115

2.B.2

The new proposal would move the phasing of the price increase from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5
year phase-in period. This would extend the 20% cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and
2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.

** 100% utilization price including price increase due to assumed fare increase in 2022
The Modeling Assumptions Were as Follows:
 The revenue & ridership impact of extending the phasing are based on the model assumptions,
namely the degree of retention of organziations given price increases
 Modeling assumptions regarding retention were used to provide conservative revenue estimates
for price increases for pass program organizations
 Modeling assumed that all Colleges, Large Employers, and Master EcoPass contracts would remain
in RTD’s pass programs in both phasing scenarios.

Title VI Impacts:
 Phasing over 5 vs 3 years would not be considered a fare change
 To understand how the phasing would impact the overall average fare increase of riders in 2021, a
comparision of the increase in average fare for minority and low-income riders were compared to
all riders
 The percentage point change in the average fare between protected riders and all riders is within
RTD’s +/- 5% threshold under either phasing timeframe

Packet Pg. 116

2.B.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
 Extending phasing would result in identical ridership but a loss in revenue in 2021 and 2022
 Estimated Revenue Loss
o 2021 - $1.5 million to $2.5 million
o 2022 - $1.5 million to $2.0 million
o 2023 - $0 to $500,000
o Total 2021-2023 is between $3 million and $5 million
 These estimated revenue changes will be incorporated in the upcoming 2020-2025 Mid-Term
Financial Plan, if this change is approved by the Board.
ALTERNATIVES
 Recommended Alternative: It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to move the phasing
of the price increase due to the 2019 fare changes for CollegePass, EcoPass, and Neighborhood
EcoPass from a 3 year phase-in period to a 5 year phase-in period. This would extend the 20%
cap on price increases to not only year 2019 and 2020 but also years 2021 and 2022 with the
full implementation of the fare increase in 2023.
 Other Alternative: Do not approve this action. The structure for phasing in the pass program
fare increase would stay the same.

Board Meeting Date:

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Finance and Administration Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to negotiate and execute contracts, including contract
amendments, to engage, or continue to engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional
$4 million for a total amount not to exceed $12.5 million.
This recommendation satisfies GM Core Goal #3 Strong Financial Management and GM Task Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability.
BACKGROUND
RTD has received certain claims from its contractors for both the Eagle P3 and NMRL Projects that have
led to alternative dispute resolution and litigation in Denver District Court. RTD has engaged certain law
firms to assist RTD’s General Counsel and the RTD Legal Services Division (RTD Law) in providing legal
representation concerning these various claims. The approved budgets for 2018 and 2019 included
funding designated and available for these litigation costs. In May 2018, this Board approved a
recommended action for contract authority up to a total of $8.5 million in litigation costs. At that time,
the requested amount was RTD Law’s best estimate of funding required for 2018. However, RTD Law
advised that if the litigation matters became more complex or otherwise continued into 2019, RTD Law
expected that further contract authority would be necessary.
DISCUSSION
For the NMRL Project, this Board approved a resolution of the delay claim pending at the time this Board
approved the prior contract authority. Since that time, RTD’s contractor has given notice of other delay
claims that may proceed to arbitration. In 2019, RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in order to defend
those claims.
For the EAGLE Project, RTD’s Concessionaire Denver Transit Partners (DTP) has filed a complaint against
RTD in Denver District Court. That litigation is ongoing; the court has set a trial to begin in May 2020.
RTD is likely to incur litigation costs in preparation for that trial.
RTD will continue to use in-house legal resources and pursue alternative dispute resolution (settlement

accordance with RTD procurement standards.

2.B.3

FINANCIAL IMPACT (If any)
This recommendation will be completed primarily with funding from the Board-approved 2019 FasTracks
project budgets.
ALTERNATIVES (if any)
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Finance and Administration
Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
negotiate and execute contracts, including contract amendments, to engage, or continue to
engage, outside legal counsel to represent RTD for an additional $4 million for a total amount not
to exceed $12.5 million.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. If the Recommended Action is not approved, the
General Counsel would use the current contract authority available and then seek to obtain Board
approval for individual contracts or amendments. While RTD Law intends to represent RTD on
certain disputes or to partner with outside counsel to reduce costs, the primary litigation matters
require a large law firm with more resources and depth of expertise beyond the capacity of RTD
Law. The Board’s failure to provide the requested contractual authority could impair RTD’s ability
to satisfy its legal obligations and act in its own best interest in defending pending claims, as well
as delay completion of FasTracks projects.

Fiscal Sustainability Update

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
A Fiscal Sustainability Task Force (Task Force) was formed in 2010 for the purpose of making
recommendations detailing opportunities for operating efficiencies and revenue enhancement for the
Base System to ensure RTD’s long-term fiscal sustainability. The Task Force consisted of 22 members
with 12 of those members being external to RTD.
The Task Force presented its written
recommendations to the Board of Directors in 2011. The Board of Directors subsequently approved
those recommendations and directed Staff to pursue implementation of each recommendation. The
Task Force reconvened for a final meeting in 2012 to be briefed on the progress of their
recommendations and provide an opportunity for feedback.
DISCUSSION
The Task Force made revenue enhancement, expense reduction and fiscal policy recommendations to
the Board of Directors, which were approved for further consideration and/or implementation. The
majority of the recommendations made have been completed or their status has not changed since our
last report in November 2018. Per Board policy, we continue to report periodically on the status of the
Task Force recommendations below. Each recommendation is summarized below and expanded
comments are provided for those that have had a change in status since the last report.
Recommendations - Completed
Removing the Volatility from Sales and Use Tax Projections
RTD contracted with the University of Colorado, Leeds School of Business – Business Research Division
(Leeds) to provide sales and use tax forecasts beginning in 2011. These forecasts are updated semiannually by CU-Leeds.
Service Optimization
Service optimization was recommended by the Task Force and implemented with Board approval in order
to match services provided with available funding sources. Service modifications were brought forward
to accommodate new FasTracks lines opened since 2016 and further service modifications may come
forward with the opening of new lines or to meet budget restrictions. Certain service revisions are made
with each runboard period in response to public feedback, internal ridership and utilization data. The
Transportation Transformation (T2) Project will review Service Optimization as part of the project scope.
Fund Balance Policy
Due to the volatility of RTD’s largest single revenue source, sales and use taxes, the Task Force
recommended implementation of a more robust fiscal policy regarding fund balances. In response to this
recommendation, RTD implemented a fund balance policy with a target level of three months of
operating expenses among applicable funds for both the Base System and FasTracks Operations. While
FasTracks has met this objective, the Base System has not and is not expected to fully meet this goal
within the six-year term of the Mid-term Financial Plan.

2.C.1

Sales and Use Tax Exemptions
Exemption parity with the state of Colorado was identified by the Task Force as providing a benefit to
RTD during difficult economic conditions when the state implements exemption changes. In addition,
exemption parity removes the complexity to vendors of RTD having different taxable items than the
state. Through legislation introduced by RTD, exemption parity took effect in 2014.
Technology and Energy Innovation
In response to the Task Force recommendation, RTD conducted an energy review of the major operating
facilities and installed equipment and lighting upgrades where possible. RTD budgets for energy
upgrades throughout the District in each annual budget. We will continue to address energy efficiency
in building systems as on-going projects are completed.
Sales and Use Tax Compliance Reviews
The Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR) collects and audits sales and use taxes for RTD. The Task
Force identified an opportunity for revenue enhancement by performing additional sales and use tax
compliance reviews based on the favorable collection experiences of Colorado cities and municipalities
that implemented these reviews. While assessments from this effort exceeded the costs, it was not
clear to what extent those assessments would be collected. RTD staff decided not to extend the
contract for this work beyond 2015 due to the limited remaining opportunities for assessments outside
of the scope of work of the DOR.
Recommendations – Ongoing
Naming Rights
The first naming rights/corporate sponsorship agreement under the Board-adopted naming rights policy
was reached with the University of Colorado for naming the University of Colorado A Line and creating
an advertising presence on the Flatiron Flyer BRT line. Any additional proposed naming rights/corporate
sponsorship contracts will be brought to the RTD Board for approval.
Partnerships and Privatization
The Task Force described this recommendation as a broad area that could include items such as
privatizing routes and administrative and operational functions to reduce expenses. These have included
the lease of the DUS historic building, IGAs for improvements to US36 and the East (A) Line, partnering
with the City & County of Denver on Route 15L improvements, partnering with the City & County of
Denver on the 16th Street Mall to receive a grant and share in the O&M costs, as well as TOD activities.
RTD continues to look for partnership and privatization opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Recommendations – Low Priority
The status of recommendations made by the Task Force and categorized as having lower priority
follows:
Charge for Parking
RTD currently charges parking fees to out-of-District patrons, in-District patrons who park longer than
24 hours, and for reserved parking. In 2013, the state legislature prohibited the charging of daily
parking fees to in-District patrons at District facilities. In 2016, RTD staff presented a parking
management briefing at a study session that focused on a consultant-led pay-for-parking study. In
December 2016, the Board approved the Parking Guiding Principles, which clarify how future changes
to parking policy will be evaluated.

Packet Pg. 121

2.C.1

Tolling and Managed Lanes
The Task Force recommended investigating the possibility of RTD generating additional revenues
through charges for tolling and managed lanes.
Enacting this recommendation would require
coordination with CDOT and other agencies. The US36 BRT project is an example of how tolling and
managed lanes can enhance RTD operations and save costs.
Home Rule Initiative
The Task Force recommended that RTD consider becoming a “Home Rule” entity which would allow
RTD to collect and audit its sales and use taxes instead of the DOR. This initiative would require
legislation. The Colorado Municipal League and other entities recommended against it. It could only be
secured for RTD by statewide constitutional amendment. As noted earlier in this report, RTD has
effected simplification of state and RTD taxation through legislation that provides for uniformity on items
taxed.

POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statement – Debt Policies
BACKGROUND
RTD has historically used various strategies to finance some of its capital needs. This has included the
use of bonds, certificates of participation, capital leases and loans. Although RTD’s current mid-term
financial plan does not anticipate much use of financing capital needs, approximately $4 billion worth of
obligations previously issued remain outstanding. Staff closely monitors the district’s ability to refund or
refinance these existing obligations at lower interest rates.
DISCUSSION
In an effort to qualify individual investment banking firms for participation in the District’s future
issuance and refunding of debt securities and the ongoing management of its financing program, staff
has issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to the investment banking community. Seventeen firms
responded to the RFQ and a review panel evaluated the responses based upon qualities:







25% Knowledge and experience of assigned personnel to RTD’s capital program
20% Experience in and commitment to underwriting Colorado municipal securities
15% Capital strength and willingness to underwrite securities
15% Marketing and distribution capabilities
15% Experience underwriting transit/transportation issues
10% Fees and expenses

As a result of this review, staff has included the following firms in no particular order, in the District’s
investment banking pool:


(1) Variance is due to lower parts and supplies and timing of invoices for purchased transportation and fuel
(2) Variance is due to lower labor, repair parts and purchased transportation mainly from timing of rail line openings.
(3) Variance is due to projects budgeted at beginning of year but now expected to start later.
(4) Variance is due to project invoices for contract maintenance budgeted earlier in the year than actual and lower compensation
(5) Variance is due to lower outside security services costs invoice timing
(6) Variance is due primarily to outside counsel costs related to litigation
(7) Variance is due to timing of outstide IT services costs for projects
(8) Variance is due to timing of outside printing costs for schedules and other outside services
(9) Variance due to purchasing card costs that initially get coded to this cost center until they can be coded to each cost center where they were incurred
(10) Variance due timing of travel costs and costs for MinuteTraq.

Board Meeting Date: June 11, 2019
Information

BACKGROUND
RTD commits to reviewing its Fare Structure and Fare Programs every three years to determine if any
additions or changes are required to provide the best options for RTD ridership and meet RTD’s revenue
targets. Over 20 months ending in mid-2018, the Pass Working Group and RTD staff reviewed all fares
and fare programs to define potential fare changes and improvements. RTD staff presented a
recommendation to the RTD Board of Directors and received approval mid-September 2018. The goal of
this project is to implement changes to the RTD Fares, Fare Structure, and changes and additions to the
Fare Programs as approved by the RTD Board of Directors.
DISCUSSION
The January 2019 fare changes were implemented as scheduled and we are now focusing on the low
income fare program (now branded LiVE Program) development.
RTD is working with the State’s Office of Information Technology (OIT) to implement a program for
evaluating RTD riders’ eligibility for the LiVE Program using the State’s public benefits application
system, PEAK. RTD staff has been meeting with employees from various departments and OIT for
several months.
RTD is also working with Denver Human Services (DHS) to perform customer service and certain income
eligibility verification procedures for RTD.
The following has been completed:








The Business Requirements Document (BRD) with OIT has been finalized. The BRD provides the
requirements necessary for OIT to develop the RTD application within the PEAK system.
The MyRide LiVE card design and final proofs have gone to the smart card vendor for production.
