WIN and Transit Workforce National Perspective
Ø The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) announced a
pilot program that would permit state and local recipients of
federal highway and federal transit funds to issue solicitations
with "local hire" preferences.
Ø In its notice, DOT states "the DOT believes that local and other
geographic-based hiring preferences are essential to promoting
Ladders of Opportunity for the workers in these communities."
Ø DOT also intends to permit the use of veteran hiring
preferences and hiring preferences for economically
disadvantaged (i.e., low-income) workers.
