#### 1. Civil Rights Committee Update

Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, introduced Martell Dyles, Workforce Initiative Now (WIN) Program Manager.  Martell Dyles presented a video the WIN program created for introduction, marketing, and training purposes.  He then reviewed the WIN presentation included in the Civil Rights Committee Agenda packet for April 14, 2015.  The presentation reviewed the WIN program statistics, projects where RTD has implemented WIN requirements, WIN program partners and events, the WIN Ambassador program, and the WIN and Transit Workforce National Perspective.

Martell Dyles pointed out that the WIN program had 31 new placements in the first quarter of 2015, making it the largest single quarter placement total in WIN’s history.

Zamy Silva reviewed the Civil Rights Division Update included in the Civil Rights Committee Agenda packet for April 14, 2015. The update included the following items:

- Introduction of Ed Neuberg as RTD’s new ADA Manager

- The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) computer based training to RTD personnel is scheduled to start on during the 2015 2nd quarter

- The EEO new software will launch May 27, 2015

- Various Small Business Office (SBO) events, including networking and pre-bid events

- Small and Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (SBE/DBE) Advisory Committee update

- SBO/WIN Program Orientation on March 12, 2015

- Memorandum of Understanding Stakeholder event scheduled for May 28, 2015

- Statistics on FasTracks DBE/SBE participation

Director Folska thanked Zamy Silva for the introduction of Ed Neuberg as ADA Manager for RTD.  She noted that the creation of this position is a hallmark on how the agency is moving forward.  She hopes that the ADA Manager’s scope would include people with disabilities in the conversation of affirmative action, as this would line up with President Obama’s Executive Order 13548.  Zamy Silva replied that her team has already started putting some of those plans in place to help raise awareness in terms of the ADA community.  This includes starting the conversation to make the WIN program information accessible as to not exclude the disabled community.

Director Anderson said that it is wonderful to have the stops announced audibly on the light rail and buses.  She recalled that recently a man sat next to her on the train wearing a sweatshirt indicating that he was deaf.  She wondered how a deaf person would be able to tell which one was their stop when it is dark out.  She said that staff did not need to reply at the moment but that she wanted to bring this incident to the discussion.  Zamy Silva replied that she will look into this type of incident.  She noted that Ed Neuberg is in the process of meeting with all the departments within RTD to find out where we are and how the agency functions.  She added that this research is crucial as her team moves forward addressing these types of concerns and issues.
