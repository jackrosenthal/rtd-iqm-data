### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions presented to the Board.

#### 1. Federal Update - Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, from Squire Patton Boggs, noted that there will not be a lot of business in D.C. after the July 4th recess.

Mike Dino said the House passed their version of the Transportation Appropriation’s Bill on June 10th.  The Senate sub-committee passed their version on June 5th.  The bill is stalled out in the Senate because of disagreements on amendments.  The Senate’s version is more generous towards transit.  Squire Patton Boggs will continue to monitor these items as they are of interest to RTD. Appropriations will possibly be addressed during a “lame duck” session after the November election.

He stated that of near term concern for RTD is the Transportation Reauthorization and the Highway Trust Fund Solvency.  He pointed out that Transportation Secretary Foxx wrote to each State Department of Transportation’s Chief Executive Officer addressing this matter.  Plans to address funding on the highway aspect will start to be implemented in August.  Any impacts for transit funding will be seen in December through formula money. Full funding grant agreement will not be affected by the fund’s insolvency as they come from a different line item.  No significant ideas have been put forth to extend the highway trust fund.

Director Lubow asked if bus services would decrease if formula funding is affected.  Mike Dino said that he could not answer that question.  He pointed out that RTD has always been able to cope effectively.  Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer, replied that RTD does not anticipate reaching that point.  RTD currently receives about 12% or $55 million for its preventive maintenance.  Staff is working on a letter on behalf of General Manager Phil Washington to the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) addressing those concerns.

Director Hoy asked to confirm that the full funding grant agreement payment will remain the same for 2014.  Mike Dino confirmed that there will be no changes in the payment for 2014.

Director Folska expressed her concerns about RTD’s Trust Fund funding since she believes there will not be a serious discussion about the matter in Congress until January, 2015.  She asked what part of RTD base operations is funded by the Trust Fund.  Terry Howerter said the preventive maintenance comes from the Trust Fund.  Director Folska said she was under the impression that RTD Operations is funded from the Trust Fund.  She expressed her concern if there would be a necessity to operate from a deficit, increase fares, or cut services.  The last two scenarios would mean RTD needs to give the public a six (6) months warning under Title VI.  Terry Howerter clarified that preventive maintenance is funded through the Trust Fund through transfer of funds to transit funds.  He further said that if $55 million would be lost it would have an impact on RTD and that would be evaluated at that time.  Director Folska asked for clarification on RTD’s reserve funds.  Terry Howerter said the RTD base has three (3) months of reserve funds.  FasTracks has two (2) months and funds are about to reach the third month.
