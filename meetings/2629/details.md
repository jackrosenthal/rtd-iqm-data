## IV. Retiree Awards

Chair Hoy stated there were no retirees for the month of September. He recognized Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis, Todd Nikkel, Manager of Cost and Budget, and Tom Smyth, Cost and Budget Analyst, for receiving the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA). He noted that the award is the highest form of recognition on government budgeting, represents a significant achievement by these individuals, and reflects the commitment of staff to meeting the highest principles of government budgeting. He added that these great employees do a lot of hard work.

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, echoed Chair Hoy’s statements and said that the budget staff has improved on the budget book each year. She remarked that receiving the award means that RTD has met all the rigorous criteria established by the GFOA. She added that the work of the budget staff reflected well on the organization and thanked them for their hard work.

## V. Public Participation

Chair Hoy stated public participation was open to anyone who wanted to address the Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.

Joan Peck, Longmont City Council, spoke about the State Highway 119 (SH119) Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project. She said that the system is vital to Longmont economic vitality and quality of life. She added that she urged the Board to keep the $30 million funding for the project as listed in the Strategic Business Plan (SBP). She stated that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) has over $100 million planned for the SH119 corridor, and RTD’s $30 million is needed to leverage CDOT’s dollars. She further added that, as a cost savings measure, she encouraged staff to look into the Volkswagen settlement fund to purchase buses for the corridor. She stated that, now that US Route 36 is almost complete, she said that SH119, per the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), should be the priority. She said that this project also fits the DRCOG Metro Vision Plan, Regional Multimodal Vision Plan, and Urban Renewal Plan for Longmont. She added that there is both business and community support in Longmont for the project to address the congestion on SH119. She said that, as improved forecasts from the Leeds School of Business come in, she urged the Board to make SH119 a priority.

Elise Jones, Boulder County Commissioner, read the following statement:

Honorable Members of the Regional Transportation District Board of Directors,

Thank you for the opportunity to speak. I am Elise Jones, a member of the Boulder County Board of County Commissioners, and am speaking on behalf of our full Board.

I am here to express our continued support for timely funding for the State Highway 119/Longmont Diagonal Bus Rapid Transit, and to urge you to keep the $30 million for its implementation in the Strategic Business Plan.

It is critical to keep this funding in the current Strategic Business Plan for a number of reasons:

1.               The ongoing commitment of RTD funding for this project is key to leveraging over $100 million in CDOT dollars currently planned for the corridor. This project has been identified as a high priority project by CDOT and maintaining the committed RTD funding for this corridor is critical if we are to successfully leverage the additional monies from CDOT necessary to implement this project. Delaying RTD's funding would put these opportunities for partnership at risk.

2.              There is regional consensus that this project is the highest priority BRT corridor. It was identified through the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), and in the associated 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition consensus statement, which is also supported by the Commuting Solutions Board of Directors.

3.               This project has momentum and community support. The recently initiated collaborative NEPA/design process includes a broad range of interests, including Longmont, Boulder, Boulder County, Commuting Solutions, the Northwest Chamber Alliance, the MCC, RTD and CDOT. This effort is anticipated to be completed in the next few years. Pushing funding timelines even further in the future could put the NEPA clearances at risk.

4.              We continue to strongly support completion of FasTracks, however we are also concerned about the proposed diversion of the base operating system to fund FasTracks construction and operations elsewhere in the region. The use of base system funding for FasTracks sacrifices the current and future quality of the bus system that serves the greatest number of people at a lower cost per passenger in order to build the more expensive rail portion of the system that serves fewer people at a greater cost per rider. It is important in times of fiscal constraint to put available revenue towards the most cost effective elements of the current and future transit system, which includes arterial bus rapid transit services such as the SH119 corridor.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

Aubrey DeBarros, Executive Director of Commuting Solutions, stated that she wanted to express her agency’s concerns with RTD’s proposed deferment of SH119 capital funding. She said that, while Commuting Solutions appreciates the agency’s commitment to balance the financial forecast for the next six years, it is important to Commuting Solutions’ regional partnership with RTD for the project to remain in the current SBP and not be postponed. She noted that several of the Directors were not serving on the Board back in 2014 when the NAMS study was approved by the Board, and she thought it would be helpful to inform the Board of the partnership efforts between RTD staff, the Board, and Commuting Solutions’ correlation that went into moving the SH119 BRT project forward. She stated that Commuting Solutions’ Corridor Coalition group strongly recommended the project as the number one priority for Commuting Solutions’ region for the short term. She said that at the time of the study the SH119 project was not in the DRCOG Fiscally Constrained Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), which it needed to be eligible for future DRCOG funding. She said that Boulder County took the lead and worked with RTD to make sure that the planned amendment took place. She noted that, in order for the project to be placed in the DRCOG RTP, it is necessary for at least partial funding to be identified, and RTD made that commitment through the $30 million in the SBP. She further stated that the US36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition and Commuting Solutions worked with RTD to apply for the DRCOG National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) environmental planning funding and that planning effort got started the previous March. She added that Commuting Solutions and US 36 Metro Mayor’s Caucus worked over the past few years with several congressional members to make sure that, under the 2015 FAST Act, the federal definition of “BRT” for projects such as SH119 would more favorably compete for small starts funding. She noted that Commuting Solutions was working at a federal level to make sure the project could compete for funding. She said that Commuting Solutions is counting on RTD’s funding to leverage local, regional, state, and federal funding to make this corridor investment happen by 2023. She added that, in light of the commitment to Commuting Solutions’ region that has been broken due to Northwest Rail funding, Commuting Solutions would greatly appreciate the Board’s commitment to proceed with SH119 corridors in the short term.

Doug Gragg, Denver, stated he is a proud resident of Capitol Hill. He questioned how the agency intends going to salvage the G Line and said that he would advocate for open rebellion against the federal authorities by opening the G Line. He said that RTD could have the G Line running for 10 years before being taken to court. He noted that something has to be done to prevent wildlife and weeds from overtaking the agency’s platforms and tracks. He added that the agency has been experiencing a lot of safety instances lately and said that an incident a day will start keeping the passengers away. He said that people think there are some routes in the city that are too dangerous to ride.

### A. 2017-006 : Budget Transfer for Router Upgrades

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.

BACKGROUND

Network equipment that supports commerce and security activities on the Southwest, Southeast and Central Plate Valley rail lines are no longer in a state of good repair. The network equipment and switches need to be replaced as the technology is at end-of-life and may become unreliable.

The new network equipment includes multiple network switches and routers which connect to RTD’s core network infrastructure. Total estimated costs are not to exceed $900,000.

In 2015, a Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) funding request was made to replace equipment on one of the three rail lines. This project has $320,000 available. An unrelated project, the Garage Concentrator Upgrade project, was completed under budget and has $325,000 remaining that can be used for the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project. The Garage Concentrator Upgrade project originally included contract services to install the equipment. The Information Technology team opted to install the equipment using in-house resources resulting in overall project savings of $325,000. The remaining $255,000 needed for the Network Equipment project is available in the Information Technology expense budget.

DISCUSSION

As the district continues to lean more heavily on technology, our reliance upon the network infrastructure increases in need and criticality. For example, Ticket Vending Machines (TVM) accept credit cards. The network equipment that connects the TVMs to RTD infrastructure must adhere to Payment Card Industry standards. Moreover, this network equipment is used to transport information to the Public Information Displays (PIDs) on the platforms, and is used by security in support of the security cameras and emergency telephones.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The project budget will not exceed $900,000. $325,000 was previously approved in the SBP. This request is asking for permission to transfer $320,000 from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade Project and $255,000 from the Information Technology expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve a budget transfer from the Garage Concentrator Upgrade capital project and the Information Technology, Data Processing Services expense budget to the Network Equipment and Switches Upgrade project to fund the replacement of the network equipment needed on the rail lines. The targeted rail lines include the Southwest, Southeast and Central Platte Valley rail lines.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       RTD replaces the equipment and switches on one rail line at a cost $325,000. This leaves two other rail lines at risk of equipment failure potentially leaving RTD unable to collect revenue, use emergency telephones, and collect security camera footage.

3.       RTD does not replace the legacy switch equipment on these lines and continues to use the existing equipment, some of which is not Payment Card Industry compliant. This puts the agency at risk of violating PCI endorsement.

### B. 2017-007 : ITS Work Order Contract

It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  Work is administered on an as-needed, work order basis. Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.

BACKGROUND

RTD has need of an on-call contractor to perform work in support of initiatives including Information Technology Governance; Service Provision, Acquisition and Contracting; Intelligent Transportation Systems, Emerging Technologies and Transit Business Operations.  The contractor will provide technical support of the agency’s broad range of technologies and applications. The Work Orders (WOs) will be short to mid-term periods.

DISSCUSSION

RTD conducted an open procurement for an ITS Work Order contractor.  Six firms submitted proposals.  The criteria used to evaluate the proposals was:

The five members of the evaluation team selected three firms for interviews.  Apex was selected as the successful proposer.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

The contract authority shall not exceed $10,000,000.  Funding for these Work Orders will be included in the budgets of the projects on which the work is performed.  The types of funds are dependent upon the funding source of each individual project.  Individual work orders will be funded as the project requirement is processed.  The amount is not to exceed $2,000,000 in any one year.

ALTERNATIVES

1.       Authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract to Apex Design, PC (Apex) for an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) Work Order Contract (Contract Number 17DH010) for an amount not to exceed $10,000,000 over 5 years.  This is the preferred alternative.

2.       Provide the needed services with RTD personnel.  RTD personnel does not have the expertise or capacity for the work provided by a work order contractor.  This does not meet the needs of RTD.

3.       Advertise again and proceed with an entirely new procurement.  This would take well over six months and not likely result in a different outcome.

### C. 2017-008 : Approval of Contract Extension for Special Event Ticket Sellers

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.

BACKGROUND

RTD is currently contracted with Central Parking Systems, Inc. for a term of three years plus two option years.  The initial three-year period had a contract value of $448,336.09.  The first option year has been exercised increasing the contract amount to $598,336.09.  Exercising the final option year will add $172,000.00 to the contract authority for a revised contract amount not-to-exceed $770,336.09.

DISCUSSION

Ticket sellers are deployed to supplement ticket vending machines (TVMs) and Park-n-Rides during periods of high passenger volume for special events.  Providing these supplemental ticket sales avoids long lines at the TVMs, allows for more streamlined boardings and provides good customer service.  These ticket selling services are used during Rockies and Broncos games as well as other special events such as The Race for the Cure, large concerts, etc.

Central Parking provides the staffing necessary for these supplemental ticket sales.  RTD retains all fares sold by the ticket sellers and pays Central Parking for the staffing they supply.  The following shows the last three years of ticket sales performed by Central Parking.

The ticket sellers on the rail corridors are housed in secure booths at certain rail stations where high passenger volumes occur.  The booths have internet and power connections which allow the sellers to accept credit cards as well as cash.

RTD has contracted with Central Parking to provide the staffing for these supplemental ticket sales because RTD does not have enough staffing resources in-house.  During these events, RTD schedules additional coverage with RTD revenue technicians to service TVMs and also may provide some RTD ticket sellers that use handheld ticket selling devices.

FINANCIAL IMPACT

Exercising the final option year will authorize $172,000 in contract funding.  Funding for 2017 is included in the 2017 Amended Budget approved by the Board of Directors in June 2016 and will be included in the 2018 Budget request.

ALTERNATIVES

1)      Authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is the recommended action.

2)      Do not approve the recommendation by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to exercise the final option year and increase the contract amount by $172,000.00 to extend the RTD contract with Central Parking System, Inc. to provide ticket selling services for special event fares through April 15, 2019.  This is not the recommended action because it would result in long lines to purchase tickets, uneven boardings and customer dissatisfaction.
