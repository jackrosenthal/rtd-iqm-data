Call to Order: Committee Chair Brohl called the Operations and Customer Services
Committee meeting to order at 7:32 p.m.
I.

Recommended Actions
 August 2010 Service Changes – Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager,
Customer and Contracted Services introduced this action. This package has a
variety of adjustments with a slight service reduction. The timeline for the May
and August service changes is very tight. Mr. Abel also distributed a memo
with the public meeting dates, times, and locations to the Committee.
Committee Chair Brohl asked if there were any reductions that resulted in a
“foreclosure” of transit in a particular area.
Mr. Abel responded that the objectives/strategies in designing these alternatives
were:
a. Utilizing our performance evaluation based on the service standards
b. The effects on the overall transit network and on transit dependent
customers
c. The availability of alternative services

d. Equitable throughout the district
e. Equitable throughout the types of services
He also pointed out that there are some areas that need an augmentation of
service and this package contains that as well.
Jeff Becker added that there are a few areas where there would be no service
and this is off of the end of the Route 21. Jesse Carter added this would affect
25 boardings per day.
Director Daly gave his compliments to staff on the service change package. He
felt it was very selective and shared the pain among the Districts. He was
concerned that the private contractors are becoming overwhelmed on busy
routes like the Route 16 and 30 and they can’t stay on schedule. He didn’t see
anything in these changes to increase service on those routes.
Jesse Carter said that with any change that is this large, staff looks at running
time analysis is part of it. We will be looking at how all these Federal routes are
working together and adjustments will be made to schedules as needed.
Director Malpiede thanked staff for their hard work on service changes and for
working on Route 9 that serves a very low income community.
Director Busck received some clarification from staff on the changes to the
Route R.
Director Martinez said we will hear from people where earliest and latest routes
are being cute will result in them not being able to and from work. Keep in
mind that some service changes will require people to make transfers and then
if we eliminate the transfers they will be even more affected.
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve moving the proposed August 2010 Service Changes
(Attachment A) on to public review and comment.

Director Daly pointed out the operator complaints and was concerned with the
fact that none of the contractors met their targets. He wanted to know if there
was an explanation. Carolyn Conover said that she doesn’t think the
contractors are tracking trends well, that they are addressing problems one on
one but there is not good follow up. Their turnover rate is 25-28%. They are
talking about implementing a mentoring program. Director Daly is also
concerned that the trainers at the private contractors are getting stale and that
they are doing training by rote. Ms. Conover shared that part of our contract is
that we are reapproving trainers and they are going out undercover and have
pulled some people off the training list so far.
Director Daly was concerned about Veolia’s inability to be on time on the higher
usage routes. Ms. Conover said she believed that some of this may be due to a
lack of depth of experience. She said that they get a lot of feedback from
operators but they are not sharing this information. We are encouraging the
drivers to share the information with us, with their own personnel and using the
driver portal on the web.
Mr. Abel shared that complaints are rising across the Board with the new
stroller policy and fare enforcement program.
Director McMullen commended staff for the improvements on the Security
reports.

III. Service Allocation/Change Process Discussion - Bruce Abel distributed a memo regarding
service standards. A copy of this memo is available for review in the Operations and
Customer Services Committee meeting minute notebook. He was not asking the Board
for a decision. He wanted to plant some questions for the Committee to consider.
HOW DO WE MEASURE SUCCESS?
Ridership
and/or
how much service we provide
Service Standards address:
- productivity (we can’t provide ridership, only service try to provide service in
such a way that people ride it because our ultimate goal is mobility)
- How many people actually use the service? (more usage = more success)
- how much do we have to subsidize each one of those services (as each service
is different)
- service frequencies (30 minutes peak, 60 minutes off peak)
- maximum load standards (not more people standing than the bus is designed
for)
- directness of Route

-

Route deviation standard (Point A to Point B and deviations)
Stop spacing standards
Area coverage standards (fixed route service within ¼ mile of where they are
at)
Special event guidelines

Mr. Abel also posted the following questions:
What is a sustainable level of service for RTD?
How do you manage economic peaks and valleys?
There was a discussion by the committee about the service standards and the need to look
at cuts/changes holistically and the interrelationship between service and fares.
Director Busck would like to have an outside meeting purely to look at these questions and
how we handle service and what the Board’s policy should be. He feels that setting policy
on service reductions and fares is very important.
IV. Other Matters - There were no other matters discussed.
V. Next Meeting – The next meeting of the Operations and Customer Services Committee will
be June 1, 2010.
VI. Adjourn - Chair Brohl declared the Operations and Costumer Services Committee adjourned
at 8:42 p.m.
