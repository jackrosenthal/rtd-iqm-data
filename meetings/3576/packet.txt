BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Transit Police Department Update

October 2, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On January 19, 2021, the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) submitted a written request to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for a peer review of the existing RTD Security
Model. APTA accepted the request and convened a peer review panel of highly experienced transit
policing leaders. Implementation of the panel’s recommendations has been led by the Chief of Police and
Emergency Management. This report describes ongoing operational and strategic changes and those
anticipated over the next several years.
DISCUSSION
The overarching strategy for RTD-PD is founded in a paradigm shift towards expanding day-to-day
operations in the following areas:
1. Proactive and positive engagement with the community forming trusted partnerships
2. A renewed focus on crime prevention
3. Marked progress in an intentional and phased internal growth strategy
4. Commitment to the application of intelligent and evidence-based strategies and the development
of solutions for complex problems, and
5. Promotion of organization-wide infrastructure improvements that enhance stakeholder safety and
facilitate crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED)
The framework for the enhancement of the RTD-PD community policing, Back to Basics, People Power,
and Welcoming Transit Environment strategies are described herein within the context of four topical
areas discussed in depth in the associated presentation:
▪ Strategic Implementation
▪ Evidence-Based Policing
▪ Strategic Priorities Alignment
▪ Performance Data Outputs
Community Policing
RTD-PD continues to improve its brand by augmenting its perception by increasing its legitimacy as a
full-service law enforcement entity. As the department assumes a more visible and active role in

Packet Pg. 21

1.E.2

improving overall public safety throughout the transit environment, through the ongoing phased hiring of
sworn officers, while remaining sensitive to non-criminal social issues, it fosters a Welcoming Transit
Environment for customers and employees and frames future expectations.
Increasing police-stakeholder engagement also includes the expansion of key partnerships with agencies
throughout the service area, facilitating a more coordinated multi-agency approach to improving law
enforcement and public safety outcomes. As RTD-PD becomes a more active participant in proactively
addressing regional criminal and social challenges, additional sworn hiring allows the agency to expand
its reach.
Examples of RTD-PD’s expansion benefits include:
• All members of the command staff undergoing intensive background clearances checks for
participation in the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force (FBI-JTTP)
• Actively connecting with social service providers to meet specific sector needs, and
• Meeting with police contemporaries in surrounding jurisdictions, part of a defined strategy to
improve relationships with other government entities as well as addiction and mental health
treatment providers for the benefit of all in the community
People Power
With approval for 70 sworn officers in 2023, RTD-PD is growing at a steady rate. As of August 22,
2022, there were only 18 sworn officers in the department; however, despite a nominal amount of
attrition, as of September 18, 2023, there are 43 sworn officers. An additional 16 officers are active in
the background process, and 42 total pre-hire interviews are already scheduled for September 2023,
with 30 police academy slots reserved for January 2024.
Although overall criminal incidents decreased as described herein, workload calculations indicate the
reduction in the agency’s historical overreliance on security, and the corresponding shift toward a larger
sworn police force, is justified. RTD-PD's commitment to focus on the diverse needs of RTD
stakeholders is further evidenced by departmental efforts to engage in more community policing efforts
and to increase recruiting event participation and success.
For example, since August 2022, as RTD-PD became more visibly diverse and embraced all tenets of
diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB), by committing to the “30 by 30 Pledge” (a national
initiative to recruit and retain additional women in policing careers), overall interest in employment with
RTD-PD has increased. This rapid increase tested the agency’s ability to process applicants, conduct
interviews, and complete background investigations within more efficient timeframes than other metroarea law enforcement competitors.
As RTD-PD continues to transition towards a majority sworn police workforce, it is becoming better
positioned to:
• Nurture community relationships
• Mitigate conditions conducive to crime, and

Packet Pg. 22

1.E.2

•

Expand its capacity to serve those with mental health, addiction, and housing struggles without
over-criminalizing non-chronic offenders.

In short, the agency’s commitment to addressing People Power in terms of police hiring promotes a
tangible reinvestment in public safety resources, further demonstrating to employees and customers the
importance RTD places upon their perceptions of public safety in the transit environment. When the
same persons hired enforce laws and Respect the Ride tenets in a firm, fair, and professional manner, it
adds to the likelihood that RTD meets the diverse needs of all stakeholders.
Information about RTD-PD careers, including career maps, salary and benefits is available on RTD’s
website at the following address: https://www.rtd-denver.com/rider-info/more-rider-info/safety-andsecurity/transit-police-careers
In addition to sworn police officers, RTD-PD is also recruiting individuals for the position of Police Cadet
through a new specialized training and education program designed to help strengthen and diversify
RTD-PD’s future workforce. Cadets are assigned administrative duties, participate in department and
community events, and participate in training that teaches skills essential to pursuing a career in public
safety. Some of the trainings include self-defense tactics, radio communications, and conflict resolution.
On average, cadets work up to 20 hours per week.
Welcoming Transit Environment
Recent accomplishments in overall crime reduction in 2022 and year-to-date (YTD) in 2023, as
compared to 2021, are highly positive indicators of the efficacy of the approach recommended by the
peer review panel and substantiated through the deployment strategies of the RTD-PD command staff.
An example is the decrease in crime reported in targeted areas like Denver Union Station (DUS) and
parking facilities. The incidence of crime in the DUS area has declined 45.33% in 2023 in comparison to
the same seven-month period from 2021 and is indicative of the extreme importance cultural changes
can have in any organization. The decrease in criminal incidents at DUS demonstrates how a strategic
and intentional reinvestment into personnel in the form of transitioning away from contracted security
guards to sworn police officers and upgrades to the hardware and use of technology in facilities benefits
the agency, its employees, and customers. The 2023 YTD overall criminal incident trends also support
the efficacy of the new strategic directions throughout the RTD transit environment:

In June 2023, the Board of Directors adopted a recommendation from staff to update the Customer
Code of Conduct and Service Suspension Policy rebranding both as the Respect the Ride campaign. The
intent of this combined staff effort was to create and further a more Welcoming Transit Environment.
The updates in both areas now allow sworn police officers, security officers, and street supervisors
additional options and impose more strict prohibitions when addressing behaviors, and in particular those
demonstrated chronic actors who make it untenable for some customers to feel safe during their rides.
In summary, the policy provides that any individual who continues to engage in prohibited behavior or
activities may be subject to enforcement ranging from a verbal or written warning, immediate
suspension from a vehicle or facility, and/or a criminal citation. Respect the Ride is also a continuous
customer education campaign that entails posting conspicuous signage in facilities and vehicles to
educate customers on “do’s and don’ts,” and the postings are expected to be installed in vehicles and
facilities by early October 2023.
Since the update to the Respect the Ride policies were implemented in July 2023, 24 RTD police officerissued suspensions were disseminated, an increase from the previous two months, when only 16
suspensions were written respectively. The current RTD-PD focus has been downtown Denver and DUS;
DUS is where the majority of officer-issued suspensions were written. As the department continues
experiencing growth; expands to outside sectors throughout the RTD service area; focuses on hotspots;
and proactively addresses persons whose chronic behaviors in violation of RTD standards went
unaddressed, the number of total suspensions should rise overall. Ultimately, suspensions will eventually
decrease over time as educational and enforcement efforts expand to, and are retained by, customers in
all five sectors.
Capital Improvements
Along with the reinvestment in People Power previously cited, another strategic objective is the future
purchase of technological capital improvement products that will replace end-of-life Records
Management System (RMS) and Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) platforms, respectively. The evidencebased policing enhancements they bring also help RTD-PD get Back to Basics. The procurement of new
CAD and RMS platforms facilitates precision in deployment, creates efficiencies in dispatching, and
augments the ability for all sworn staff to analyze and adapt to trending crimes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item. The expansion of sworn RTD-PD
personnel and capital and operating expenses related to this expansion in the current fiscal year are
contemplated in the 2023 Budget.
