RECOMMENDED ACTION
M. January 2012 Service Changes–Lyons to Longmont Service (new service)
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents
necessary to enter into an Intergovernmental Agreement with Boulder County to provide
Express bus service -between the Town of Lyons and the City of Longmont. This
agreement will be valid from January 8, 2012 to May 12, 2012 and may be amended for
future periods. Funding for this service will be provided by Boulder County.
N. Assumptions for FasTracks 2012 Annual Program Evaluation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the scope of the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) to include the
following assumptions:
Sales and Use Tax












Successful 0.4% sales and use tax election in November, 2012, with new revenues
effective January 1, 2013
The new sales and use tax will fully sunset
Debt proceeds secured by the new sales and use tax will be used ONLY for the
remaining, partially-funded projects (as identified below in Table 1)
Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be available to pay for O&M for the
remaining, partially-funded projects
Existing 0.4% sales and use tax would not be able to fund O&M on the new corridors
until after 2035. Absent this flexibility, this could result in a scenario where there is
not enough funding to operate and maintain the corridors once they are built
RTD needs to maintain the ability to manage O&M as a system, not on a corridor-bycorridor basis
Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be combined for debt service coverage
purposes
If revenues cannot be blended for debt service coverage purposes, RTD cannot issue
new bonds in time to complete the program by 2020 at a 2.00x Additional Bonds
Test (ABT)
Issuing debt at less than 2.00x ABT could result in:
1. Lower credit rating

2. Higher interest rates
3. Reduced pool of potential investors
4. More risk for completing the program if revenues do not meet expectations
Scope








Construction and operation of all of the FasTracks corridors and projects, including:
Denver Union Station, West Corridor, Central Corridor Extension, Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, Light Rail Maintenance Facilities, North Metro, Northwest Rail,
Southeast Corridor Extension, Southwest Corridor Extension and RTD’s remaining
proportionate share of US 36
Scope of these corridors and projects consistent with the final environmental
clearance documents, currently approved designs, signed contract documents and
any minor modifications resulting from future value engineering efforts
Current design assumptions will be used to update capital cost estimates for the
remaining corridors
Establishment of a program-wide contingency is being considered to ensure funding
is available to complete the FasTracks system on time
If there is contingency left over after all the corridors are complete, RTD staff and the
RTD Board of Directors will work with stakeholders to develop a recommendation
concerning the use of any remaining contingency. Options could include:
1. Fulfilling outstanding commitments allowed by the original FasTracks plan
2. Paying down the existing bonds so that they sales and use tax can sunset
earlier than targeted

Schedule

Corridor construction phasing consistent with the current Board adopted 2011 APE,
as approved in the most recent (2010) Annual Report to DRCOG on FasTracks (See

This action does not represent a decision or commitment at this time by the Board of Directors to
place a sales and use tax increase on the ballot, but it preserves the RTD Board of Directors’ ability
to continue consideration of all potential scenarios for completion of the FasTracks program.
