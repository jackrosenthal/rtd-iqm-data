N. Assumptions for FasTracks 2012 Annual Program Evaluation
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the scope of the 2012 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) to include the
following assumptions:
Sales and Use Tax


Successful 0.4% sales and use tax election in November, 2012, with new revenues

effective January 1, 2013
The new sales and use tax will fully sunset
Debt proceeds secured by the new sales and use tax will be used ONLY for the
remaining, partially-funded projects (as identified below in Table 1)
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be available to pay for O&M for the
remaining, partially-funded projects
 Existing 0.4% sales and use tax would not be able to fund O&M on the new corridors
until after 2035. Absent this flexibility, this could result in a scenario where there is
not enough funding to operate and maintain the corridors once they are built
 RTD needs to maintain the ability to manage O&M as a system, not on a corridor-bycorridor basis
 Revenues from the new sales and use tax will be combined for debt service coverage
purposes
 If revenues cannot be blended for debt service coverage purposes, RTD cannot issue
new bonds in time to complete the program by 2020 at a 2.00x Additional Bonds
Test (ABT)
 Issuing debt at less than 2.00x ABT could result in:
1. Lower credit rating
2. Higher interest rates
3. Reduced pool of potential investors
4. More risk for completing the program if revenues do not meet expectations



Scope








Construction and operation of all of the FasTracks corridors and projects, including:
Denver Union Station, West Corridor, Central Corridor Extension, Eagle Project, I225 Corridor, Light Rail Maintenance Facilities, North Metro, Northwest Rail,
Southeast Corridor Extension, Southwest Corridor Extension and RTD’s remaining
proportionate share of US 36
Scope of these corridors and projects consistent with the final environmental
clearance documents, currently approved designs, signed contract documents and
any minor modifications resulting from future value engineering efforts
Current design assumptions will be used to update capital cost estimates for the
remaining corridors
Establishment of a program-wide contingency is being considered to ensure funding
is available to complete the FasTracks system on time
If there is contingency left over after all the corridors are complete, RTD staff and the
RTD Board of Directors will work with stakeholders to develop a recommendation
concerning the use of any remaining contingency. Options could include:
1. Fulfilling outstanding commitments allowed by the original FasTracks plan
2. Paying down the existing bonds so that they sales and use tax can sunset
earlier than targeted
