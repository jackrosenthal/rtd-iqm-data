BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Title VI Service Equity Analysis

July 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors (Board) to adopt the Title VI Service Equity Analysis report for the September
2024 service changes to comply with federal laws, regulations, and guidelines related to Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Martin Romero, Transit Equity Manager, Civil Rights Division
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 38 service changes proposed for September 2024 facilitate opportunities for bus and rail operators
to select new work assignments and for the Service Development Division to adjust the overall
operations plan for the transit network. Additionally, with the Board’s adoption of the Reimagine RTD
System Optimization Plan (SOP), several of the service change proposals reflect the first phases of SOP
implementation to provide the best possible value to customers.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on service standards
• Maintaining the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• Making alternative services available to affected customers
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard
to race, color or national origin; also, there is no disparate impact on minority populations, nor a
disproportionate burden on low-income populations
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
Service Equity Analysis Requirements of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that
exceed the established major service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income populations. The September 2024 service
change proposal includes one major service change out of 38 total changes. Thus, an analysis is required
to be brought before the Board for its consideration. The complete Title VI Service Equity Analysis report
is included in Attachment A.
Title VI Service Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate
Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide the foundational
requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity. These policies and their applicable
thresholds are listed below:
Major Service Change Policy
A major service change is defined as a 25 percent addition or reduction in the service hours of
any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service changes will be
subject to an equity analysis.
Title VI Policies
Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10 percent more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate
impact.
Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10 percent more than higher-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below
150 percent of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
DISCUSSION
Staff proposes changes to 32 bus routes and six rail lines in the forthcoming September 2024 service
change. Of these 38 changes, one service has proposed additions or reductions to service 25% greater
than that of baseline service and thus meets established thresholds for a major service change. That
route is shown in bold in the following table.

Methodology

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

Disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses were performed at the route/line level, route/line
block group and network level to identify any potential disparities in service changes based on
race/ethnicity or income.
Summary of Findings:
• A potential disparate impact was identified at the individual route level: the one route/line that
had major service changes, Route 40, had a potential disparate impact finding.
•

The proposed major service change was examined, at the network level, to determine overall
impacts to equity (i.e., minority and low-income) populations compared to non-equity (i.e., nonminority and non-low-income) populations. However, the systemwide service increase findings
mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to being the sole major service change.

At the network level, service changes (service increases solely on Route 40), minority populations stand
to benefit less than non-minority populations (1.37% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This difference falls
below the disparate impact threshold of 1.56%. Therefore, the proposed major service increase results
in a system-level disparate impact. However, low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than
non-low-income populations (1.57% vs. 1.62%, respectively). The difference does not fall below the
10% disproportionate burden threshold of 1.46%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is
found with the proposed major service increase.
Conclusions
Although the major service change has resulted in a potential disparate impact at both the route and
network levels, RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 major service change plan as proposed,
as there are no practical alternatives to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The
substantial legitimate justification for the Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of
the SOP, which recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th•
Colorado Station and Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective
Bargaining Agreement-compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate
justification for the service improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are
significant, with a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of five of the
six minor changes (of the 38 service changes, only those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours),
are considered low-income-serving bus routes, and a total of two out of six are considered minorityserving bus routes. Other minor changes include improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus
routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on eight routes, three individual implementations of
the SOP, and four changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project.
In adopting this report, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priority of Community
Value while maintaining compliance with Title VI federal regulations. RTD will continue to assess the
equity implications for all subsequent service change proposals and will propose adjustments and service
alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

Executive Summary
This document summarizes the analysis of major service changes proposed for the September 2024 runboards
to ensure that the changes will not inequitably impact minority and low-income populations.

Methodology

RTD’s established Title VI program methodology defines the process to identify major service changes, disparate
impacts and disproportionate burdens. Analyses were performed at the route and block group levels to identify
any potential disparities in service changes based on race/ethnicity or income.

Major Service Changes

RTD proposes changes to 38 bus route/patterns of RTD’s forthcoming September 2024 runboard. Of this
change, one service met the established threshold for a major service change. The route tabulated below has
proposed adjustments to service that were greater than 25% of baseline service and are proposed for the longterm (will remain in effect for 12 or more months).
Service Adjustments (1 service)

Route 40: Improve headways to 15 minutes weekday
mornings through evenings along the entire route.

Findings

Major service changes included in the proposed September 2024 service changes include only the
improvement of service levels of Route 40. This route serves populations in east Denver that are below the
district average of minority populations and just under the district average for low-income populations.
When considering the demographics within the service area (within a quarter mile) of the major service increase
and as a proportion to the district overall, low-income populations received a slightly lower increase in service
(i.e., were less positively impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas received
0.02% less of a benefit than non-low-income areas. However, this difference does not meet the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold. Minority areas received less of an increase in service (i.e., were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefitted 0.15% less than non-minority areas,
a difference falling below the 10% disparate impact threshold. Thus, a potential disparate impact was identified
at the route level for the changes proposed for Route 40. The systemwide service increases findings mirror the
route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route 40 being the sole major service change.

Introduction
Title VI and Environmental Justice

Equity is a core principle of RTD’s functional mission to provide mass transit service within the Denver region.
An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and adverse effects of transit service without
regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major
service change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact
on minority or low-income populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document changes that are proposed to occur between the
current and proposed runboards. Routes with major service changes include one major increase and one
reinstatement of a formerly suspended route pattern. These changes and all others have been reviewed
individually at the route/line level and in aggregate at the block group level to identify potential impacts to the
communities RTD serves.

Service Change Philosophy

An equity analysis is triggered by proposed major service changes to the transit services provided by RTD. These
changes include the addition of new routes/lines, the elimination of existing routes/lines and changes to the
alignment and trip frequency within existing routes/lines. RTD has established principles to identify the service
changes needed to meet the diverse travel needs of those within the district and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system.

RTD Service Changes Guiding Principles

•

Service performance evaluation based on service standards
The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
The availability of alternative services to affected riders
Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
Compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without
regard to race, color or national origin; also, disparate effects on low-income and minority
populations
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

RTD services are divided into various service classes (the “Family of Services”) depending on service type, route
alignment and frequency. Each service class has its own service standards derived from the performance of all
routes within each class. RTD continually and comprehensively adjusts services in response to changes in
ridership and operational performance of the transit system. It is also the agency’s responsibility to identify
services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as
warranted. In keeping with Colorado Revised Statutes, RTD utilizes official service standards to establish
performance metrics used to identify underperforming services on a class-of-service basis. The agency uses
these metrics to identify a series of service changes. Equity analyses examine the impact of the proposed major
service changes on minority populations and low-income households at or below 150 percent of the Department
of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

…The general assembly further finds that the district should be organized efficiently,
economically, and on a demand-responsive basis and that the district should consider least-cost
alternatives in discharging its responsibilities.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies

Based on requirements within FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD, as an agency receiving federal funding,
must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy.
Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for evaluating service change proposals for equity
and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Major Service Change: A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the
service hours of any route that would remain in effect for 12 or more months. All major service
changes will be subject to an equity analysis that includes an analysis of adverse effects.
a. An Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes,
but is not limited to, eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting
an existing route and increasing headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects
and analyze those effects when planning major service changes.

2. Disparate Impact Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population
10% more than non-minority populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact.
3. Disproportionate Burden Policy: A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income
population 10% more than non-low-income populations; this level of impact is considered a
disproportionate burden. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150%
of the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed major service change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposed service change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the
potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and
RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed service change, the FTA may allow
RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Analysis
Data Sources and Methodology

Demographic data used for this analysis comes from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) 5Year Estimates for years 2018 to 2022 and is reviewed at the census block group geographic level. Other data
related to the analysis includes route alignments and block group geography. The linking of these datasets into
a service-geographic-demographic combination relates equity populations with changes in service at a
geographic level to aid in reviewing potential impacts to district equity communities.
The equity analysis for the September 2024 runboard looked at whether an individual route’s major service
changes impacted the communities it served. The review needed to determine the proportional difference in
changes made to equity populations within a quarter-mile service area of a bus route or rail line. These
proportional differences were compared against district population proportions of equity populations and
route/line proportions of equity populations.
Low-income status for population within the district is derived from Census Bureau population estimates and is
based on 150% of the United States federal poverty level (Department of Health and Human Services
guidelines), based on local context, which is an annual income of $32,580 for a family of three. Minority status
is based on the non-white and Hispanic or Latino count of total population. The service area is based on the
collection of block groups wholly or partially within district boundaries.
Route/line service area population is determined using a quarter mile “catchment area” centered around bus
stops and rail stations. This catchment area is then used to calculate the percentage overlap of block groupbased population underneath. For instance, if a catchment area contains 100% of the underlying block group,
100% of the population would be associated with the services within a quarter mile; if 50% of a block group
was contained in the catchment area, only half of the underlying population would count as being included
(ratios of population demographics would be unchanged).
RTD calculates the net change in service hours for each route/line proposal to provide the percent difference
from baseline service hours. Any change meeting or exceeding a 25% change (either positive or negative) from
baseline is flagged as a major service change for further review.

Public Outreach Overview

Six public meetings were conducted between June 18-26, 2024. No comments regarding the major service
change were collected during these meetings. Table 1 captures the meeting locations, dates, and number of
attendees.
The Communications and Engagement department produced a recorded webinar and downloadable toolkits,
which were provided to community-based organizations. Efforts were made to increase the use of social media
platforms, and in-system promotional assets were used to inform the public about the service changes. RTD’s
newly formed Impact Team was deployed to inform and gather feedback at stops and stations.
The public was also notified of the ability to submit comments to service.changes@rtd-denver.com, by phone at
303-299-6000 and by fax at 303-299-2227.

In addition to the public meetings, the Transit Equity Office contacted 67 key public activity centers within a
quarter mile of Route 40. These entities were informed of the proposed major service change, provided with
instructions on how to offer feedback, and encouraged to attend the open houses.
The Transit Equity Office collaborated with three community-based organizations (CBO) to share information
and collect feedback virtually and in-person. Of note, one CBO attended a community event and conducted
direct outreach along the Route 40 corridor. A total of 39 customers responded to the survey administered by
the CBO. Four additional survey responses were collected via the Service Changes website bringing the total
survey responses for the Route 40 to 43. Of these 43 responses, 41.5% stated that the change has no impact
on them, 14.6% indicated it has a somewhat positive impact, and 41.5% stated it is a very positive change.
Table 2 captures the common themes of the feedback received and the total responses.

Major Service Change, Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Analyses

Proposed service changes for the September 2024 runboard that resulted in a 25% or greater change in
service were categorized by equity population (minority or non-minority, low-income or non-low-income) for
comparison. Routes were categorized as either equity or non-equity based on their identification within the prior
(current) network using 2018-2022 ACS five-year demographic data.
A comparative, proportional equity analysis was completed to review the route/line individually. This analysis
identified the equity and non-equity populations within a route/line service area and compared those against the
equity and non-equity populations of the district. If impacted equity populations within the route/line service
area received 10% or greater impacts compared to non-equity populations, the route/line had a potential finding
of disparate impact (for minority populations) or disproportionate burden (for low-income populations) and was
flagged for a potential finding of impact.

Changes by Transit Mode

For the September 2024 runboard, 32 bus routes and six rail lines will undergo various service changes. Of
these, 6 routes will see combined increases in bus service of over 115 total weekday revenue service
hours and 51 additional weekend service hours. While temporary and technically not meeting major
service change requirements, with the ending of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project the discontinuation
of temporary service on the Free MetroRide with reinvestment of its resources into improving Free MallRide
service levels is a combined cost neutral change. The improvement of service on the Free MallRide allows for
service every 5 minutes between Denver Union Station and Civic Center Station along an updated alignment
along 15th and 17th Streets. The L Line is also proposed to resume operations downtown in September.

Major Service Change Review

A complete listing of all service changes can be found in Appendix A. Changes were first reviewed in aggregate
equity groupings of routes/lines prior to individual review of routes/lines, route/line block groups and overall
network levels; equity grouping comparison occurred at every level. Major service changes are categorized as
the following:
•
•

Major Service Reductions (a service reduction of 25% or more)
Major Service Increases (service increases of 25% or more related to new or restructured service)

Major Service Change Reductions

There are no major service reductions proposed for the proposed September 2024 runboard.

Major Service Change Increases

One bus route, the Route 40, had a proposed major service increase which includes service increases of 25%
or greater. Improved headways are proposed on Route 40 for the September 2024 runboard as outlined in
the RTD Board approval of the Systemwide Optimization Plan (SOP).

Route- and Line-Level Analysis
Having identified the service changes which meet the definition of Major Service Change, the next step in the
analysis is to look at each route/line individually to determine potential disparate impacts (DI) and/or
disproportionate burdens (DB). Both service reductions and service increases are analyzed. For service increases,
the analysis examines the extent to which the benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and lowincome populations. For service decreases, the analysis examines the extent to which the adverse effects of the
reductions are disproportionately borne by minority and low-income populations.

Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Analysis
For each route/line with a major service change, determine the percent of the route’s/line’s
impacted equity and non-equity populations comprising the district’s equity and non-equity
populations; if the difference is greater than 10% for equity populations, additional review is
required for potential adverse impacts

In concert with RTD’s Title VI policies, the demographics of each of major service change routes were reviewed
for potential DI or DB findings. For service increases, the following analysis examines the extent to which the
benefits of the improvements are inclusive of minority and low-income populations. Because these are proposed
service increases, protected populations falling below these thresholds are flagged for potential concerns. The
narrative analysis of each individual line follows, which includes further considerations of access to jobs,
education, health care, food and social services for minority and low-income populations.
Route 40

Proposal: As outlined in the RTD Board-approved System Optimization Plan (SOP), it is proposed to
implement 15-minute headways weekdays, mornings through evenings, along the full corridor. This also
ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement compliant restroom at each terminal.
As shown in Table 4, a slightly lower percentage of the district’s low-income population stands to benefit
from the proposed major service increase as compared to non-low-income population (0.99% vs. 1.01%,
respectively). However, this difference falls below the 10% disproportionate burden threshold (0.91%).

district’s minority population benefits from the proposed major service increase as compared to the nonminority population (0.91% vs. 1.06%, respectively). This difference falls below the 10% disparate
impact threshold (0.95%). Thus, there is a potential disparate impact found at the route level requiring
further examination (i.e., access to key public service destinations, community engagement and network
level analysis).

Systemwide Analysis
In accordance with RTD’s 2022 Title VI Program Update, a systemwide analysis is required in addition to routeand line-level analyses. A system level analysis provides further understanding of changes to service levels for
Title VI protected populations at aggregate levels.
The major service change threshold of 25% or greater used for individual route-level analyses was used as
precedent to determine potential adverse impacts overall and to identify structural issues in areas requiring
further review. Once average district thresholds for low-income and minority populations are established,
subsequent equity analyses focused on the subset of district block groups that experienced major service
changes of 25% or greater (additions or reductions in service), and whether equity block groups with major
service changes experienced service changes of 10% or more compared to non-equity block groups. Routes
with major service changes are later comparatively reviewed for potential adverse effects at route-block group
levels (block groups within route service areas).

Service Equity Analysis: September 2024

1.D.1.a

The analysis of all service changes identified the following:
•
•
•

Systemwide, bus service increases by over 115 weekday revenue hours
Of the over 31,000 people served by stops within the service area with major service changes, equity
populations represented an average share of population compared to district averages. Of this total,
nearly 4,300 low-income people and nearly 10,500 minorities would receive service improvements.
At the systemwide level, equity routes and non-equity routes1 were compared only for those with major
service changes. The one bus route with major service increases serves slightly below-average lowincome and minority populations and is not classified as an equity route.

In review of the proposed Route 40 changes at the systemwide level, there is a potential disparate
impact finding.
An analysis of all district block groups and their service levels was conducted to establish the baseline equity
thresholds for low-income and minority populations and to determine the systemwide magnitude of impacts of
the May 2024 to September 2024 service change. Block groups with low-income and minority populations at
or above the district average are referred to in this analysis as “equity” block groups whereas on-low-income
and non-minority block groups are referred to as “non-equity” block groups.

Network Analysis Process
Determine block groups at/above district averages for low-income population (14.2%) and minority
population (37.5%).
Determine which block groups experienced service changes of 25% or more.
Of block groups with a major service change, compare the difference in population for equity versus nonequity block groups; if the difference is more than 10%, review for potential adverse impacts.

There are 2,197 block groups defined as being wholly within or mostly within the District.2 Using the 2018-2022
5-Year ACS Estimates, total population residing within these block groups was calculated as well as the total
minority population and total low-income population, calculated separately, to determine the District-wide lowincome and minority rates which set the thresholds for which block groups are classified as above average.
While the percent minority figure of 37.5% was derived by using the base population of the service area (3.064
million), the low-income population percentage of 14.2% is derived from a slightly smaller population figure
(3.02 million). This is due to the smaller population whose poverty status the Census Bureau can determine.3
The thresholds summarized in Table 4 yielded 824 (37.5% of all) block groups above the district average for
low-income population, and 846 (38.5%) block groups above the district average for minority population.

Based on existence of the route within the May 2024 network and the population within a quarter mile of bus stops or
rail stations. 2018-2022 5-Year ACS estimates were used for population identification.
2
Some block groups are not completely contained within district boundaries due to differences in boundaries between the
District and Census-defined geographies.
3
The total population whose poverty status is determinable/assessed is lower than the estimate of total population due to
the inability of the Census to determine income for everyone estimated to reside in a particular block group.

The proposed major service changes were examined in aggregate by transit mode to determine overall impacts
to underlying population. Table 6 summarizes the change in service for total block group populations underlying
the bus stops with proposed major service increases proportionally compared to population in the District. There
are no proposed service decreases. The comparison reviews the equity composition of those who may be
impacted by proposed service changes compared to the overall equity composition of the District overall. For
the proposed runboard, systemwide service increases mirror the route analysis for Route 40 due to the Route
40 being the sole major service change.
No major service changes (longer than 12 months) were proposed for rail services with the September 2024
runboard.

For system-level service changes (service increases solely on Route 40), minority populations stand to
benefit less than non-minority populations (1.37% vs. 1.74%, respectively). This difference falls below
the disparate impact threshold of 1.56%. Therefore, a system-level disparate impact finding is found with the
proposed major service increase. Low-income populations stand to benefit slightly less than non-lowincome populations (1.57% vs. 1.62%, respectively). The difference does not fall below the 10%
disproportionate burden threshold of 1.46%. Therefore, no system-level disproportionate burden is found with
the proposed major service increase.
Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the locations of above average low-income and minority block groups within the

40 serves populations in east Denver close to but below district averages for minority and low-income

Summary of Findings
The systemwide service modifications proposed between May 2024 and September 2024 include schedule
adjustments, suspension of school trips, changes to fall/winter schedules and trip availability and additional
service. The sole major service change proposed for this runboard was for service increases on Route 40.
Route-level Findings:
•
•

Of the 38 total services with proposed changes, taken individually, one had a potential finding
Route 40 has a potential disparate impact finding due to minority populations receiving 0.15% less
benefit than non-minority populations. Low-income populations benefited 0.02% less than non-lowincome populations but the difference did not meet the disproportionate burden threshold

Systemwide-level Findings:

•

Route 40 comprises the September 2024 runboard’s only major service change
Almost 31,000 people live near Route 40 bus stops. Both minority and low-income populations are
represented at slightly lower shares of the population than district averages (34% and 14%,
respectively). Low-income populations received a slightly lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-low-income populations. Low-income areas benefited 0.02% less
compared to non-low-income areas. However, this difference did not fall below the disproportionate
burden threshold. Minority populations received a lower benefit (were less positively
impacted) compared to non-minority populations. Minority areas benefited 0.15% less compared
to non-minority areas. This difference fell below the disparate impact threshold; therefore, a systemlevel disparate impact was found with the proposed change
When considering the proposed service increase on Route 40 for the nearly 50,000 people within the
block groups that include the route’s stops and as a proportion to the district overall, minority
populations stand to benefit less compared to non-minority populations. Minority population
areas received 0.37% less of a benefit compared to non-minority areas. The difference was below the
disparate impact threshold by 0.19%; therefore, a potential systemwide disparate impact was
found. Low-income populations received 0.05% less of a benefit than non-low-income
populations. The difference was 0.11% above the threshold for a potential disproportionate burden;
therefore, no potential disproportionate burden was found with the proposed service decrease

Next Steps for Potential Disparate Impacts and Disproportionate Burden Findings
Given a potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative
that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact. Otherwise, RTD will either:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential disparate impacts/disproportionate
burdens, or
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority riders or disproportionate burden on
low-income customers but would still accomplish the project or program goals
Alterations to the initially proposed September 2024 service changes4 include an improvement in service levels
along Route 40 which serves low-income populations at a below average rate than as the District average.
RTD recommends keeping the September 2024 service plan as proposed as there are no practical alternatives
to avoid, minimize or mitigate the disparate impact (Route 40). The substantial legitimate justification for the
Route 40 service improvement follows RTD Board approval of the System Optimization Plan (SOP) which
recommends frequent service levels along the entire Route 40 corridor between 40th and Colorado Station and
Southmoor Station. Moreover, the improvement also ensures there is a Collective Bargaining Agreement
compliant restroom at each terminal. Thus, providing the substantial legitimate justification for the service
improvement.
Additionally, the overall potential benefits to customers of the proposed overall service plan are significant with
a large benefit to minority and low-income customers. Specifically, a total of 5 of the 6 minor changes (of the
38 service changes, just those routes with non-cost-neutral impacts to hours) are considered low-income-serving
bus routes and a total of 2 out of 6 are considered minority-serving bus routes. Other minor changes include
improvements to on-time performance for 15 bus routes, reinstatement of fall/winter tripper service on 8 routes,
3 individual implementations of the SOP, and 4 changes related to finalization of the Downtown Rail Replacement
Project.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2024 Service Change

July 24, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
July 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the September 2024 Service Change as revised and summarized in
Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators impacted by the service changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager, Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In alignment with the service change and work shift process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union 1001 (ATU), the September
2024 service change process facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new
work assignments and for Service Development staff to adjust the operations plan for RTD’s transit
network.
Many service changes recommended for September 2024 restore rail service levels and patterns to the
Central and Southeast corridors, with the Coping Panel Project and Phase One of the Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project anticipated to be completed. Changes to bus service to maintain access to the
Central Business District are also contained herein.
DISCUSSION
These recommendations include a mix of service improvements, reductions, and adjustments aimed at
addressing system network reliability, increasing seasonal school-related capacity, and restoring service
to the Central and Southeast Corridors with the conclusion of current rail reconstruction efforts.
Notable changes include the restoration of service levels on the E and H lines upon the Coping Panel
Project’s completion and the discontinuation of suspensions and detours on the Central Corridor. Rail
services on the D and H Lines will resume the regular pattern on the Central Corridor’s Downtown Loop.
L Line service, which was suspended with Phase One of the Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, will
be restored. Additionally, bus service on the Free MetroRide will be discontinued as five-minute service
frequency returns on the Free Mall Ride. Finally, the removal of bus detours downtown and the
restoration of Central Corridor rail services, enable Route 0 Limited midday service to be discontinued.

Packet Pg. 48

1.D.2

The September 2024 Service Changes are directed at improving on-time performance, maintaining CBA
compliance with, and adjusting service levels to match ridership demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on RTD Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit-dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the district and family of services, and the ability to
• enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
• national origin; also there is no disparate impact on a minority population nor a disproportionate
• burden on a low-income population
• Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

A summary of the service proposals, provided below, are detailed in Attachment A.
Summary of Public Outreach
Between May 15 and June 28, 2024, staff reached out to the community via public meetings, civic and
non-profit organizations and direct contact efforts at bus stops and rail stations. Additionally, an updated
feedback process was employed to collect customer input by impacted route or line. Written
communications, survey data and public comments collected during this public comment period have
been summarized and listed in Attachment C of this report.
Revisions to Preliminary Modifications
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service modifications are communicated to the Board. Depending on the outcome of the
public comment process and continued analysis, staff may recommend additional revisions to these
initial modifications. The following modifications have been added or significantly revised:
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron/Orchard Parkway: schedule adjustments aimed at improving on-time
performance on weekdays.
Longmont Routes (323, 324, 326, 327, BOLT, LD)/ 8th and Coffman Park-n-Ride (PnR) Closure
Due to reconstruction of Coffman Street, between 1st Ave and 9th Ave, related to CO 119 Bus Rapid
Transit (BRT) corridor construction, the current Park-n-Ride at 8th and Coffman is closed, and service for
routes BOLT, LD, 323, 324, 326 and 327 have been relocated to Bross Street and 8th Avenue as of
Sunday, May 26, 2024.
Light Rail Maintenance
Due to ongoing preventative maintenance inspections of the rail network along both the Southeast and
Southwest Corridors, and corresponding protocols involving reduced operating speeds, schedule
adjustments are recommended for the D, E, H, and R lines. Additionally, the increased service levels

Packet Pg. 49

1.D.2

planned for the E and H lines are recommended to be set at 30 minutes, rather than 15 minutes on each
line, to better match available workforce resources to support schedule adherence.

Please do a survey to learn how many more people commute between LoDo and Littleton
(former C line) versus central downtown Denver and Littleton (D line). The C Line was
wellused before the pandemic and it could be again.
I work next to union station. When the D line loops at California and Stout I have to walk up
to catch the train. Which adds 20 plus minutes to my commute. If I try to catch the E at
Union Station and it is delayed or doesn’t run that means I am behind catching a D at
Broadway. If the D is also delayed or doesn’t run my commute can extend to 2 hours. RTD is
unreliable. Please reinstate the C line.
Please bring back the train from mineral to union station. Being able to ride it during the
detour is convenient. Having to transfer to the E line is terrible because the E line is constantly
behind schedule or running with reduced service.
Many families here in Littleton were negatively impacted when the C line was discontinued.
The straight shot from Mineral to Union Station without a 20 minute wait in between was of
ideal. The most recent D line detour was reminiscent of those times so we have used RTD as
it’s much easier than driving. It’s unfortunate that there won’t be a straight shot without a
layover after the update. It will definitely defer us from using RTD.

E Line:
• I am in favor of restoring 15-minute frequency to E line. Please implement this change.
• It is great that frequencies are being restored on this line, but this should not be classified as a
service improvement but rather a service restoration. 15 minute frequencies are also the bare
minimum for rapid transit, and service should be further increased to 10 minutes or more, in
accordance with the SOP.
• The train leaves every hour now and it’s terrible. Please restore e line to 15 mins , at least 30
mins minimum during construction /maintenance
• Return of 15 minute frequencies is very desirable.
• I would rather you change to every 30 minutes if you don't have the staff to cover trains every
15 minutes. To me I would rather see consistency and less trains than cancelations due to
capacity of train operators.
• Please do this it would make my life and every other regular commuter on the E lines life so
much easier
• Is there a plan in place to ensure enough operators are hired, trained, and available to actually
meet the 15-minute scheduled frequency? Prior to the disruptive rail maintenance, this was an
ongoing issue that caused actual service to be between 15 and 45 minute frequencies due to
operator shortages. Additionally, if the coping panel repairs are completed early, will service
restoration also be moved up ahead of the 9/15 date?
• Reduce airport fare. $10 to get to the airport is expensive. More than Chicago or Seattle. And
both of those cities have much more extensive and useful rail systems out of their airports.
• Almost every time I've ridden the E line I've had trains not show up when they're supposed to.
• I would stopped using when service went to hourly and will look to go back to commuting 3-4
days a week…if you can find a way for times/drivers are more reliable and consistent. More
then a few times I would show up and train was cancelled or I would sit on train at a full stop
for 10+ minutes. I use to get to work in lone tree but can not use if not reliable.

If this actually happens, it will be better. Rtd isn't known for its reliability, however, so I won't
be even remotely surprised should this not happen. Rtd can promise the trains will run more
frequently, but will inevitably cancel dozens of runs a day.
Makes using the light rail worth it again for my household

H Line:
• I drive to Southmoor to get the rail because the Illiff station is full of drug users and homeless
and I’m afraid to be there. Also no parking.
• I have completely stopped using Rtd this summer and have switched to driving every time I go
downtown. Routing H train to downtown again will be wonderful, but will make us all even
angrier than we already are right now if you don't also fix all the 10mph delays with unreliable
schedules. Don't create a train schedule based on hypothetical 55mph speeds. Create the new
train schedule using actual 10mph speeds of this issue won't be fixed by September.
• Increasing the frequency again will be a relief! I've had to make a lot of alternate
arrangements for my commute and am looking forward to the Fall.
• I am really looking forward to the restoration of service and route adjustment.
R Line:
• Please keep R line service at 4am. Just one northbound train from Lincoln Station will make a
big difference.
• Ideally, connections from R Line to A Line both airport bound and Ridgegate bound will be
improved. Currently, airport bound is pretty good, although on the tight side (connections can
be missed). Ridgegate bound is on the longer side.
• I strongly urge you to consider increasing the R line frequency to 15 minutes and extending
service to Ridgegate Parkway. As more development has been established within Aurora city
limits, there has been a steady increase in ridership. However, all riders are facing trip
cancelations leading to 60+ minutes of additional wait times for the next train. I understand
that you are facing an operator shortage and allocating resources is vital for you, but from a
rider's perspective, having to wait 15 minutes for the next train after a cancelled trip feels less
of an inconvenience than having to wait at least a half hour for the next train. Also a one seat
ride from Aurora to say Sky Ridge makes lives a lot better through connections.

W Line:
• Thank you, thank you, thank you!
• This increase in service on the W Line will better support my schedule and provide me with
more travel options to JeffCo. I fully support it. Thank you.
• The W line is my first and last transit to and from my house. I work at the airport and also ride
the A line. When it's time to head home I am in the time frame when the A line has decreased
the schedule. By the time I arrive at the W line I am waiting for 30 minutes +, before the next
train comes in. Having the train run every 15 minutes would help cut my commute time
greatly. I stand behind the changes.

The W has had seen so much neglect since covid. It's nice to see that some attention is being
put on riders. Now if you can get more police on the system and check fares, that would be
great.
Absolutely change it to every 15minutes for a train. Currently, if a train is cancelled, a person
has to wait a full hour for the next one? Weekends, too!!
As I sometimes drive to the Oak station to get better head times, this change may induce me
to go to the Jeffco Center instead, and thereby cut GHG.
When the W line switched to every 30 minutes, we stopped using it because the wait
were too variable and long.
I will use it more frequently to travel to downtown from Golden with increased frequency.
I would be very grateful for this change! I ride the W from Jeff Co Government Station to get
to work, and the 15-minute frequency would make the commute much more convenient and
less stressful - and potentially encourage others to make more use of the service (especially
now that the City of Golden has a transit service to take you from town to the W line).
Public transportation works best if it is convenient and this change gives more convenience to
jump on the W Line.
While the change does not personally impact me, it very strongly impacts people around me.
Please restore 15-minute service, and while you’re at it, extend the G line to Goosetown
Station in Golden. Doing so would improve public transit in Golden tremendously. Thank you!
I believe the level of service should be decided by level of use and demonstrated community
needs, not idealistic visions of utopia.
If the train comes more often, it’s easier to use
When visitors come, particularly during the winter, it can be a challenge to drive to DIA for
pickups due to traffic or inclement weather. The light rail is a big help, but not if you are
waiting around in the rain, wind or cold for the next train.
I think it's important to have 15-minute frequency on the W-Line from Golden.
Please restore the 15 minute service to Golden.
It would be very helpful to me to have more frequency on the W line--especially when I am
connecting to the Airport Line. Thank You
W line provides transport for Golden students going to Lakewood High and Golden residents
commuting to downtown Denver. Adding the additional frequency allows Golden residents to
catch the W line using the Ore Cart or biking to the station, rather than having to drive or
catch a ride to the Federal Center
Reducing the frequency of service would negatively affect me and ny willingness o use the rail
line.
the next evolution in W-line service is an express from either Oak St Station or the Federal
Center. I can currently ride my bike faster to downtown than the train.
Would love more regular trains for commuting!
Increased frequency equals increased use.
I currently never consider talked the light rail due to infrequent service. Additional service
would make it an option for me and would all more access to the city for those without
vehicles.

Route 0/0B:
• I am optimistic, but concerned about this service change, specifically the truncation of route 0
and the introduction of 0B. It is a good idea to separate the line into two separate buses, as
often the 0 is 10 or 15 minutes delayed by the time it gets to Littleton. Additionally, the new
routing through Highlands Ranch is better than the previous. What is critical to the success of
a new route 0B is maintaining or improving upon a 30 minute headway and timing connections
well at Englewood station with both route 0 and the D line. If service is reduced on 0B to only
every 60 minutes, it will effectively kill what is one of the best transportation options for those
in Englewood, Littleton, and Highlands Ranch. But if headways stay at 30 minutes, or
preferentially become every 20 or 15 minutes, then the 0B will be worthwhile. Additionally, to

make it the best route possible, its northbound termination at Englewood should coincide with
the departures of route 0 and the D line and the transfer with route 66 should be optimized.
I support this adjustment to the route. It allows me to take the bus to my job.
I would expect this and other route splitting to cost RTD ridership. As I understand it, people
going from downtown to south of Englewood will now have to transfer, which takes time and
requires standing in the weather. Personally, if I can't get somewhere without a transfer, I
usually drive.
I would only support this if the frequency of the proposed 0B route was maintained at 15
minute intervals. Reducing service to every 30 minutes would only harm communities and
businesses in South Denver and Englewood. As you'll recall, a similar service reduction has
already impacted the southern branch of the 12 route, which runs only every 30 minutes. The
existing 0 route, which still runs every 15 minutes, is the only alternative option residents in
Englewood and South Denver have remaining.
muchas gracias!

Route 11:
• Increased frequencies are great, but I do not use this route to get to school, and frequencies
remain low on off-peak and weekend periods, especially later at night.
Route 24:
• I think this route should be on a 30 minute interval as it would be better for light rail
connections as well as serving DU students and those wanting to take the bus to Cherry Creek
North, Botanical Gardens, City Park, Southglenn, etc. Also I would be in favor of a route 25 or
25L that runs along South University between Englewood Station and C-470 University, or
wherever it could connect with a 402L, to provide more transportation to parts of Centennial
and Highlands Ranch from Englewood without having to wait on route 66 from Broadway and
Littleton.

Increased frequencies are amazing! More evening and weekend service would be helpful
though.
"Mornings through evenings" is vague, so I would like to submit my plea that it run more
frequently from at least 7 am to 8 pm, please. I work as a public librarian, so we do not work
standard 9-5 hours in order to serve the public. I would also love a Limited for the 40! This
route currently takes 3 times longer by bus than it would to drive--the increased frequency will
be massively helpful for reducing my wait time between connections; a Limited service would
be incredible. Thank you for considering!
great you are looking into better public transportation
I am glad that the 40 bus will be coming every 15 minutes on weekdays, however, I also wish
that it was on the weekends too because I would ride the 40 more.
El pasaje está caro
Igual nada cambia
Mejor para mi trabajo
I think it’s a good idea

Route 51:
• Now we must put up with the younger generation and their disrespectful nature. And the sad
reality that NOONE WILL CHECK THEM ON THEIR BEHAVIOR and we all suffer from poor....
correction - the lack of parental control, corrective action and inability to beat some damn
sense into these little bastard/assholes!
Route 65:
• Increased frequencies are good, but more service on weekends and off-peak times would be
helpful, as they are extremely low on this route.
• So glad RTD is providing school year service from the Central Park Station to the Sandoval
Campus that aligns with Northfield High School bell times! Thank you!
Route 93L:
• As a rider who lives near the 93L, I have spent more time wishing I could be able to use the
route, rather than actually using it. One of the biggest inhibitors is the poor connection to the
N line at Thornton Crossroads/104th Station. I would find myself at best sprinting to/from the
platform to make my connection, or at worst, opting to transfer to the 120X at Thornton
Parkn-ride as I watch the southbound N line pull away from the station, while the bus is
pulling into the driveway. Improving connections to the N line will definitely sway me to using
the 93L more often. On a side note, increasing the service span to 5 am to 10 pm would be
the other factor that would get me on board more often.

Slightly more frequent buses that run a bit later through the night would help make the bus
the best way to get to the airport by far
I would love to be able to take later flights home and still make the bus
More late night service and more-frequent-than-hourly runs on the weekends would be a huge
benefit!! The exact timing of the bus arriving at the airport would be less impactful if there
were more arrival times to choose from.
Add late night AB service back!
I'd like Route AB to extend to Boulder Junction to aid in folks including myself living around
Junction place accessing the route without having to take Uber/Lyft to downtown. Also, the
frequency of AB buses leaving from the airport needs to be increased to more than 1 per hour.
There are often 2-3x as many riders as seats for times where the bus only comes every hour.
The buses are often full to the point where riders who board at flatiron have to stand for 35
minutes at speeds of 75 mph. This doesn’t seem safe. Increasing frequency beyond the two
hours in morning and evening where you run every 30 minutes might be in order - esp during
peak travel seasons. The good news - the bus is VERY popular
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. On a regular basis,
busses are completely full to capacity. People are forced to stand for the hour-long trip, due to
a lack of frequent service from the 3rd largest airport in the US. It is necessary to run more
frequent service on this route.

Please increase frequency of service - hourly service is not sufficient in this high-population
area, and busses are often over capacity. Additionally, the last bus from the airport is
exceptionally early. I have had flight delays which left me stranded at DIA.
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route really doesn't meet the needs in terms of
capacity, frequency, or coverage (particularly later in the day). On a regular basis, buses are
over capacity and people are required to stand for the hour-long trip, due to a lack of frequent
service from the 3rd largest airport in the US. Additionally, many flights do not arrive until well
after the last bus has left for the day and alternatives have only gotten more expensive and
less available over the past few years. Having reliable AB service is really important to so
many groups (residents and visitors alike). Please bring back additional service. The need is
greater now than ever and the service is not even where it was a few years back.
More frequent buses would be tremendously helpful. There are times that I wasn’t able to get
on the bus at the airport due to capacity. A bus every 30 minutes would reduce the wait time
and make bus travel to and from Boulder/DIA much more efficient.
Higher bus frequency (every 30 mins) has the side benefit of trivializing many delays.
The experience of riding the AB is horrible due to the low frequency of buses vs the high
demand. Long, disorganized lines form at DIA and people budge, plus the bus fills up so
people have to stand the entire ride or get rejected from boarding. On the way to the airport,
the bus takes forever to load since there are so many people waiting at each stop and the bus
ends up full so people have to stand. Going to and from the airport on the AB1 is the most

stressful and miserable part of my travel experience any time that I have to fly. This is not
going to encourage people to use public transport!
The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. The last bus is too
early, the first bus of the day is too late, and it is necessary to run more frequent service on
this route. If it consistently ran every 20 or 30 minutes then people could truly rely on the
service.

The current level of service on the AB1 bus route is simply unacceptable. This is an amazing
route in theory but cannot be relied upon given its current infrequency of buses. Increase bus
service to every 30 minutes and I would gladly use the bus more often. But for early flights
when the bus only comes every 1 hour, it is hard to rely on.
We need thirty minute service and a serious increase in service on holiday weekends. People
standing or not fitting in the bus deters then from ever riding again. It's crazy under staffed on
holidays
We always use the AB route to get from Boulder to the airport and back, the last 6 months
have been unreliable and crowded. It is often completely full and sometimes passengers are
not able to board. Since there is less flexibility in air travel, it makes it less appealing to use
this route at all. Making the schedule more reliable and more often would be appreciated and
meet the demand.
Please increase frequency and on-time performance. It is such a useful service. I use it for
work trips. I park at work and take this bus to the airport. However it is so frustrating when
the bus is full or if missed. In would be great Sid it was every 30 min
Increase hours of service. Late night and early morning flights sometimes cannot be
accommodated with the current schedule. Please look into expanding schedule times.
Please increase AB frequency. I know RTD despises Boulder and Broomfield, but the current
buses are at capacity every single time…
The minor adjustments to help o time performance is great. But please add more times! The
bus is always full. It’s hard to know when it’s coming at DIA because the real time tracking is
rarely accurate there. Thank you!

BOLT:
• Having more frequent buses during rush hour (busses coming every 15 minutes in the
mornings and afternoons) would help 1) riders have more flexibility to arrive to their
workplace at their scheduled start times and 2) give riders more space on the bus. In the
afternoon Bolt bus for 4:07pm during school season, many students ride the Bolt after school
at the Downtown Boulder Station (northbound) to reach another part of Boulder. They most
likely switch between the 204 and the Bolt depending on which is more convenient to use in
16

the moment. When they ride at 4:07pm Bolt bus (northbound), the bus is usually completely
full by the time it reached stops on 28th street, leaving many riders standing in the aisle until
students get off further down the routine in Boulder. An overloaded bus doesn't seem safe, so
breaking the schedule into 15 minute increments could prevent this.

MetroRide:
• The freeMetroRide is a vital form of transportation throughout Downtown and is more than
just a support for the MallRide. It is a way to quickly reach one end of downtown to the other
without having to stop at each block. Furthermore, since it was a part of FasTracks, taxpayers
are expecting service that they paid for to remain especially since the infrastructure and buses
for the MetroRide have been sitting around ever since.
• The free metroride is helpful for getting to work on time. The bus is very clean and efficient
compared to other routes to use for downtown office commuters. Even peak travel service
would be useful in the morning and afternoon commute periods.
• Increasing the frequency on the Mall Ride to five minutes is better than continuing the Metro
Ride.
• As somebody who regularly commuter between Civic Center and Union Station, the Free
Metroride has definitely my favorite way to get between the two, as it feels the fastest, and it
stops in the Union Station bus concourse making it way easier for me to transfer to other
busses such as the FF or the LD. It's also backwards on your system optimization plan, as it
promises to bring back the FMR. Please if possible keep the FMR running, and make the
sacrifice of keeping the Mallride at 10 min headways, which currently doesn't even run along
16th Street mall at the moment, do at least until the mall reopens keep the FMR.
• I STRONGLY urge you continue operations on the Free MetroRide at least until the 16th Street
Mall construction is completed. As it stands now, the Free MallRide is an insufficient transit
option to reach the core of downtown with it's spaced out stops, and operations on 15th and
17th street. To increase service to 5 minutes while cutting out a needed and honestly quicker
connection between Union Station and Civic Center Station would not be a wise decision. The
MetroRide also provides a needed connection to the northern downtown area and I've noticed
a decent amount of workers boarding and alighting during peak hours. What this route needs
is improved regional connections, like increased E and H line frequencies, and the D, H, and L
lines returning to central downtown to support and boost ridership on the FMR. Please
consider continuing service on this route and the MallRide at 10 minute frequencies and the
addition of more frequent LRT service will booster better connections within the downtown
area.
• This service provides a way for people north of Coors Field to get downtown for work, events
and entertainment. There are very few routes from this area to get downtown on a frequent
basis by using public transportation. So driving or not going is what happens when this is not
available. I used to take it for work and other errands.
• Keep the mall ride at reduced schedule to keep the MetroRide!

Please don’t discontinue MetroRide! I have loved being able to quickly and efficiently get from
DUS to Civic Center this summer. It’s so much faster than MallRide and a lot cleaner. It’s
commuters getting to the Capitol area. It’s highly used too.
I am disappointed that you cut
so much service during the pandemic and then have not restored it. Having the MetroRide this
summer has been a bright spot. Please maintain. Thanks!
The MetroRide provides far more convenient service to Coors Field and Union Station than the
MallRide does, especially for those of us that work in Uptown. I would strongly ask that RTD
keep both buses’ schedules the same at this time.
The MetroRide is the only decent way to get from Union Statiom to the south end of
downtown. The mall bus is extremely slow (you can literally walk faster) and isn’t a great
environment (homeless, drug users, etc.) for professional commuters.
Can you please keep the Free MetroRide? Before the pandemic it only ran in the morning
during peak hours and afternoon during peak hours. It is the only good route for commuters
that ride RTD into Denver Union Station. It has fewer stops than the Free MallRide and
frankly is cleaner a more professional ridership.
The only better option would be to bring
back the Sheridan and 92nd bus that traveled directly to Civic Center. Again this Bus only ran
during morning and afternoon peak hours.

mentioned the limitations and anonymization of current data collection methods, but that
anecdotally (through operators, observations, and ridership on certain routes at certain

used for further data collection and analysis as part of the program and reporting.

Chris T: Had multiple questions and concerns regarding multiple bus routes and operator
procedures/conduct. First comment regarded the SB Route 35 stop at Dartmouth and
Raleigh (near the school) being clogged due to personal vehicles being parked/temporarily
located in the bus stop landing area (perhaps around school start/end times, but no time
was given as an example of when issue occurs). Voiced concern over three recent
instances of operators getting out of their seats to confront passengers (one on Route 51,
another on Route 15L, third incident Route N/A), said they confronted the operators in
each instance and made a customer care report to RTD the same day in each instance.

Jim Tegart: He lives in Littleton and rides the 0 to connect to the Route 6 to volunteer at
the Wings Over the Rockies Museum location in Aurora, and is concerned over the split of
the Route 0 into the Routes 0 and 0B at Englewood Station come the Sep24 runboard (as
this would force an additional transfer in both directions). Also asked about the old 0L
route which went to Southglenn, which he said would better meet the needs of
commuters. Dan responded that the 0-0B split was intended to improve on-time
performance for both routes by splitting them at Englewood Station, and indicated that
running times for both routes were designed to allow for timed transfers at Englewood
Station. Dan also mentioned that the 0L is intended to travel between Civic Center Station
and I-25/Broadway Station to improve connections between those two points and does
not intend to return old 0L routing to Southglenn. Jessie concurred with Dan’s statements.
Phil Clerner: Says he rides the D Line light rail and is very disappointed that RTD did not do
more to make its constituents aware of the impacts stemming from this summer’s
concurrent construction projects (mostly the speed restriction order). Wanted faster
response times due to this impending issue and asked if there would be assurances made
so that the lack of communication would not be repeated in the future. Jessie on behalf of
RTD apologized for the lack of communication and mentioned that RTD uses a variety of
banners and service alerts on the website/app to make riders aware of service
changes/disruptions and to keep an eye on the website for more information as the
projects progress.
Jackson Ledesma: Jackson had multiple comments, questions, and complaints (some of
which are in the written notes – please refer to the written comments for more
information). His first question was a concern over the potential need to add blocks to
either/both of the new 0/0B to ensure headways (using the example of the Routes 7 and
12 split and the subsequent need to add blocks to keep service headways). Dan said that
no blocks would need to be added at this time but mentioned that an additional block
could be added later if needed. Jackson’s second question was about guaranteed
(protected) transfers at Englewood Station between the 0 and 0B. Dan mentioned that
running times had been adjusted to improve timeliness of transfers between the routes.
Third question voiced confusion over why the ‘0B’ was chosen as the name of the
southern portion of the existing 0 route for the 0-0B split given that it sounds like a
spur/branch number, and that this designation may not be self-explanatory for riders as a
unique route. Dan and Jessie explained that the existing Route 0 number limited RTD’s
options for naming the new route, so RTD ultimately went with 0B. Fourth question asked
about the potential use of articulated 60-foot buses on the 0B. Dan said that RTD is

recently asked them to turn the radio down while sitting on the bus near the operator’s
seat. Made compliments about light rail station cleanliness in recent time and the RTD bus
operators who have gone above and beyond in their line of work to make the lives of
passengers easier. Jessie thanked them for voicing the operator concerns and for sending
in customer care complaints in a timely manner and thanked them for the compliments and
suggestions.

looking into the use of articulated 60-foot buses on the 0B but mentioned that there might
be logistics issues involved since private contractor garages do not currently have capacity
for articulated bus storage and maintenance. Fifth question regarded the return of
improved frequency on the Free 16th St. Mall Shuttle and Free MetroRide services in
downtown Denver at the end of the seasonal summer construction work for the
downtown rail replacement project. Sixth question regarded school trippers on the Route
51 still appearing on May24 traincards (operator schedule) even though school is not in
session for summer break. Seventh question was if the Route 38 would be terminating at
the new Lutheran Hospital at Clear Creek Crossing in Wheat Ridge instead of at Wheat
Ridge/Ward Station. Dan said that the route change is intended per the construction of a
compliant landing area by the developer at the intended site. Eighth question was about
the possible increase of headways or the use of articulated 60-foot buses on the Route 16
due to existing ridership congestion. Dan mentioned that RTD has run safety checks on
the route with articulated buses and said that articulated buses may be put into use on the
Route 16 in the near future. Jackson also wrote down additional suggestions which have
been added to the service change record.
Brian Hernan: Asked about what RTD is doing to expand rail/rapid bus service along the
C470 corridor/generally expand services throughout the Denver Metro area. Wants
improved connections to entice drivers out of their vehicles and onto transit. Jessie said
that it is difficult to implement new service to all regions of the Denver Metro area at this
time given shifts in commuter habits stemming from the Pandemic and available
budget/operator counts. However, he also insisted that the RTD is committed to improving
service throughout the district and continually searches for avenues to positively impact
the overall customer experience.

Dr. Ramming wanted to know about why the Free Metro Ride is being suspended in
September after just being brought back in May. It was explained that the FMR was a
temporary measure to address the reduction of rail service during the Downtown Rail
Replacement Project. Dan Merritt explained that the frequency of the Mall Ride was
reduced to provide operators for the Free MetroRide. It was also stated that other
customers would like to see the Free Mall Ride returned to higher service levels with the
completion of Phase One of DRRP.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Language Access Plan Update

July 24, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Director, Civil Rights Division
Dani McLean, Transit Equity Specialist
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Executive Order 13166, and United States
Department of Transportation Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Implementing Guidance, the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) is committed to ensuring its diverse community of customers, residents,
and visitors can effectively participate in or benefit from its transit services and programs regardless of
race, color or national origin. Importantly, this means that RTD is responsible for taking reasonable steps
to provide customers of LEP with meaningful access to its services, facilities and programs. Those with
LEP are defined by the federal government as persons whose primary language is not English and who
have a limited ability to read, write, speak or understand English (referred herein as “linguistically
diverse”). RTD is committed to providing language assistance not only to comply with federal law and
guidance, but also to uphold its own principle of equitably providing public transportation services to all
who reside in and visit the Denver metro region.
Language Access Plan Requirements
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides recipients of federal financial
assistance (including RTD) with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI regulations to ensure
grantees provide meaningful language access to linguistically diverse persons. Specifically, Chapter III
Part 9 of this Circular directs FTA recipients and sub-recipients to:
1. Conduct a Four-factor Analysis to determine the language assistance needs of the
linguistically diverse persons RTD is likely to serve
2. Develop a Language Access Plan (LAP) to guide action toward improving language access
3. Provide appropriate language assistance by implementing the action items listed in the LAP
DISCUSSION
2022-2025 LAP Progress Update
RTD’s most recent LAP was published as part of the 2022-2025 Title VI Program Update and is
managed by the Transit Equity Office within the Civil Rights Division. The LAP outlines 38 individual
tasks for RTD to pursue in the 2022-2025 period to restore the agency’s commitment to language

Packet Pg. 127

1.E.1

access, clarify staff roles and responsibilities, and provide linguistically diverse customers with
meaningful access to the agency’s services, initiatives and programs. The complete LAP is included in
Attachment A.
Implementation Calendar and Status
As of June 1, 2024, all LAP tasks were, at a minimum, started. More specifically, of the 38 tasks, 28
(74%) are complete or “ongoing (complete),” and 10 (26%) of the tasks are in progress.
“Complete” refers to tasks that have been achieved, with an end product or result, and are not ongoing.
“In progress” refers to all tasks that are in the process of being completed but have not yet achieved the
desired outcome. “Ongoing (Complete)” refers to tasks for which a process or product has been
successfully produced or implemented but that do not have a specific end product or result, with the
related activities typically occurring on an ongoing basis. For purposes of this report, these activities are
considered complete.

CONCLUSION
As part of the most recent LAP, RTD has made considerable strides in strategizing and pursuing its
language access efforts, with 74% of the 2022-2025 LAP’s 38 tasks considered complete and the
remaining 26% in progress. These tasks do not represent a language access “ceiling” that RTD cannot
surpass but instead a foundational “floor” upon which the agency can continue to improve. Specifically,
staff will ensure the 2025-2028 LAP will build upon the framework and associated tasks noted in the
2022-2025 LAP, providing better insight into the language needs of the Denver metro area (with a focus
on immigrant and refugee community members) while applying a more specific, measurable, attainable,
relevant, and time-bound task approach to improve clarity and measurability. Through its language
access and other efforts, RTD will continue to build a respectful, dignified, and welcoming transit
environment for all.

2022 Language Access Plan

Limited English Proficiency or Limited English Proficient (LEP): People with limited English proficiency
(LEP) are persons whose primary language is not English and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak or
understand English.
Meaningful access: Language assistance that results in accurate, timely and effective communication at no
cost to the LEP person. For LEP persons, meaningful access denotes access that is not unreasonably restricted,
delayed or inferior as compared to access to programs or activities provided to English proficient persons.
Vital Document: Paper or electronic material that is critical for accessing RTD’s services, programs and
activities or contains information about procedures and processes required by law. Classification of a document
as “vital” depends upon the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and the
consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not provided accurately or in a timely manner.
Effective communication: Sufficient communication to provide the LEP person with meaningful access to the
services that otherwise are available to the public.
Reasonable steps: Steps taken, or language assistance services provided, to ensure effective communication
with people limited in English (e.g., interpretation services).
Recipient: Any state, political subdivision of any state, or instrumentality of any state; public or private agency,
institution, organization, or other entity; or any individual, in any state, to whom federal financial assistance is
extended, directly or through another recipient.
Safe harbor: The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor
regarding the translation of written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each
eligible LEP language group has written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor
Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is
less) the population to be served.

Language Access Plan Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) Language Access Plan (LAP) is to document and
guide the actions that RTD has taken – and will take – to ensure meaningful access to RTD transit programs,
services and activities by people with limited English proficiency (LEP) in accordance with Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166.

2022 Language Access Plan

In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166, the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) is committed to ensuring its diverse community of residents, customers and visitors
can effectively participate in or benefit from its transit services and programs regardless of race, color or national
origin. Importantly, this means that RTD is also responsible for taking reasonable steps to provide customers of
limited English proficiency (LEP) with meaningful access to our services, facilities and programs.1 In some
circumstances, failure to ensure that people with LEP can meaningfully access federally assisted programs or
activities may constitute national origin discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. RTD, as a
recipient of federal financial assistance, has an obligation to reduce language barriers that inhibit meaningful
access by LEP persons to the agency’s services. Consequently, RTD is committed to providing language
assistance not only to comply with the requirements of Title VI, Executive Order 13166 and United States
Department of Transportation (USDOT) LEP Implementing Guidance but also to uphold its own principles of
equitably providing safe, reliable transportation to the community.
This document includes a Four Factor Analysis, as established by USDOT LEP Implementing Guidance, that
assesses the language assistance needs of LEP persons in RTD’s service area. The analysis found that, according
to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 227,262 of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area (close to
7% of the RTD service area population) speak English “less than very well.” Further, approximately 378,376
persons, or 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born; and 646,021 persons, over
19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other than English at home. Sixty-eight percent of
people with limited English proficiency are Spanish speakers, followed by Vietnamese (4.4%) and Chinese
(4.2%). Supplemented with data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) as well as other sources including
(but not limited to) Colorado state agencies, the analysis reveals 21 languages that qualify as safe harbor
languages. The focus of RTD’s language assistance measures will thus be on these languages.
Following the Four Factor Analysis, this document establishes RTD’s updated Language Access Plan (LAP) to
guide language assistance measures from 2022 to 2025. After an extensive review of the 2019 LAP, RTD’s LEP
inter-division comprised of Administration, Communications, Operations, Planning and Security recommended a
two-tiered approach to retain and expand upon past language assistance measures to better meet the needs of
people with limited English proficiency. The tiers are as follows:
•

Tier One: Successful Activities to Continue. Tier One will retain existing programs and activities
designed to meet the language needs of regional LEP populations, such as:
o
o
o

Telephone interpreters in virtually any language;
Multilingual printed materials and multilingual information on RTD’s website; and
Continuing development of partnerships with community organizations that serve LEP

populations.
Tier Two: Activities to Deepen our Focus. Tier Two identifies new areas to further the agency’s goal
of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs and services. These activities focus
on four primary areas:
1. Updating and monitoring the LAP: how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates the LAP.
This area of focus provides guidance for monitoring and compliance of the LAP, program research,
program administration and primary as well as secondary research to obtain feedback from LEP
populations.
2. Language assistance: how RTD provides language assistance services by language.
This area of focus relates to providing free language assistance for outreach documents and inperson services. It also guides the evaluation of which documents are vital for translation and the
format(s) that most effectively communicate the messages contained in those documents. Lastly,
this area guides how RTD will provide information through customer information channels as well
as conduct culturally responsive outreach.
3. Providing notice of language assistance: how RTD administers notice to LEP persons
about the availability of language assistance. This area of focus provides guidance for
providing notice of language assistance on outreach documents, on the system and providing
notice of the Title VI complaint process.
4. Training programs for personnel: how RTD trains employees to provide timely and
reasonable language assistance to LEP populations. This area of focus provides guidance
for the development of curriculum and the incorporation of LAP information into the employee
environment in order to prepare all front line and other relevant staff to effectively engage and
respond to LEP customers.

In pursuing this two-tiered approach to language access, RTD seeks to better mitigate language barriers that
could prevent LEP customers from accessing the agency’s transit programs and services. It is RTD’s intent that
this approach will allow the agency to more equitably serve the Denver metropolitan region’s diverse
communities, in turn enabling more customers the freedom to get where they want to go.

Introduction
As the Denver metropolitan region’s public transportation provider, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
committed to its residents, customers and visitors regardless of race, color or national origin. Importantly, this
means RTD is responsible for making reasonable accommodations and removing barriers to accessing those
services for individuals in protected classes – which include people with limited English proficiency (LEP). For
LEP persons, language can act as a barrier to accessing the benefits of RTD’s services, complying with
responsibilities such as payment or safety measures, or understanding other information regarding RTD’s
activities. A commitment to providing language assistance for those with LEP is thus not only required of RTD in

Legal Basis for Language Assistance Requirements
The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Federal Executive Order 13166 and the Department of Transportation's (USDOT)
LEP Guidance together require that agencies which receive federal funding, including RTD, must make
reasonable accommodations for LEP persons. At the core of these requirements is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., which provides that “no person in the United States shall, on the ground of
race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” While Title VI itself does not
explicitly include language as a protected class, the 1974 Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563
interpreted Title VI regulations to hold that Title VI prohibits conduct that has a disproportionate effect on LEP
persons, as such conduct would constitute national origin discrimination.
Later, on August 11, 2000, former President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to
Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” which requires recipients of federal financial assistance to
take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services, information and other important
portions of their programs and activities for LEP persons. On December 14, 2005, the U.S. Department of
Transportation published guidance for its recipients to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory
requirements.
To further assist transit agencies, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published the most current Circular
4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients” on October 1, 2012. Chapter III Part 9 of
this Circular directs FTA recipients (including RTD) and sub-recipients to:
1. Conduct a Four Factor Analysis;
2. Develop a Language Access Plan (LAP); and
3. Provide appropriate language assistance.
In fulfilling these criteria, transit agencies such as RTD must ensure they are striving to mitigate language
barriers to their programs and services. This report documents RTD's Four Factor Analysis and LAP describing
how RTD will continue to provide meaningful access to its transit services to people with LEP.
RTD’s Commitment to Equity: Progress Made in Language Access
RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be “the trusted leader in mobility,
delivering excellence and value to customers and community.” RTD recognizes the role that public transit plays
in achieving mobility for all people, in turn improving their connections to employment opportunities, recreational
activities, health care, housing, social programs and services, and more. For example, as part of its Reimagine
RTD project launched in 2019, RTD’s values are increasingly embracing concepts of transit equity, with an eye
towards providing meaningful access to high-quality public transportation services for a broad and progressively

order to comply with federal regulations, but it is also intrinsic to the transit agency’s mission, vision and values
to provide accessible public transportation to all.

Figure 1. RTD’s Six Guiding Principles Adopted by the Board in April 2021

As concrete evidence to RTD’s commitment to equity and language access, the agency launched its Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis in spring 2022. The study aims to examine RTD’s fares and explore changes to
its fare structure to make its services more equitable, simple and affordable. The agency is conducting the study
in response to customer feedback that RTD’s fares are expensive and complex – complexity that is made worse
when customers may not speak English proficiently. Working towards the desired goals of improved equity and
simplicity will include making RTD’s services more accessible to LEP persons; further, the study itself was
designed to be as supportive of language access as possible. For instance, RTD did the following:
•

Created the study survey in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese (the top four languages in RTD’s
service area);

•

Provided instructions for all safe harbor language customers to translate the English webpage into their
preferred languages;

•

Provided language assistance to participate in the study at no cost;

•

Conducted a customer and community meeting in Spanish; and

•

Worked with 6 multicultural community-based organizations to host focus groups with their constituents.

more diverse community. Improving the accessibility of RTD’s activities, programs and services via language
access is one key way to reduce mobility barriers for people with limited English proficiency, in turn making local
public transit more equitable for all.

1.E.1.a

2022 Language Access Plan

Historically, RTD has made strides to ensure meaningful access to public transportation for LEP persons.
However, as the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis illustrates, the agency can do more to attract
customers who would otherwise be excluded from utilizing services because of language barriers and, ideally,
encourage customers to continue using the system after they are proficient in English or may have more
transportation options.
LAP Monitoring and Updating
USDOT guidance states that recipients should (where appropriate) have a process for determining whether new
documents, programs, services and activities need to be made accessible for LEP persons; RTD does so as part
of its three-year cycle to monitor Title VI compliance and an ongoing basis as changing service area
demographics and service changes warrant. As such, RTD continually monitors demographic information and
engages with community organizations serving LEP persons to remain in tune with those in need of language
assistance.
With a burgeoning focus on equity, RTD sees much room to build upon its existing programs and activities
designed to serve LEP persons and is seeking to expand its historic approach to language access. Firstly, in
2021, RTD established a dedicated outreach program intended to further the implementation of language access
measures. This outreach program is housed in the Civil Rights Division and has a dedicated staff member, the
Transit Equity Specialist (LAP Coordinator), who is assigned to help develop the program, carry out the day-today tasks, coordinate across departments for agency-wide implementation and conduct outreach to LEP persons

and community-based organizations serving these populations. The program is overseen by the Transit Equity
Manager. Further, the Transit Equity Office in RTD’s Civil Rights Division assumed the responsibility to update
RTD’s LAP. Part of the update process included reconvening an inter-departmental workgroup to address federal
language access requirements for LEP populations, restore agency commitment to its language access program
and clarify staff roles and responsibilities. In March 2020, the Transit Equity Office selected staff members
throughout the agency in accordance with their position and asked them to participate in the update process.
Specifically, the workgroup aimed to:
1. Complete a needs assessment of LEP persons in the district. The Four Factor Analysis assessment
(see below) permitted Market Research and Transit Equity staff to identify high concentrations and
frequency of contact of LEP populations, to ascertain the nature as well as the importance of RTD services
and programs and to determine if there were language barriers limiting the access of LEP persons to
RTD services.
2. Develop the LAP, including its Guidelines Index and 2022-2025 Implementation Schedule.
This undertaking provides a framework for the provision of timely and reasonable language assistance
to those with limited English proficiency who access RTD’s services as well as a method to evaluate and
review the effectiveness of a LAP.
Staff members from the Transit Equity Office developed a work plan with designated tasks and timelines to help
the inter-departmental workgroup complete the LAP update in a timely manner. This process allowed for a
methodical, focused approach to the assessment; it also defined deliverables, assigned tasks and clarified roles
and responsibilities. The following Four Factor Analysis and updated LAP are products from that work.

Overview of the Four Factor Analysis
Per the USDOT LEP Guidance, transit providers must determine the language assistance needs of the LEP
persons they are likely to serve by utilizing a Four Factor Analysis. The assessment involves the following factors:
1.

The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by an RTD
program, activity or service;

2.

The frequency with which LEP persons interact with RTD programs, activities or services;

3.

The nature and importance of programs, activities or services provided by RTD to the LEP population;
and

4.

The resources available to RTD and overall cost to provide language assistance.

Attachment: Attachment A 2022-2025 RTD Language Access Plan (4962 : Language Access Plan Update)

RTD has conducted the Four Factor Analysis using a combination of market research resources which consists
of an evaluation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, engagement with RTD staff, consultation with Colorado
state agencies, consultation with community organizations and direct interactions with people limited in English
proficiency. The results of this analysis will be used as the criteria for the development of language assistance

Factor 1: Identification of LEP Persons in RTD
Service Area who Need Language Assistance
The first step in conducting the Four Factor Analysis is to assess the number or proportion of people with LEP
who are eligible to be served or encountered by RTD. The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) gives RTD a reliable baseline of the safe harbor languages2 within the RTD boundaries.3 According to the
ACS, of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area, approximately 227,262, close to 7% of the RTD service
area population, speaks English “less than very well.”4 The following points identify other notable findings from
the assessment of the number and proportion of LEP persons in the RTD service area:
•

Approximately 378,376 persons, 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born.5

•

Approximately 646,021 persons, over 19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other
than English at home.

•

North and Northeast Denver, East Lakewood and Northwest, North, and Northeast Aurora have the
highest concentrations of people with LEP, containing multiple census tracts with more than 2,000 LEP
persons.

American Community Survey (ACS)
The figures below display those LEP populations, by language, that meet the LEP safe harbor language threshold
(5% of the service area population or 1,000 people that are likely to be served by RTD, whichever is less). Spanish
is by far the most frequently spoken language at home other than English, accounting for more than 68% of
the LEP population. Excluding the grouped categories of “Other Asian/Pacific Island Languages” and “Other
Indo-European Languages,” the second- and third-most languages spoken at home are Vietnamese and Chinese
(comprising 4.4% and 4.2% of the LEP population, respectively).

2

The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor regarding the translation of
written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each eligible LEP language group has
written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for
language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is less) the population to be served.
3
RTD estimated district boundaries using the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates at the Census Tract
level. RTD analyzed all Census Tracts required to include all 8 counties RTD has services in: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Weld Counties.

three most popular spoken languages other than English: Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese.67 This data
illustrates that the highest populations of all LEP speakers concentrate in North and Northeast Denver; East

To ascertain whether there are other potential language groups that meet the Safe Harbor Threshold using data
outside the ACS, RTD’s Market Research and Transit Equity Office conducted an analysis of Public Use Microdata
Sample (PUMS), Colorado Department of Education and Colorado Health Authority data as well.
PUMS supplements the ACS estimates and allows RTD to take a deeper dive into grouped ACS language
categories, such as African languages (e.g., Somali, Amharic). Consequently, in addition to Arabic, Chinese,
French, German, Korean, Russian, Spanish (Mexico), Tagalog and Vietnamese being considered as safe harbor
languages, PUMS data adds Amharic, Farsi (Persian), Hindi, Hmong, Japanese, Khmer (Cambodian), Laotian,
Nepali (Nepalese), Somali, Swahili, Telugu and Thai to the list.

In addition to considering the ACS and PUMS estimates, RTD’s Factor 1 analysis examined the most recent data
on the Student Language Spoken at Home from the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) for the 2020-2021
school year, which includes students ranging from kindergarten to high school. It is assumed that if children are
identified as speaking a language other than English at home, then their parents or adult guardians are likely to

While CDE data is largely in line with ACS and PUMS data regarding the top languages spoken by LEP persons,
Spanish accounts for an even larger percentage of the LEP population here. Additionally, Arabic replaces Chinese
as the third-most spoken language.

WIC data corroborates PUMS findings that Amharic, Nepali, Somali and Swahili should also be paid attention in
language assistance measures. It also found that two other languages that had not appeared in other data sets
– specifically, Burmese and Tigrinya – are spoken at WIC Clinics. However, given their low prevalence in ACS
and PUMS findings, RTD has omitted them from consideration of the current list of safe harbor languages.

From Factor 1 of RTD’s Four Factor Analysis, RTD can draw crucial conclusions about which languages should
be prioritized in language assistance measures and where such measures are most needed geographically. First
and foremost, Factor 1 allows RTD to establish a list of 21 safe harbor languages to guide language assistance.
These languages are (in alphabetical order):
1. Amharic

12. Laotian

2. Arabic

13. Nepali (Nepalese)

3. Chinese (Simplified)

14. Russian

4. Farsi (Persian)

15. Somali

5. French (European)

16. Spanish (Mexico)

6. German

17. Swahili

7. Hindi

18. Tagalog (Filipino)

8. Hmong

19. Telugu

9. Japanese

20. Thai

10. Khmer (Cambodian)

21. Vietnamese

11. Korean

These safe harbor languages can then be organized by tiers of relative need for translation or interpretation
services district-wide and reflect each language’s rank based on the average of all four data sources in Factor 1.

Ensuring that Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese – as the most common languages spoken by people with limited
English proficiency – receive attention when it comes to translation of vital documents, interpretation and other
language efforts is especially important. While RTD has done some work to provide assistance for Spanish
speakers, and resources such as telephone interpreters give support in other languages (see Language
Assistance Measures Employed by RTD for more detail), much work remains to expand upon Spanish language
access as well as establishing a more solid foundation in other languages.
Data from Factor 1 also allow RTD to most strategically pursue language assistance measures based on the
spatial concentrations of LEP populations. Transit routes and other activities located near high concentrations
of LEP (specifically, North and Northeast Denver; East Lakewood; and Northwest, North and Northeast Aurora)
warrant the most attention to language access.

Factor 2: Frequency of Contact with LEP Persons
by RTD Services
Following Factor 1, Factor 2 in the USDOT LEP Guidance requires RTD to assess, as accurately as possible, the
frequency with which the agency interacts with LEP persons from different language groups. The more frequent
the contact, the more likely enhanced language services will be needed. Consequently, the reasonable language
assistance measures that RTD takes to serve a rarely encountered LEP population (e.g., Ilocano) will be very
different than those taken for an LEP population that is encountered daily (e.g., Spanish).
To complete the Factor 2 assessment and understand the frequency of contact RTD has with people of limited
English proficiency, RTD conducted surveys with frontline employees who interact with customers. RTD also
collected the following data sources:
•

Frontline employee survey data

•

Customer satisfaction survey data

•

Telephone information center data

•

Access-a-Ride call data

•

Website visitation data

Frontline Employee Data
Since frontline staff are often the first contact LEP community members have with RTD, RTD sought to answer
the following questions (among others):
•

How often do frontline employees interact with LEP customers, and where do these interactions take
place?

•

What types of questions do LEP customers ask frontline employees?

•

Do frontline employees have difficulty communicating with people limited in English?

•

Are frontline employees aware of materials, services or tools that RTD uses to communicate with people
limited in English?

•

Are there additional materials, services or tools RTD can use to improve communications?

•

What can RTD do to better prepare frontline employees to assist LEP customers?

The survey closed on June 13, 2021 with 614 responses, including 141 responses to the online version and 473
responses to the paper version.
The survey found that almost all frontline employees interact with community members a few times per week
or more (96%), with 76% interacting with community members every day. While interactions with LEP
populations were less frequent than those proficient in English, 67% of frontline employees interacted with LEP
people a few times per week, with 1 in 4 (26%) reporting daily interaction with LEP people.

RTD Telephone Information Center Data
RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC) is one of many ways RTD fulfills its commitment to providing quality
customer service to all its potential transit users. RTD’s TIC has 27 full-time Information Specialists answering
incoming calls from customers requesting route information, filing complaints and making suggestions and
comments for response by e-mail, telephone or mail.13
Presently, TIC experiences a limited demand for language assistance. TIC does accommodate LEP Spanish
speakers by staffing 11 full-time bilingual Information Specialists; however, the demand for language assistance
from Spanish speakers seems low, given the proportion of LEP Spanish speakers in the RTD service area. To
illustrate, in the period of April 2021 to March 2022 (the 12 months prior to drafting this LAP), the TIC received
565,500 calls, with only 18,610 (3.29%) of those calls requiring language assistance for Spanish speakers.

Access-a-Ride Call Data
RTD’s Access-a-Ride has 21 full-time reservationists answering incoming calls from customers requesting Accessa-Ride trips. Presently, the service has experienced limited demand for language assistance. The Access-a-Ride
Call Center, operated by First Transit, began utilizing phone interpretation services, May 2021. Since May 2021,
out of a total of 154,874 incoming calls, 135 (0.087%) requested Spanish interpretation. 4 (0.003%) calls were
for Mandarin and 3 (0.002%) were for Russian.
RTD Website Visitation Data
In 2021 we had a total of 32 million page views, 9.2 million sessions, and 3.6 million users on the RTD website
(www.RTD-denver.com).
RTD can track the default language of a visitor to the agency’s website, providing some indication of the amount
of default device or “in-browser” translation. For example, operating systems such as Apple support localized
translations in dozens of languages so that users can automatically display content in the language of their
choice on their device. Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge also offer in-browser
translations, giving users the opportunity to translate information while surfing the web.
Below is a percentage breakdown of the top 10 languages used by our visitors from January 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Most website visitors view the RTD website in English (97.5% of the 3.6 million total users); visitors
who translate the website from English into their preferred language account for less than 2.5% of total visitors,
excluding crawlers (bots).

To further assist in website translation, RTD has historically offered the Google Translate widget. However,
Google deprecated the widget in 2019 and, consequently, will no longer update it. While RTD will continue to
offer the widget to website visitors in the short-term, it will eventually be removed as it becomes increasingly
outdated.
Summary
Factor 2 in the Four Factor Analysis helps ascertain in what mediums language assistance is most needed. Data
collected from the frontline employee survey, customer satisfaction survey, telephone information center,
Access-a-Ride telephone and the website especially show how important it is to improve language assistance in
locations where frontline staff are likely to have face-to-face interactions with people limited in English, such as
on transit vehicles or at a stop. Improving language accessibility for trip planning information, fares, schedules
or ticket purchases seems to be the most important, given that these are the types of questions frontline staff
report receiving the most from LEP persons. Further, staff largely note that it is difficult to communicate with
customers limited in English, suggesting that more translated announcements, signage, cards with common
words/phrases, brochures and schedules; a translation device; a direct phone line for translation services; and
language classes for the most frequently encountered languages would help them better serve LEP people. They
are also unfamiliar with the language assistance services RTD does offer, so bolstering staff training on these
services is also important.

It is unclear whether the low quantity of telephone requests and website visits in other languages is due to low
demand or other factors. For instance, people limited in English may not know the telephone lines or website
exist in the first place, they may not have ready access to a computer or (smart)phone or they may be hesitant
to use them given real and perceived language barriers. Expanding notice of available language assistance

Factor 3: Nature and Importance of RTD
Services, Programs and Activities
Factor 3 of USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis requires RTD to assess the nature and importance of programs,
activities or services provided by RTD to people with limited English proficiency. To complete Factor 3, RTD’s
LAP workgroup conducted surveys with LEP people who use RTD services. The workgroup sought to answer the
following research questions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

How frequently do LEP customers interact with RTD?
How do LEP customers receive RTD specific information and how do they prefer to receive information?
How useful are RTD’s language assistance services?
What is the importance of receiving RTD information in their native language?
How safe and secure do LEP customers feel?
Are LEP customers aware of RTD’s LiVE program?
How do LEP customers perceive RTD’s fare system?
What are LEP customers’ demographics?

RTD conducted a survey from September 7, 2021 through October 31, 2021 to answer the aforementioned
questions. Surveys were distributed to LEP persons in collaboration with numerous community-based
organizations. Due to lower-than-expected response rates, RTD created a social media campaign to target LEP
persons. RTD offered the survey in both a paper and online format, and it was translated into Amharic, Arabic,
Chinese, English, French, Korean, Nepalese, Persian, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.
The survey closed on October 31, 2021 with 206 responses, including 101 responses to the online version and
105 responses to the paper version. During data collection efforts, RTD collected responses from many people
who do not classify as LEP. Their responses were analyzed for potential skews and were deemed too biased to
be included in the analysis. Over half (58%) of respondents speak Spanish as their native language, followed by
Vietnamese (7%), Chinese (6%) and Nepalese (5%). Almost all respondents either read, write or understand
English less than “very well” (87%, 90%, and 88%, respectively).
Concerning the frequency of their interactions with RTD services, the survey found that 1 in 4 survey respondents
use RTD daily, with 59% using transit once a week or more. Most respondents (70%) had used RTD prior to
the global COVID-19 pandemic. Half of respondents state they use RTD the same now as they did prior to the
pandemic; about a third of respondents state they ride RTD less now than they did prior to the pandemic.

The survey also gathered perceptions of RTD’s language services. Participants were asked to rate the importance
of having translations available for a variety of information on a 5-point scale, where 5 means “very important.”
How to buy a ticket (84%), where the buses and trains go (83%), and service and schedule changes (81%) are
the most important information participants want translated into their native language.

It is important to note that customers with LEP differed on the usefulness of RTD’s current language translation
services. Respondents were asked to rate how useful RTD’s language assistance services are on a scale of 1 to
5, with 5 being “very useful.” Less than half rated RTD Customer Care (49%), translations through the website
(47%) and announcements on the bus or train (45%) a 4 or 5.
Further, access to information has implications for feelings of security. Two in three respondents have felt their
security was at risk while using RTD services at some point, but not everyone reported knowing what to do in
case of an emergency. Most respondents (69%) know how to follow emergency exit instructions or call RTD
Customer Service (51%); fewer know how to call RTD Police (35%), text Transit Watch (26%) or report an
incident on the Transit Watch app (25%).

Most respondents are also not aware of RTD’s various discount fare programs, which may indicate a gap in
language assistance and available translated information. For instance, 68% of LEP survey respondents are not
aware of RTD’s LiVE program. Further, 15% of survey respondents find that RTD’s fare structure is very difficult
(6%) or somewhat difficult (9%) to understand, and 44% are unfamiliar with RTD’s fare structure.

Summary
Though the survey used in RTD’s Factor 3 analysis only gathered input from a relatively small percent of RTD’s
LEP community, it is still illustrative of the nature and important of RTD’s various services and activities for
people with LEP. Firstly, it demonstrates the high, frequent usage of RTD’s services among the LEP population
surveyed, and thus reinforces the importance of pursuing reasonable language access measures. It also helps
demonstrate which materials, in which format and on what subjects RTD should offer language assistance. The
website is noted as a very important source of information for people with LEP. While Factor II found that little
translation of the website is performed, RTD recognizes that in-browser translations are not captured by the
Factor 2 data. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to at least offer instructions in various languages on how to
change one’s in-browser language on the RTD homepage. Signage at transit stops and in transit vehicles is also
an important source of information for people with LEP. Interestingly, while only 7% of survey respondents
showed that they get information from RTD via its social media platforms, 15% would prefer to receive
information from RTD via these channels. Examining the prevalence of language assistance on social media as
well as expanding advertising of RTD’s various social media networks could be a valuable endeavor to meet
community members’ preferences.
It is important to note that 1 in 5 survey respondents do not receive information about RTD. Thus, in addition
to better advertising RTD’s social media platforms, RTD could also prioritize providing language access to expand
awareness of RTD’s various outlets for information, including its email listserv, service alerts, Transit Watch app
and beyond.

(n=198)

Finally, in providing language assistance, RTD should focus on the information that people with LEP need the
most. This survey indicates that topics of priority should be purchasing fares (and costs of fares), routes and

44
Packet Pg. 178

1.E.1.a

navigation information, and service changes and alerts. Language-accessible safety information is also crucial to
the well-being of people limited in English proficiency, as many participants have felt their safety has been at
risk while using RTD but did not know what to do about it (e.g., by reporting an incident on the Transit Watch
app). All in all, this survey should be helpful in determining what information, its format, and its location are
considered vital for translation and should be targeted for other important language access measures.

Factor 4: Available Resources and Costs of
Providing Language Assistance Services
The final factor in the USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis is to examine the overall cost and resources available to
RTD to provide language assistance. RTD’s LAP inter-departmental workgroup conducted this assessment.
As this Plan has mentioned, it is RTD’s intention to maintain current language assistance measures that have
proven successful while also expanding upon those efforts in the coming years. A good place to begin
understanding what our resources are (and could be) to support expanded language efforts is to analyze
expenditures for language assistance in recent years. This will provide us a baseline from which we can better
analyze costs and resources moving forward.
The analysis shows that RTD spent approximately $176,000 on language assistance measures including
telephone interpretation, literature translation, vehicle signage and more (see Figure 36).

* Not including staff labor
A more complete explanation of these language assistance measures can be found in the next section.
What is not accounted for in this approximate total is the staff costs incurred to provide language access. Various
staff from Communications, Bus and Rail Operations, Access-a-Ride, Planning, Service Planning and Transit
Equity are often involved in these efforts, as RTD strives to find creative ways to address the diverse customer
base it serves. Further, these numbers do not quantify the cost of staff regularly providing their language skills
to assist community members with LEP (for instance, 1 in 4 frontline RTD staff who regularly interact with people
limited in English proficiency speak a foreign language).
Summary
It is clear that RTD has an opportunity to determine what resources it needs and those that are available to the
agency as it expands its language access efforts. The agency is already on its way to doing so by establishing
an official language access outreach program, housed within the Transit Equity Office of the Civil Rights Division.
With the support of the Transit Equity Specialist (a dedicated LAP coordinator) and overseen by the Transit
Equity Manager, the outreach program will begin to establish the “people power” and formalize language access
work into dedicated staff time. In this manner, RTD will be better able to determine what resources the agency
requires and has available to it for expanded language access, not only including tangible resources such as
funding but also intangible ones like community partnerships.

Translation of Vital Documents
Agencies receiving federal funding are required to identify “vital documents” that must be translated to the
extent possible. Vital documents are defined as 1) any document critical for obtaining services and benefits,
and/or 2) any document required by law. In other words, whether or not a document (or the information it
solicits) is “vital” depends on the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and
the consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not accurate or timely disseminated. For
instance, applications for a bicycle safety course would not generally be considered vital, although summaries
of major service changes are vital documents. Other vital documents include but are not limited to:
•

Title VI public notice

•

Title VI complaint procedures

•

Bus and rail schedules

•

Summaries and notices of public hearings regarding proposed:
o

Transportation plans

o

Service impacting construction activities

o

Major service changes

RTD has consistently worked with community organizations and the LEP populations the serve to evaluate which
documents are “vital” to the meaningful access to RTD services and programs. However, with the 2022-2025
Language Access Plan update, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup now has clearly defined tiers (1,2 and 3)
to determine if documents are considered vital and to guide translation efforts. Find more information in 20222025 Language Access Plan Guidelines and Implementation Calendar.

2022-2025 Language Access Plan Guidelines
and Implementation Calendar
After a review of the 2021 Four Factor Analysis results, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup recommended a
two-tiered approach to meeting the needs of LEP populations in RTD’s service area. Tier One retains successful
programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of LEP populations. Tier Two outlines areas of
focus to expand upon the agency’s goal of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs
and services.
Tier 1: LEP Activities
Tier One retains existing programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of
regional LEP populations, such as telephone interpreters in virtually any language, multi-lingual printed materials
and multi-lingual information on the RTD website or brochures, and continuing development of partnerships
with community organizations that serve people with limited English proficiency.
Specifically, the following activities will continue (as noted in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD
above):
•

Providing telephone interpreters via customer service at 303-299-6000 and via the Access-a-Ride Call
Center at 303-292-6560 to assist LEP customers

Area of Focus 1: Updating and Monitoring the LAP
rtd-denver.com

53
Packet Pg. 187

1.E.1.a

This area of focus shores up RTD’s LAP updating and monitoring process by developing the necessary systems
to more efficiently and effectively determine language assistance needs. In addition to ensuring compliance with
Title VI and DOT LEP Guidance, this area will see RTD building out processes (e.g., staff roles, community
evaluation tool and more) to guarantee that language assistance is available where needed, establishing and
solidifying relationships with organizations and community members to inform the LAP, creating a uniform file
management system for language assistance needs and translated documents, and otherwise formalizing a
strategic foundation for pursuing language access.
Area of Focus 2: Language Assistance
Where Area of Focus 1 focuses on how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates its language access program itself,
Area of Focus 2 dials in on the actual provision of language assistance. For instance, activities will include creating
a planning process for hosting an in-person interpreter at events, ensuring certain information like trip planning
or purchasing fares is language-accessible, providing interpretation for basic transit questions, creating updated
versions of How to Ride videos in identified languages and more.
Specifically, as mentioned in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD, RTD will be fortifying its
processes for translating vital documents. In identifying documents needed to provide meaningful access to RTD
services for LEP customers, RTD has defined three levels of vital documents. This will allow for prioritization of
materials translation as resources allow. In some cases, translation of vital documents may consist of only a
summary or key points. For other vital documents, providing notice of available language assistance can also
provide sufficient access.
The 3 tiers can be described as follows:
1. Tier 1 – Safety, Security and Civil Rights. Information categorized in Tier 1 is that which protects
customers’ physical safety and facilitates RTD customers to exercise their legal rights. Providing translation
or LEP-accessible versions of this type of information is the highest priority of all vital documents.
Information categorized as Tier 1 would be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following
information types identified in Factor 3: Safety and Security, and Rights Notices. Information about public
hearings and public involvement opportunities related to Fare Information, Service Changes and Planning
Information are also classified as Tier 1 vital documents. Customer surveys related to Tier 1 will be
considered Tier 1 documents.
2. Tier 2 – Information Critical to Access RTD’s Services. Tier 2 includes information that helps LEP
customers to understand RTD services to facilitate ease of use and to understand RTD programs to facilitate
participation. These types of information are critical for LEP-access because they provide more details about
specific benefits available or details of RTD services or programs. Information categorized as Tier 2 would
be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following information types identified in Factor 3:
basic customer information, fare payment information, program applications, maps, service changes, service
alerts, and destination information. Customer surveys related to Tier 2 will be considered Tier 2 documents.

2022 Language Access Plan

Area of Focus 3: Providing Notice of Language Assistance
Area of Focus 3 is predominantly about how RTD communicates to people limited in English about their options
to receive language assistance, as advertising the availability of language assistance services will be key to
ensuring people with limited English proficiency are able to meaningfully access RTD services. RTD will strategize
how to best notify LEP communities of available language assistance by strategically posting signage at all major
passenger transfer stations, RTD’s administrative offices and other RTD properties with high volumes of
pedestrian traffic. The agency is also considering how to make a dedicated “brand” or cohesive theme around
the language assistance services it offers to make them more identifiable and uniform. Furthermore, RTD will
utilize its website and the relationships developed with community organizations that predominantly serve people
limited in English to better market available language assistance services.
Area of Focus 4: Training Programs for Personnel
LEP DOT Guidance states that RTD employees should know their obligations to provide meaningful access to
information and services for LEP persons, and all employees in public contact positions should be properly
trained. In 2022-2025, and in accordance with Guideline 4, RTD intends to fortify staff training to ensure that:
•

Staff know about LEP policies, procedures and resources; and

•

Public-facing staff are trained to work effectively with in-person and telephone interpreters.

As noted in the Four Factor Analysis, RTD mainly encounters LEP persons by way of its local bus service. In
2022, RTD’s Transit Equity Office will launch “Serving Limited English Proficiency Customers” training courses to
educate and provide general skills to all frontline staff for interacting with LEP customers.
It’s reasonable to anticipate that more complex interaction with people limited in English will occur with telephone
information specialists, receptionists, sales outlets associates, transit security and other frontline staff. These
frontline employees will have more detailed procedures and sophisticated tools for managing interactions with
LEP persons to include, but not limited to:
•

Third-party telephone or video remote interpreters

•

“Basic Spanish for Transit” employee books

•

RTD LEP handout guide

•

U.S. Census “I Speak” cards

•

1.E.1.a

RTD looks forward to implementing the 2022-2025 Language Access Plan by first producing the strategic and
procedural foundation for expanding language access (Area of Focus 1) as well as immediately working to
increase awareness of the language assistance measures the agency already provides (Area of Focus 3).
Fortunately, the agency has already created a solid base from which to pursue this plan by establishing its LAP
outreach program, hiring on the Transit Equity Specialist to coordinate LAP-related work, finalizing the
Implementation Calendar and Guidelines Index as included above, and more. An immediate next step will be to
write the charters that guide each of RTD’s language assistance activities in their purpose, practice,
responsibility, approach and procedure. From there, RTD looks forward to taking real action on improving
language access across the agency’s public transportation system, in turn making local transit more accessible
and equitable for residents, customers and visitors alike.
