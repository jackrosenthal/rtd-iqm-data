Step 1
Comprehensive Assessment of Services
§ Detailed performance metrics analysis and compilation
§ Comparison of RTD to six peer transit agencies
§ Route-by-route performance assessment
§ Key Findings:

• Local routes are most productive
• Growth in boardings has not kept up with regional population growth
• Compared with industry peers, RTD:
•Provides more service per resident
•Generally has more boardings per revenue hour
•Generally has higher costs per revenue hour
•Has the lowest population density

Step 2
Review Existing Travel Patterns Against Services
§ Location-based Services (LBS) data for 50 million trip events
§ Tied LBS to census data
§ Onboard survey data
§ Key Findings:
• 70% of transit trips originate at home and end at work or school
• Downtown Denver captures highest transit market share
• Equity groups:
•Are more likely to travel midday
•Are less likely to travel to downtown Denver
•Travel shorter distances

• Opportunities exist to better address:

•Trips with destinations not in downtown Denver
•Non work/school trips
•Short trips
•Travel needs of equity groups

Step 3
Financial Capacity

§ Key Findings:
• Pre-pandemic operating expenditures exceeded revenues
• State of good repair is behind schedule
• FasTracks debt service uses majority of revenue generated by
0.4 percent FasTracks sales tax

• An 8 percent reduction in services was needed for fiscal
sustainability (pre-pandemic in 2019)

Community and Agency Goals and Values (cont.)

§Key Findings:

•Focusing resources on:
•High-quality service:

§ Highest ridership
§ Lowest cost per boarding
§ Broad stakeholder support

•Equity populations:

§ High ridership
§ Low cost per boarding
§ Broad stakeholder support

•Broader geographic coverage:

§ Lowest ridership
§ Highest cost per boarding
§ Some level of service to much of district
