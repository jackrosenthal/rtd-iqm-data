BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: April 3, 2013

From:

Terry Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

April 3, 2013

Board Meeting Date: April 9, 2013

Subject:

Adoption of 2014 Performance Measures

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
adopt the attached 2014 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7. There are 22 performance measures
in total.
POLICY REFERENCE
Fiscal Policy Statements – Budget Policy 10
BACKGROUND
Each year the RTD Board of Directors adopts a vision and mission statement, goals, objectives, and
specific performance measures. These measures provide a framework in which RTD can determine
how well it provides service to its passengers and the citizens of the District. A report detailing yearto-date performance on each of these measures is presented to the Board of Directors following the
end of each quarter.

DISCUSSION
Recommended changes from 2013 to the 2014 adopted goals are listed below:


Goal 2.1 Prompt response to facility complaints
o The goal for average facilities maintenance complaints per month is increased to < 14.0
from < 12.0 per month to reflect full year revenue service on the West Line and actual
experience with West Line maintenance incidents to date. Pre-opening maintenance has
included graffiti and materials theft.



Goal 4.2 Improve level of customer complaints
o The goal for customer complaints per boardings is increased to .0004 from .0003 due
to a static higher level of complaints reached over the last 2-3 years from the
strollers/wheelchairs policy, fare enforcement campaign, TIC availability, the
introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line which will bring with it additional
complaints.



Goal 6.2 Increase ridership
o This measure will be established by the financial plans inherent in the adoption of the
2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and is noted as a placeholder until that point.
It is a forecast.



Goal 6.3 Increase in fare revenue, EcoPass revenue, and total operating revenue

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

o

Each of these measures will be established by the financial plans inherent in the
adoption of the 2014 Annual Budget in November 2013 and are noted as placeholders
until that point. These are forecasts.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2014 Performance Measures will be utilized in the development of the final 2014 Adopted
Budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures included
in the 2014 Performance Report.
2. Modify the recommended 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance
measures to be included in the 2014 Performance Report and make required adjustments, if
necessary, to the 2014 Requested Budget.
3. Do not adopt the 2014 Goals and Objectives and the accompanying performance measures
included in the 2014 Performance Report.

On-time is arrival at a location no more than 1 minute early and no more than 5 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.

The measure is lowered in 2013 due to system complexity added by the West Line, which will bring with it more single-track
chokepoints on the west end of the line and more crossing points in the CPV. Delays are also coming from signal timing
changes in the downtown district which is affecting performance.

Complaints by type were being monitored by Bus Operations; however, they were unable to gather information from the Trapeze
monitoring system to report on this measure. Reporting began again in 2012 when the issue was resolved.

The goal is increased in 2014 to account for static higher level of complaints due to the stroller/wheelchair policy, fare
enforcement campaign, TIC availability, introduction of SmartCards, and the new West Line.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT

Board Meeting Date: April 9, 2013

Subject:

Review of 2014-2019 SBP Development
Process and 2014 Budget Assumptions

BACKGROUND

Staff has prepared the attached presentation to give the Board the opportunity to offer early,
substantive input in the development of the RTD 2014 Annual Budget. The purpose is to provide a
framework for conversation and to confirm Board approved parameters for decision making in the
development of the 2014 Budget and 2014-2019 Strategic Budget Plan (SBP).

DISCUSSION

The Strategic Budget Plan is RTD’s six year financial plan for the Base System. Updated annually, it
provides important cash flow planning information used to develop the upcoming new capital budget
and overall scope of program activity, including hours of service the District can afford to provide.
(See attached slides.)
At the early stages of the development of the SBP and annual Budget, staff looks to the Board for
guidance regarding key budget objectives and assumptions that are to be used in the generation of
the financial plans. This is to inform the Board that staff intends to use these existing guidelines
unless overriding instructions are received. Parameters currently considered in the preparation of the
District’s 2014-2019 SBP and 2014 Budget are:
(1) fiscal management, including requirements to operate per specified performance goals and
to maintain a balanced budget
(2) continued development of Board-appropriated fund and capital replacement fund
(3) continued implementation of Fiscal Sustainability Task Force recommendations
(4) optimization of service levels for bus and light rail systems
(5) fuel lock for budget certainty
(6) SOGR of facilities and equipment
(7) prioritization of capital and expense projects
(8) CBA negotiated costs through 2017
(9) planned fleet expansion/replacement and COP financing
Material uncontrollable variables which significantly impact RTD’s budgeting process and financial
planning can change, however. The following items will affect RTD in the development of the 20142019 SBP and 2014 Budget:
(1) sales and use tax revenues

Packet Pg. 15

1.C.1

a. current quarterly CU-Leeds School forecast for sales and use tax indicates an
increase in 2013 of 2.5% above 2012 collections
b. actual sales and use tax in January 2013 was 2.8% over January 2012
c. forecast for 2014 is an increase of 4.3% over 2013
(2) fuel costs
a. final outcome of 2013 diesel fuel lock was $3.26/gallon
b. 2014 diesel futures estimate is also $3.26/gallon at this time
c. current contract with diesel vendor expires at end of 2013 with no options for
extension
(3) inflation rate
a. Denver/Boulder area: CLC forecasts 2.3% in 2014, 2.4% in 2015-2019 (applied to
operating/maintenance/project costs)
b. National: CLC forecasts 2.5% in 2014-2019 (applied to fuel costs)
(4) fare increases
a. continual review with Board of periodic fare increases
(5) pursue additional grant revenues as they become available within Board policy
(6) nature and speed of economic recovery in Colorado
(7) impact of State legislation and audit adjustments on sales and use tax revenue

Conclusion: Staff is seeking agreement to proceed with the guidelines and parameters identified to
develop and present a first draft of the SBP to the Financial Administration & Audit Committee at the
Budget Study Session on April 23, 2013.
