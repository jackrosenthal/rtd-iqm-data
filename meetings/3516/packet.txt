BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
GM/CEO Compensation Philosophy

September 11, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Compensation
Philosophy.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
Jack Kroll, Board Office Executive Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee (committee) meeting, committee members
reached a consensus that the processes for evaluating both the performance of the GM/CEO and of the
agency itself (evaluation processes) could be enhanced.
The committee members reviewed the following materials during the April 12, 2023, meeting:
• The 2021-2026 Strategic Plan adopted by the Board of Directors on August 10, 2021
• The GM/CEO Employment Agreement (contract) entered into on September 29, 2020, and most
recently amended in the Fourth Amendment agreed to on October 26, 2022
• The Compensation Study Report completed by Gallagher dated November 18, 2022
Further, committee members agreed to explore possible strategies and opportunities to enhance the
evaluation processes.
On June 5, 2023, the Chief People Officer delivered a compensation philosophy presentation, from an
objective human resources perspective, detailing the considerations, factors, types, and components to
be considered in developing said philosophy.
On June 26, 2023, the committee convened an executive session for consideration of the
compensation, performance appraisal, and employment agreement for the current GM/CEO, to receive
legal advice, as well as to hear from the current GM/CEO, regarding these topics.
On July 17, 2023, the committee convened for subsequent consideration of a draft compensation
philosophy. After fulsome dialogue and consideration, the committee asked that the draft compensation
philosophy be circulated to the full Board for further input, edits, and consideration.

Packet Pg. 37

17.A

Suggested edits have since been incorporated into the draft compensation philosophy. It was agreed
that the amended compensation philosophy would return to the committee for review and
recommendation to the full Board at the September 2023 monthly Board meeting.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the Board will honor its commitment to establish a compensation
philosophy for the GM/CEO as noted in the 2010 State Audit on Executive Compensation Practices.
A compensation philosophy is a foundational document from which the Board can establish a base salary
compensation range for the GM/CEO position. Further, effective January 1, 2021, the Colorado Equal
Pay for Equal Work Act requires employers with one or more employees to include the rate of
compensation or a compensation range; a general description of bonuses, commissions, or other
compensation; and a general description of all employment benefits offered for the position, including
healthcare benefits, retirement benefits, paid time off, and any tax reportable benefits when posting a
position. Therefore, the agency has defined a salary range for every other position within the agency,
except the GM/CEO position.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the Board’s adoption of this recommended action.
Regardless of the base salary compensation range established for the GM/CEO’s position, the total
compensation of any seated GM/CEO is negotiable and must be agreed to by both the Board and
GM/CEO.

Compensation Philosophy for the GM/CEO (draft as of 8/31/2023)

RTD’s mission to make lives better through connections and vision to be the trusted transit leader in
mobility, delivering excellence, and value to our customers and community requires the expertise of a
highly skilled and seasoned executive capable of leading and inspiring an innovative, complex, and
unique multi-modal transit agency.
An overarching goal of the Board of Directors is to attract, motivate and retain the requisite executive
talent necessary to achieve the agency’s mission and vision. The Board further acknowledges that
competition to attract a GM/CEO with the required suite of competencies, knowledge, and experience
is extremely challenging given the highly specialized transit environment. Therefore, RTD must be market
competitive on a Northern American scale in both public and private sectors when considering talent
acquisition and retention.
Furthermore, the following principles will guide the components of the GM/CEO’s total compensation.
Total compensation will be designed to:
•

•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Demonstrate internal equity, fairness, and transparency while being externally market
competitive, aligned to the 50th percentile of comparable public transit agencies, and related
public and private sectors where executive talent may reside
Comprise a component of pay-for-performance designed to motivate and incent performance
and retention
Incent agency, team, and individual performance aligned to the agency’s strategic objectives and
directly linked to a pay-for-performance framework
Provide appropriate opportunities for personal and professional development
Recognize the value in compensation components that directly support the health and welfare
of the GM/CEO today (e.g., health [including dedicated executive health benefits], dental, vision,
PTO, executive leave) and into the future (e.g., deferred compensation, retiree health benefits)
Consider specific agency variables (e.g., size, values, strategic goals, stage of evolution,
geographical markets)
Recognize and respect the agency’s fiscal reality and the commitment to responsible stewardship
of public tax dollars and customer revenue
Adapt nimbly to changing external (e.g., labor market) and internal circumstances (e.g., fiscal
restraints)
Be reviewed for market competitiveness and legislative/regulatory compliance (local, state, and
federal) on an annual basis

Additionally, the GM/CEO’s performance will be formally assessed on an annual basis.
Further, should the GM/CEO be employed with a term contract, the Board will endeavor to hold
meaningful discussion about extending the term of such contract no later than 18 months prior to the
expiration of the contract’s term.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
September 2023 Code of Conduct Revisions

September 13, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt revisions to the Customer Code of Conduct.

DIRECTORS
Kate Williams, Chair, Operations and Safety Committee
Michael Guzman, Director – District C
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
The RTD Act, Article 9 of Title 32, Colorado Revised Statutes, authorizes the district to develop,
maintain, and operate a mass transportation system for the benefit of the inhabitants of the district.
In order to provide for personal safety, convenience, and comfort of all customers, the agency has
established a Customer Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth rules prohibiting certain conduct that may
adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles, facilities, or property. To enforce this
Code, RTD has established a Service Suspension Policy (Policy) setting forth procedures and
enforcement guidelines.
The Code and Policy are tools in an overarching strategy to maintain a welcoming transit environment
for all RTD employees and customers.
At the June 2023 Board Meeting, following months of discussion and on-going feedback, the Board of
Directors adopted a revised Code as well as a new Policy. At that meeting, Director Guzman had
planned to offer a series of amendments to the Code. However, to afford the Board more time to
consider the amendments and to follow the best practice of having recommended actions first
considered by a standing committee, Director Guzman agreed to withhold offering amendments at the
June meeting. Subsequently, Director Williams, as Chair of the Operations and Safety Committee
committed to considering select amendments to the Code from Director Guzman at an Operations and
Safety Committee meeting. The July Operations and Safety Committee agenda was too full to
accommodate the discussion, so the September meeting was selected by Committee Chair Williams as
the meeting to hear proposed amendments as a recommended action. Per the RTD Board of Director
Bylaws, the Chair of a Committee may place items on the agenda. (Article VI, Section 1, b).

17.B

DISCUSSION
This recommended action seeks Board approval to modify the Code with four straightforward changes to
four rules in order to:
•
•
•

Clarify rules
Simplify language
Eliminate redundancy

Director Guzman developed these proposed changes based on community and customer feedback and
met with the General Manager and CEO on Monday, July 24, 2023 to discuss his proposed changes.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no substantive financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

Proposed Amendments to the Respect the Ride/Code of Conduct Rules
Introduction:
Thank you for your willingness to review these suggestions and engage in discussion about the merit of each.
Below I have proposed five amendments to the Code of Conduct as approved by the Board at the June 2023
meeting.
For the purposes of the following suggested amendments, strikes or modifications all reference the finalized
code of conduct document on file with the Board Office.
Each proposed amendment is contained on its own page in this document and I have included the rule number,
as well as the rule as written prior to the June changes, the current language of the rule as updated following
the Board’s June changes, and my proposed amendment in red. I have also provided some brief rationale for
each proposed change.
The first three of the following are important to constituents of District C. There is one more amendment I
offer for consideration, as I believe it is a commonsense adjustment which will assist in clarifying and simplifying
the rule for the benefit of employees and customers. I hope all will be considered by the Operations and Safety
Committee and reviewed by staff for any advice or legal requirements.

The amendment is for clarity, not to change the intent.
It is based on multiple constituents and stakeholder groups stating that “customer demand is high” was
confusing; if “seating is limited” is clearly stated.
Removes redundancy

● We want to encourage individuals to use RTD when we know that public transit is part of public safety
campaigns, e.g. - NYE & “Don’t drink and drive!”

“Not limited to” is unnecessary.
Clarity, reduces conflict and helps all stakeholders.
This type of explicit behavior, here-in defined, is covered under rules against harassment - as it is to cause
another to fear for their safety.
Also it is redundant, but a clarified version.
See Rule # 15 - Current Customer Code of Conduct.
Engaging in harassm ent , sexual harassment, or bullying. This includes offensive behavior, unwelcome conduct
of a sexual nature, or abusive, repeated conduct directed toward an individual because of their sex, race, color,
national origin, religion, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, ancestry, age, military
status, disability, genetic information, or any other status protected by law. (emphasis added)

Proposed Amendment Four

17.B.b

Customer Code of Conduct
The Regional Transportation District makes lives better through connections, whether that is connecting a customer
with their final destination or the connections that happen with others on the system. To support all types of
connections, RTD asks its customers to follow a set of behavioral guidelines called Respect the Ride.
Respect the Ride focuses on providing a safe, convenient, and enjoyable experience for all customers,
while also discouraging disruptive or antisocial behaviors.
Being respectful of other customers and considerate to RTD’s employees does not take more than common courtesy.

Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective transportation throughout
the District to all constituents.
RTD strives to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for
the safety, convenience, and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth
rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles (including
RTD buses, Access-a-Ride vehicles, FlexRide vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail vehicles), facilities
(including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and fountains, and administrative,
operational, and maintenance facilities), or property.
Prior to enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited by
this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement ranging from a
verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5: “Enforcement”).
Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the Americans with Disabilities Act (see
Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”)

Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016, by RTD’s Board of Directors and thereafter
amended on July 21, 2020, and June 27, 2023.

Prohibited Conduct:
A person, including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever (including but not limited to companies,
clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from committing, attempting to
commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit, the following acts in or on any RTD
vehicle, facility, or property.

maximum extent feasible, to ensure that a person with a disability has access to, and benefits from, its services.
RTD will make reasonable modifications to its policies, programs, and procedures applicable to its transportation
services when necessary to avoid discrimination and ensure accessibility for people with disabilities.
There may be certain situations when RTD’s policies and procedures do not achieve ADA objectives/accessibility.
A modification to these policies and procedures may be needed to ensure that a passenger with a disability has
access to our services.
Examples of reasonable modification can be found on RTD’s website under Accessibility. When making a
reasonable modification for an individual with a disability, the modification is not intended to:

personnel are to contact Dispatch or Security for advice and assistance.
Enforcement will be conducted in a fair and reasonable manner. A person who engages in any of the above
prohibited conduct (Section III) may be warned and/or ordered to immediately exit the RTD vehicle, facility,

to the person to exit RTD property for up to the remainder of the service day.
Situations where a person refuses to leave an RTD vehicle, facility, or property after being ordered to do
so may be considered trespassing and may be referred to law enforcement personnel.
A person who engages in any of the above prohibited conduct may also, or instead, be issued a suspension
by RTD, suspending the person from all RTD vehicles, properties, and services for a determined amount of
time pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy and procedures.
A person ordered to leave or suspended from RTD property will not be entitled to any refund of unused

Suspension or orders to exit RTD property may be appealed pursuant to RTD’s Service Suspension policy
and procedures.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, riding an RTD vehicle without evidence that the
proper fare has been paid may be treated in accordance with Colorado Traffic Code, C.R.S. § 42-4- 1416.
In addition to any other enforcement under this Code, illegal activity may result in a citation under any
applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or ordinance, including C.R.S. § 18-9-114 - Hindering
Transportation (Class 2 Misdemeanor), and C.R.S. § 18-9-115 - Endangering Public Transportation and

Customer Code of Conduct
The Regional Transportation District makes lives better through connections, whether that is connecting a customer
with their final destination or the connections that happen with others on the system. To support all types of
connections, RTD asks its customers to follow a set of behavioral guidelines called Respect the Ride.
Respect the Ride focuses on providing a safe, convenient, and enjoyable experience for all customers,
while also discouraging disruptive or antisocial behaviors.
Being respectful of other customers and considerate to RTD’s employees does not take more than common courtesy.

Purpose:
RTD is committed to offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous, accessible, and cost-effective transportation throughout
the District to all constituents.
RTD strives to ensure that everyone is treated fairly and has equal access to transportation. In order to provide for
the safety, convenience, and comfort of all persons, RTD has established this Code of Conduct (Code) setting forth
rules prohibiting certain conduct that may adversely affect use, operation, or occupancy of RTD vehicles (including
RTD buses, Access-a-Ride vehicles, FlexRide vehicles, light rail vehicles, and commuter rail vehicles), facilities
(including bus and rail stations, parking facilities, bus stops, bus shelters, plazas and fountains, and administrative,
operational, and maintenance facilities), or property.
Prior to enforcement, RTD will make every attempt to first educate a person on conduct prohibited by
this Code. However, any person who engages in prohibited conduct may be subject to enforcement ranging from a
verbal or written warning, immediate suspension, or a criminal citation (see Section 5: “Enforcement”).
Conduct prohibited by this Code is subject to reasonable modification under the Americans with Disabilities Act (see
Section 4: “The ADA and Reasonable Modification”)

Authority:
This Code of Conduct was initially approved on December 20, 2016, by RTD’s Board of Directors and thereafter
amended on July 21, 2020, and June 27, 2023.

Prohibited Conduct:
A person, including any combination of persons of any nature whatsoever (including but not limited to companies,
clubs, associations, corporations, partnerships, and public entities) is prohibited from committing, attempting to
commit, or assisting any other person or combination of persons to commit, the following acts in or on any RTD
vehicle, facility, or property.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Pass-through Carbon Reduction Grant

September 12, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize an expense appropriation to effectuate a pass-through grant from
the State of Colorado to the City and County of Denver (CCD) in the amount of $5,000,000 for the
Colfax Avenue Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Brian Welch, Acting Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
CCD is making several enhancements to sections of the Colfax Avenue corridor, including infrastructure
improvements related to providing BRT services from RTD along the Colfax route. A portion of the
Colfax Avenue enhancement funding is being provided from a grant through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) related to carbon reduction.
RTD has agreed to be the qualifying direct recipient for these grant funds and to pass them through to
CCD to fund and implement the Colfax Avenue enhancements.
DISCUSSION
RTD has internal budgetary controls in place requiring Board-appropriated funding for expenditures. In
order for RTD to receive and then expend these federal funds, thereby passing them through to CCD, an
appropriation must first be authorized.
RTD will record an equal amount of grant revenue and grant expense for the activity associated with this
pass-through grant activity.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to RTD from this recommended action aside from minor ongoing costs
associated with internal grant administration functions.

Public Opinion Polling Consultant Summary Scope of Work
Approval and Contract Authorization

September 21, 2023
Board Meeting Date:
September 26, 2023

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the summary scope of work for a solicitation, and to subsequently
authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to enter into a contract, for consulting services for
strategic advice, development of a survey instrument, and public opinion polling related to revenue
diversification and RTD finances.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to Article X of the Colorado Constitution known as
the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). TABOR includes governmental annual revenue growth limitations to
which RTD’s 0.6% sales and use tax revenue will be subject after 2024.
During the May 9, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, a Board Discussion Item was
presented by Director Davidson and the Chief Financial Officer, titled "Board Retreat Summary." This
Discussion Item provided additional information regarding one of the goals emerging from the March 25,
2023, Board Retreat, which was to seek to shore up RTD’s financial position and outlook with a policy
goal to create a long-term, sustainable, and resilient funding model.
During the September 12, 2023, Finance and Planning Committee meeting, staff provided additional
information to the Board regarding a Revenue Diversification Working Group (working group) that will
advise the Finance and Planning Committee and the Board. Participants in the working group, who have
been identified due to their relevant subject-matter expertise, in addition to Director Davidson in his
capacity as Vice Chair of the Finance and Planning Committee who will serve as the liaison to the Board,
include the General Manager and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Government Relations
Officer and Senior Manager of Debt and Investments.
The working group and the Finance and Planning Committee will consider available options and develop
recommendations for the Board to consider in the coming months to create a sustainable and resilient
funding model in alignment with the agency's Strategic Priority of Financial Success.

Packet Pg. 65

18.D

A critical step to decision making and understanding a viable path forward to address potential TABOR
impacts and alternative revenue sources is having reliable information on public opinion and willingness
to support a potential ballot measure.
DISCUSSION
If approved, staff will prepare a solicitation seeking consulting services to accomplish several tasks
related to assessing opinions of registered voters and their likelihood of support for a potential ballot
measure to avert negative financial impacts and/or approve additional revenue sources. This proposed
work is exploratory, and no decisions have been made on what, if any, funding avenues to pursue,
including whether to submit a ballot question to registered voters in a future election.
SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY
The selected consultant will:
• Develop and recommend an overall strategy and timeline for completing the desired polling
• Identify potential solutions to address financial challenges
• Suggest solutions for potential additional revenue that could be used to fulfill community needs
related to public transportation
• Develop a methodology and polling instrument to capture a statistically valid sampling of
registered voters within the District
• Conduct public opinion polling of possible solutions, including polling on specific language for any
recommended potential ballot questions to be considered
• Produce a report detailing the findings and offering recommendations for Board consideration
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The unrestricted fund account will be utilized to fund this initiative.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2024 Draft Legislative and Government Relations Program

September 21, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff initiated a process to develop and implement an annual
Legislative Program. The Board of Directors approved the agency’s first Legislative Program in October
2021. The Legislative Program is considered by the Board annually and serves as a guiding document for
Government Relations staff and external advocates to pursue goals related to legislation and policy
matters. Additionally, the Legislative Program serves as an organizing document that can be adjusted
throughout a legislative session to provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be
communicated and pursued by agency staff.
DISCUSSION
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections. It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and
federal elected officials. To achieve the adopted goals, RTD must be proactive in education and inform
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
Equally important is building trust through partnership that fits within the framework of RTD’s financial
forecast. The 2024 Draft Legislative and Government Relations Program, included as Attachment A to
this report, outlines priority actions on a variety of issues that staff believe are achievable through
advocacy and collaboration.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no direct financial impact associated with the Board’s consideration of this discussion item.

2024 Draft Legislative and Government Relations Program

PURPOSE
To establish a set of Board-approved legislative and advocacy policies that benefit the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) and assist in guiding staff’s actions and efforts during the
Colorado General Assembly’s 2024 regular session that support the priorities and success
outcomes of the agency’s adopted 2021-2026 Strategic Plan.
STRATEGY
Developing and maintaining relationships with myriad stakeholders is central to RTD’s strategic
approach to government relations. Staff will work to communicate, educate, inform and partner
with the agency’s Congressional delegation, the Governor’s Office, the state General Assembly
delegation, and local elected officials to advocate for Board-approved policies.
Additionally, staff will continue to work with its industry associations to partner and collaborate
on shared goals to advance and seek support for legislative positions approved by the Board.
Those partners include but are not limited to the American Public Transportation Association
(APTA), the Colorado Association of Transit Agencies (CASTA), regional transportation
management organizations/associations (TMOs/TMAs), municipal and cultural chambers of
commerce, and other stakeholder organizations. Lastly, tactics included in the Legislative
Program will be guided and informed by the priorities set forth in the agency’s Board-approved
2021-2026 Strategic Plan – Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee Ownership,
Financial Success.
EXECUTION PLAN
Contained herein are specific priorities and actions that outline areas of focus for the 2024
Legislative Program. Beyond the actions listed in this program, specific legislative matters are
likely to arise that warrant consideration by the Board.
To allow staff flexibility for consideration of items to be changed, added, or deleted as a result
of legislation introduced during the legislative session, the recommended change must be
presented to the Board as part of the Board’s Executive Committee or another committee
deemed appropriate by the General Manager/CEO and Board Chair. If time does not allow for
an item to be agendized for a committee meeting for discussion by the Board, RTD will remain
neutral on the legislation in question.
