II.

2012-2017 Strategic Budget Plan, 2012 Budget and 2011 Amended Budget
Jannette Scarpino introduced this item. This budget calendar has been synched with the
Board calendar for 2011 and provide the important dates leading to the adoption of the
budget for 2012. Jannette pointed out three important dates—June 21 when the Board
adopts the 2011 amended budget, July 19 for the adoption of the 2012-2017 SBP and
November 22 when the Board adopts the 2012 budget.

III.

Fourth Quarter 2010 Performance Measures
Director O’Boyle had several questions related to these performance measures. Staff will
follow-up with him and the full Board related to setting performance measures for 2012
and incorporating some of his suggestions into the process. One of the things discussed
was a slight difference in opinion related to how should the ECOpass and Flexpass be
reported to more accurately reflect the change in numbers (6.3). Director O’Boyle also
thought we might need to set a goal to reduce cash fare in line with discussions from the
Fiscal Sustainability Task Force.
Director Tayer expressed the ECOpass has a substantial impact as does cash fare. It is
important that RTD continues to track and report out on these items to have a better
understanding of the health of our fiscal conditions.

IV.

January Financial Status report
Committee Chair James introduced this item. He shared with the Board members that as
part of continuous improvement, Staff included in their packet two different formats for
reporting of the financial status information. He asked the Board to review the new format
and provide their comments, concerns or changes to Terry Howerter, CFO. They will run
the two different formats for the next month to give the Board a chance to determine
which one they prefer.
Terry Howerter passed out the latest sales and use forecast, a copy of which is included in
the Minute notebook located in the Board office. He noted an 8.9% increase in January
2010 from January 2009.
Terry Howerter also pointed out some of the significant changes from the summary income
statement from 2010. He used the example from other outside services to show the
impact of the current manual accrual process on the numbers that gives a somewhat
distorted view. Director Brohl queried if there is a better way to report this information.

Terry Howerter indicated for the future he would like to use the Oracle PR accrual process
which provides a cleaner way to handle accruals.
