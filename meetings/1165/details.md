#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

David Lewis, Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC) Co-Chair, stated that the CAC has completed the two-on-one meetings with 14 of the Board members.  These meetings have been important for the Board members to convey their interests; the feedback received was very valuable.  CAC members are making themselves available to go to individual community meetings for each Board member if requested.

There is a work session tomorrow (May 15, 2013) and staff will be briefing the CAC about the West Line opening.    Presentations will also include lessons learned from the West Rail Line; the CAC will work with staff to help transfer those lessons learned onto other projects.

On June 26, 2013 the CAC Quarterly Meeting will be held at the Westminster City Hall – Council Chambers.

Director Menten requested more information for the June 26 meeting.  David stated that it will be from 12:00 – 2:00 p.m. at 4800 W. 92nd Ave., Westminster, CO  80031 in the Council Chambers.

Committee Chair Hoy asked if there is going to be a field trip to the Westminster Mall demolition site.  David stated that it will take place after the quarterly meeting at 2:00 p.m.  He said that an email with more information would be sent to all Board members.

#### 1. Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator Fare-Free Service Plan

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations beginning in 2014.

Motion:              Director James made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the May 28th, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Daly seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, introduced Lacy Bell, Project Manager for the Downtown Denver Circulator and Bryan Welch, Planning Technical Service Manager.  Lacy stated that the circulator has always been included in the FasTracks plan as there is a need to complement and enhance the existing 16th Street MallRide.  It will accommodate the increased amount of passengers due to the completion of the West Rail lines and other projects.  Lacy explained that the service was originally planned as a continuous service but a reevaluation showed that the circulator service is only needed during peak hours.  They expect that 80% of the circulator’s ridership will be transfers from other RTD services.  Since RTD has a free transfer policy, the majority of riders would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a fare free service.

Staff anticipates that based on peak period service, the circulator will operate from 6:00 – 9:00 a.m. in the morning and 3:00 – 6:00 p.m. in the afternoon.  The cost for operations and maintenance will be $830,000 per year.

Director Lasater stated that he met with staff member earlier to discuss this item; when he was on the E-470 Public Highway Board payment was on a per-mile basis.  As an outsider to RTD, he thought the MallRide was originally paid for by the downtown merchants or a business improvement district that contributed to it.  He knew that it was free for the riders but thought it was paid by someone other than RTD tax payers.   He would like the Board to consider creating both the circulator and MallRide on a per use basis.  There are still 20% of riders that do not come from other areas and therefore would be paying to ride the services.  He explained that when the Public Highway Board raised tolls, the number of users went down but revenue went up.  He believes this would be the same situation on the circulator.  If we are subsidizing this service for approximately three quarters of a million dollars or more, coupled with the free mall shuttle, even 50 cents could make a difference.  Riders can choose to walk or pay for the privilege of the ride.  Director Lasater does not feel this is a good recommendation; he thinks we could provide better service in our bus system if these services were not subsidized.

Director Daly asked for explanation of what the Bus Bulbs are.  Lacy stated that the bus bulbs purpose is to bring the passengers to the bus instead of making the bus move to the sidewalk to get the passengers.  They are curved extensions that allow the bus to stay in the travel lane for the bus stop and the bus doesn’t have to wait to get back into traffic.

Director Menten applauded Director Lasater for bringing up the issue of riders paying their share for what they are using.  Director Menten noted that the original ballot text does mention increasing bus service but does not expressly say anything about the circulator.  She wanted to know if the transit expansion plan is one single document or several created over the years. Marla Lien said she will send the document to Director Menten.

Director James thanked Director Lasater for the comment about E-470.  He thinks that the mall shuttle and the circulator are different from E-470.  The frequency and efficiency of the service is what makes it very difficult to charge a fare.  The subsidy per passenger for the mall shuttle, even with the free fare, is a fraction of the lowest subsidy capacity experienced in other routes.   The circulator is anticipated to have a subsidy similar to the mall shuttle.  It is more cost effective to not charge a fare for the service.  Bill Van Meter stated that some of the considerations for this recommendation are that attempting to collect a fare would slow down the service due to the number of stops and the large volume of passengers.  80% plus of the riders on the circulator are passengers that would have already paid or will be paying a fare to RTD and our current fare policy accommodates free transfers so they would have the service for free anyway.  They have done an analysis based on the projected ridership; because of the peak period only services keeping the costs down, they anticipate the subsidy per passenger is in the same range as the mall shuttle which is the most effective service in terms of low subsidy per rider.

Committee Chair Hoy stated “I came into this process on this particular issue thinking that we should probably charge a fare too, but the practicality of this is just that it is impractical.  Too many people are getting on and off the bus, 80% of them would not pay a fare anyway; as a result we would be collecting fares from part of 20% because we don’t require people to go past the driver on those buses.  The riders just hop on and hop off and go a block or two. There is no way for any supervision; as a result I decided that perhaps the free fare is certainly something that we can at least start out with and maybe down the road we can explore different opportunities.”

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED to the Recommended Action.

#### 1. FasTracks Public Information Update

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager, stated that they will be giving a presentation about the FasTracks Public Information (PI) Team.

Pauletta Tonilas, PI Manager, stated that they have two new PI specialists.  She introduced Deborah Mendez-Wilson and Tara Miller.   They will be focusing on the four strategic priorities described in the presentation was included in the May 14, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Pauletta shared that the PBS TV Channel 12 Special called “FasTracks Moving Forward” will air on May 14 at 9:30 p.m., May 16 at 12:30 a.m., June 21 at 11:59 p.m., and June 23 at 9:30 p.m.  This is a half an hour program which includes both of the videos RTD developed on how FasTracks came to life, the challenges faced and the impact on the region.

PI will be conducting a Public Opinion Survey from May 29 to June 7.  The findings will be presented to the Board in late June or early July.  FasTracks PI staff will also work with HNTB on the Northwest Area Mobility Study which will kick off in June with a telephone town hall.  The first update for the Board should be in July.

With regard to Social Media, RTD-FasTracks.com registered a large increase in visits.  This includes visits from 140 countries with the top (excluding the US) being Canada (928), Mexico (649), UK (557), India (296) and Colombia (294).  Visits from the top states (excluding Colorado) include California (5,885), New York (3,839), Texas (3,234), Washington State (2,036) and Illinois (1,774).

RTD Facebook’s page received 9,060 like in April and 3,500 through May.  Staff believes this jump is due to the promotion inviting people to “Like” RTD’s page in exchange for two free ride coupons.  They have also seen an increase on Flickr.

Going forward for 2013, staff will continue to provide the Board of Directors’ Guest Columns and provide the quarterly FasTracks Progress Fact Sheet; on May 15 they will host the Media Working Group; the Public Opinion Survey will be conducted between May and June; they will have Board Communications Trainings in June or July; on June 6 they will conduct the Regional PIO Briefing; the Northwest Area Mobility Study’s telephone town hall will be in June; and In the fall the telephone town halls for all districts will take place.

Director Hoy thanked them for the presentation.

Director Menten asked for the questions for the public opinion survey to be provided to the Board before they go out to the public.  Pauletta stated that they will send it to the Board members.

Director Deadwyler thanked the team for going out and taking over a presentation she had to do when she was sick.  She appreciates their support.

Director Hoy asked who owns the PBS spot.  Pauletta stated that RTD owns it.  She explained that we utilized some of their expertise and studio time.  Pauletta said that her team would make sure to distribute copies to the Board.

Director James noted that the PBS spot makes him think about some conversations he has had with Scott Reed regarding the Colorado Public Radio (CPR).  He thinks this is perhaps an untapped resource and asked for other Board members feedback.  Scott Reed stated that they have approached CPR several times but we do not have funding for paid advertising.  Tony McCaulay has met with them several times but so far they have not wanted to work within our funding capacity.  They are scheduled to meet with CPR again this summer.

Director Solano mentioned that he is part of the Advisory Council for the 760AM Weekend Wisdom radio program.  He has been working with them to promote RTD.  Pauletta stated that they can help with that.

Pauletta stated that Brenda Tierney, who was the public information manager on the West Line, is now moving with Jim Starling to the North Metro Line.  Director Hoy stated that he is pleased with this as they are a great team.
