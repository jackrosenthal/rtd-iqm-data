Approval of the Downtown Denver Circulator
Fare-Free Service Plan

Board Meeting Date: May 14, 2013

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve the
Downtown Denver Circulator bus service plan including fare-free operations beginning in 2014.
BACKGROUND
The 2004 voter-approved FasTracks Plan included funding for a Downtown Denver Circulator (Circulator)
bus transit project to complement and enhance the existing 16th Street FREE MallRide. The Circulator is
a critical element to the implementation of the FasTracks Plan as the MallRide will not be able to
accommodate the increase in passengers from the addition of the US 36 BRT and the West, East, Gold,
North Metro, and Northwest Rail Lines.
Since the adoption of the original FasTracks Plan in 2004, RTD has worked with the City and County of
Denver to refine the plan for the Circulator. The long-range vision for the Circulator is all-day operations
along 18th and 19th Streets and Broadway and Lincoln Street between Denver Union Station (DUS) and
the Denver Art Museum area south of Colfax Avenue. The service is planned to operate in mixed-flow
traffic with transit priority measures such as bus bulbs, dedicated stops, a bus/bike/HOV lane, and
multiple-door, fare-free boarding.
In the short-term, RTD is recommending that the Circulator operate during the weekday peak periods
only with five minute headway based service between DUS and Civic Center. The peak period
operations are necessary to prevent overcrowding of the MallRide with the opening of DUS. The
MallRide will continue to have adequate capacity to accommodate the normal mid-day and weekend
transit ridership demand. The Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide and service levels can be
increased when the MallRide is expected to be overcrowded, including for special events. Therefore, it
is necessary for the Circulator to also offer free service in order to attract customers from the
overcrowded MallRide.
DISCUSSION
Fare-free service is recommended for the Circulator due to a number of characteristics unique to the
Circulator.
These characteristics are outlined below and were the basis for the fare-free
recommendation.
1. The Circulator is a regional service that provides a benefit for the entire District. A recent passenger
survey on the MallRide indicated that 40% of the passengers are from outside of the City of Denver.
The Circulator is anticipated to have a similar or greater percentage of non-Denver residents due to
the primary function being the last mile connection for commuters arriving downtown from other
RTD services that serve the entire District.
2. The Circulator will provide the last mile connection from the new FasTracks projects to the major
employment center in the region. The Circulator and MallRide are necessary for the design of a

Packet Pg. 4

1.C.1

major transit hub at the edge of downtown to work. The service needs to be fast and convenient for
passengers to transfer modes for the last mile of their trip.
3. There is a parallel free service with the MallRide two blocks away serving the same travel pattern.
Since the Circulator will be supplementary to the MallRide, any passengers who would have to pay
the fare would likely opt to not pay a fare and instead take the MallRide.
4. The Circulator ridership is anticipated to be over 80% transfers to or from other RTD services. RTD
has a free transfer policy so the majority of riders would not have to pay a fare even if it was not a
free service. As such, the cost of charging a fare would far exceed the fare revenue collected.
In addition to the characteristics outlined above, the operations of the Circulator would make it difficult
to collect a fare. Multiple-door, fare-free boarding is considered the most important transit priority
measure for the Circulator as it has the greatest impact on reducing travel times and increasing the
reliability of the service. Charging a fare and allowing multiple-door boarding would require off-board
fare collection or a policy that all passengers needing to pay a fare would have to board at the front
door. These options would be very difficult and costly to enforce. If the Circulator cannot operate with
multiple-door boarding, it would not be any different than a standard RTD Local route and other
alternatives such as increasing service on existing downtown routes such as the 0 and 15L should be
considered.
A preliminary Title VI review of the service plan and fare policy reveals an equitable impact with respect
to race, color, national origin and income. The analysis will be completed and submitted to the FTA six
months in advance of the Circulator’s commencement of operation. Once the FTA provides feedback on
the completed equity analysis, the Planning Department will finalize the analysis and seek RTD Board
approval (as required per FTA Guidance).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The opening day Circulator service plan is anticipated to cost $830,000 per year for operations and
maintenance (O&M). This is based on peak period service, six hours per weekday, between DUS and
Civic Center and fare-free operations. The O&M for the Circulator will be paid for from FasTracks.
Charging a fare would result in an increase in the O&M required to operate the Circulator and an increase
in annual Circulator O&M would have a negative impact on the rest of the FasTracks Program.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the Circulator service plan including fare-free operations beginning in
2014.
2. Approve the opening of the Circulator as a fare service in 2014. This is not recommended for the
reasons outlined in the Discussion section and would negatively impact the FasTracks financial plan.
In addition, this option could require additional capital investments for fare equipment that are not
included in the Circulator project.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the Circulator service plan to begin in
2014. This is not recommended as the Circulator is a commitment in the FasTracks plan and a
necessary element to ensure the success of the other projects. Without the Circulator, the MallRide
will be overcrowded which would require RTD to increase service levels on existing downtown routes
such as the 0 and 15L. The Base System is not able to absorb the increased O&M costs associated
with this alternative. In addition, this alternative would require additional buses for these routes

which have not been programed. The Circulator project was awarded a $3.9 Million FASTER grant
for purchasing buses and this money would be lost if the Circulator is not implemented.
