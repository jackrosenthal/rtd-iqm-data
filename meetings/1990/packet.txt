Board Meeting Date: December 16, 2014

Subject:

Englewood art Shuttle

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to enter into a Cost
Sharing Agreement with the City of Englewood to provide RTD financial support for the operation of the
art circulator bus service in the City of Englewood. This agreement is for calendar year 2015 and is for
an amount not to exceed $282,000.00.
BACKGROUND
In 2003 the City of Englewood applied for and received a Congestion Mitigation Air Quality (CMAQ)
Grant for a circulator bus service. This grant was approved with funding available 2004-2007. CMAQ
funds were approved for 80% of the cost of the service. RTD contributed 10% of the expense and the
City of Englewood contributed 10%. The art shuttle was implemented in 2004 as a free service. In
September 2007, with the expiration of the CMAQ grant, the RTD took over funding of the art shuttle
because the high ridership exceeded RTD’s expectations. The City of Englewood continues the
management and marketing of the art shuttle. The City of Englewood covers all marketing and related
expenses. The art shuttle continues to be a free service that is sponsored by the City of Englewood.
The City of Englewood reimburses RTD for the fares that would have been paid if the art shuttle charged
a RTD fare.
The art shuttle currently operates from 6:30 AM to 6:30 PM on weekdays. There is no service on
Saturdays, Sundays or holidays. The shuttle operates between the Englewood light rail station and
Swedish Medical Center/Craig Hospital. The art shuttle operates as a free shuttle on a fifteen (15)
minute frequency. Ridership has averaged 688.3 boardings per day or 28.8 passengers per hour.

DISCUSSION
RTD shall contribute funding to the City of Englewood to support the operation of the art shuttle in an
amount not to exceed $282,000 in 2015.
This Agreement will be for a period of one year. The performance of the art shuttle will be assessed at
the end of the year to determine if performance expectations have been met and to determine if
continuation of the cost sharing agreement is warranted. Performance will be evaluated in terms of
RTD’s service standards. If it appears that service performance will not warrant continuation, RTD and
the City of Englewood will confer on modifications to the service in order to bring it into conformance.
The provision of art shuttle service through the 3rd Quarter in 2014 resulted in 28.8 passengers per hour
and an RTD subsidy per art shuttle passenger trip of $1.43. For comparison, the boardings for RTD local
fixed route service in 2012 ranged from an average of 34.6 boardings per hour for CBD local routes to an
average of 17.7 boardings per hour for suburban local service. The City of Englewood will continue to
pay for all fares for the art shuttle.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for RTD support of the art shuttle were included in the approved 2015 RTD budget. Nothing
herein obligates the RTD to renew or extend this Agreement.

ALTERNATIVES
1.
Approve the cost sharing agreement with the City of Englewood for the art shuttle circulator bus
service so that the City of Englewood can continue to provide this service to the residents,
visitors and businesses in the City of Englewood.
2.
Do not approve the cost sharing agreement. This course of action is not recommended as it may
result in a reduction to or elimination of the art shuttle circulator service.

Subject:

Longmont Fare Buy Up

BACKGROUND
In early 2014, Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of Longmont requested that they be allowed to
“buy up” all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont felt that
one of the major reasons that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The
objective of this action was to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County and RTD entered into an agreement for Boulder County to reimburse the RTD $209,400 on
an annual basis for fares on the 300 series local routes and any additional dollars for Access-a-Ride trips that
fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300 series routes. This dollar amount was established
based on 300 series fare revenue from 2012. Originally, this program request was for a two year period.
However, the FTA felt that this might constitute a fare change which would require a fare analysis. The
program was scaled back to a 6 month promotional period that would run from July-December 2014. The
original Board action noted that this was for a 6 month period that could be extended an additional 18
months if Boulder County could receive FTA approval for the entire 2 year period. The FTA subsequently
ruled that this program did not require a fare analysis as it was a “Buy Up” and not a fare change. As a result
this program will be extended through June 2016. As previously discussed, there will be no fares for any
passenger boarding any 300 series route. All passengers will be allowed unlimited boarding’s on all 300
Series routes, in both directions, throughout the day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct are
the same as if passengers were paying fares. Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law
enforcement will continue to have the discretion to refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will
compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued to any passengers requesting a transfer. This
program will not include the Call-n-Ride or regional routes operating within Longmont. The purpose of the
program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within their thresholds; any new cost will be
borne by Boulder County. The local agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, have
performed the majority of the marketing and publicity for this program with the approval of RTD Marketing.
Overall the program has been doing very well. RTD performed the annual customer service survey for the
District in October 2014, at which time we made some modifications to capture additional information in
Longmont regarding the Fare Buy Up Program. This data will be available in 2015 spring and should help us
breakdown ridership statistics and identify new riders as opposed to current riders using the system more
frequently. Before the Buy Up, ridership was a little more than 600 boarding’s per day. An upward swing of
ridership was evident before the program started in July 2014. The chart below shows boardings for 2013
and 2014. The Buy Up Program began in July 2014.

Concern that the Call-n-Ride ridership numbers would decrease due to no fares being charged on the 300
series routes has not materialized. Call-n-Ride boarding numbers are actually higher in 2014 than 2013.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
There continues to be no financial impact to the RTD.
