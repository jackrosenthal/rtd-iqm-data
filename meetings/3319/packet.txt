BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022

Sales and Use Tax Forecast

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD’s Fiscal Policy requires that:
RTD will contract with a qualified, independent third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts.
As such, RTD has contracted with the Business Research Division of the University of Colorado Leeds
School of Business (CU Leeds) to provide semi-annual sales and use tax forecast model reports in March
and September to coincide with the development of RTD’s annual budget and six-year Mid-term
Financial Plan (MTFP). The provision of the forecast model report is followed by a presentation to the
Board by CU Leeds in April and October.
DISCUSSION
The September 2021 sales and use tax forecast was included in the 2022 Budget. The March 2022
sales and use tax forecast will be included in the 2023-2028 MTFP.
The March 2022 Forecast Model Report reflects a projected improvement from the September 2021
forecast in RTD’s sales and use taxes as follows:

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Executive Summary
While the pandemic-induced recession had a swift, negative impact on RTD sales and use taxes in
2020, retail sales staged a speedy recovery that lifted RTD sales and use taxes to record levels. From
January 2021 through January of 2022, RTD posted record revenue for each respective month in the
series going back to 1980. Revenue swung from a 4.1% decline in 2020 to 19.6% growth in 2021.

RTD revenues are collected primarily within seven metropolitan counties (the “district”): Adams,
Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson, as well as a portion of Weld County.
Colorado and the Denver Metro region posted strong, above average economic growth following the
2007-2009 “Great Recession.” RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax growth
averaging 5.9% between 2010 and 2019. The pandemic recession created a drop in GDP, led to an
unprecedented decline in employment, and caused a sharp decrease in RTD revenue. The economy,
labor market, and RTD revenue are all in recovery mode.
A model was developed to examine fundamental relationships between U.S. and Colorado economic
growth, and between Colorado and the district. It forecasts short-term, medium-term, and longterm RTD sales and use tax revenue, and accounts for economic and demographic (e.g., population
age) shifts over time.
Economic Update
•

•

•

The economic recovery from the pandemic-induced recession in 2020 has been remarkable
in terms of output and income, but the labor market recovered more slowly. Total domestic
employment will return to pre-pandemic levels in 2022.
Real (inflation-adjusted) U.S. GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of
2.3% in Q3 2021 and 7% in Q4 2021. Real GDP in the second quarter reached a new peak,
rising 0.8% above the prior peak recorded in the first quarter of 2021. Real (inflationadjusted) GDP is projected to increase 2.3% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023.
Despite the recession and record losses in employment and in wage and salary income,
personal income posted strong gains in 2020 and 2021 due to a record increase in
government transfer receipts (e.g., unemployment benefits, household stimulus checks).

Transfer receipts have decreased with waning government stimulus, but governmentsupported income is now being replaced with record levels of employee earnings, leading to
record personal income.
The personal savings rate spiked to record levels during the recession and remains elevated,
increasing the potential for continued strength in consumption.
Nationally, employment remained down 1.4% from the prior peak as of February 2022, but
Colorado employment was comparatively better at -0.2% as of January. The national
unemployment rate dropped to 3.8% in February, while Colorado’s rate dropped to 4.1%
(January). Colorado had the 4th-highest labor force participation rate in the country in
January.
Nationally, inflation increased 7.9% year-over-year in February 2022.

Short-Term Outlook
•

•

•

•
•
•

•
•

RTD sales and use tax revenue increased 6% in 2018 and 4% in 2019. Revenue subsequently
declined by 4.1% in 2020 due to the pandemic but rebounded 19.6% in 2021 to $757 million.
Revenue is projected to increase 5.6% in 2022 and 3.9% in 2023.
Colorado employment is projected to increase 2.2% in 2022 and 1.8% in 2023. Statewide
total personal income was unaffected by the recession due to government assistance, and
the unemployment rate continues to decrease as the labor market recovers.
The forecasting model also provides information on uncertainty that is inherent in any
forecast through construction of confidence bounds on total RTD revenues. The mean
forecast for 2022 of $799 million is bracketed by 67% confidence bounds of $755 million on
the low side and $842 million for the upper bound.
The mean forecast for 2023 is $830 million, bound by a lower bound of $778 million and an
upper bound of $880 million.
The 67% upper- and lower-bound estimates illustrate the broad uncertainty behind
economic conditions that pose upside opportunities and downside risks to the forecast.
Quarterly growth exhibits more volatility than annual growth, and use taxes are more
volatile than sales taxes. The third and fourth quarters tend to be the largest revenue
quarters for RTD.
Forecasts of national indicators that are used to drive state and district forecasts come from
Moody’s Analytics.
For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been above the actual revenue 73
times and below the actual revenue 90 times, and a simple average of the error has been 0.9%.

Medium-Term Outlook
•
•

The impact of COVID-19 on the retail and restaurant industries, employment, income, and
tourism weighed heavily on retail sales activity.
The past two post-recession recovery periods lasted 4.5 years and 4.75 years, before RTD
revenues returned to their previous revenue peaks. However, RTD surpassed the prior
revenue peak after just over a year from the onset of the recession in 2020 due to both the
nature of the recession and the government response.

Modeling three economic scenarios helps to accommodate the broad uncertainty
surrounding the U.S. economy. These scenarios may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD
revenue growth over the medium-term period; the greatest variation in forecasts occurs
during the first three years.
Under the baseline scenario, RTD total tax revenues are projected to grow by 36.2%
between 2021 and 2028, reaching $1.03 billion by the end of the medium-term horizon.
A more optimistic scenario under which the national economy experiences a faster rebound
yields cumulative revenues 2.5% higher than the baseline scenario over the medium-term
horizon; however, the 2028 total is 2.1% above the baseline forecast.
A second alternative scenario in which the national economy experiences slower growth in
the near term yields a cumulative forecast 3.1% below the baseline scenario.
There are higher inflationary pressures caused by excess household savings, high commodity
prices, and a sudden tightening of the labor market.

Long-Term Outlook
•

•

•

After revenue growth of 4.8% for the decade ending in 2020 (in current, nominal dollars),
revenue projections for the next three decades average 5.3% (2021–2030), 2.8% (2031–
2040), and 1.8% (2041–2050); the 30-year average is 3.3% (2021–2050).
Long-term revisions are due, in part, to higher expectations in the short-term forecast that
increased the revenue base early in the long-term forecast. Downward revisions for
population growth decreased revenue projections late in the long-term forecast.
The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates population growth and shifts in the age
distribution of the population as key factors influencing the rate of growth in output,
employment, and sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Project Overview

The BRD collaborates with the RTD administration to forecast sales and use tax revenues, and to
identify the key drivers that will impact RTD’s tax revenue stream. Since project inception, the BRD
research team has been working closely with the RTD administration to better understand the
existing forecast system, to collect and organize relevant data, and to develop the three sets of
projections.
This report presents the revenue projections at the three forecast horizons, with some discussion of
the economic forces driving these forecasts. The model uses vector autoregression (VAR) techniques
in order to capture a mix of long-term, stable relationships, as well as short-term “deviations” from
these long-term trends. These relationships connect RTD tax revenue components to key
macroeconomic drivers, such as retail sales. The methodology is described in detail in the main body
of this report.
RTD revenue data is available through January 2022; state retail sales and state taxable sales are
available through December 2021. Data after these dates represent forecasts. Additional revenue
from medical and retail marijuana sales are in the RTD receipts. Adjustments to the model were
necessary to accommodate the gap year (July 1, 2017–June 30, 2018) in retail marijuana collections
caused by Senate Bill 17-267. As such, RTD taxable sales in this report are based on RTD sales tax
revenues excluding retail marijuana taxes. Therefore, these data are actually RTD taxable sales
excluding marijuana sales. However, the forecasts reported for RTD sales tax revenues include the
forecasts of RTD retail marijuana revenues. This construction was necessary to produce a series
without the discontinuity over the period from July 2017 through June 2018 to produce reasonable
revenue forecasts.
In 2016, revenue from Electronic Shopping and Mail-Order Houses (i.e., ecommerce) became a
significant contributor to RTD’s sales tax revenue. Ecommerce accounted for over 8% of the total
sales taxes collected in 2020.
Given the pandemic recession’s impact on specific sectors of the economy, the BRD began modeling
major components of RTD’s sales taxes (e.g., restaurants, auto sales, ecommerce, grocery, etc.).
Modeling the components of retail sales taxes produces forecasts that accommodate the volatility in
the subcomponents.
The methodology and model descriptions may be found in Appendix A.

In an effort to provide consistent and accurate RTD revenue forecasts, a new sales and use tax
forecasting system was commissioned in 2010. The Business Research Division (BRD) of the Leeds
School of Business at the University of Colorado Boulder was contracted to develop a model for
projecting RTD revenues over the short term (2023), medium term (2028), and long term (2050).
This model has been regularly updated and fine-tuned to portray best-available revenue forecasts
that are specific to Colorado’s Front Range economy.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Forecasts: Short Term, Medium Term and Long Term
Short-Term Forecasts

All equations are estimated using monthly data to produce monthly forecasts that are aggregated
into quarterly or yearly data. Historical data for Colorado and national economic variables were
retrieved in March 2022, with much of the data current through 2021. RTD revenue data and state
retail sales and taxable sales data are current through January 2022. All reported data after these
dates are forecasts.
The short-term forecast relies on the S2 Scenario from Moody’s Analytics. These national
macroeconomic indicators drive the forecasts of the Colorado economy.
Colorado Economy Forecasts
As background to the revenue forecasts, data on Colorado economic indicators are presented in
Table 1. Key indicators of Colorado economic activity show the COVID-19 economy in 2020, the
rebound in 2021, and the forecast for 2022 and 2023. The unemployment rate averaged 7.3% in
2020 and improved to an average of 5.9% for the 12 months of 2021. The rate is projected to
improve to 5.4% in 2022 and 5% in 2023. Personal income grew in 2020 despite the record loss in
employment and employee earnings. Personal income growth continued in 2021 with stimulus early
in the year and rebounding wage and salary income. Moderate nominal income growth is projected
in the medium-term, but real income growth will be comparatively lower due to inflation.

Annual Tax Revenue Forecasts
The following table presents the expected changes in RTD base sales tax revenues and the driving
force behind these changes: taxable sales. From 2010 through 2019, district taxable sales recorded
10 consecutive years of growth averaging 6.1%. Taxable sales fell 3% in 2020 but increased 20% in
2021. District taxable retail sales are projected to increase at a comparatively modest pace in 2022
(5.6%) and 2023 (3.3%). Sales tax revenues are anticipated to change in stride, falling 2.6% in 2020,
but rebounding 19.8% in 2021. Revenue is projected to increase 5.4% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023.

Summary: Following the Great Recession, RTD recorded 10 consecutive years of sales and use tax
growth averaging 5.9% (2010-2019). The pandemic-induced recession caused RTD sales and use tax
revenue to decline 4.1% in 2020, recording year-over-year losses for nine months in 2020. RTD posted
growth of 19.6% year-over-year in 2021, with projections of 5.6% growth in 2022 and 3.9% in 2023.

The Short-Term Use Tax Revenue Forecast
In this model, use tax revenues are directly related to Colorado use tax collections reflecting the
broader geographical base for the use tax. Households and businesses residing within the district but
purchasing taxable goods outside the district are required to pay a use tax on these purchases at the
same rate as the sales tax. Illustrating the volatility, use tax revenues fell 1.1% in 2015, but increased
7.5% in 2016, 4.6% in 2017, and 25.7% in 2018 before falling 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020. Use
taxes rebounded in 2021, increasing 17%. The forecast calls for continued growth in 2022 (7.7%) and
2023 (10.1%). The volatility of use taxes is apparent in both annual and quarterly data.

Upper- and Lower-Bound Estimates for Baseline Forecast
The previous tables present only medium-level forecasts, which should be interpreted as the mean
values within a range of probable outcomes. All forecasting exercises involve elements of
uncertainty, although information about possible forecast errors is seldom presented. Uncertainty
arises from the errors in equation specification and estimation, and from the forecasts of the
national variables that drive the state variables. Although information on the latter source of
uncertainty is not available, the probabilistic high and low forecast bounds that incorporate possible
errors in fitting the equations are presented. The values of the high and low forecast bounds are
computed as 67% confidence bounds, meaning that a 0.67 probability exists that the interval
between low and high forecast values will contain the actual value of the variable being predicted.
The following table displays the 67% confidence bounds on total RTD revenues through 2023. The
wide 67% confidence interval reflects uncertainty. The possible range is as low as $755 million and as
high as $842 million for 2022. The 2021 lower and upper bounds range -5.5% to +5.4% relative to the
medium forecast. The confidence bound widens in 2023 with greater uncertainty. The 2022 upperand lower-bound estimates are -6.3% and +6.1% different than the medium baseline forecast,
showing greater uncertainty one year out. This shows that it is not impossible or unrealistic that
revenue could grow stronger over the next year relative to the medium forecast, as well as the
exposure to the downside risk posed by economic threats.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Two alternative scenarios produce variations in the short-term revenue forecast (1-3 years), but
growth rates generally converge in the medium term (7 years). An alternative scenario in which the
national economy experiences a stronger short-term growth pattern yields a 39.1% increase from
2021-2028. Under stronger economic conditions, this scenario out-produces the baseline scenario
nearly every year of the medium-term forecast. In the second alternative, in which the economy
grows more slowly in the short run, there is a 34.7% increase between 2021 and 2028, with slower
growth recorded in the first two years. The differences in the cumulative revenue from 2021 to 2028
illustrate the impact of slower and faster growth in the short run. The optimistic scenario produces
cumulative (2021-2028) revenue $159 million above the baseline scenario, and the pessimistic
scenario produces cumulative revenue $196 million below the baseline scenario. These alternative
scenarios allow for a reasonable degree of uncertainty about possible outcomes for the U.S. economy
and may be taken as plausible bounds on RTD revenue growth over the medium-term period.
The BRD short-term forecasting model is adapted to produce forecasts over the medium-term
horizon through 2028. This time frame has been chosen to conform to the RTD investment planning
horizon for FasTracks. The specifications of the equations for these medium-term forecasts are the
same as for the short-term model, and these are also estimated with monthly data.
Over any medium-term period, the U.S. economy can be subjected to shocks producing outcomes
that are difficult to anticipate. One reasonable way to present forecasts that incorporate the
uncertainty about future policy or unpredictable economic shocks is to develop results for
alternative scenarios. In addition to a baseline case, two alternative outcomes are presented: one
allowing for stronger growth than the selected baseline and the other assuming generally slower
economic growth. As an alternative method of incorporating uncertainty into the forecast, statisticsbased confidence bounds for the baseline scenario are also generated, producing high- and lowforecast bounds based on 67% confidence intervals.
Baseline Sales and Use Tax Revenue Forecasts
The Baseline RTD forecast is based on macroeconomic conditions described by Moody’s Analytics in
the “Alternative Scenario 2 – Downside – 75th Percentile”. Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 2 –
Downside – 75th Percentile” is constructed with a 75% probability that the U.S. economy will
perform better and a 25% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes that COVID-19
cases, hospitalizations, and deaths rise more than expected and infections abate by June 2022. As a
result, consumer spending on air travel, retail, and hotels is reduced and resumes slowly. In addition,
supply chain issues resolve slower than anticipated, keeping inflation elevated, and unemployment
begins to increase again in the latter half of 2022. A return to full employment will occur by the
fourth quarter of 2023. The Fed commits to keeping interest rates near zero until the end of 2022.
Real GDP grows 2.3% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023; the average through the medium-term forecast is
2.5%. The unemployment rate falls below 5% in 2023. After an unprecedented performance in 2021,
retail sales increase more moderately through the medium term.

Despite the recession, Colorado retail sales grew 4.9% in 2020 and 14.7% in 2021. Modest growth is
projected for 2022 (1.5%), followed by strong growth; the simple average of 3.5% is projected for
the medium-term forecast horizon. In the medium-term forecast, state retail sales growth
outperforms the nation every year of the forecast period beginning in 2023.
Colorado personal income growth is projected to increase 1.5% in 2022. The annual average
unemployment rate in 2022 improves to 5.4%, and total employment grows 2.2%. The employment
rebound surpasses the prior peak in early 2022. With rebounding employment and wages, and
elevated wealth and savings, retail sales continue to advance.

RTD use tax revenue fell 16% in 2019 and 20.4% in 2020 but rebounded 17% in 2021. Two strong
years of growth are projected in 2022 (7.7%) and 2023 (10.1%), followed by more modest increases.
Simple average growth of 4.3% is projected over the medium-term forecast horizon from 2022-2028.
With 90% of RTD tax revenues coming from sales tax, the yearly changes in total revenues closely
track those for sales tax revenues.

In this baseline scenario, the mean forecast in the BRD model calls for a 36.2% increase in total RTD
revenues from 2021 to 2028. Allowing for uncertainty in the model estimation and equation errors,
67% confidence bounds can be estimated. These interval forecasts show a lower-bound increase of
25.6% in RTD revenues for the 2021−2028 forecast period and a 46.3% increase in the high-range
forecast.

As an alternative approach to incorporating economic uncertainty into the forecasts, the next
section describes two scenarios that examine the implications of potentially divergent shocks to the
national economy—one positive and one negative—for district taxable sales and RTD tax revenues.

Optimistic Scenario
The BRD selected the Moody’s “Baseline Forecast” to represent a more optimistic outcome over the
coming four years. Moody’s Baseline Forecast is constructed with a 50% probability that the U.S.
economy will perform better and a 50% probability that it will underperform. This scenario assumes
that COVID-19 cases have peaked, and that COVID-19 infections abate in April and will then be
endemic and seasonal. The Fed moves to increase interest rates 0.25 basis points in March and three
additional times each quarter by 0.25 basis points each time. Some of the $1.2 trillion Build Back
Better fiscal package will occur by the second quarter. A key risk to this forecast is a significant
tightening of financial and economic conditions and the uncertainty around how rate hikes and
quantitative tightening will play out. Additional downside risks to this forecast include another spike
in COVID cases, labor constraints, inflation, and constrained supply chains that slow the economic
recovery.
Real GDP grows 3.5% in 2022 and 3.1% in 2023; the average through the medium-term forecast is
2.6%. The unemployment rate improves to 3.6% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023. After an unprecedented
performance in 2021, retail sales increase more moderately through the medium term.

Pessimistic Scenario
Moody’s “Alternative Scenario 3 – Downside – 90th Percentile” is constructed with a 90% probability
that the U.S. economy will perform better and a 10% probability that it will underperform. This
slower-growth scenario is caused by a resurgence in COVID cases that causes some local and state
governments to impose restrictions, which significantly impacts consumer spending on travel,
tourism, and retail. This causes a recession in the second half of 2022 with consumer confidence
falling and unemployment rising. The economy doesn’t return to full employment until the first
quarter of 2027. The Fed keeps the fed funds rate near 0% until the end of 2025.
Real GDP increases 0.9% 2022 but declines 0.4% in 2023; the medium-term average is 2.2%. The
unemployment rate increases to 7.6% in 2023 before declining. In this scenario, retail sales grow
moderately after the slump in 2022 and 2023.

The timing of future revenue changes differs across the three scenarios. This difference reveals how
revenues may shift, but they eventually end up relatively close to each other. The difference in total
RTD revenues between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios is 3.3% in 2027, but the cumulative
revenue differences are 5.7% between the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Long-Term Forecasts

Synopsis: Coming off a lower base for 2020 but a much stronger 2021, the March 2022 long-term
forecast reflects moderate growth in the first 10 years of the forecast horizon, slowing in the final
decade. Over the entire 30-year period, RTD’s total tax revenues in nominal (current dollar) terms are
projected to grow by 3.2% per year on average, while the real (inflation adjusted) growth rate is
0.8%.
This forecast is for three decades: 2021–2030, 2031–2040, and 2041–2050.
National Economic and Demographic Trends
Growth in real output (GDP) is positively related to the proportion of the population that is upper
middle age (30–49 and 50–64) as this group contributes highly productive workers to the labor force
due to their experience and training. Although population shares change slowly, over the period
2010–2030 the proportion of the population in this productive age group is projected to decline,
from 46.2% in 2010 to 43.6% in 2030, contributing to a slowing rate of growth in real output
between now and 2030. The prime population proportion then increases to 45% by 2050. However,
total population growth rates slow throughout the 30-year forecast period, reducing real output
growth rates with each advancing decade.
Figure 3

In addition to a slowing of total U.S. population growth over the next three decades, the differing
growth rates of key age groups will have negative effects on economic growth. Growth rates of the
most productive age group (30–64), as well as the total population, will be slower during the coming
decades compared with the previous 10-year period (Table 22), producing some slowing in the rate
of growth in output. Across the three decades of the forecast period, growth in real GDP slows
considerably during the final decade compared with the periods from 2021–2030 and from 2031–

The BRD long-term forecasting model incorporates age shares of the population as a key factor
influencing the rate of growth in real output and in state and district sales that determine RTD sales
and use tax revenues. This model projects annual growth rates in real RTD tax revenues to 2050.

2040. (See the BRD forecast in Table 23; the Moody’s projections are presented only for comparison
with the BRD forecasts and do not play a role in the long-term BRD projections of any real variables
after 2027.) Growth in the current decade was distorted by the negative impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on the economy, and the strong growth that should follow in the recovery (although from
a markedly lower 2020 base). The demographic drag dampens growth in the final two decades of the
forecast horizon, partially offsetting the positive influences of increases in productivity and human
and physical capital that account for the long-run trend in GDP growth. During the final 10 years, the
share of the productive age group stabilizes, but the total population growth rate continues to
decline. The net effect of these demographic changes is a further decline in the real GDP growth rate
into the final decade of the forecast.

The BRD’s projected rate of growth in real GDP are below the Moody’s growth during the next three
decades. Over the 30-year forecast period, the BRD model projects 0.4% average growth and the
Moody’s model projects 1.1% average growth. The BRD forecast of retail sales growth is below
Moody’s for the forecast horizon.
Growth in U.S. retail sales is driven first by growth in output, which is then moderated by
demographic forces. The BRD forecasts show sluggish growth in retail sales during the last two
decades of the forecast (Table 24 reports rates of growth in real, inflation-adjusted terms).

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Both Moody’s and BRD forecast modest growth rates in each of the three forward-looking decades.
Notably, retail sales grow at a slower pace than GDP.

Following the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the economy early in the current decade, growth
rebounds for retail sales and taxable sales at the state and district levels. Over the long term, the
national economic environment is reflected in the Colorado forecast. The combined influence of
national economic forces and changing demographics leaves the state and the district with quite low
rates of growth in sales and taxable sales during the final decade of the forecast as shown in the
following tables and figures.
Colorado retail sales growth over the next three decades is slightly higher than for the nation.
Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales also tend to outperform national retail sales growth
(with the exception of RTD taxable sales in the final decade). The negative growth rates for RTD
taxable sales during the final decade reflects the persistent slowdown in total population growth in
Colorado, and especially in the district.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

This long-term forecast ends in 2050. During this period, retail activity faces demographic drag in the
state. The long-term average real growth rate for RTD taxable sales is 0.8%, reflecting the slow longterm (30-year) growth.
Looking at nominal growth rates in RTD taxable sales shown in Table 25, the decade from 2021-2030
and the following decade are expected to produce growth of 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. The
pattern of growth rates in Colorado taxable sales and RTD taxable sales are both consistent with that
of retail sales growth, with average growth rates for the last decade of the forecast (1.8%) being the
weakest for all three sales variables. These rates of growth for nominal sales appear in the next table

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Future RTD sales tax revenues are forecasted by multiplying the effective rate of taxation by the
district taxable sales forecasts. Assuming no further changes in the RTD effective tax rate beyond
those implied by the reinstatement of the vendor allowance, the rates of growth in RTD sales tax
revenues for 2016 and beyond are identical to those of district taxable sales. Since the use tax base
is not directly observable, it is still necessary to estimate an equation to forecast RTD use tax
revenues. In this equation, RTD use tax revenues are driven by Colorado use tax revenues and
indirectly by the value of single family residential building permits. Revenue forecasts in real and
nominal terms over the next three decades are summarized in the following tables and charts and in
Appendix A.

Actual RTD sales and use tax data are now available through January 2022, allowing for error
evaluation through the end of 2021. For the short-term forecast, the BRD estimates have been
above the actual revenue 73 times and below the actual revenue 90 times, and a simple average of
the error has been -0.9%, with a 4.7% standard deviation (including the rapid revenue swings during
the pandemic recession). The September 2021 forecast for Q3 and Q4 2021 were low by 2.4% and
8.1%, respectively, illustrating the rapid recovery of revenue in the second half of 2021. The shortterm and medium-term forecasts were revised upward in March 2022 (in part due to higher inflation
driving nominal revenue growth). The average 30-year forecast growth rate in nominal dollars
ending in 2050 is 0.03 percentage points lower than the September forecast.

Forecast Evaluation

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Three models have been developed and estimated for forecasting RTD sales and use tax revenues at
the short term (2023), medium term (2028), and long term (2050). All three models consist of
dynamic equations that link RTD district retail sales and sales and use tax revenues to underlying
national and state economic indicators. Forecasts of the national indicators that are needed to drive
the state and district forecasts come from Moody’s Analytics. Population projections that enter the
equations of the long-term model come from Moody’s Analytics and the Colorado Demography
Office. Colorado economy forecasts are derived from updated specifications of the Colorado
Economy Model.

Key Econometric Concepts
The equations of the RTD forecast model rely on modern techniques of econometric time series
analysis. Each equation specifies a dynamic relationship between two or more variables, capturing
both a long-run equilibrium relation and short-run dynamic adjustments toward this equilibrium.
Such equations are called error correction models (ECMs) and are a type of vector autoregression
(VAR) model. Following time series analysis traditions, these equations may embody complex
dynamic behavior that is based on rigorous examination of historical patterns in the data. Unlike
univariate (ARIMA) methods, which are sophisticated representations of trends and cycles, VAR
models include explanatory variables in each equation to allow persistent departures from trends
and possible turning points.
In the error correction model, a long-run equilibrium relation is joined with a short-run dynamic
adjustment mechanism. The long-run relation is called the cointegrating equation, which captures
the common trends in the variables of interest. For example, district taxable sales and state retail
sales are expected to move together as a result of common underlying economic processes; they are
therefore referred to as “cointegrated” variables. Naturally, one will observe short-run departures
from this common pattern, but with a tendency for one variable to adjust back toward the
equilibrium relation. For example, the district economy may lag behind changes in the Colorado
economy, but departures from the common trends governing these two variables will vanish within
several months. These dynamic adjustments back toward the equilibrium relation are captured by
the ECM.
This framework is illustrated with a simplified version of the relation between district taxable sales
(TXBLSALES_RTD) and retail sales of Colorado (TRDR_TTL).
DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD) = - 0.205*LOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.210*LOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) + 0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)) 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(-1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)) - 0.03745*@SEAS(1) + 0.040*@SEAS(5) 0.033*@SEAS(7) +4.125
Here DLOG( ) transforms any variable into its rate of change, so that the left hand side term is
interpreted as the rate of change in RTD taxable sales. Looking at the first two terms on the right
hand side, one sees that RTD taxable sales respond negatively to the level of taxable sales in the
previous period and positively to the previous period’s level of Colorado retail trade. These two

Appendix A: Models for the Three Forecast Horizons

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

A more complex adjustment back toward equilibrium is embodied in the following three terms on
the right hand side of the equation (- 0.512*DLOG(TXBLSALES_RTD(-1)) + 0.741*DLOG(TRDR_TTL) +
0.403*DLOG(TRDR_TTL(-1)). Past rates of change in RTD taxable sales and current plus past changes
in Colorado retail trade also impact the rate of adjustment in RTD taxable sales in the current period.
Additional independent variables, such as the price of gasoline (- 0.034*LOG(CPIUUS_GAS(1)/CPIUUS_TTL(-1)), can also be included in error correction equations, and this specification also
contains three seasonal dummy variables and a constant term.
This particular specification of lags and differences is the result of experimenting with various
alternatives and selecting the equation that meets standard diagnostic criteria, such as uncorrelated
residuals and statistically significant coefficients. For example, it is natural to allow all 12 months to
enter into the equation as seasonal variables, but only 3 of these were found to have statistically
significant effects. Similar cointegrating equations and ECMs are developed for the other key
variables in the RTD forecast model.
Since the ECM is expressed in rates of change, this is the natural form in which the forecasts of
district taxable sales can be generated. Given historical and forecasted values of all right-hand side
variables, the ECM produces forecasts of district taxable sales based on the forecasted month-tomonth changes.
Econometrics explicitly allows for random errors in the equations and in the estimation of their
coefficients. These sources of error will be reflected in the model’s forecasts, and the resulting
uncertainty can be estimated through simulation methods. This uncertainty is presented in the form
of interval forecasts given by the model’s mean forecast plus and minus one standard deviation of
the forecast error. The upper and lower bounds of these 67% confidence interval forecasts provide
statistically based high and low forecasts for each time period within the forecast horizon.

Comparisons and Linkages between the Three Models
All three models are grounded in the cointegration and ECM methodology, and all three generate
statistically based interval forecasts of RTD sales and use tax revenues. The short-term and mediumterm models are estimated using monthly data and produce forecasts at that same frequency. These
monthly forecasts of sales and use tax revenues are then aggregated to quarterly series for the
short-term forecasts and to annual data for the medium term.
The specifications of individual equations in the short-term and medium-term models are the same,
and therefore the baseline forecasts over a one-year horizon are identical. Variables and forecasts in
these two models are expressed in nominal values.
In order to forecast district level variables (e.g., RTD taxable sales, use tax revenues), it is necessary
to model and forecast economic variables at the state level. The Colorado Economy Model
previously developed for OSPB provides the framework for predicting state economic variables, such

terms capture the error correction mechanism: if RTD taxable sales are too high relative to the level
of Colorado retail trade, then TXBLSALES_RTD will tend to decline in the following period. In this
situation the relation between RTD taxable sales and Colorado retail sales is out of equilibrium,
requiring future adjustments to restore equilibrium between these two cointegrated variables.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

as Colorado retail trade and Colorado taxable sales. These key Colorado variables are driven by
corresponding national variables and related state series, such as personal income. The linkages
between the economic variables at the national, state, and district level are shown in the following
figure:
Figure 8

The primary drivers from the national economy are personal income, employment, and retail sales,
and these contribute to the determination of Colorado retail sales and, in turn, RTD taxable sales.
Given the effective rate of sales taxation, RTD sales tax revenues are then given by a simple algebraic
identity.
Recognizing that large shocks to the national economy are likely to occur at some time over the
seven-year forecast horizon, the possibility of such shocks is incorporated in the medium-term
forecast by the use of two alternative national economic scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. These
alternative scenarios allow for the possibility of faster economic growth in the near term in one case
and for slower long-term growth in the other. These scenarios also provide alternative bounds that
complement the statistically based lower-bound forecasts from the econometric model.
The long-term model equations are fundamentally different from those of the other models, and are
designed to capture gradual structural adjustments in the economy due to changing demographics.
This model relies on population projections from Moody’s Analytics and from the Colorado State
Demography Office to drive the forecasts of all real national economic variables, state and district
retail sales and taxable sales, and therefore RTD sales and use tax revenues. Whereas Moody’s
forecasts of national economic indicators are used to drive the short-term and medium-term
Colorado Economy Model forecasts, BRD researchers have developed equations for key national
variables for the long-term forecasts. Only Moody’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) forecast is used for
converting forecasts of real variables into nominal values in the long-term forecasts.
Higher inflation could have an impact on the RTD forecast. Currently, the real-dollar RTD forecast is
constructed as nominal dollars adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For most of the previous
decade, the inflation rate has been low – between 0.5% and 2.0% annually.

However, market disruptions and supply-chain discord associated with current events creates
additional risk of above trend and above target CPI. Year-over-year prices grew an average of 5.2%
from May through August 2021.

A combination of factors that may cause higher inflation within the next 12-24 months include:
•

Excess savings by households who remained employed during the pandemic. As the
economy continues to rebound, most households are expected to boost spending well
above historical averages. This abnormally high spending can create demand-pull inflation.

•

High commodity prices. Several staple commodities, such as copper, lumber, and wheat
reached all-time highs in 2021. This causes potential cost-push inflation. Such effects are
currently seen in home-construction costs.

•

Sudden tightening of labor markets. As the economy reopens, labor markets have tightened,
leading to wage growth. Wage growth is considered to be the largest contributor to
inflation. Even though national and state unemployment rates are higher than pre-pandemic
levels, many businesses face difficulties finding qualified and willing workers, and this has led
to wage increases especially for low wage workers.

The RTD forecast model currently incorporates annual US inflation that rises to 4.4% in 2021, with
Denver metro area inflation over 2.8% in 2022. The BRD team will continue to monitor the situation
and may adjust expected inflation when sufficient evidence emerges to suggest changing inflation
expectations.

The Input Data—Sources and Description
This section describes the data used to estimate equations and generate forecasts from the three
models. There are three levels of data: national variables, Colorado data, and district (RTD) data.
National Statistics and Forecasts: National data, such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. GDP figures, track
closely to state indicators. Typically, higher U.S. retail sales indicate higher retail sales in Colorado.
National statistics for GDP and retail sales are published frequently, and several forecasts for these

indicators are available. The Colorado Economy Model that drives the district level variables relies on
these national variables to forecast corresponding state variables.

•

U.S. Retail Sales: Obviously, this indicator tracks closely to Colorado’s retail sales. This
indicator, along with its forecasted levels, is a central part of the Colorado Economy Model
and the RTD district model.

•

The figure below shows the relationship between U.S. retail sales and Colorado retail sales
over the past two decades. The Colorado sales values are not seasonally adjusted (the U.S.
figures are), but the two series are clearly closely related. The data have been standardized
to show the common movement of the two variables. U.S. retail sales change direction at
the same time as Colorado retail trade. It can also be seen that, over time, the overall level
of trade trends diverge slightly for these two series. In 2000 through 2006, U.S. retail sales
were, for the most part, greater than Colorado sales, but from 2009 to 2020 the opposite
was true. This implies that U.S. retail sales were growing more slowly than Colorado sales
over the past 15 years.

indicators for the state of the national economy. U.S. GDP plays a key role in the long-term
model. U.S. personal income is a predictor of Colorado personal income, which enters into
the equation for Colorado retail trade.

•

Consumer Price Index and Components: In forecasting sales and use tax revenues, it is vital
to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable expenditures and to consider how the
composition of household expenditures changes over time. In the short run, the proportion
of expenditures going to taxable items can vary with changes in the relative prices of goods
and services that are tax exempt. Gasoline prices are one example of a CPI component that
fluctuates dramatically, affecting the share of taxable/nontaxable retail sales. This variable
is included in the current specification of some equations in the forecasting model. The CPI
is also used to convert between nominal and real values of personal income and retail sales.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

Population by Age: In the long-term model, the age distribution of the population plays an
important role in the forecasts of retail sales and taxable sales. For example, the rate of
growth in the prime working-age population of the United States is used in the equation for
national GDP. Population projections come from Moody’s Analytics.

Regional Economic Variables: The equations in the forecasting model are based on basic
relationships between corresponding variables at national, state, and district levels. National data,
such as U.S. retail sales and U.S. personal income, track closely to local indicators. While national
level retail trade sales are a reliable indicator of general trends in Colorado retail sales, the inclusion
of state-specific economic variables, such as Colorado personal income, can improve the explanatory
and forecasting power of the model.

Colorado and Denver Metro Personal Income: Total wages are obtained on a quarterly basis
by industry (or aggregated) and by county from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (not seasonally
adjusted). This information is posted online with a six-month time lag. The data source is the
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW). Because the survey only asks for total
wages disbursed for the quarter, and not for the month, we cannot see an alternative
method for obtaining monthly data by county. This survey solicits information from the
employer’s location, not from the employees’ residence, so some wages leak out of the
Denver Metro region. Personal income data for the state of Colorado are sourced from the
Bureau of Labor Statistics on a quarterly basis. (Data sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics,
www.bls.gov; Bureau of Economic Analysis, www.BEA.gov)

•

State and District Populations by Age Group: In the long-term model, retail sales and taxable
sales at state and local levels are affected by the age distribution of the relevant population.
Data on population by age groups come from the U.S. Census Bureau’s U.S. Population
Projections and Population Estimates, and the Colorado State Demography Office in the
Colorado Department of Local Affairs.

•

Colorado and Denver Metro Employment: Employment by industry and metropolitan area is
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Current Employment Statistics (CES) is a survey of
employers and is available monthly, with a one- to two-month lag. These numbers are
revised as the QCEW data become available. If county-level data are necessary, the QCEW
employment data are available, but lag six months.

•

Taxable and Total Retail Sales and Tax Revenue Data: The Colorado Department of Revenue
(DOR) is the primary source for taxable sales, sales tax revenues, and use tax revenues. From
the collection of sales tax revenues each month and the knowledge of the effective rate of
taxation, the department computes the value of taxable sales (revenues divided by the tax
rate). At the state level, this procedure produces data on sales tax revenues and taxable
sales that are entirely consistent. However, the DOR computes taxable sales based on the
tax laws that apply to state sales tax collections, and these laws previously differed in their
treatment of RTD tax collections. In 2014, HB 13-1272 effectively changed the RTD base to
be the same as the state tax base.

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In recent updates of the RTD revenue forecasts, the BRD team has modelled and forecast
specific components of sales tax revenues to improve the accuracy of total revenue
forecasts. This disaggregation of sales tax revenues became advisable during the recent
economic turmoil as various components moved in entirely different patterns during the
pandemic and into the recovery. Important examples of components that are now modeled
separately are online commerce sales, which were unusually strong during the pandemic,
and eating and drinking places sales, which dropped dramatically. These several components
of RTD taxable sales are driven by corresponding industry sales at the national and state
levels. The summation of the various components is now reported as total RTD sales tax
revenues.
The BRD Long-Term Forecast Model—Analytical Framework
Most long-term economic forecasting exercises employ a production function framework to project
real output (GDP). With this approach, output is a function of labor supply, capital stock, and
technology. From projections of these three determinants, predicting output is straightforward.
However, forecasting these three inputs is a daunting task that is often handled with arbitrary
assumptions about their long-run growth rates. There is little reason to believe that projections of
the growth rates in the three inputs would produce more reliable forecasts than directly projecting
output.
However, the BRD long-term forecasting model borrows some useful elements from this framework.
Modeling real output growth for the national economy is the starting point of the BRD forecasting
model, and all other variables in the BRD model are also expressed in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.
This puts aside the task of forecasting inflation, which depends on national political issues, Federal
Reserve behavior, and changes in global resource prices. Since inflation rates can be expected to
impact RTD revenues and costs symmetrically, incorporating inflation into the analysis is an
unnecessary complication.
Although the BRD model does not estimate a production function or make assumptions about the
long-run growth in inputs, a production relation implicitly underpins the framework. The growth in a
nation’s labor force, capital stock, and technology is affected by the age distribution of the
population. Substantial theoretical and empirical literature on the “demographic dividend”
establishes the impact that age distribution has on economic growth, working through the three
determinants of real output.1 The use of the age distribution of the population in forecasting long-

We apply the same DOR data construction procedure to compute RTD taxable sales. Sales
tax revenues collected by RTD are divided by the RTD effective rate of taxation to produce
RTD taxable sales. In addition to providing consistency between the taxable sales and
revenues data, this procedure allows future changes in RTD tax rates to be incorporated
(e.g., anticipated changes in the vendor allowance).

Sound economic theory and empirical evidence supports the existence of a stable, predictive
relation between output and age structure. Output growth is positively related to the
working age share of the population, according to the aggregate production relation, and it
is negatively related to the dependency ratio, according to life cycle models of saving.
The age structure of the population is predictable with reasonable accuracy, and projections
are provided by the Social Security Administration and published by the Census Bureau.
Underlying demographic processes (fertility rates, mortality rates, immigration) change
slowly over time, allowing accurate age-specific population projections. Furthermore, older
portions of the age distribution of the population can be projected with great accuracy
because for the next 30 years, the population over the age of 30 depends only on mortality
rates and immigration—the former being highly predictable.
In terms of the production function framework, the age distribution can impact output
through each of the three inputs. By affecting the savings rate, age structure influences real
business investment and the growth in capital stock. One form of investment is in R&D,
which contributes to productivity growth. In addition, new physical investment embodies
latest technologies, thereby contributing to productivity growth. The labor force is obviously
directly related to the age structure through the size of the working age population. Also,
experienced workers tend to be more productive than new entrants to the labor force, so an
older workforce shows higher output per worker.
The ultimate goal is to forecast (taxable) retail sales, not output. Given the equivalence of
output and income, a simple consumption function links retail sales to output or,
equivalently, to gross national income. However, the relation between aggregate
consumption and aggregate income is expected to vary over time with changes in the age
structure of the population. Therefore, the equation for (national) retail sales includes the
population age shares, as well as aggregate income.
By the same reasoning, the age distribution affects the relation between total retail sales
(the model’s key national variable) and taxable sales (the relevant state and district
variables). For example, the consumption pattern of people 65 and older shows a higher
proportion of spending on nontaxable items compared with younger individuals who spend
more on taxable goods as they establish new households.

The BRD model employs this framework to produce long-term forecasts over the period ending
2050. Business cycle fluctuations come into play only during the current decade as the economy
gradually moves toward capacity output. These business cycle fluctuations play a role in the
medium-term forecasts previously developed for RTD, and the forecasts presented here build on
these 2021–2028 forecasts. The short-term and medium-term forecasts presented in the earlier
sections of this report employ nominal (current dollar) values of all variables, while the long-term
analysis is based on real variables. Both real (inflation adjusted) and nominal forecasts of total RTD
revenues are presented in this section of the report to allow comparisons with other forecasts and
to permit either real or nominal budgetary analysis. The data presented through the end of 2020 are
historical observations, while data from 2022 to 2050 represent forecasts.

term economic growth in general, and RTD tax revenues in particular, has several important
advantages:

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

National output growth is determined by population shares as indicated by the previous discussion.
National retail sales growth is driven by output growth, moderated by changes in age shares of the
population. State and district sales and taxable sales are similarly related to national and state sales,
as well as state and district population shares. State and district sales growth rates, in turn,
determine the growth in RTD sales and use tax revenues.
National retail sales and Colorado personal income are key factors driving Colorado retail sales in the
long-term forecasting model. But differences in population growth rates and age distribution for the
nation, the state, and the district affect the relations between sales at the three geographical levels.
The growth rate of Colorado’s working-age population, for example, affects personal income growth
in the state, which in turn feeds into the determination of Colorado retail sales. Slowing growth of
this prime working-age population therefore indirectly contributes to the declining growth in
Colorado retail sales, Colorado taxable sales, and therefore RTD taxable sales. On the other hand,
moderate growth in the total population of the state adds to the growth in Colorado taxable sales,
offsetting to some extent the adverse effects of changing population age shares on the other sales
and tax revenue variables.
Population forecasts are sourced from the Office of the Colorado State Demographer and from
Moody’s Analytics. Colorado population forecast revisions by age and by county were released in
late 2021, and showed slower net migration to the state and the district (note: new Colorado and
district population estimates and projections will be released in October 2022).
Overall, population growth in Colorado and in the district affects the growth in sales and therefore in
sales tax revenues. While total U.S. population growth declines steadily over the three decades of
the long-term forecast, the state and the district exhibit somewhat different patterns in expected
growth rates as shown in the following figure. The estimated population growth rate for the district
and for the state peaked in 2015, followed by a decade of rather flat growth rates, and then began a
long period of decline. If birth rates increase, or the state experiences stronger net immigration, the
trend may be altered somewhat.

The equations of the long-term BRD model employ the same dynamic error correction/cointegration
framework as the short- and medium-term models. All variables in these equations are expressed in
real terms, and projected real variables from the equations are converted to nominal values using
Moody’s forecasted national CPI. Both real and nominal values are presented in the tables and
charts of this section.

1.C.1.b

RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecasting Model

In addition to variations in the rate of total population growth, the changing population age
structure also affects the growth rates of sales and tax revenues in the long-term projections. For
Colorado and the district, the proportion of those in the prime working-age group and those in the
youngest age group (0 to 29 years of age) are projected to decline throughout most of the forecast
period, while the share of the aging population will grow. These trends will adversely impact total
and taxable sales in the state and the district.

The following two figures further demonstrate changing demographics over time, modeled by the
old-age dependency ratio and the prime working-age ratio. These ratios target more precisely the
changing size of the retired and working populations as they affect income and retail sales.
The old-age dependency ratio increases throughout the forecast horizon, but Colorado and the
district remain below the national ratio.

Conversely, the primary working-age ratio for the district falls through 2030, with some leveling of
this decline between 2030 and 2045 followed by further decline to 2050.

Since budget planning more commonly employs nominal (current dollar) values, the inflationadjusted (real) forecasts are converted to current dollars using Moody’s Analytics annual forecasts of
the national CPI for urban households. This adjustment with the national CPI is consistent with the
conversions to real values used throughout the BRD long-term modeling project. Although local CPI

Appendix C: A Qualitative Assessment of Colorado’s Economy

Summary: Strong economic recoveries in both the U.S. and Colorado continue, although significant
headwinds remain. Both the U.S. and Colorado continue to observe growth in GDP, employment, and
wage and salary income; and declines in jobless claims and unemployment. Colorado real GDP
increased 5.8% year-over-year in Q3 2021, and employment levels have almost fully recovered
(February 2022 employment down 0.2% from pre-pandemic). However, rising inflation and
tightening by the Federal Reserve pose headwinds which could stall the economic recovery observed
in 2021.
COVID-19
The United States had the highest number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths in the world as of
March 2022. While Colorado has the 21st-largest population in the United States, the state recorded
the 22nd-highest number of cases, the 28th-highest number of deaths, and the 35th-highest rate of
cases per capita. Despite the lifting of mask mandates state-wide in the first quarter of 2022, COVID19 cases have been increasing at a higher rate to start 2020, with February 2022 observing the
largest month-to-month increase in cases since the start of the pandemic. This follows the broader
increase in cases nationwide.

Confidence
The Consumer Confidence from the Conference Board recorded a slight decrease in Consumer
Confidence for a second-consecutive month in February 2022—the lowest level since September
2021—but still up markedly from the prior year. While consumers remained confident of short-term
economic growth prospects, concerns about inflation remained elevated and confidence and

This qualitative assessment of the U.S. and Colorado economies is intended to serve as context for
the RTD sales and use tax forecast. In the process of compiling an annual business and economic
outlook for Colorado, the BRD has developed local indicators that can be used to complement the
results from the econometric models.

consumer spending will face headwinds from higher prices in the near term. As is often the case, the
Mountain Region exceeded the national index, resting nearly 15 points above the national reading in
February. While the national index declined in February from the previous month, the mountain
region index increased to its highest level since June 2021.

The Leeds Business Confidence Index (LBCI), a forward-looking index of economic and industry
growth expectations, revealed that Colorado business leaders’ confidence remained elevated ahead
of Q1 2022, rising slightly from Q4 2021. While panelists expressed concerns about inflation, supply
chain issues, worker constraints, and COVID-19 variants, they also expressed optimism regarding
increased demand and COVID-19. Despite the expressed caution, sentiment remained in positive
territory heading into the third quarter of the year.
Gross Domestic Product
The pandemic recession was officially marked by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the
shortest U.S. recession (two months) dating back to the mid-1800s when dating recessions began.
The recession caused a record decline in GDP, followed by a record rebound. Growth continued
throughout 2021—national real GDP increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) of 2.3%
in Q3 2021 and 7.0% in Q4 2021. The surge of personal consumption expenditures slowed but still
continued to increase, up 2.0% and 3.3% in the last two quarters of the year, driven by a decrease in
goods (-8.8% and 1.5%) and an increase in services (8.2% and 3.9%). Gross private fixed investment
decreased by 0.9% in Q3 2021 and increased 2.6% in Q4 2021. Following a similar pattern,
inventories fell in Q3 and rose in Q4. Government consumption fell 2.6% in the fourth quarter, and
the trade deficit widened. GDP is expected to grow 3.3% in 2022, according to Consensus Forecasts,
followed by 2.4% growth in 2023.
In Q3 2021 (newest available data), Colorado’s real GDP increased 5.8% year-over-year but grew at
an annualized rate of 2.4% from Q2 2021 to Q3 2021. Nationally, Colorado ranked 17th in quarterover-quarter growth.

Jobless Claims
National initial jobless claims have fallen back to levels seen before the pandemic with 214,000
initial claims filed the week ending March 12, 2022 – just slightly below the 2019 average of 218,000.
Like the nation, Colorado’s jobless claims have shown vast improvement from the early days of the
pandemic. The 1,453 initial jobless claims filed the week ending March 5, 2022 were 19.2% below
the 2019 average of 1,800 and the lowest weekly claims filed since the week ending September 21,
2019.

Employment and Wages
As of February 2022, the United States has recovered 19.9 million of the 22 million jobs lost in March
and April 2020 due to the pandemic recession, leaving a jobs deficit of 2.1 million jobs (-1.4%),
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Colorado has recovered from the recession slightly better than the nation. As of January 2022,
Colorado has recovered 98.4% of the 374,500 jobs lost in March and April 2020 due to the
pandemic. Compared to the pre-pandemic peak, Colorado’s total employment remains down only
0.2%. The combined Denver-Aurora-Lakewood and Boulder MSAs made up 62.3% of non-farm
employment in Colorado in January 2022.
The unemployment rate in Colorado was 4.1% in January 2022, ranking the state with the 26th
highest unemployment rate in the nation. The state’s unemployment rate is still well above the
record low 2.1% seen in 2019 but has recovered from the 12.1% in April 2020. Within the state, the

Real Estate
Real estate prices in Colorado continue to increase at double-digit rates. The most recent data from
the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) All Transactions Index show that home prices in
Colorado increased 19.7% year-over-year in Q4 2021, marking three consecutive quarters of doubledigit growth and the largest annual increase since 1979. Home prices were 26.9% higher in Q4 2021
than in Q4 2019. The Purchase-Only index increased 18.3% year-over-year in Q4 2021.

Industry employment gains in Colorado year-over-year in February 2022 were led by
Accommodation and Food Services; Government; and Professional, Scientific, and Technical
Services. Federal Government was the only sector to report a job loss in February 2022 year-overyear.

The total value of construction is determined when permits are pulled rather than when activity is
put into place. Colorado recorded $23.6 billion in construction in 2021, a 14.9% increase year-overyear.

Inflation
High inflation rates in both Colorado and the nation have been impacting consumer confidence and
spending over the past year and pose a significant headwind to growth in the year ahead. According
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) – All Items increased 7.9% in
February 2022 year-over-year – a 40-year high. The national CPI (not seasonally adjusted) rose 4.7%
in 2021 year-over-year, while the CPI for the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood region increased 3.5%. The
annual increase for Colorado is the highest since 2011.

services and drinking places (33%), department stores (22.8%), and motor vehicle and parts dealers
(17.2%). National retail and food services sales increased 19.4% in 2021 year-over-year after only
0.2% growth in 2020, signalling a strong consumer economy. The large increase in retail and food
services sales is partially elevated due to the high inflation rates observed over the past year.

Figure 29: U.S. Retail Trade and Food Services Sales, February 2021 Year-Over-Year

E-Commerce
Internet sales continue to expand at a rapid rate. As technology advances through tablets and
mobile devices, consumers have greater ability to make digital purchases and access the nation’s ecommerce landscape. The pandemic exacerbated the ongoing trend towards online purchases,
which was a contributing factor to heightened inflation and supply chain problems in 2021.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce sales increased strongly year-over-year in Q2
2020 (43.8%), Q3 2020 (36.1%), and Q4 2020 (32%). Growth continued into 2021, up 39.1% yearover-year in Q1 2021. However, building off the much larger base of sales, growth slowed in Q2, Q3,
and Q4 of 2021 to 8.9%, 6.7%, and 9.4% respectively. E-commerce represented 12.9% of retail sales

Appendix D: Prolonged Recession Scenario

This protracted slump is caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lasting longer than generally expected
with sharp increases in cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. This causes the recovery to stall, as some
state and local governments impose new restrictions, supply chain issues worsen, and consumer
spending declines sharply.
Real GDP is just above 0% 2022 and declines 2.6% in 2023; the medium-term average is 1.8%. The
unemployment rate increases to 6.1% in 2022 and about 8.7% in 2023 and 2024. Except for the
recession-caused decline in 2023, retail sales grow moderately after a robust (19.4%) 2021.
In this recession scenario, RTD revenue falls in 2023 (-4.1%). However, RTD revenue begins posting
growth again in 2024, ranging between 2.9% and 7.5% in the medium-term horizon.

In response to a request by RTD staff, the BRD research team added a fourth scenario modeling the
impact of a prolonged recession. The team leveraged a U.S. macroeconomic scenario titled,
“Alternative Scenario 4 – Downside – 96th Percentile.” This scenario represents a 96% probability
that the economy will perform better and a 4% probability that it will perform worse.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Coping Panel Budget Transfer

Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
April 26, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer of $6,000,000 from the Unrestricted Fund
balance to Light Rail Maintenance of Way for coping panel repairs and authorize the General Manager
and CEO or her designee to enter a contract to complete repairs.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In 2006, the Transportation Expansion (T-REX) project was completed through a partnership among
RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments, the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT),
the Federal Transit Administration and local municipalities, which widened I-25 and added the Southeast
Rail Corridor. As part of the $1.7 billion project, retaining walls were constructed and fitted with coping
panels, decorative concrete panels attached by metal fasteners to the top of the walls.
The original construction of the coping panels requires repairs for corrosion mitigation to maintain the
safety and integrity of the retaining walls and rail alignment. CDOT proposed a solution to install new
stainless-steel fasteners, epoxy and grouting to permanently rectify the corrosion issues.
In 2016, CDOT received an insurance settlement to complete the necessary repairs and engaged with a
contractor to begin repairs first on the I-25 coping panels followed by those on the RTD rail alignment.
After numerous attempts to complete the work, as well as multiple change order requests that were
denied, CDOT terminated the contract for convenience. In October 2019, CDOT paid RTD $4.1 million
to complete the repairs.
Beginning in late 2019, RTD attempted to complete this work in-house using internal labor and
equipment. Due to ongoing people power problems, weather constraints and other maintenance
obligations, this process has been determined to be ineffective as to time and cost.
Staff estimates, at a minimum, that an additional three years would be required to complete the coping
panel repairs using internal resources and has determined that the repairs will be completed more
expeditiously through a third-party contract.
DISCUSSION
RTD has expended $1.1 million of the $4.1 million from CDOT on coping panel repairs resulting in $3
million remaining in the unrestricted fund balance to complete the repairs. RTD currently estimates a
cost of up to $6 million to complete the repairs necessitating an additional appropriation of $3 million.

Packet Pg. 75

1.D.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact of this action item will be to appropriate $6 million from the unrestricted fund
balance, of which $3 million has already been provided by CDOT. The estimated unanticipated additional
cost of up to $3 million is available from positive budget variances in 2021.

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Ali Imansepahi, Project Manager and Engineering Lead, Capital Programs

PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
Beginning with the Northwest Area Mobility Study (NAMS), completed in 2013, RTD has been working
closely with the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) and local jurisdictions to establish Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)-type improvements in
the CO 119 Corridor from Boulder to Longmont. In 2019, RTD completed the SH 119 Planning and
Environmental Linkages (PEL) study, which established a multimodal vision for the corridor including
managed lanes, new and expanded Park-n-Rides, upgraded BRT stops, a commuter bikeway and other
improvements.
DISCUSSION
CDOT, working with RTD and local stakeholders, is currently leading an effort to advance key elements
of the PEL’s multimodal vision plan into construction along the CO 119 trunk line between Boulder and
Longmont. CDOT has committed $40 million to this project. Additionally, RTD is working toward
establishing BRT-type improvements, such as upgraded stops and parking facilities, within the cities of
Boulder and Longmont. As the design of the project moves forward, project partners have been
collaborating to pursue various grant opportunities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The current mid-term financial plan (MTFP) includes $5 million for the CO 119 Corridor. Also, the MTFP
has identified an additional $28 million in funding for the corridor in future years. RTD’s contribution is
therefore capped at $33 million.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
General Election Day System-Wide Fare-Free Transit

Committee Meeting Date:
April 12, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Debra A. Johnson, General Manager and CEO
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the Board of Directors meeting held on Tuesday, March 22, 2022, during Other Matters, Director
Bouquet raised the question of RTD’s ability to provide fare-free transit days for General Elections. The
General Manager and CEO responded that staff would provide information to enable the Board to have
an informed discussion regarding a path forward. Hence, this Discussion Item.
DISCUSSION
Data from the Survey of the Performance of American Elections from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology’s Election Data and Science Lab demonstrated that in 2016 approximately 30 percent of
non-voters across the country claimed that the lack of transportation to the polls was a factor in
deciding not to vote. Among persons of color under the age of 30 responding to the survey, 38 percent
cited lack of transportation as a reason for not voting.
While research shows that Colorado’s system of all-mail ballot voting significantly increases voter
turnout both overall and for all major demographic groups, providing fare-free transit during general
elections would further reduce barriers to polling place access, particularly among traditionally
disadvantaged voter groups. The RTD Board of Directors’ adoption of a policy to provide system-wide
fare-free transit on general election days would demonstrate the agency’s commitment to the Strategic
Priorities of Community Value and Customer Excellence.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The biennially occurring financial impact to provide fare-free transit on general election days is
approximately $357,000, the average daily operational cost of providing weekday transit service, these
costs include the following:
Fare Revenue Replacement – $303,000
Light Rail Expenses (additional rail cars) – $23,296
Law Enforcement and Security – $30,695
Marketing – $10,000
Total for General Election Day: $356,991
