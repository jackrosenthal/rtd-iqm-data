RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2020 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized base system cost savings of $6,737,700 and a FasTracks cost savings of $1,534,700,
and a reduction of 43 operator shifts and, further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to
execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these
changes.
The funds that are saved through the service reductions will be placed in the Board Appropriated
Reserves for future Board consideration.
This recommended action supports the following General Manager’s Goals:
Core Goal #1 – Successful Delivery of Transit Services
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also
our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications,
curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted or recommend new service as changes in the
community warrant and resources allow.
The proposals herein include a mix of service adjustments and reductions aimed at addressing an
operator shortage which has resulted in increase in loss of service and service unreliability. As presented
in the December 19, 2019 Board of Director’s Study Session, this proposal seeks to reduce the number
of operators necessary to provide RTD’s transit services, thereby better matching our service offerings
to our operator headcount. The Board adopted Service Standards were used as a guiding policy in the
development of this plan, which include consideration toward ridership performance and service
duplication.
We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose
adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and
Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
There were 20 public meetings conducted between February 19th and March 5th in Arvada, Aurora,
Boulder, Centennial, Commerce City, Denver, Englewood, Golden, Ken Caryl, Highlands Ranch,
Lafayette, Lakewood, Littleton, Parker and at the Blake Administration Building Rooms T & D. Comments

the customer contacts received in the Service.Change web address will be summarized and made
available March 12th.

2.13.B

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The overall estimated financial impact contained in this proposal includes a base system cost savings of
approximately $6.74 million and a FasTracks cost savings of $1.53 million. The operator requirement
impacts are an estimated reduction of 34 Bus and 9 Rail work shifts.
EQUITY ANALYSIS
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 regarding Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA requires RTD to
evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all service changes that exceed the established major service
change threshold, to determine whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on
minority or low-income populations. This analysis is currently in process and will be completed by March
23, 2020.

May 2020 Service Change

Wednesday, February 19, 2020
Boulder Chamber of Commerce
2440 Pearl Street, Boulder
6pm
Staff in attendance included Sage Thornbrugh, Brian Matthews, Pauline Haberman, and Nataly Handlos.
Alex Hyde‐Wright from Boulder County, Danny O’Connor from Boulder County, John Tayer from the
Boulder Chamber of Commerce, Andrea Meneghel from the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, Joan Lyons
from Boulder Transportation Connections, and Cliff Bosley from the Bolder Boulder were also
present. There were 4 members of the public in attendance, along with Lynn Guissinger, Director
District O, RTD Board.

John Tayer introduced himself as a former board member and a friend and partner of RTD.
He spoke about his opposition to the cancellation of the RunRide by stating that it is
impossible to safely and timely serve 50,000 people in such a small time window without
transit. He indicated that the Bolder Boulder is most people’s first experience with transit,
and that we should preserve those opportunities for newcomers. He stated that the Bolder
Boulder is an iconic local event, and that everyone needs to do what they can to make
sure it remains an enjoyable and well-run experience. He claimed that the deadline for the
decision to cut the RunRide service is too close to the race for organizers to develop an
alternative plan. He asked that the service not be cut in 2020.

Beth Hendorf asked whether RTD ridership would improve with more neighborhood/group
passes. She said that RTD should market their services better so as to not repeat the
issue. She asked if RTD fees for development within Boulder County could be instated.
She then stated that big buses are scary for her as a potential driver, and asked if she
could drive a smaller vehicle.

Lynn Segal asked if RTD could implement an AirBnB model where you can pick what you
want - she did not clarify what this meant. She later asked why the 236 was being
eliminated. She claimed that there should be an Uber-like service for ADA passengers. She
talked about transit as being important during peak events like the Bolder Boulder. She
indicated her desire for further municipalization of local transit. She asked if it would be
possible to have a “Super Uber Day” for the Bolder Boulder. She said that there needs to
be more think tanks involved to develop more ideas.

Public Meeting Comments

Joan Lyons asked that RTD not suspend the RunRide service, citing the same points as
John Tayer. She said that BTC (Boulder Transportation Connections) agree with the 236
changes, and that they hope for better service to Boulder Junction at Depot Square
Station (BJDS) in the future. She asked for RTD to reinvest money into the BJDS area.
She stated that Route 206 was inefficient, and that South Boulder deserves more direct
service to BJDS. She asked why RTD would consider cutting the JUMP when BRT is being
planned for SH7. She stated that Route Y would perform better with more frequency and
reliable service, and that the Y deserves weekend service.

Cliff Bosley introduced himself as the Director of the Bolder Boulder. He stated that there
have been 250,000 public transit riders to the Bolder Boulder since the run’s inception. He
claimed that the RunRide service is great exposure for newcomers to transit. He stated
that 47% come to the Bolder Boulder in their car, and 7% carpool. He indicated that there
are lots of riders utilizing the RunRide service, but that he understands the driver shortage
issue. He then claimed that he had received lots of letters from Bolder Boulder participants
advocating for keeping the RunRide service. He stated that the decision to cut the RunRide
service was too close to the day of the race to organize alternative transportation options.

Andrea Meneghel said that the immediacy of the decision to cut RunRide service means
that it is too close to the deadline to cut the service. He indicated that the Bolder Boulder
is a big money maker for Boulder County. He asked that RTD explore alternative ways to
provide service if the RunRide service is cut. He said that he would be sending over a SH7
Coalition letter regarding the JUMP service changes, which would indicate their desire that
RTD not cut JUMP service as BRT is “imminent.”

Rebecca Loughner identified herself as a passenger with disability issues, and thanked RTD
for the changes made to the 225. She stated that 15 minute frequency is essential for
disabled passengers due to lack of transportation alternatives. She indicated that she
agreed with the fixed route changes that RTD was making. She asked the RTD and
Boulder County do everything they can to remove the difference in transportation options
for ambulatory and disabled passengers.

Alex Hyde-Wright thanked RTD for working with Boulder County in making service
changes, and claimed that he understands the mandating issues. He indicated a desire to
partner with RTD in alternative ways in the future.

Need a reliable service from Lakewood to CCS. Other options add significant time, takes

the name change back in January this seemed to cause a lot of confusion. Contacted RTD
and was told that the latest performance report and 99L is the lowest performing and the
same fare is used over three classes including the urban, downtown, and suburban. The
regional fares seem to be all different. Seems odd to be using fare to eliminate service.
Talked to Nataly Mitten and she suggested using the EV and CS to the Federal Center.
Andre Iltis - MallRide
Spoke to a lot of businesses and this is a serious concern especially with the Mall Ride, in
past years there have been service cuts and they’ve noticed the decline in ridership. There
has been a loss in reliability to the service. It is a public service that people use in
downtown. 12,000 residents in downtown and a quarter of them don’t have a car. No
other service compares to the mall ride across the board. Ask to propose to do a bit more
of a study to see what the impacts would be and find a way to mitigate the impact.
Michael Bailey – Route 32
Been using for over 30 years, they are a one car house hold. The alternative is the 28. The
route is a ‘half mile’ away with poorly maintained sidewalks. Need to do a better job in
advertising on the buses since the operators don’t know the service changes. This seems

Danny O’Connor stated that the JUMP reduced frequency is a concern for him. He claimed
that the 206 & 236 changes would mean no midday service to BJDS. He wants to make
sure that we can provide all day service to the Flatiron Business Park. He stated that he
agreed with John Tayer’s and Cliff Bosley’s comments regarding the RunRide service. He
asked that we restore RunRide service permanently when RTD has enough operators to do
so. He also asked about the possibility of using resources saved from the Route 236
changes to provide more service on the FF4.

gone this will have a major impact. (Response given, rider assumed route was cancelled
entirely).

Robin Finegan
Good information to share about the efforts that RTD is putting in about the real problems
of bus operators shortage, the hiring, to retain, salary. As a consumer it is helpful to know
what RTD is doing to try to solve the problem of keeping operators. What about reaching
out to voc rehab, coalition for the homeless, etc. I’m a resident of downtown. The
relationship of sales tax is obvious to keep my own business downtown to help support
the mall ride. If there is no consistent mall ride, I have to wait in the cold, I will take my
business outside of downtown, go online, or not do business at all.
Jeff Mayer – Route 99L
Similar thoughts to Aaron Smith, there are some folks who do not have the flexibility of
taking the W-Line. “my commute will go up 75% taking the W Line.” Federal Center trips
should be reconsidered.

We really appreciate the operators and what they are doing. It would be great to know
how much effort they are putting in.
Cody Seal
Service cuts are because of mandating, few routes would lead to better retention? Is that
what this is supposed to come out of it? Any numbers to show what retention is like?
Does RTD predict that if there would be no mandating, in that world, would retention go
up and then routes would return? What are wages for operators and what would happen
if raises were given to operator’s? (Response given)

Jacob Britton - MallRide
Gates’s official position is that we would prefer any cuts to the MallRide service be
postponed until a detailed analysis of the impacts can be performed and considered and a
plan to put in place based on that anslysis to minimize loss in mobility. Gates is a
participant in the ECO Pass program and a great many of our employees rely on RTD
service. Any reduction in MallRide service would likely have a measureable impact on the
daily commute of numerous Gates employees.
Alisha Humphrey - Route 139
Please do not cancel the 4:41am route. The riders on that route are commuting to work,
the airport, and the school. We all use that bus to transfer to the other buses and light rail.
No other buses are in the area. Also, please do not discontinue the special routes, ie.
Broncos Ride, Buff Ride, etc. many people solely rely on these to get to these events and
have no other way to get there.
Michael Bailey - Route 32
Please do not cancel our Route! This is a historical transit route. There were trolley lines
into 22nd ave. the neighborhood was designed around available transit. I’ve been riding
this route for over 20 years. My wife and I have been able to share a single car for this
entire time. The nearest alternative route is not practical in terms of time and dangerous
conditions in the winter. If this route closes, I’ll probably have to buy the second car and
stop using public transit for my commute.
I only found out about the change by accident. I’ve spoken to about a dozen people on my
route and no one knew about the proposed changes. Some obstacles on the RTD side:




No service change fliers on the affected buses.
Website lists no phone number for comments.
Website meeting times inconsistent with flier times.

Carl Crosswhite - LD1/LD3
We live in Broomfield, the LD 1 was gone, and the LD3 feeds into the FF and then to
downtown. The screens never showed that the bus was not going to show up. From
Union Station we tried to take the 0 and the bus never showed up. On the Free Mall
shuttle it was cancelled until 7/7:30 in the morning. It never showed up and the officer
didn’t know that either. The summary is communication, instant communication. If a bus
(FF) doesn’t leave Boulder, it should tell us right away instead of waiting 20 min. LD1 one
time didn’t show up. We can’t make our commute decisions with no knowledge of when a
bus isn’t coming.

Maybe have the bus connect with Route 0 to connect to the Broadway bus instead of
Alameda Station?

Staff in attendance included Fred Worthen, Pauletta Tonilas, Dan Merritt, Tegan Rice, and
Maux Sullivan. There were six members from the public in attendance, along with
Directors Jeff Walker and Natalie Menten with the RTD Board.
Janice Brown raised concerns about the 0 bus route and how the times frequently change.
She also expressed how the snow and icy conditions have made getting to bus stops and
the actual bus stops very slippery and dangerous, especially at the Elati & Englewood bus
stop that she normally uses. Also concerned about the D Line being cut on the weekends
since there is so much entertainment downtown. Also wanted to express her appreciation
for the bus drivers as they’re all so nice and so great, she said.
John Azuc had questions about the C and D Line changes as he now uses the D Line to
get to work on the weekends from Littleton. Wanted clarification on the specific changes.
Also very concerned about the route 32 changes as he uses that to get to his job at the
Zoo. He does not feel that the alternatives are adequate as they extend his commute time
significantly and could increase the number of transfers required. Also concerned how this
will impact people who want to visit the Zoo and the Museum of Nature and Science.
Wanted to know exactly when the C Line schedule will be posted and also concerned
about the proposed H Line changes in combination with the C/D Line changes as it will
impact his ability to transfer. Wanted to express his sympathy for the drivers and how
tough it must be to work 6 day weeks, claiming he would not be able to do it.
Erin Nobler echoed concerns about the route 32 proposed changed. She also wanted
clarification on the paratransit information. Was particularly concerned about any impact
on the disability community as they are some of the most transit-reliant.
Peter Leising wanted to let us know that he supports the C/D Line change as he and his
wife often travel downtown on the weekends and are excited that the will not have to
transfer trains to get to union station. He was wondering if there was more that RTD could
do to better support the crowd capacity after events, since the train platforms are always

Paolo Solorzano - Route 157 and Service Cut Justification

2.13.B.b

Cathy Storey wanted to better understand the reasoning for cutting the BroncosRide
service as she has been using it since it was first introduced and it always seems well
utilized, since there is less bus service on Sundays (when the games usually are). She
thinks it’s the best way to get to and from the Broncos games and believes that
passengers would pay more for the service if that would help keep it. Staff explained the
toll Broncos Ride takes on resources and sometimes budget and explained that the service
must be comparable to fares to be in compliance with federal regulations.
Ann Wilseck really appreciates the rider alerts and that the advanced notice is a significant
improvement since sometimes the notifications weren’t coming in soon enough. She is
concerned about the C/D Line change since she sometimes uses the D Line to get to and
from the performing arts center on the weekends. She feels that the current transfer
opportunities are not well timed or well-coordinated and often just misses the train she
needs and then has to wait a while for the next one. She is willing to sacrifice service for
reliability, but feels that lately RTD is providing neither. Suggested the GPS tracking for
trains and buses would be helpful for passengers. Also mentioned that it would be useful if
the digital displays inside the train showed the next stop instead of the train line so it was
easier for customers to get off at the right stop.

Random Participant: Differentiate between eliminate and discontinuation? (Response given)
Patty Dreiling– 99L
From Lakewood, having a tough time understanding discontinuing service. The 99L, could
be 25-30 depending on traffic, there are many people such as Denver county, the federal
people. The light rail is an hour and 15 min to get to downtown. Then you have to catch
the shuttle or the MetroRide. Why couldn’t we even get the EV or the CS to Federal
Center to pick up riders. I’m 68 and have a few more years to work. I don’t know where
to catch the 87L or the 116X, by then to catch those I’ve driven half my commute. I
always park at Federal Center Station.
Fred Kumlluilm–
From/representing Auraria Campus, and the students, I’m more concerned with the
MallRide and take that part of the way to campus, a lot of those Union Station riders take

so crowded. He also thought that the meetings should be better publicized as he only
found out about the meeting that day from watching the news.

2.13.B.b

Brad Neiman
I live in Whittier, and take the 32 in to downtown, the modification is troubling as a
Whittier resident and those in City Park West. There isn’t other bus coverage, options
were the 28 or the 20. That’s about half a mile to those routes. If the bus stops operating
east of downtown there’s no way to get downtown.
Mr. D. Martinez
I’m a volunteer neighborhood advocate, we have dozens of people concerned. I called
service development to ask about a petition and was told that it wasn’t going to do any
good to keep service. On Route 1 you are cutting 5 miles east of Alameda, that’s a lot of
miles. Once the bus passes Broadway it’s not a lot of people but there some throughout
the day. The 1 is proposed to go down Cherokee, but the 52 already goes down
Cherokee, that doesn’t make sense for two routes to service that area. A lot of the elderly
people cannot walk far, and then we would have to transfer to the 3 to head east of
Alameda Station. Maybe carry the bus over to Clarkson/Emerson to Speer to Washington
and turn back west. (Response given about restrooms) Current operators can’t even use
restrooms over near Target now it’s so far to walk around.
Andrew Ilitis
Would like to emphasize a few points, 16th street mall, it’s the lifeline through the city and
a gateway. It’s how people get to other transit lines and introduces new people to transit.
They get on the mall ride and feel like it’s an opportunity for them to do. There’s the
disproportion of those people who can’t get around, it’s really tough to have those people
get around and make changes. On behalf of the businesses there’s over 370+ businesses
that use ECO pass, 43% of people who commute downtown use transit, and that number
would drop with the cuts.

behalf of the Denver Zoo. Holly rides the route 32 east of downtown to get to work at

the MallRide, what degree of confidence does RTD have to cure this issue. (Response
given). When I take the G-Line in, I get the warnings about trains cancelled. With regard to
the Mall Shuttle that’s your flagship, doesn’t just affect the people who live downtown
but the tourists who come to the city. Please thing long and hard about the mall shuttle.

2.13.B.b

On behalf of the Zoo, Holly wanted to let RTD know that the Denver Zoo will be opening
two new exhibits this year. The city has restricted the zoo’s ability to add more parking,
when there are free days at the zoo families rely on RTD to get to the zoo. Patrons to the
zoo come with many children, strollers, and coolers. Walking to the zoo from the route 20
wouldn’t be convenient for the customers. Many tourists come to the Denver Zoo, there
is a concern that tourists may no longer want to come to the zoo if they don’t have access
by way of the route 32.

Allen wanted clarification with the route 16L elimination that the route16 would still go
into Golden. Curious the difference of times are for the route 16L compared to the route
16. Wondered if meets will occur with the W line, and when the services would be
reestablished.
Staff assured him that the route 16 would still continue into Golden, the route 16 is about
15 minutes slower than the 16L, and that there will be consideration to the route 16
meeting the W line.

Adina angrily stated that the services have already been paid in advance by the tax payers.
The CEO was the highest paid in the nation, allowed to retire early, and wants to know
who is accountable for that $43 million shortfall.
Concerned that the surplus of money is not going to the operator’s wages, operators at
other agencies are paid more, the disparity in wages is why there currently is an operator
shortage.
Complained that the route 21 has a different schedule on the weekends compared to
weekday, which causes confusion for the customers who are used to the weekday
schedule, and despite complaining about it repeatedly no one has addressed her concerns
mentioned at previous meetings.
Feels that RTD is not considerate to the communities when removing services.
Told staff there needs be an operator retraining, because operators laugh and wave at her
as they leave stops early.
Colorado Station is a horrible design with trains arriving and customers have to run up 50
stairs to connect to the trains, and the trains don’t wait for customers and leave people as
they are running for the train. Yelled, why are people having to run to make connections?
Nothing has changed in the last 10 years!

with her shift at the zoo. Doesn’t feel that walking down to the route 20 is a good option
because of the poor walking conditions of the connecting sidewalks, and doesn’t feel safe
with that walk in the late evening. The stop right in front of the Denver Zoo is so much
safer and more convenient to access.

2.13.B.b

Asked how long the board members have been in place? Called the board members
newbies, which is why nothing ever gets done at RTD with all the changing over of staff.

The schedule changes are a sham, and the reason why there is a decline in ridership,
because the schedulers change schedules at a whim.
Demanded that RTD be accountable to the customers. Compensation for the customers
lost wages and cancelled doctor’s appointments that are resulted because of the dropped
services.
Wants to know where the 63 new operators that Mr. Schaffer said were hired ended up.
Wants to know what is going to happen when RTD brings back the service and the
ridership doesn’t come back?

Denise asked if the operator shortage is only RTD operators or system wide. Stated that
RTD has an operator shortage because HR takes too long in the recruitment process.
Thinks that cutting the route 66 after just changing this service is nonsensical, especially
with the cut to the R line. The route 66 is finally running just fine with the changes made
to allow the operators the ability to use the restroom on the east side of the route. Asked
why RTD is removing services from the Arapahoe Justice Center? Doesn’t understand
how the route 153 can cover the service being cut from the route 66.
Removing the route 16L is going to add too many passengers to the route 16, which the
route 16 can’t handle, bad idea. When RTD removed the route 16L with the opening of
the W line the route 16 couldn’t handle the added capacity.
RTD needs to have a refresher training of all operators, especially to be more considerate
to the passengers. Operators laugh at her when they make her run for the bus. Operators
drive off before she sits down, even after she has asked the driver to wait to proceed until
she sits down, and she has almost fallen a few times. The operators are rude and
inconsiderate.
The buses and trains don’t meet at Colorado Station.
Thinks that the paratransit service change is a violation of ADA.
Doesn’t understand how RTD can open a new line, in reference to the N line, when there
is an operator shortage going on.

Mentioned an emergency bus bridge that occurred a while ago, when people were
transported to University by a bus bridge, and was exasperated that she, along with many
others had to wait at the platform for 40 minutes in the cold for a train while the busses
just sat there at the station idling. Wondered why the buses just didn’t continue taking
the people downtown.

From Golden, do both drive and ride the bus, a lot of us work between civic center and
13th street, state workers. The amount of time it would take to ride the W line will double
our commute and we can’t afford that. The mall shuttle, I have to work at 6:15 and
doesn’t even start by then, that’s unacceptable, the CV and ES used to stop at Federal
Center station to get to downtown. Why can’t that be put back in, if needed to decrease
the number of routes? The ridership being counted, ECO pass is being used for counting
but other people use other methods to pay, I think that the ridership numbers are off from
that. (Response given) How to get to Federal Center to Civic Center, there are several

another route. Now I have to think about time and money and what that’s worth. When I
take the current drive myself it’s worth it, up to 45-50 min. getting 99L taking the W line
it takes over an hour to get to downtown. I know the time difference, I’ve taken both
routes. The options I would offer to the board, cutting the number of routes in half for the
99L, if a bus misses a time then all of us get doubled up on the bus and in that case the
bus is completely full and standing room only. The ridership would be there if the routes
were even cut in half. The other option would be the CS and ES there’s one route on each
route that stops at the Fed Center, the CS stops then changes its sign to 99L and heads
to Civic Center and that’s a route that could be considered. The 16 to cover the 16L for
the evening trips, the concern is safety, this is a concern for those who work late.
(Response given)
Lori Maloney
The added time to and from work, dropped off at the 13th stop, with the cold weather and
the cold mall shuttles, the buses are frequent and you have to go all the way down to
union station, there’s no way to get out of the weather. At the PnR you can wait for the
bus in your car, the 16 doesn’t stop at Fed Center to take into downtown. The 16L I had
to take into downtown and the W line wasn’t running. Had to take the 16L to get home
because of snow. It doesn’t have to come every 15 min. It’s dark when we get off of
work and there’s the safety concern.
John Duran
Resident of Arvada. Since G line was operating a lot of people from Golden have avoided
the W line and using G line parking lots, especially at Downtown Arvada. The parking lots
are full, the Ward Station lot was full. My request for an adjustment to not terminate
where they terminate and extend them to the Ward Road Station so they have an
alternative to get to G line route. Couple questions. 1. What are the expectations of this
proposal that the adjustments will be in line with the labor resources. 2. What is the
projected revenue hours per capita with the proposed service adjustments? They are
around .87 right now of revenue hours of service. What would be the new revenue hours
of service per hour. (Responses given)
Janet Binz
99L rider, Golden resident been taking this route for 15 years from Fed Center, if you
eliminate the route and push us to the W then my commute will increase, I could drive a
lot faster. I’m fine with reducing the number of trips and frequency to half hour. If you
force people on to the W….Why does the W stop on every stop? It would be nice to have
it stop at some stations and not others.
Jeff Pickles
Lakewood resident, Peggy did not respond to my email. For the 99L, I take it everyday for

Grad student at Mines, one of 5 students who use the 16L at night to get home. I wake
up at 6:30 to get to a 9 am class. It takes that long to get to Denver to Golden, I’m
usually late to class. Taking W-Line adds 25 minutes, that means I have to get up earlier, I
would have to get up earlier. Would have to wake up at 5:30 to get to a 9am class. I can’t
afford a car right now, driving isn’t an option. We rely on this line to get to school,
cancelling this would really affect us and I don’t know how to get to school. Only half of

option. There are state employees. Please don’t cancel the bus.
Assaf Wunsch
Some people cannot afford to take the W line. Some trains are packed, and sometimes
there’s only 2 cars and not 3. If ridership goes up the trains will be packed. If something’s
inefficient then we aren’t going to ride it. If you have something people want to use then
ridership will go up. Give a list of trains that are on schedule.
Karen Oxman
I have used the W-Line, I empathize with everyone, but with RTD issue, we are looking
from the bottom up, routes and drivers, it should be the reverse, it should be looked by the
budget, why isn’t there enough money for the drivers to keep the routes for the riders.
Look at the budget, where are the dollars, why aren’t we paying enough for the drivers.
We are behind compared to other major metro areas. Maybe we don’t need people at top
getting paid top dollar, and time is taken away from families, maybe that needs to change.

The drivers are amazing and I feel for them. I live in Lakewood, I work at City and county
of Denver for a year. My choice to work there was because of the transportation option to
work. I get on the bus, right after work and make it to daycare right in time before they
close. I have a child that goes to daycare and without the bus I would have to change my
childcare. I can’t afford to drive and parking lot passes are expensive. There are people
who depend on this. This affects major life choice and circumstances. On the west side of
the metro, we are disproportioned because of the 99L and the 16L. It’s discouraging to
see these on the list of cutting. I hope there’s a way to get those on the west side of the
city to the city.

Resident of Golden, Director Menten we exchanged emails, thank you. I work for Denver
Health, 99L is the only option. Taking other options to downtown, my friends only have to
go to the capitol, I have another 15 min ride to go to Denver health and that’s if
connections were on time. I would be looking at 80 minutes one way if everything was
timed correctly. We had a petition to keep the 99L, we have the ridership. We would even
pay more for the ECO pass for our way of life. Many of us get together for drinks after
work and we are a bus family, if it wasn’t for RTD we wouldn’t have that relationship, it’s
part of our life. We are close on our bus. Most of the time it’s standing room only, a can
of sardines. I have pictures to show how packed it is. I have to walk to 9th and Broadway
now. This route is very important to us. Thank you for listening to us, I know the board
has a tough decision. Maybe affect all routes in a small way rather than cutting a whole
route entirely. Traffic is already bad in Denver this would add so many cars on the road
and downtown doesn’t have the capacity. We need to know we have that reliability to get
downtown. (Response given).
Unnamed Participant
Going from the Fed Center to Civic Center would take less operators. Please don’t assume
we are going to complain when there is a compromise.
City Manager/Mayor
City gets a lot of contacts from residents about the cuts that are proposed, my voice if for
those who aren’t here. Questions: 1. Budget is important but so is business strategy, what
RTD is doing to adjust the recruitment and retention of operators. 2. What are you doing
to grow ridership? (Response given).
We do hear from the residents of Golden, but we are a destination for the metro area.
Many people come to Golden to work and go to school. It’s more than how do we get
people to Denver, we have people coming this direction. We have downtown Golden, the
Mines and other larger employers. JeffCo has the light rail. The 16L has been popular and
Lakewood has been investing in transit. We have a long ride on the W line. The 16L gives
us a quick way to travel on this side of town. Having to stop every single stop and not
having any other option really affects all our riders and all the transit oriented development
along the route. It’s hard to retain that ridership when it takes too long, people aren’t
going to ride it. If the shortage is done will they come back? What about the 16L only
certain trips or times of day would come to Golden. We have the ridership in Golden, we

choice of taking the job was the bus service downtown. I take the 99L into downtown.
The concept of 99L name seems incorrect, I’m not sure why the route was named that.
The other Limiteds have good ridership, this bus goes on US 6 to downtown. Four times in
the morning when they start that so early is not reasonable for a 9 to 5 job. If you
changed the classification to an express or a regional route and the subsidy of the bus
goes up, and RTD is willing to pay that higher subsidy. This route should be classified to
another class. I appreciate you listening to us tonight. (Response given)

Rob Reed - Councilman of Golden
Thank you for hearing all our thoughts. We completed a transportation master plan, a
study in that plan was the number of people who come during the day and those who go
to work. Numbers are through the roof. A large number of those folks relay on those
services. It’s better to have service that is less time on the bus and less frequency. Our
residents are ok with that. Make sure it’s reliable and that it goes where it needs to go in a
reasonable time. Thank you for your time and for coming out to Golden.

JJ – Councilwomen of Golden
Golden residents really value our transit options, Golden is committed to viable RTD, we
know the concerns of operators and budget, Golden has done a lot of items to increase
ridership. We are doing everything we can in Golden to increase ridership including dense
development. I have letters from people who couldn’t come tonight. It’s also about the
environment too. The change in fare zone would help ridership, we do believe that Golden
being the only stop on the W – Line, being higher, we would love to have a conversation
about the fares. These are our residents we want more transit. We would love to stay
engaged and how to do this better.

If the 16L must be cut, please add option to 16 that skips the Decatur Station stop. This stop
adds 5 to 10 minutes to the ride.
Douglas Sexton:

Why the 99L when it has people riding it? When we are waiting for the 99L at Federal Center
Station and a train pulls up, people will wait for the 99L and not take the train, even when it’s 0
degrees out. The train takes an extra 45 minutes. Passengers would rather get in their own car
than get on the train; that’s how inconvenient the train is. It stops everywhere. Why not switch
the tracks closer to 16th and California so it’s closer to that side of town? Why not reduce the
amount of stops?
April Davis:

I take the 99L to Civic Center. My friend got on the W while I waited for the late 99L bus. I got

Matthew Norwood

I’m hearing that the 99L has the ridership, but that there are concerns about subsidies. Are
they a factor?
I’m here for the 99L, and I wrote something up. Hello, RTD, and thanks for the great bus
drivers! I am hoping you will (??) buses everyday; get rid of the buses it will be hard for those
who have glasses; the route plans will change; thank you for listening; we have a blind person
who needs that route.
Amanda Horvath

I’m in Director Lewis’ district downtown but I’ve been making the reverse commute since a year
ago. There were three different routes and they were reduced down to one. Here we are again
talking with you about the same route. I felt the first time that it made sense to consolidate.
Generally most people can make it work. For a lot of people riding the bus, it’s not convenient
to take the W Line. Some of these route options perplexed us. Did RTD look at leaving that one
route with buses that are deadheading? Add that one extra tour; already existing route that
picks up and goes; if there is a contingency. The other point: We have a nice regional bus.
Does it make sense to use a smaller bus, to reduce costs? I feel like I’m being punished for
being a person who lives downtown, walks to everything I like to do and is environmentally
conscious. I don’t have a car. RTD is my only way to get to work.
Sophy Chhun

The W line estimates seem generous; there are first-mile, last-mile obstacle going both ways.
That’s two hours; the 99L is convenient. On the occasions I took the W I was able to use B
Cycle. Now the city has eliminated that. The 16 and 16L are both up for elimination, and the
only option I have is the W because of the last options. We are hearing you that there’s an
operator shortage; we wanted to make our voice heard as well.
Crystal Brysky (sp)

For working hours, the 87L would be a great option, but there are timing issues. The 16 and
the W Line are not great alternatives.
Eric Perry

Keep the 16 along Simms. People where I live use it.
Joe Goil (sp)

There’s a petition to keep 99L. How much will it weigh on your decision? Other services are
seeing the same competition. My wife signed it (the petition) because she depends on me to
get home. Is there a monetary solution to driver shortage? I have a solution. Hire part-time
people. What about a job share?
Rebecca Long

Are the proposed cuts temporary? Have you guys considered running the 99L at different
points? Are they going to create five-day cuts? I’m a 16L rider at Simms and Colfax and take
the 16L downtown. The W sucks. One hour and 15 minutes is not a good option.

This is all about quality of life. We’ve made a life here from Federal Center to Civic Center.
Without that, I’m questioning why I’m living here. None of these work for me. I took the
previous iteration of the 99L. What I see is a pamphlet full of alternatives, none of which work
for me. Open us the mountain buses to take us downtown. It’s all about quality of life. You’re
stripping that from us.
Not sure of name:

For me, this boils down to convenience, and not doing three or four transfers. I bought a house
near Federal Center; 24-28 minutes; not an apples to apples comparison; never made decision
to take W again; ridership is high on the 99L. Three hundred per bus is good ridership. It’s a
strategic approach if it’s a numbers game.
Not sure of name:

With the elimination of the 16L, what would the frequency of the 16 go to? The W is not a good
option for Federal to Civic. There are 11 trips between Federal Center and Civic. If you cut that
in half during peak, that should make a big impact. I work for the state. You’re hurting public
service workers.
Not sure of name:

A ton of us ride the 99L, and close to half, if not more, live further south and get on the 99L. I
will not ride the W.

Instead of getting rid of 16L, cut it from (???). It’s going to hurt all the people who ride it; from
Simms to Federal Center; don’t like have service gaps like that; work to amend as quickly as
possible.

When you make cuts, you project fewer riders systemwide. At a point where Denver is growing,
it is strange that RTD is making cuts with growth. How would it benefit me to get from Alameda

Betsy Oudenhoven is the President of the Community College of Aurora. She was there to
represent the students and staff and expressed her concern with all of the service changes
impacting Aurora and reiterated many of the points outlined in the letters she sent to RTD.
Pointed out that many of the students are transit dependent and rely on RTD services to
get to campus. Unlike other schools, there are fewer transit routes and these service
changes impact some students’ only option to get to campus. Students face significant
first mile/last mile issues already. The school offers an affordable education for Aurora
residents and Aurora is growing, so cutting service seems contradictory to the growth for
the area. The school is also a feeder for DPS and Aurora Public Schools and are able to
tour the transit options as an asset to get to campus. Though the R Line is new, they see
it as a real opportunity to connect their students to campus and to the rest of the area.
See written statement/letter for further comments.
Amy Schouten was concerned about all the proposed changes that impact Aurora. As a
nurse at National Jewish, she’s concerned about patients’ abilities to get to a from their
appointments, sees the R Line as a major connector since it serves the Anschutz Medical
Campus, cutting it will make it harder for patients that need to get to the hospitals. She
also expressed safety concerns for her daughter that works downtown at night, not
enough lighting or security presence. She was also very disappointed to hear about the
proposed cut of the RunRide, concerned about the environmental impact and the added
congestion. Said she probably would not have signed up to run the Bolder Boulder if she
had known that service was going to be cut.
Watik Aleem identified himself as the Chair of the Veterans Affairs Committee in Aurora
and read the written statement/talking points provided by the City of Aurora/Mayor’s

City of Aurora. He read from a written statement. Values the partnership between the City
of Aurora and RTD, which lead to the R Line being built, which was a huge investment
that has spurred a lot of development and new infrastructure. Stated there’s more coming,
including the new pedestrian bridge at Nine Mile Station, and thousands of residential and
commercial units. There has been a 6.2% increase in ridership on the R Line in 2019.
Aurora has done what RTD asked and has built transit-oriented development. Aurora also
has a high percentage of transit-dependent residents. Stated Aurora is seeing the highest
percentage of service cuts, which is not equal and inequitable.

because there are no alternatives for those trying to get to Buckley Air Force Base.
Emphasized the route’s importance for veterans and those with special needs that rely on
the service. She advocated for some sort of alternative, like a FlexRide or bringing the
route 10 back to a former routing that included the base.

2.13.B.b

Mike Coffman, Mayor of Aurora stated that the proposed cuts will have a chilling effect on
development on Aurora. Reducing the R Line to every 30 minutes will make it much less
convenient for passengers and will cause a further drop in ridership. The 157 route is the
only option for those looking to get to Buckley Air Force Base, is the only route that’s up
for total elimination. The 153 services a lot of the local schools, so will greatly impact
students in the area. Mentioned he was late because he was speaking at the RTD board
meeting earlier, where he also stated that these cuts are unfair to Aurora as they
disproportionately impact the area. The cuts are short-sided and a result of poor planning.
RTD will continue to suffer if these cuts are made as ridership will continue to decrease.
Has anyone evaluated what the projected decrease in ridership will be? See letter to the
editor and letter to RTD for more comments.
Art Mendoza lives at Heather Gardens and knows that he and other residents are
concerned about the proposed cuts and feels they will be greatly impacted. However, he
feels that many of RTD’s issues are a management problem and wanted to know how
those problems are being addressed. Does not see the inability to get enough drivers as a
ridership problem, yet the riders are the ones who suffer. Wants to hear how management
is changing first. Happy to help as he has degrees in management. RTD needs to set up
new personnel policies. Feels the service cuts are premature and that telling people now
when they’re supposed to go into effect in May is not enough notice.
Gaye Hoffman wanted to echo that she agrees that the operator shortage is a
management issue and wants answers about what is being done.
Shawna McCowan works for Aurora Public Schools and does mobility travel training for
students with disabilities. These cuts will have huge impacts on her students. The school
she works at is right off the route 157, where all the students have disabilities, what are
they supposed to do? She’s on the bus every day, she knows the system. She explained
all the daily issues that her students have utilizing RTD services each day including missed
connections, dropped trips, lack of communication about changes, etc. What about school
trips for the 157? There needs to be a compromise or more give and take.
Mike Roberts has worked with mobility organizations most of his life. Feels RTD lacks
accessibility and reliability which leads to falling ridership. There are too many loopholes
and exceptions in the way service is run now. His father was a bus instructor and has said
that lots of people want to come to work for RTD, but no one wants to stay.
Kevin Hougen is the President of the Aurora Chamber of Commerce. He fought for the R
Line when it started. Aurora is the fastest growing community. Buckley Air Force Base is

Shelia Johnson was wondering how many zones the R Line is in and if the ridership issue

then makes a couple of transfers once she gets downtown), but the R was a good back up
to have, especially with the increase in dropped trips.
Paolo Solorzano stated that the operator shortage has been the narrative for years and at
this point it’s just words. Concerned about leadership, has reached out to board members
and some have stopped them to ask contacting them or have not responded at all. Cited
facts and figures from the employee survey supporting his concern about RTD leadership.
Worried about all the lawsuits and how much those costs are impacting RTD service.

there should be more transparency and that there is currently no accountability. Mentioned

John Parks is a real estate agent in Aurora. Told a story of a recent experience to
demonstrate how competitive the real estate market is in the area. Feels that the R Line
have been a huge boon to the local real estate business. Concerned about the impact R
Line cuts would have. He’s encouraging real estate brokers to apply to be bus drivers to
help solve this issue and because a lot of brokers don’t actually make that much money in
real estate.
Tom Worker-Braddock was a transit planner for a while. He suggested that RTD look into
different ridership standards for the R Line since it’s the only line that does not go into
downtown and therefore serves a different purpose.
Kenyon Moon stated that he only uses the H Line to go downtown, but “no man is an
island” and therefore something that impacts those in his community impacts him too.
Would be open to cutting the H Line to three trains an hour instead of four if it meant
saving the R Line frequency some. Also suggested that maybe other lines could be cut this
way to make it more equal. Feels the cuts will encourage more people to get into their
cars, which is concerning for environmental reasons. Had questions about why certain
routes are being truncated, as he feels it makes the system more confusing to use.
Huiliang Liu is the transportation planner for the City of Aurora. He cited a recent TRP

Last fall, husband and her moved to a place near a light rail station, chose to be near a
403 stop. It’s 4/10 of a mile away and doesn’t have a car. Walks to the bus stop, bus to
light rail then to downtown. Same coming home. Next ride works for the most part for a
bus coming in the morning. As long as there is some kind of comprise for the Wildcat
portion, 1.7 miles is the next closest stop and I wouldn’t like walking that. 3.5 miles
would be what I would walking daily after the changes, and it’s not possible to walk that
with snow. For everyone who isn’t here, we need that service on wildcat. The brochures
on the light rail, list it as Lucent Blvd not Wildcat, they do not list the impacted routes.
The buses don’t have these brochures on them and the people on the bus may not have
social media or a computer and don’t have this information. It’s not accessible to them.
You are eliminating access to school, to jobs, to medical care, shopping and many other
things. I ask that you seriously consider finding some compromise for who will be deserted
in that part of HR.

HR pays 10 million a year in sales tax, you have been letting down the team and haven’t
given HR its money’s worth. Can’t park at Mineral station because there isn’t enough
parking. Now you’re cutting us off from the 403 and service. I pointed out there is a hill
from the 403 to the 402. You can come walk and choose which bus stop you would want
to walk to with this change. The R line is the fastest route to the A-line for us and not
going downtown. Going through Mineral you can’t get parking and it’s a longer route to
the airport. The light rail is so expensive that the subsidy on the R line is tremendous. The
safety and security you mention is tone deaf to this community, because cutting the 403
will leave us in the dark. (Response given)

My son catches the bus and is visually impaired. He would have to walk a mile. This is his
lifeline. He will never drive, you guys are making it more difficult for him. You have to
think about that some people this is their life line. This is the first year my son will be

Thank you have for having this today, I ride the 403, I am happy with that, but I’m upset
about the changes. I ride up to Lincoln station, if you cut that you disconnect another
metro link. I do take them both but could you look at the 402 or the 403 and change the
schedule instead of just eliminating it. (Response given)

If you got rid of your directors you could hire 3 operators per director. It’s about money.
You need to hire operators.

I don’t take the 403 right now, I live off wildcat, the 402L is close to me and a mile away.
I thought about the 401 down wildcat, would that be possible? I was trying to think of
different ways to shorten that but still cover wildcat. Was hoping the 403 could cover
wildcat, but you need the 403 there to cover that extension. But if the 401 continued
onto wildcat that would work. (Response given) Followup, from what I heard, the numbers
for the minimum, you need one more rider per hour, and is that the line you have? We are
talking about a thousand or two a month people, everything is a money problem. What’s
the RTD budget? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant – You’re not telling your operators that they have to work 6 days a
week? (Response given)
Unnamed Participant – Operators tell me that they are only trained certain times of year.
And that there’s an issue with the cannabis here to get people hired. (Response given)
Unnamed Participant - How did you get yourself in this situation?
Unnamed Participant – So the d-line and the 403 can come back or are they gone forever?
Unnamed Participant – It says right here you are eliminating them, that means they aren’t
coming back.
Unnamed Participant – Why did Douglas County decide to not want to pay you the $21
bucks. The problems seems to be management. Management at RTD has not done a darn
thing to fix the problem. We are paying taxes and RTD isn’t providing the service. This is
RTD’s problem. You haven’t changed the culture in years.

My daughter is here, this means a lot to her. There are some older people who are going
to rely on the bus when the new senior citizen center comes in. There’s a lot of them
concerned. I have 10 pages of notes, but with light rail first, approx. 15 years ago we
joined the tax district, it was 10-12 years then to get this SW extension, now it’s another
20 years until, what? 2040? We are paying about 10 million from HR, to RTD. There is a
parking lot at Mineral, it’s muddy, lack of security, lighting, there’s no parking at 7:30 in
the morning, some keep driving up to other stations to park, those are all full, until they
are downtown. When I went to a show downtown everything ran just fine, the D-line ran
mostly empty that night, if we are doing this proposal every 3 times a year, why is that
happening and why wasn’t that evaluated. I suggest that when they find a permanent
CEO from outside, anyone from RTD shouldn’t have that job, I don’t blame director’s
because I’ve been on boards. I’m ticked that we don’t have light rail. Back to
management, things change, I go back 30 years, heard a lot of BS. I would like to see the
D line stay. There are times when we take the light rail at Broadways station, there aren’t
walls to protect from weather, there’s an issue with safety. Making a train switch is a big
deal for the elderly especially if they have canes or walkers. I don’t think C has to be 15
min it could be 20 or 30. We waited for the mall ride, waited for 40 min. then two
showed up back to back. Everything isn’t perfect, it would be really nice for some of you
to experience what I experience. If seniors don’t feel safe on the train, it’s an issue, it’s a
feeling. Even if it was once an hour.
403 – there’s been half a dozen proposals. Please come up with something that doesn’t
blow us in the wind without the 403. What if I cut out at the town center instead of
continuing east, a circulator with the 401 and the 403 or a mix of them. We are here to
save the 403.
About the Rockies ride, if you get off one end of the bus station, some elevators or
escalators don’t work, older couples have to carry their luggage and find a way to get to
the A-line. Maybe there’s a way to improve movement like a moving sidewalk. People
need to get to their line in a reasonable amount of time.
Max Allred
I am a student at STEM and ride the 403, I live on wildcat, some students have to walk.
And sometimes it’s not easy for them to take the light rail. If you discontinue it those
students won’t have a way to get home. I have been on buses that have been completely
full. For younger kids there should be a way for kids to sit down and not stand up on the
bus. It’s more an issue trying to get home from STEM. They can’t make it home without
the 403. I could make it if you extend the 401.
Unnamed Participant – Who is the genius that combined the grade crossings system with

If the 403 is gone, the access-a-ride will continue. What is the schedule for the access a

Sue Frommelt
Comments about what I’ve been listening to, the impression is that you finally decide to
get out of this mess. It was ok, what’s the easiest to do, let’s look at these thresholds, we
will just eliminate the 403 and not look at the other routes that have better ridership. You
didn’t have any thought other than eliminating it until you heard here tonight that there are
other options. Would it have better use of time to have the meetings first before making a
decision? Perhaps change all three routes to make it convenient for the 96,000 people in
HR. Maybe do something with all 3 routes. I have lived here for 5 years, and if I drive
around I can follow the bus and see where they stop. The buses don’t hit a lot of the
places and people have to walk. I would hope that I don’t have to go that far to reach a
bus. Maybe increase where it’s going and not have to run every 15 minutes. If we knew
the bus would come close to the house every 30 min. Maybe then the ridership then
would go up and the subsidy would go down. Looks like we are getting over 3 million
dollar service when we are paying 10 million. Last week at the delegate meeting you
didn’t know the HR community was putting in 10 million to RTD.
Unnamed Participant – Taxes coming from the community, is that per capital because
Denver has more people and will pay more.
Unnamed Participant - The app doesn’t list all the stops, you have to go to google maps.
So it will not give you all the stops.
Unnamed Participant - Do you want to come walk with me because google said it’s over a
mile to go to the stop. This would give me a two hour commute. My point is that you say
these changes have alternatives that are close by, but they are not.
Unnamed Participant – Alternative routes, there are no alternative routes. There are none.
In our area, that is not an alternative route. Some people walk a mile or two to get to
wildcat. There are a couple of stops that show up some don’t. We should have some other
town session about these arterial routes, I live off Benefer. It’s a long walk. Why people
don’t see the stop? We are complex here in HR. We don’t have a spokesperson who
would represent us. We represent ourselves. We could use benches and shelters. When
metro district when they push the snow over, people have a hard time to get to the stop.
We will work with you and some marketing with the seniors. If we knew something like

Complaint about convenience around the D and F line. You are abandoning the theatre,
because of the ridership on weekends. I was on the train at 10:30 in the morning. There
were people on the train going to the show. I don’t think RTD looks at times of events.
The F-Line on a Friday the f line ends before the shows end. The C train shows up, there’s
no place to get on. I won’t use the RTD service because it takes to long. If I miss the train
from the theatre then I will have to wait for 30 min. On the website says that the
MallShuttle will be every 15 minutes. It says that on the website.

I use the town center PnR. Lot of parking there. I can catch all three buses there on
different days. I can take the C and D or the 0 into downtown. What’s affecting the 403
route is because the trains are infrequent. I don’t ride it any more.That’s an issue. You
can’t really use the 401 because it goes through the other neighborhood. That would be
my argument for keeping that. Riding the 0 bus the last run is 12:45 am maybe the last
run could be until 8pm? I catch the first bus at 4:54 in the morning. A lot of homeless
people are on the bus. They get stranded down here for a couple of hours. Maybe if you
cut the service on that, that would prevent them from coming down here because they
want to ride back to downtown for free. Just maybe cut the 0 back? (Response given)
There are lot of homeless coming down here.

Some of these discussions are similar to other meetings, I work at Anchutz, my husband
applied to RTD. He got no response from RTD. Now he’s been driving for RTD for a month
and a half. There is an issue with your hiring. The 403, the stop is right behind my house,
it would affect me. It’s drastic to cut it all together, maybe less on weekends, or just
every half hour. The 401 would it go to Lincoln with a new plan? I am confused.
(Response given) Nothing would go to Lincoln then? I learned about FlexRide just recent
and didn’t know what it was. They told me about the app, the FlexRide is convenient.
Lower your prices. Getting anywhere is expensive. No single trains? At 11pm at night you
have trains running then with no people on them. You would have less maintenance if
some trains weren’t out there when ridership is low. It could save maintenance. The single
train for the R line is a really bad idea. There is only so much space for bikes. The R line is
the step child here for the whole network. You need to make a deal with UC health.
Student and faculty. We get zero help. Anchutz doesn’t get a pass. No one gets a dime.
RTD says for an ECOpass it has to be everybody or nobody. Make it attractive for people
to ride it. I would volunteer to advertise it. I have turned over 6 people to ride the train.
The drivers, there is a shuttle from Anchutz to the train. We are getting out of the shuttle
and the driver takes off. One time there was a thunderstorm. When the shuttle shows up
the train takes off. This happens during a thunder storm. The train should wait for us. That
turns people off. It’s disgraceful and a lack of respect. Your respond is that they are on
schedule, we don’t want to be struck by lightning. They need to work on that. People are
literally running for the train and the train takes off. If we could just come to an
agreement with some help. Talk to the school and the hospital. There are going to be more
people with a new building on the campus. Keep that in mind. So if I have a cane, I don’t
buy that they are on a tight schedule when the operators have to put out a ramp and get
passengers on. The R line is important, for the people at Anchutz, we don’t get any help.

The 403, I’ve been here for 15 years and it’s the reason why I moved to HR. We planned
it around the light rail before Lincoln station. We since moved 2 miles down the road
because now there’s a stop to catch the 403. There are two hospitals that the other
routes don’t cover. There are 2 high schools and 2 middle schools, senior centers. Even if
you did expand the 401, it takes forever, it helps but it won’t be the best. So even if it’s
not heavily used for patients there are people on it, I use it 5 days a weeks to downtown. I
use it heavily, I would have to jump on my bike, to get to town center then to light rail to
get to downtown. It’s dark out right now to and from work there’s a safety concern. I
would hate to see it go away. There are people who use it. I use my pass to scan and I
get a red light, don’t know if I’m being counted or not which could be why ridreship says
it’s down. Other people take 403 to get to 402L.

D line, on the weekends, eliminating it on the weekends, especially on summer, with all

have to make my way to union station then come back up on a shuttle, is there a
guarantee? Is that train going to be there for me to pick me up? What happens if it doesn’t
show up, how do I get back to Mineral Station? There is no shelter there. All this time,
nothing has been done about it that people are stuck at the elements. You have 3 pieces
of plexiglass, and your feet are wet and stuck out in the weather.

some people don’t know. Train connections, can we encourage passenger-driver

Justin Schmitz
The discontinued service of bus route 403 removes a critical east-west bus service
connecting communities in the south metro area of Denver, including Littleton, Highlands
Ranch, and Lone Tree. The removal of this service will reduce access to services for
transit dependent citizens in our community and eliminate bus access to the light rail
connections, directly increasing the number of people who will need to drive and part to
access the light rail. This critical connection should be maintained as part of the transit
system within Littleton, HR, and the city of Lone Tree. All bus service from the southern
end of Lone Tree including Ridgegate communities and including employment, retail, and
entertainment centers.

WRITTEN COMMENTS

2.13.B.b

Amy Tisdale claimed that a special event service has a very different impact than daily
commute routes. She said she was stunned when she saw that RunRide might be
discontinued. She used to live close enough to walk to the Bolder Boulder, but not
anymore. She has no idea how to get there if the bus is discontinued. She picks up the
bus on the diagonal, and the huge mess of buses is indicative of how much they are being
used. She is very proud of the event and transit usage. She said she is happy that RTD
supports the event and the removal of cars from the road. Director Lubow indicated that
the board is working with schedulers to figure out some sort of solution. Amy then
explained the driver shortage issue. Amy later asked if there are is anything citizens can do
to help RTD get out of driver shortage.
Audrey DeBarros thanked the directors for their presence. She wanted to echo Amy’s
request to not cut RunRide service. She claimed it is too late to change the event
organization. She asked if RTD could increase the fare for the service. She requested that
the JUMP not have reduced frequency. She claimed this would diminish regional transit
options and would reduce overall ridership on the route.

Brett O’Sullivan was upset with the Saturday change to the LD, but understands the issue
of the operator shortage. He inquired about the cost difference between a 40 foot fixed
route vehicle and potential smaller vehicles. He indicated that he had a difficult time
verifying that the meeting was happening – website needs to be improved.
June Maginnes said that the LD paper schedule is wrong in so many ways. She inquired
about the 6:15am trip. She claims that the LD2 bus has not been stopping at US 287 and
Empire – could possibly be that stop issue that we’ve been experiencing so far. She stated
that the website does not indicate LD1/2/3 on the overall LD schedule. She said that the
LD1 being repurposed for the apartment complex near Exempla means that there are now
shelters along 287 that are not being served. She claims that we have eliminated the most
popular commuter times – 4:15 and 4:20 – from Union to Longmont. 5:35am trip should
either be an LD2, but should double check the boardings near the apartment complex.
Jeremiah Sjoberg asked what “midday service” means. He indicated that the more cuts
made to the JUMP means less and less ridership. He indicated that dDecreased frequency
makes it a much less appealing option. He would also like to take the 208, but claims that
connections are very hard to make.
Brian Graham thanked RTD staff for being here. He said that he in general opposes cuts,
but especially the midday cuts to the JUMP. More cuts to midday mean that fewer people
will ride due to an hour long wait if they miss a bus, he stated. He inquired about what
“temporary changes” actually means. He claims that temporary May cuts mean that
routes/trips have been reduced for May but not re-implemented for August.

chance of LD1 5pm trip being reinstated. After Nataly indicated that we’ve been running
the 6:15am trip on special order, and that the 5pm northbound LD1 trip would be
reinstated in May, he seemed very satisfied and said the public meeting very well.

Kevin Mooney stated that Lafayette PnR is a mess. Nataly informed him that the process
to remodel and improve the area is underway. He stated that the apartment complex being
built in the area makes it even more of a mess. He wanted to know who was responsible
for updating the timetables at shelters. He inquired as to who is responsible for clearing
snow at DBS. He asked if there are there any plans for improving DBS. He asked when
construction of Boulder Canyon would be complete. He complained that LD1 stops near
apartment complex are awful for ADA passengers.
Deb Fahey indicated that the issue of transportation is not only RTD-based, but state and
nationwide. She elaborated on local and regional partnerships working to improve
transportation options in the region.

Glenda Richey
Been riding for 42 years, moved to the area when it was just stop signs. It really affects
me greatly if we lose our buses. The 116X we are charged $200 a month. That’s more
than my house property tax a year. Eliminating the morning bus, I don’t ride it because I
have options but I ride it if weather is bad. There are about 30 people on the third bus, 15
people on the last bus. That’s quite a bit of money that you would be giving up. The
evening would impact me more, and would make me decide if I am going to ride anymore.
I catch the 5:25 back home. If the 6:15 is eliminated I won’t have a ride home any more.
Traffic on C470 and severe weather is bad. We will be stranded if we don’t have a bus to
bring us back home. If the bus were free that would be different. I’m paying more than
most people being a regional bus. If we don’t have any options after 5:25 pm or if they
are late or don’t show up. How do we get home? How am I trust a bus to get home from
work. That’s my concern. The 100L was eliminated, the only other bus down Kipling and
Belleview is the 99L if you eliminate that we have nothing. We pay taxes and $200 a
month. It’s not that we aren’t paying, it concerns me that this whole area’s option are
being eliminated. I have options right now, on the 99L and 116X. There was a blizzard and
didn’t want my daughter to pick me up, I walked 2.5miles home during that bad weather. I
can’t do that anymore. I hope we keep something. Light Rail isn’t an option, I have tried it

Katie Boyd does not like the reduction of the JUMP service. She claims that she is a big
climate change advocate and wants to increase transit options to help fight that issue. She
wants RTD to think of more ways to incentivize transit ridership. She wants to buy a

Question to citizens about 99L boarding: Where do you board for the 99L?
One person boards at Ken Caryl PnR and one person catches it at Fed Center. If the 99L
was eliminated, I would go to Mineral or Englewood.
Glenda Richey
RTD proposed eliminating 116X years ago, it was gone and we got it back. If it’s gone it
will add so many cars on the road from west of Kipling. I can’t take an early bus. There
was times when there were no surplus buses because they were all out. Some people left
taking Uber. People out here really do ride the bus.
Hailey Tatum
I am new to the area, moved here for work. Work downtown close to civic center. We
were able to bike to work every day even in winter. Carbon footprint was low and that’s
important. In the last year, we’ve wanted to settle down and we are engineers we live out
in Lakewood and love where we live for our family and dogs. We have a good alternative
out here. Having a low carbon footprint, avoiding parking downtown because it’s
expensive. The solution was to ride the bus. The 99L is the only option for me to get to
civic center. I am driving to Fed Center when he can drive to Denver West for work. The
buses seem pretty well attended. We would have considered a better location if we knew
about these proposal and the cuts. We support alternative transportation. I hope to make
an impact with my voice. I have considered the W-Line but it does drop me off at union
station and I work at Civic center. My commute is one hour door to door and I don’t want
to extend that.
Ruth Bruski
My husband and I commute to downtown every day. We take the 116X. It’s disheartening
that the whole bus is being eliminated. My husband is one who rides that bus. If he was to
do an alternative, Mineral and Littleton have no parking. It would take another 25 min to
drive to Englewood. If there was another option to get anywhere we would. I work close
to civic center station, some buses go in every 5-7 minutes. I am for the life balance of
these drivers and know one under this stress. It’s only 8 runs a day, and it affects this
whole area. For my family it affects us.
Proposed question of combining the last two trips (most people agree that would help) of
the morning trips and the evening trips.
Unnamed Participant - This would help the bus, the first bus comes out here and then it
goes back downtown and there’s only one driver who can actually do that.

and between the fights, drunks, and they all get to ride free at the stations because they
get to hop off and on. The more money you pay the less you get it seems. There are a lot
of people on the 99L. I have a flex pass, when I get on the bus the bus operator doesn’t
count me. How are you to know I am getting counted? We also have someone who is in a
wheelchair riding the 5:25 bus. I’m concerned about him. (Responses given). It’s different
when you’re 20 miles from home and that’s different than taking a 0 when it comes every

Unnamed Participant - 99L, if cancelled, then could the 116X stop at the Fed Center. So
that way there some service down here. There doesn’t seem to be any replacement for
this. I board the bus at the PnR down here. How long would this be temporarily cut? With
the cuts happening, how many buses would be coming down to Ken Caryl PnR?

Unnamed Participant - If we would have a slew of operator’s would this still be an issue and
would our bus be cut. (Response given)

Staff in attendance included Sage Thornbrugh, Lisa Trujillo, Paul DesRocher, and Nataly
Handlos. Alex Hyde-Wright from Boulder County, Jeff Butts from Boulder County, Audrey
DeBarros from Commuting Solutions, and Deb Fahey from Louisville City Council also
attended. There were 12 members of the public in attendance, along with Judy Lubow,
Director District I, and Lynn Guissinger, Director District O, RTD Board.
Jeff Wohl can’t ride the LD anymore as his LD1 trip at 5pm was cancelled. He
acknowledged that the 6:15am LD1 went missing as well. He asked if there was any
chance of LD1 5pm trip being reinstated. After Nataly indicated that we’ve been running
the 6:15am trip on special order, and that the 5pm northbound LD1 trip would be
reinstated in May, he seemed very satisfied and said the public meeting very well.

Unnamed Participant - If we wanted to when it’s a blizzard, could we use that? Would it be
an issue if the call is within one hour because of weather? (Response given)

Amy Tisdale claimed that a special event service has a very different impact than daily
commute routes. She said she was stunned when she saw that RunRide might be
discontinued. She used to live close enough to walk to the Bolder Boulder, but not
anymore. She has no idea how to get there if the bus is discontinued. She picks up the
bus on the diagonal, and the huge mess of buses is indicative of how much they are being
used. She is very proud of the event and transit usage. She said she is happy that RTD
supports the event and the removal of cars from the road. Director Lubow indicated that
the board is working with schedulers to figure out some sort of solution. Amy then
explained the driver shortage issue. Amy later asked if there are is anything citizens can do
to help RTD get out of driver shortage.
Audrey DeBarros thanked the directors for their presence. She wanted to echo Amy’s
request to not cut RunRide service. She claimed it is too late to change the event
organization. She asked if RTD could increase the fare for the service. She requested that
the JUMP not have reduced frequency. She claimed this would diminish regional transit
options and would reduce overall ridership on the route.
Brett O’Sullivan was upset with the Saturday change to the LD, but understands the issue
of the operator shortage. He inquired about the cost difference between a 40 foot fixed
route vehicle and potential smaller vehicles. He indicated that he had a difficult time
verifying that the meeting was happening – website needs to be improved.
June Maginnes said that the LD paper schedule is wrong in so many ways. She inquired
about the 6:15am trip. She claims that the LD2 bus has not been stopping at US 287 and
Empire – could possibly be that stop issue that we’ve been experiencing so far. She stated
that the website does not indicate LD1/2/3 on the overall LD schedule. She said that the
LD1 being repurposed for the apartment complex near Exempla means that there are now
shelters along 287 that are not being served. She claims that we have eliminated the most
popular commuter times – 4:15 and 4:20 – from Union to Longmont. 5:35am trip should
either be an LD2, but should double check the boardings near the apartment complex.
Jeremiah Sjoberg asked what “midday service” means. He indicated that the more cuts
made to the JUMP means less and less ridership. He indicated that dDecreased frequency
makes it a much less appealing option. He would also like to take the 208, but claims that
connections are very hard to make.
Brian Graham thanked RTD staff for being here. He said that he in general opposes cuts,
but especially the midday cuts to the JUMP. More cuts to midday mean that fewer people
will ride due to an hour long wait if they miss a bus, he stated. He inquired about what
“temporary changes” actually means. He claims that temporary May cuts mean that
routes/trips have been reduced for May but not re-implemented for August.
Katie Boyd does not like the reduction of the JUMP service. She claims that she is a big
climate change advocate and wants to increase transit options to help fight that issue. She
wants RTD to think of more ways to incentivize transit ridership. She wants to buy a
house in Lafayette, but indicated that it is difficult when they don’t know what’s going to

Kevin Mooney stated that Lafayette PnR is a mess. Nataly informed him that the process
to remodel and improve the area is underway. He stated that the apartment complex being
built in the area makes it even more of a mess. He wanted to know who was responsible
for updating the timetables at shelters. He inquired as to who is responsible for clearing
snow at DBS. He asked if there are there any plans for improving DBS. He asked when
construction of Boulder Canyon would be complete. He complained that LD1 stops near
apartment complex are awful for ADA passengers.
Deb Fahey indicated that the issue of transportation is not only RTD-based, but state and
nationwide. She elaborated on local and regional partnerships working to improve
transportation options in the region.

Arvada City Council
6:00pm
Carl McEncroe shared that he rides the 99L. Over the past two years riders in the area
have seen reductions in service previously provided by the EX and CS. He noted that
with the proposed elimination of the 99L RTD was proposing routes 87L, 116X and W
Line for substitute service. Route 116X goes down Quincy Avenue and is far from the
west side of town, route 87L picks up at Hampden and Wadsworth and is substantially
southeast from the mountain communities and the W Line to Union Station to then catch
the Free Mall or Metro Ride takes one hour fifteen minutes versus the current thirty three
minutes. He stated that people that ride the 99L are commuters and alternate routes more
than double the commute time. He is fortunate that he could pay for parking but many
riders cannot and a three hour commute seems extreme.
Faye Russell agreed that the 99L was more feasible in terms of time compared to the
suggested options. She was really concerned with discontinuation of the route 99 on
Saturday as she really relies on that route in bad weather or if her car is not working. She
noted Sunday service was eliminated several years ago. She does not take the Saturday
99 regularly but relies on it being an option.
Zachary Burchfield said he is concerned about people with disabilities and low incomes
having access to transportation. He shared that he has an eye condition and cannot drive
nor has the luxury of paying for Lyft or Uber. He wondered why there are not H Line
trains running to Peoria Station during rush hour. He also expressed concerns about
access to Buckley Air Force base for pharmacy and grocery services if route 157 is
cancelled.

happen with transit in the area. She thanked us all at the end of the meeting.

Cliff Andersen noted that while there are some ridership issues the main issues seem to be
workforce. He wondered why there was such a difficulty and if it was related to hiring or
retaining. If it is related to retaining operators he wondered why RTD was not just hiring
more operators to help with mandating. He also wondered if the legalization of marijuana
had an impact on hiring. He noted that RTD said this was not a budget problem, there
was plenty of money to pay operators, but last year millions had to be cut from the budget
and the Board hired a new temporary director at significantly more than the last GM. He
expressed concern that the Director of CDOT makes significantly less and hiring a
temporary director at such a high salary will lead the next permanent GM to expect
similar. He thinks RTD is getting taken and the public is getting it in the shorts.
Wendy Matthews expressed an overall concern with the way the budget is handled as 2/3
of it is spent on non-transportation related expenses. She feels that is a lot of resources
that could be dedicated to transportation. She said she does not see anyone looking at
efficiencies. Buses downtown stop at every stop and there are routes that go through
downtown that no one board. She suggested that RTD look at the frequency of the
FreeMetro Ride and that perhaps it should coincide with the frequencies of the trains, such
as operating every 15 minutes. She stated that with cutting buses north of the Wheat
Ridge Ward Road Park-n-Ride the only way for people living that direction was for them to
drive. She thinks the only thing that was evaluated was ridership and not if this was the
best places for buses to go.
Lisa Cook stated the possibility that the RunRide may not be here this Memorial Day
strikes fear in her heart. She would happily pay twice as much if it gives the operators a
bonus. She said she would be grateful if there was a way to keep the service. She also
expressed concern that a lot of kids took the route 32 to Wheat Ridge High School and
suggested that RTD look to keep a morning and afternoon stop.
Irene Rael shared that she moved a couple years ago to Arvada and chose the area
because there was a bus half-a-block away and the train would be coming soon. Now
that the train was open the 72L was gone and she has to walk ¾ of a mile now to catch a
bus. She said that is fine if the weather is good but the last few weeks she had to ride
with her son, meaning she gets to the train at six and does not work until nine. She
expressed concern that now the route 125 was going to be cut in her area and she does
not know what she will do as she does not have a vehicle. She stated there were a lot of
people grumbling when the 72L was cancelled and with eliminating the route 125 she
worries about parking, especially with the housing being constructed around the Park-nRide.
Debbie Poland noted that she works at 16th and Welton and when she leaves work the 90
second intervals for the Mall Shuttle do not happen. She said she can walk to Union
Station and not see a single Mall Shuttle going her direction but will see 6 to 8 heading to
Civic Center. She stated that when buses do come you cannot get on as people are
packed like sardines. She noted that when the route 0 used to go down Welton she
would take it a lot but now it was rerouted. She asked if a request to please move away

from the door could be added to the Mall Shuttle announcements, similar to what is on the
G Line.

Cliff Andersen inquired if security for drivers was also a factor that was impacting operator
retention as he was hearing that on a Facebook page.
Faye Russell noted that there have been several shootings around light rail stations and
there should be more security late at night.
Debbie Shipley expressed concern about people at Union Station sleeping in stairwells and
making it difficult for passengers to get inside from the trains. She suggested a spotlight
or playing classical music. She said there are no security guards in sight when she is
there. She also wondered why only one set of doors opened when the G Line train comes
into the station and then the other open about 45 seconds later.

Zachary Burchfield shared his concerns for accessibility when it snows for people in
wheelchairs or blind people. He said it piles up at stops and is very unsafe. He also
wondered why the light rail stations were not designed with winter in mind.
John Girand noted that 69% of bus operators are mandated and asked what the
anticipated percentage would be if the service changes are adopted. He believes this
metric is important to have when the changes are presented to the board.
Irene Rael wondered if there was a way to balance operators working long days so they
could still get two days off.
Debbie Poland hoped that RTD was utilizing part time operators.

32 bus, it wasn’t going to be eliminated, and that it’s going to be modified. (Response
given) Start with eliminating the non-rush hour, it comes every hour, a year ago they
added service on the weekdays, for half hour in the morning and the afternoon, the people
that live on 22nd, and around park Ave, use it to get to school, the doctors, the hospitals,
you have eliminated the 28 to go downtown on the weekends, if the 32 goes, then there’s
nothing on 22nd ave. There are lots of people there that don’t have cars. It’s not just me
going to the zoo all the time, the staff there uses it too. Our CEO also takes it west. I see
him a lot on that bus. It’s not a good idea to get rid of this. It’s a mile walk to get to
Colorado Blvd or Josephine. I would end up taking 3 buses to get home instead of one.
The mayor didn’t have as much bond money as we requested. His emphasis was mobility
and accessibility, that’s what he wanted to focus on. I ride with people who get off 17th,
they come from all over who ride the bus. You can’t tell them to take the Route 20 then
walk a mile. The parking at the zoo and museum is very tight. Once they open the golf
course they might have more parking but it’s all overflow.
Joy Ravenel
I am visually impaired, I rely on RTD to get around I ride the 99L, live in cap hill, and work
in the Fed Center. I sometimes ride the 16 and the W is a two hour commute. I don’t want
to do access a ride I want this to be as normal as possible for me. I don’t want you to take
this bus away. I do the Bolder Boulder every year. I know there are 50,000 people who
use it and I see those buses packed and people are standing even on the 60 foot accordion
buses. If you take away the buses then my normal commute will get harder to live my life.
(Response given for RunRide) But the RunRide would get me to the starting line those
other buses don’t get me there. I know a lot of other people won’t like that route, and
roads are closed off up there. I am bringing this to your attention that there are a lot of us
who are racers who like to get the starting line.
Sean Lusten
I catch the transit to school every day, my main concern is with changing the bus times.
When I go to the bus stop, I catch the bus to take me to campus, earlier than I need to I
am not confident that the other ones will come. One of my friends has to catch the 15L,
rerouting the 5:20 to make it to work. There are shortages, but I get that. The changes
that you guys are making, how much can you guarantee that the rides are going to
happen, ARE going to happen? (Response given)

We are still dependent on a bus. The Conifer bus in the morning goes to the Fed Center
then the garage then does it in reverse for the evening. (Response given) This one run in
the morning and one run in the evening, how does this affect cutting out a neighborhood.
Our drivers prefer this it’s best for them, you still have the bus going up to Conifer. The
7am, you don’t have another load of people coming down from Conifer. For me, it’s a
total disruption for my lifestyle. We may need a ballot initiative to remove FastTracks, this
FastTracks was supposed to not affect bus service.

Jared Miller
I am supporting the 16L or not supporting the removal, I live on the west side taking it 5
days a week. I have a question, are there any number for what that bus serves and what
the ridership is? I would echo the other peoples’ concerns. The 16 takes twice as long if
not longer. The 16L it’s the most efficient for going downtown to Golden. This change
would add an hour to my day so, another 7 hours a week. I work on the other side of
downtown the W would take too long. You call it a duplicate route, but it doesn’t stop at
the rec center or the Decatur Station. I would like to share that there was another person
at the other meeting and I’ve been sharing pictures about how busy the buses are. I don’t
know if you factor in the stress that will add to the 16. I don’t know if this is a well
thought out move there is a lot of time that the 16 or the 16L cover at the same times.
Maybe stager the 16 and the 16L, it will offer different options for this corridor. I don’t
know if that map has been done but you should be able to tweak it to where you have
less drivers. This seems like a premature move.
Sarah Miller
I am married, we ride the bus together in the morning working downtown. I have 6
coworkers at work on my floor that take the 16L. There are so many people that will be
affected cutting this route. The 16 will be packed. Everyone gets on the 16L. No one
wants to take the slower bus. You are cutting an efficient route. You are going to drive
people away from the bus. It’s not always a pleasant ride, but we deal with it. You are
taking away from peoples’ time from their family or what they enjoy. There are buses that
run to Boulder from 10 min every day. I feel like the west side is being targeted. Are those
cuts affecting the FF. I don’t see those on the list. Boulder seems to be getting some sort
of treatment.
Daniel Anderson
My wife and I depend on the 16L, we live across the street. We go downtown for doctors
appts or going out and having fun. We don’t like the 16 because it sits at Decatur Fed for
5 minutes waiting just sitting there, no one getting on. If you do take out the 16L, my
wife is in a wheel chair, it’s going to be more compact. There are times where we had to
wait for other busses because there are too many wheelchairs on the bus. It’s not fair to
us. It’s going to make it harder for us. Maybe reducing the hours, maybe that will help the
operator problem. It affects us trying to get downtown for appts. That’s hard on us.

August, did research online before moving here from the country. Reason for moving to
Cap Hill was for the express bus to get to work and I don’t have to take a transfer. It’s
only 20-25 minutes to take the 99L. It’s the most Ideal for me to go to work. It’s only one
route. I have to make sure I don’t miss it. I would have to ride the W which is a long way
for me or the 16 which is 2 hours or more for me a day. (Response given) How long would
it take with that suggestion you gave me, over an hour? You guys are taking away the
Federal Center station stops. That’s eliminating one of my options, so I would have to take
the W. I have taken the 16, it’s either not shown up or it’s late.

Jennifer Hale
Representing as a SW resident, D, C, and 32. For the zoo as well. The impacts of those
routes, and the accessibility of the other route being a mile away. The population, or
tourists, and residents in the area. The 1.1 mile walk to other routes is really tough for our
residents. If the 32 is down, it’s quite a walk, I have done it myself. This will be
detrimental to us, there were 32,000 people at the zoo during the free day. Our staff, 60
staff ride that route frequently, I do have an hour commute good for reading. It’s
detrimental for us for it to stop downtown. It affects the lead building and emissions that
the city is trying to achieve. Thank you for having this meeting. (Response given) I
understand that it’s tough to hire people out there.

I ride the 99L, reverse commute. When I moved here there was the option of taking
transit, I moved from Galveston TX and there’s not much transit there. I’m impressed
about the app you guys have. It told me about the 99L. Other systems tell me to take the
10 or the W and takes me over an hour to get to my work. I can leave right now at 7 and
make it to my desk get there at 7:30. There are tons of people who ride that bus. It’s a
really good route. It’s once each way. You have a dedicated ridership. Last year you
brought this up but you kept it. There’s opportunity to grow, there’s a lot of people at the
Fed Center. The alternate routes come from Littleton to Civic Center. The W is very slow,
too many stops and curves, it takes too long.

Concern of the discount pass. I got it because I’m low income. I do need that reduction.
When January came for me to pay cash on the bus I wasn’t able to. I don’t have another
way to get my riding pass, I don’t have the ability to do that. I don’t have a credit card to
buy tickets online with that. Other people who are low income they can’t do that. I would

32 and the 16L. They are thinking of eliminating them on Sundays. I’ve been riding 20
years, especially the last 9 years. I’ve rode it less and less only when I have to. They
eliminate it on Sundays and it’s bad enough on Sundays when it runs once an hour I won’t
walk to the 28 and might to the 38. The biggest problem is that they cut, cut, cut and
they spend billions on transit. The dumbest thing is that it passes the Decatur Station and
can’t make a connection. I don’t take the 16 because it’s too slow. I don’t go west. They
lose on revenue for that but I don’t take the 31 either. The 15 and 15L at Larmier, I see
countless 15L go by and they are empty. During rush hour it might be different. That’s a
lot of operators and gas being used. The 32 drivers are very, very nice they know me. One
time I had an operator that didn’t speak English for me to communicate to him to know
what other bus I need to take to transfer. But the 32 is closest to my house, they took
away some stops which is good.

don’t want to stay downtown until 6. Traffic is worse coming this way. The 99L, the options, not all the
buses go to the Civic Center and back. Out here that’s our other alternative. We have a lot of workers
that go downtown and need those options. I didn’t know the 99L existed. It just goes up and down
Kipling to the Fed Center, I have never seen anyone on the 99 on Saturdays. People who use the 99 on
the weekdays aren’t using it on the weekends, why not eliminate the weekends to keep the 99L for
those who get downtown. (2 people state they ride the 99L both hop on off Kipling) I have taken the W‐
line, it had 2 cars, during something at the Pepsi Center, Mile High Station, and the colleges, we were
arm to arm touching, when people go up to the Fed Center, the door opens, and this one man picked up
his bike and threw it on the sidewalk out of the car. It’s so dangerous. That’s why I quite riding the W‐

The D line, if you want to go downtown, transfer to the H line, but they aren’t coordinated, or go to
union station to catch the mall ride. It’s saying, ok, you live out here, don’t go downtown because we
are going to make it hard on you. You should interval C and D, it doesn’t have to be 15 min. One
shouldn’t go away. (Response given) I would disagree with those numbers. If you want to go downtown,
you change trains at I‐25, that’s your answer. I don’t know about those numbers with the Avs, and the
Nuggets not playing during the summer. So your answer is to change trains to go downtown.

Jennifer MoreIand
I recognize the time away from family, I appreciate the time you are taking to do this. I appreciate the
operators and the work they are doing. I think they aren’t paid enough so I think them. I ride the 116X,
this is a service with the latest trip being cut, it erodes into the rider who isn’t just going to and from
work. It’s not about providing service to what is typical for those for work but those who also have to do
family care, care for the elderly. The 116X should actually be expanded. I can barely get my daughter to
school. It’s impossible to get family members to where they need to be or to get to work. This falls on
different types of workers. It’s about equity and not just commuters. I want to stress the broncos ride, It
is convenient, and so much more user friendly. To take my daughter downtown there and all the people
it’s frightening, for anyone else it’s scary and not family friendly. Think of the people who is young who
should have a good experience. And those who have family, traveling with family, please think of them.
These other events should be helping you out Bolder Boulder, the stadium, and this all helps the
environment. I have chosen to live without a car as much as possible, to cut service it’s really
challenging. Please keep everything possible with the 116X and the broncos ride. Please keep it all in

Discussing, Bolder Boulder, for Memorial Day, 13,000 people take the bus service. This would not help
public relations image. Do not discontinue service for that this year. It’s possible higher fares would be
necessary and most riders would be ok with that. (Response given)

116X, I live in the weber hall neighborhood, I have school aged children and doesn’t start until 7:30. It’s
hard to find a bus before 7. Eliminating the last trip, you preventing anyone, to get kids out the door, or
high school students to get to school, I can’t get the kids out the door on time sometimes. And the D
line, you can’t get a parking spot, Englewood is the next available place. I don’t know how early you’re
suppose to get to the Mineral station to get a spot, I don’t have a parking pass for work. If I don’t have
th 116X at a time I can take my kids to school, if the Englewood development happens, you might not
have enough people to ride the D line in the future. I would encourage that for the D line, there were
multiple shows and the conventions center area, there was a mess, lots of people down there. There are
a lot of people traveling with children who have reservations about taking the train. There’s also the
need to address the VMT in the area and the emissions from cars. It’s more efficient to put people on
buses but it doesn’t work if the bus doesn’t service your needs. Getting people out of cars reduces our
emissions and reliance on cars. You are eliminating people in my demographic to ride this service.

John –
About the D line on the weekend you can transfer to the H line but you’ll be waiting for that transfer,
the need for going to union station will end when the events end, and the summer time is when people
want to go downtown for the weekend. The needs will be greater in the center of downtown than the
Nuggets game or the Aves game (Response given) on the 32, it will be discontinued east of downtown so
going to the zoo will be gone, the 28 is suggested to take but that will be a mile to get to the museum or
the zoo. If you’re an elderly person or in a wheelchair this will be difficult.

D –line, cutting it of the weekend, how do us black folks get to downtown to get to church in the Welton
area. The W line when you get to Union Station, there are drug addicts down there and it’s very scary
there on the weekends, the bathrooms are full with drug addicts on the weekend, You need to check
this out before you all do this. Why does Union Station close? It’s closed on the weekend. The security
there tells us they have nothing to do with the bus. In the mornings you have hundreds of people there
in the morning sleeping. It’s embarrassing especially when you have tourists coming to town. (Response
given) OK, how do we get to church on Sunday, the L line doesn’t do anything, The L line is a waste of
time, we don’t know why you all did that. It only goes three blocks. The 15/15L that is a waste of drivers,
I ride that too. I have 4 15s and 3 15Ls and you say you have no drivers, I don’t know if the schedule
changed but they are never on time. People still wait for the bus. Why do you all have that 15l going
through that construction, can’t it go another block. It’s time consuming from Anschutz, to Colorado it’s
an hour and a half, they are all ended up in construction. Why can’t they go around? (Response given) Is
it true that the board of directors don’t ride the public transportation like we all do? (Response given)

given) I want the best for the workers, and it’s hard to get both service and the workers. When living in

Have you all done a study on 87L, and I ride it every morning, you barely have 10 people and that is
really wrong. They might be state employees. I ride the 87L, why do we have 15 buses on Federal and 1
on Wadsworth. You have been saying these issues for 5 year, you have more than 5 buses on Federal.
We only have 1 76, you are leaving us on the curb. I ride the light rail, when it snows we don’t have any
salt, at 6am in the morning this happened at 13th and Wadsworth, you need to do better with us
disability folk. Even at Union Station there was still nothing, there was snow and ice. That $3 is a lot of
money too. But there are other people out there, that are paying $3. The idea of the people who have to
pay cash, that’s expensive.
Kim
I ride the D line for 15 years, I know the 116 very well. I take the 77 across town and the flex ride. I use
the next ride a lot to see where the bus is. I highly recommend you put a notification when you cancel a
route especially the train. Sometimes, I have waited so long because the H was cut, the D was cut. You
guys do know ahead of time, for the trains, it would be helpful to know this ahead of time. (Response
given) The notifications at the station shows the trains are coming but they don’t come. (Response
given) So I ride the flex ride that replaced the 85 going this way, I can’t track the flex ride. I don’t know
where they are, how can I see them? The thing for new riders, they don’t know about this feature.

99L, the 99 comes by, very seldom, can they eliminate the 99, combine it for the 99L, they both go to
the Federal Center. They don’t follow the same street.
Unnamed Participant
I would suggest, going to the army reserve to get more drivers or mechanics?
Unnamed Participant
Cancelling the 99L that means the W will be packed, it had 13 cancellations on Wednesday. The other
thing too, have you looked at summer times, school is out of time, those drivers aren’t driving, they are
looking for summer jobs, they could help alleviate during the summer times, or even during the winter
breaks I’m sure they would love the opportunity. (Response given)
Unnamed Participant
I work at Fitzsimmons, I have to catch the bus at 5:30, it takes me 2 hours to get to work and 3 to get
home. It does me no good. I have to catch the 15 to come back downtown. A lot of veterans, the 15
goes down to Children’s hospital, there’s nowhere for us to transfer, from Broadway to Anschutz there’s
no transfer.

Staff in attendance included Mike Meader, Jeff Dunning, and Dan Merritt. There were 10
members from the public in attendance, along with Director Lewis.
Barb O’Donnell was concerned about the running times on route 153. She inquired about
the FlexRide. She stated the 16L should stay. Does the board know about operators being
assaulted?
Pam Jiner has concerns about the lack of public restrooms and shelters at bus stops
throughout the district. She is concerned about 3 to 4 stops that were consolidated. She
would like a bus shelter at Montbello Manor, 4355 Carson St. She wants tax refunds that
correlate to RTD’s proposed cutbacks. She is also concerned with Peoria and Albrook.
People are climbing fences because they don’t want to walk the bridge at Peoria Station.
RTD needs to install an elevator and the bridge needs to be covered to address this
problem. She will invite the to audit the area. She would like to know why the Chambers
bus doesn’t go straight up from Colfax. Pam stated that directors who don’t care about
transit dependent people shouldn’t be on the board. The interim CEO should be here.
Rachael Lehman is concerned that downtown Denver is Disneyland for rich people.
Gentrification is pushing transit dependent people to the suburbs, where there is less
coverage. People have to walk further and wait longer to access RTD’s network. She
wants to see RTD’s budget because the interim CEO was paid too much.
Michael Bailey is concerned for the hundreds of daily riders on the 32 east side who will
no longer have service with the proposed cutback.
Mayra Gonzales asked how temporary these proposed cuts will be.

Public Meeting Comments

2.13.B.b

Thursday, March 5, 2020
Parker Town Hall
20120 Mainstreet, Parker

Claudia Iglesias rides F Line every day, and noted that it has never arrived at the scheduled
time. She lives two blocks from the RTD boundary line, so she has to pay for parking
despite being a Parker resident. Please explain how this can happen.
Ron Springsteen said he has the same question as Claudia: who makes these RTD
boundary decisions?
David Casiano is concerned about the welfare of RTD operators after hearing about
mandating. RTD’s job is supposed to be to move people around, what is the plan if RTD
doesn’t get enough drivers? What is RTD doing to address the budget? Please walk us
through your process.
Mike Roberts noted that it seems like adding more operators would solve a lot of the
current RTD issues. Does this mean that a lot of these proposed route cuts would be
temporary? Once RTD gets the operators, will the routes all be brought back? And has
RTD thought about advertising the R Line to the public? We need to get the volume of
people of I-25; it takes his wife two hours to go only six miles by car on I-25. Get the
work out to the public that it will benefit them to take transit. People have to get to work
on Sundays, too, so consider that when cutting Sunday service. Mike has concerns about
the bus stops on Parker Rd between Dartmouth Ave and Peoria St: people cut cross Parker
Rd during rush hour instead of walking all the way down to the crosswalks since it’s a
pretty far walk. Can RTD move the bus stops closer to the crosswalks so people aren’t
tempted to cross traffic? He asks that RTD look into this as it is a safety concern. He’s
heard that other places have provided a breakdown of what each route costs per rider –
can we do something like that here? That seems like it would be a useful tool and maybe
get more people on FlexRide instead of fixed route service. There’s a whole society of
people who depend on FlexRide, and if they can’t get their ride even one day, it really
impacts their life. RTD should hire more part-time workers.
Tom Graves came to this meeting to voice support for the RunRide for the Bolder Boulder
event. Please think carefully about this decision, it’s the only way may people can get to
this event.
Kimetha King rides the 99L and has been riding it for years. She also rides the 483. The
proposed discontinuation of the 99L will add considerable time to her commute. Can this
route be merged with another route from Federal Center? Kimetha has tried using Parker
FlexRide, but wasn’t a good option for her.

Kit Summers would like to know if ridership information is available to the public. Is there
a breakdown of ridership for every stop and every station? Kit noted that he doesn’t see
the Flatiron Flyer up for any reductions of service, does RTD really have the funds to run
the FF as frequently as it currently does?

Tom Blach Rides the P Route, and uses RTD services regularly. He thinks RTD is great,
and would like some ridership data to get the word out there.
Inger Pippen has participated in the Bolder Boulder for 24 years and has taken the RunRide
every single year. The timing of this cut is bad, maybe this cancellation could be made
next year so that participants can plan for alternative transportation.
Erin Madigan is concerned about proposed discontinuation of the BroncosRide. This service
keeps intoxicated people off the road, and it’s only a few times a year – why would RTD
eliminate this?
Omar Castillo is the Vice Chair of the Parker Area Chamber of Commerce. Parker pays $11
million to RTD, where is that money going? What is RTD doing to bring more work force to
Parker?
Cheryl Poage came after the meeting while members of the public were mingling with RTD
employees, she thought this was an open house event from 6-8:00 pm. Can RTD expect
an increase in service any time soon? We need get workers in and out of Parker to get
more ridership. RTD needs to reach out to out of state tech schools and trade schools for
mechanics and drivers. What is our opinion of the proposed state bill?

Re: Service Cuts
Date: February 11, 2020
Dear Members of the RTD Board:

In regards to proposed Temporary Service Reductions, Boulder Transportation Connections wishes to share our comments.
●

Attachment: May 2020 Attachment B (4136 : May 2020 Recommended Service Changes)

Thank you for your service and the efforts to expand transportation options through our district. With a large and diverse
region, this job is not easy.

We are asking you to reconsider the suspension of the RunRide Service. The Bolder Boulder is held on Memorial
Day when existing service is already reduced. With a difference in location for the race start and the race finish,
the RunRide provides a valuable asset, simplifying the trip for users. Park and Rides throughout the area, such as
the Niwot Park and Ride, are overflowing on the morning of Memorial Day. A positive experience with the
RunRide can encourage a person to consider RTD for other trips, including their work commute.
As to the reduction on the 236, we agree that this route has been underutilized and hope that the future brings
more direct service between Boulder Junction and Denver. We encourage RTD to apply some of the savings from
service cuts to allow other operators to provide service from Boulder Junction.
Route 206 is an example of a route that serves a great need. We hope that RTD continues to study and explore
options for how best to serve these neighborhoods. BTC believes that South Boulder residents need and deserve
more direct access to their desired destinations. The number of transfers required from South Boulder typically
makes transit far less time efficient. When routes are returned after the temporary reductions, we hope to see
more options for people in South Boulder, around 55th Street, and from Boulder Junction.
Jump service has been identified via the NAMS study as an area needing heightened service. This corridor is
slated for BRT service. Cutting the service, which is intended to grow in the future, is a backward step.
Lastly, we are very concerned about reduction made to the Y service, the only bus option for the residents of
Lyons. This area would likely see higher transit usage if transit options were more frequent and thus more
reliable. Lyons could also be receiving weekend service to assist service workers, get people to and from outdoor
opportunities, and support transit dependent users. If service to Lyons is cut, the funds should be returned to
the community to support other options including transportation vouchers.

RTD Board, thank you for your consideration and thank you again for providing a safe, reliable and cost‐effective service
throughout our district.
