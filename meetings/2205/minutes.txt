Pension Trust Fund Update
Cal Marsella framed the discussion to follow and Director Wally Pulliam
provided the setup to this presentation and introduced Brad Ramirez,
actuary with the Segal Group, who reviewed the presentation with the
committee. Stephen Weinstein, legal consultant for the pension trust,
provided a legal perspective that a government agency is not governed
by ERISA and therefore should meet the three requirements for a change
in the pension plan based on the respective state: actuarial necessity,
corresponding increase in benefits or substantial improvement in the
plan. There is perceived risk involved in changing the plan for current
employees and therefore all recommended changes would apply to new
employees hired after Jan 1, 2008. For a copy of the RTD Salaried
Employees Pension Plan Review, please refer to the Executive Committee
minutes located in the Board office notebook.
Director Yamrick stated there were 4 types of plans available for
employees at RTD (including the represented employees) and asked for
consideration that the plan would include every employee hired from
2008. Cal Marsella further clarified that there are separate plans for
represented employees and salaried employees. The represented plan is
totally outside RTD and there are no obligations or liabilities for this plan.

Summary of the Executive Committee Meeting held on September 18, 2007, 12:00
p.m. Page 2 of 7
Several of the Directors had questions about the plan and the proposed
options and requested more time to review this proposal. Chair Martinez
made the decision to postpone moving this forward until the full Board
had a chance to be briefed in a study session to be determined. Director
Brohl requested a projected number of new hires and what would the
impact be to the plan. Director McMullen requested scenarios for a new
employee using the defined contribution plan and using the defined
benefit plan for comparison purposes.

II.

2008 Board Decision Package
Director Elfenbein spoke on his request for a Board decision package for
Transit Alliance and requested permission to have this included with the
other requests for the 2008 Board Decision package. The Committee
agreed to move this forward.

requested Staff to provide more information on projected number of
hires in 2008 and its impact on this decision. They would also like to
see scenarios for new employees under the defined contribution plan
