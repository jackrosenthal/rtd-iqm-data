BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

David A. Genova, General Manager and CEO

Date: March 2, 2017

From:

William C. Van Meter,
Manager, Planning

GM

Date:

Subject:

Modeling On-Call Contract Amendment

Assistant

General

Board Meeting Date: March 28, 2017

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to amend the contract
with AECOM for travel modeling services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This
amendment increases the value by $535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the
2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
BACKGROUND
In 2013 RTD awarded a contract to AECOM to perform travel modeling on an as-needed basis, The
contractor performs work when required due to limitations of RTD resources and/or expertise for the
particular task and time. Work has been performed in the context of National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) studies; Federal Transit Administration (FTA) New Starts submittals; Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG) regional planning activities as required by Federal planning law; RTD internal
planning studies; RTD budget development and contract analysis; and preliminary engineering, final
design, and construction of FasTracks corridors.
The contract is for three years with two one-year renewable options at RTD’s sole discretion. RTD has
exercised these options and 2017 is the last year of the contract. The initial contract value was
$309,706.62. A previous amendment in 2013 increased the value by $46,000 to reach the current
value of $355,706.62.
DISCUSSION
One key purpose is to provide travel modeling services for the SH-119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
Planning and Engineering Study. That study will require travel modeling for numerous BRT
alternatives to develop ridership and related data for decision-making.
A second purpose of this contract amendment is to make travel model updates. The Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) requires recipients of Full Funding Grant Agreements (FFGAs) to regularly
update travel forecasting models for the projects receiving grants. RTD makes use of three travel
models:
1. A traditional four-step model originally developed by DRCOG called Compass
2. A state-of-the-art tour-based model developed by DRCOG called Focus
3. A transit ridership forecasting model developed by FTA called Simplified Trips-on-Project
Software (STOPS)

1.B.1

Of the $535,000 being requested for this contract amendment, it is expected that $285,000 will be
used for travel model updates and $250,000 will be used for the SH-119 BRT Environmental
Clearance project.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment is included in the 2017 expense budget and the budget for the SH
119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning/Capital Programs &
FasTracks Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to
execute all documents necessary to amend the contract with AECOM for travel modeling
services. The current contract value is $355,706.62. This amendment increases the value by
$535,000 to a total of $890,706.62. Funding is included in the 2017 base system expense
budget and the budget for the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. This is not recommended because it will delay the
completion of travel model calibration and the SH 119 BRT Environmental Clearance project.

PART 1: TRANSIT FARE POLICY:
CONSUMER PRICE INDEX
• No rate-making policy in original parking program
• Cumulative CPI for 2008-2016 was 17.5%
– $2.00 X 1.175 = $2.35
– How would 17.5% increase impact ridership and parking?
– Recent RTD Study (elasticity of parking demand):
– 17.5% increase in parking rates has potential:
• Loss of parking from 6% to 18%
• Loss of ridership from 3% to 18%

– Offset by site specific conditions that will backfill losses
• service alternatives, distance, traffic conditions
• latent demand for parking…system-wide15 p-n-r over 93% usage
