Executive Committee
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Good morning. I'd like to call the Executive Committee to order. Is 11:30 AM
on July 15, 2021. I have, Miss McManus, can you do the roll call of the Executive Committee, please?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes. Director Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Buzek.
VINCE BUZEK: Here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Chair Angie Rivera-Malpiede.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Here.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Rosenthal. Four present, one absent being Director Rosenthal. We also
see Director Tisdale and Director Catlin who are joining us, as well as Melanie Snyder, General Counsel,
Brandi Hunter, Steve Decker on our IT team, John McKay, and CEO General Manager Johnson from the
executive offices. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you, Miss McManus. I so appreciate it. This morning, we're going to
be approving the agenda for the Board meeting. And before I do, what I'd like to do is under unanimous
consent, pull-- pull it up, pull item B, the Amendment to the General Manager and CEO employment, and
put it under an executive session. So General Counsel, if I might ask you to help us do that, and Ms.
McManus.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair. So I think that what you're wanting to do is pull it off
unanimous consent agenda. But it would still be on the agenda. And then my understanding is that you
wanted to do a separate executive session. And that would be scheduled with staff in coordination with
myself.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: That would be correct.

MELANIE SNYDER: OK, but not necessarily on July 20.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Correct.
MELANIE SNYDER: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. And then if you could get back with us, that would be great. Thank
you. So do I have a motion to move forward with the Board meeting agenda?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Oh wait. I have a question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So Melanie, you said not specifically on the 20th. So are we not bringing this item
forward on the 20th? I just want to be clear.
MELANIE SNYDER: So sorry if I was unclear. We are bringing this matter. It would be on the agenda for
the meeting on the 20th. But my understanding is that the Chair wanted to hold a separate executive
session for discussion that's related to this contract but the executive session wouldn't necessarily be on
the 20th. That could be scheduled with 24 hours notice.
BARBARA MCMANUS: So that would be prior to the 20th.
MELANIE SNYDER: Likely.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you. OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: All right. With that all in mind—
VINCE BUZEK: I have a question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
VINCE BUZEK: So the executive session will occur before the 20th.
MELANIE SNYDER: That's my understanding of what you all were asking for.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, that's good. Yeah. I thought it was going to be on the 20th before the meeting. But
yeah, I think it needs to be before the 20th since it's an executive session to discuss personnel matters,
which will be on the agenda the 20th. OK, got it.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

MELANIE SNYDER: --separately noticed executive session.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you for that clarification. Any other discussion? Yes First Chair
Guissinger.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Melanie, can you please remind us what is appropriate in the executive session
and what isn't with respect to this?
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. So Madam Chair, if I may?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please.
MELANIE SNYDER: Yes. So you have the Open Meetings Law allows for discussion of personnel
matters in executive session. There is also the opportunity to get legal advice on executive session. So
my plan was to speak with the chair to make sure that we have a clear basis for that executive session.
But those would be the two main topics that I would think that would be the basis for that session.
LYNN GUISSINGER: Thank you.
MELANIE SNYDER: You're welcome.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Any other questions? Yes. Director Tisdale.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you very much, Madam Chair. I just forgive the interruption from a non-executive
committee member. But just to give me clarification on this. So the executive session will be held not on
July 20, but perhaps on July 19, or sometime over the weekend? I ask because I'm going to be traveling
and will be probably not available to attend depending upon when it is. Do we have some sense of when
we will actually schedule that executive session meeting?
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We do not as of yet. So after the executive committee, we will look at the
dates and then get it out as soon as possible.
DOUG TISDALE: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Thank you. Thank you, Director Tisdale. Anyone else?
LYNN GUISSINGER: And yeah, just one more. I haven't thought it through y'all have in terms of what-but is the decision that it doesn't make sense to have the executive session before the Board meeting the
same night?

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: We have done it like that in the past. And I will refer to the GMOC Chair. But
it seems to me that we could do either I believe. Is that correct, Miss McManus?
BARBARA MCMANUS: Yes.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: So I guess what I will do is meet with the General Manager or with the
General Counsel and Miss McManus and the Chair of the GMOC to determine if we do it before. We
would have to do it before the actual Board meeting. We could do it like a 4:30 executive session I
suppose on the 20th or the day before. So we would be looking at that.
LYNN GUISSINGER: OK, thanks.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director [INAUDIBLE]
VINCE BUZEK: That's a—
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Please. Go ahead.
VINCE BUZEK: Yeah, it's a good point Lynn. And I thought it was going to be the same night as the
Board meeting since that is scheduled and everybody has notice. It probably wouldn't be an extremely
lengthy executive session. So we could start it at 5:30 just as our normal Board meeting. Just a thought
for discussion. Thanks.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yeah, and we have not determined the date. Usually it's on the same day.
We just do it earlier. But it is something we will be looking at.
VINCE BUZEK: OK, great.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Director Catlin.
PEGGY CATLIN: Thank you, Madam Chair. I really think that pulling this from the unanimous consent
agenda is a good idea because the GMOC did not have all Board participants. And I think that a
discussion from the Board as a whole would be appropriate. So I wanted to thank you for pulling it from
the unanimous consent agenda. So thank you for doing that.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK, thank you. Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, just to echo that, and to sort of apologize, I did open the packet and saw the
PowerPoint. But that was listed as a discussion item. And I didn't, and this is my fault, I didn't open the
action item to realize that they were connected and linked. So I apologize for that. But I think it may have
been the case that other Board members also had made that oversight. And so I'm glad we're pulling it
from the agenda for discussion. So thank you.

ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. OK. With all of that said, do I have a motion to accept the
agenda?
VINCE BUZEK: So moved.
SHELLEY COOK: Second.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Thank you. For a minute, I thought, uh-oh. Anyone opposed to the agenda
as it stands?
VINCE BUZEK: As amended.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Oh, it's amended. Yes, thank you. Seeing none, we're good to go, Miss
McManus.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: OK. Other than that, I have nothing. Is there any other matters to come
before this Board? OK.
VINCE BUZEK: Oh, I have a question.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Yes.
VINCE BUZEK: Is anybody downtown at Blake? Some people are. Is the traffic still crazy around-- I have
to drive down there.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Well, you can park now next to RTD in the new parking facility.
VINCE BUZEK: I don't know how that works. I'm kind of afraid. So—
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's very simple.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Is it?
BARBARA MCMANUS: It's very simple. And if you want to stay on after this call, I'll walk you through it.
VINCE BUZEK: OK.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Or Director Buzek, if you need me to go down and sign checks, I can do that
too. So either one.

VINCE BUZEK: I have to pick some stuff up while I'm there. But I appreciate that offer. Thank you.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: Second Vice Chair Cook.
SHELLEY COOK: Yeah, thank you. I just wanted to compliment the staff and Pauletta. We of course, still
have the mask requirement. But during the Major League Baseball All-Star events, one of our riders sent
me an image of the G line that night, and it was packed. I mean standing room only, which is really good
to see. But not a soul in the picture had a mask on. And with the Delta variant, I think it's really good to
reinforce that. So I just wanted to say thank you, CEO Johnson. And please pass that along to Pauletta
as well.
ANGIE RIVERA-MALPIEDE: On that same note, I have seen stories on the news about the mask
requirement and why. And I think that was really timely during this whole time. But yeah. Thank you for
stating that.
Any other matters to come before the Executive Committee? All right. Seeing none, we are adjourned as
11:41. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Have a great week.
BARBARA MCMANUS: Director Buzek, I will call you right away.
VINCE BUZEK: Thanks, Barbara.
