#### 1. Civil Rights Committee - WIN Update

Zamy Silva, Senior Manager for Civil Rights, said that she was very delighted to be updating the Board this evening.  She noted that, as the Board saw during the State of the District presentation during the Operations and Customer Service Committee Meeting, the WIN program received over $660K in 2015 from the Federal Transit Authority.  She shared that in addition to the FTA funding, one of RTD and the WIN program’s key partners, Denver Transit Partners (DTP) and its affiliates, has made an additional donation to the WIN program for 2016.  She stated that DTP has donated to the WIN program since 2011.  Zamy Silva pointed out that even though there was no WIN goal as part of DTP’s contract with RTD they have voluntarily worked with RTD to hire WIN participants.  She explained that the other exciting item is that DTP has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with RTD to utilize WIN participants for the duration of operations and maintenance of the Eagle P3 project.

Martell Dyles, WIN Program Manager, expressed that it was very exciting to receive additional funding from DTP.  He explained that this funding will be a tremendous asset in addressing the many ancillary needs that might not be covered by the FTA grant.  He asked Aaron Epstein, DTP CEO and Executive Project Director, to speak more about DTP’s partnership with RTD.

Aaron Epstein thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak this evening.  He said that on behalf of DTP and all their affiliates he wanted to share how proud they were of the work done within the communities in partnership with RTD.  He shared that when DTP was given the opportunity to participate in the WIN program they thought it was a great idea.  He commented how impressed he was with the vision of former General Manager Washington for the WIN program that has been carried on by Interim General Manager Genova.  He noted that DTP and its affiliates have contributed over $400K since 2011 and have received a lot of benefit from the program.  Aaron Epstein pointed out that DTP’s operations and maintenance contract with RTD is for 29 years so people being hired from the WIN program will really be developing long-term careers.  He said that to-date already 33 people have been hired on the operations side and he expects more will be hired in the future.

Director Archuleta inquired how many people had been hired through the WIN program to-date and if they were full or part-time employees.  Martell Dyles stated that since 2011 there have been 663 people hired from the WIN program.  He shared that number continues to grow and believes it will be closer to 700 come January, 2016.  He said that he would provide the Board with the breakdown of full and part-time employees.

Director Anderson asked for information as to the number of people that have been hired from Adams County.  She feels that the WIN program is very Denver oriented; however, there are many people in Adams County that could benefit from the WIN program and need jobs.  Martell Dyles said he would provide the Board with that information.

Director Francone echoed Director Anderson’s sentiments.  She shared that she met with Martell Dyles recently and one of the concerns she addressed with him was that people in Jefferson County need jobs too.  She believes from her conversation with Martell that it is in the works to begin rolling the program out to other counties soon.

Committee Chair Walker noted that RTD does not just move people, we help build lives.  He believes the WIN program makes a real investment in the lives of the participants which means a lot more than just giving someone a job.   He thinks this is something that should be recognized.  Director Walker shared that in October when he attended APTA Annual and Rail~Volution he was approached by several people about the WIN program.  He commended the work of the WIN team and DTP.

Director Lubow asked if the number of people hired from the WIN program could be provided for every county.  Zamy Silva said that staff would provide the Board with the complete information.  She shared that there would be a lot of outreach throughout the entire District in the coming year.

### D. Other Matters

Director Archuleta shared that he recently represented RTD at the Denver Union Station Grand Illumination when it was a warm 17 degrees.  He also recently accepted an award from the U.S. Building Green Council of Colorado for the Commuter Rail Maintenance Facility.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Walker adjourned the meeting at 7:55 p.m.
