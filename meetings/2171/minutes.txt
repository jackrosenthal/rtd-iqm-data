November Board meeting Agenda Review
Assistant General Manager Genova introduced the items for the
November Board meeting.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to
approve November Board Agenda.
Director Tayer seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Vote on
the Motion:


The agenda appears pretty benign. Board
members noted that Director Christopher
had wanted a discussion with the staff
prior to next Tuesday meeting as it
relates to the contracts for Jacobs,
Delcan and Front Range. Dave Genova
indicated he would follow-up with Rick
Clarke.
Relevant to the action item “resolution
regarding waiver of sovereign Immunity
and Indemnification of claims for UP
Moffat subdivision”, Director Tayer
expressed the need for a more global
solution. This is a bigger issue for transit
and requires global traction. It would be
worth it to him to invest a few dollars to
get a dedicated focus on this issue.
Director James indicated that Carol
Boigon with the Denver City Council was
also taking on this item.
The Motion PASSED.

IV.

Memberships to Organizations (i.e. NAIOP)
Chair Kemp indicated the only item we have on the books relate to the
membership in Chambers of Commerce. This resolution is also outdated
in that it limits the amount of money spent with these Chambers to a
defined amount although Chamber membership costs have grown more
over the years. He would like to establish an ad hoc group to look at
this issue. How do we approach which organization to be approved?
What are the criteria?
He would like to appoint Director James and other Board members along
with member/s of staff to determine the appropriate criteria and bring
back a recommendation to the full Board.
Director James accepted this appointment and indicated that from his
perspective when we are looking at professional organizations, etc, it
may be that there are different types of memberships based around
Board or staff. There are reasons for being a part of these different
organizations (i.e. professional organizations, Chamber of Commerce,
Neighborhood Organizations) such as PR, ridership, political
environment, etc. He would like this committee to explore and identify
similarities and differences as to when membership may be advisable.
He would also like time to explore who might be a good Board member
for this committee but hopefully we can keep it at a minimum number.
It should be a Director offering a diverse or different perspective. Dave
Genova suggested Scott Reed and Carla Perez from the Senior
Leadership Team but would like to defer this to the General Manager
and the Leadership team for further discussion.
Director Tayer suggested that perhaps Director James could ask for a
show of interest at the upcoming Board meeting. The Committee
agreed that this is really an expansion of the resolution already on the
record and should not deter from the bigger issues that the Board must
address.
