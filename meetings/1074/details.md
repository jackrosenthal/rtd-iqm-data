There was no retiree present.  Chair Kemp recognized Lorraine Taylor, bus stop program supervisor, for her 22 years of service at RTD.

Special Recognition

The Board and General Manager Washington recognized Jim Jacobson and his staff at the Wellness Center for going beyond the call of duty.  Director Cohen shared the story where on October 26 during the Health Fair, an employee suffered a medical emergency.  Jim responded in a very timely and calm manner to assist the employee and avoid a potential serious situation.  Director Cohen stated this was incredible action and the team worked together like a smooth and well-oiled machine.

## IV. Public Participation

- Katie Witt, member of the Longmont City Council, who was representing NATA expressed general support for the approach to the risk allocation matrix (RAM) but expressed needing more clarification on (1) what jurisdictions and amount above the current 2.5% level have been contributed from local sources and (2) information on how the projected $127M for the sales tax audit has been calculated.  She expressed a desire by NATA to participate in this sales tax audit/parity discussion.  She also expressed a desire by NATA that these funds are allocated to the north/northwest corridor.

- Howard Gelt, also with NATA, reemphasized the desire that in the interest of equity parity, the monies from the RAM should be allocated to the north.

- Gene Putman, Transportation Planning Manager for the City of Thornton, stated that he supports the comments made by Katie Witt.  They are in general support for the RAM but need further discussion related to: increase in local match above the 2 ½%; What others have contributed in this process; and trying to get to 104th versus the 72 Street that RTD has proposed.  He stated that sadly RTD is not on time nor on budget.

- Walter Isenberg with USA expressed appreciation to the RTD staff, particularly Marla Lien and her negotiation skills for the approval of the lease of the Denver Union Station Historic Building. He thanked the Board for their confidence and trust to them to be tenant of one of the most amazing assets in the city-DUS.  This building will open as a multi-modal, retail and hospitality center in downtown Denver.  The building will close beginning this weekend for this renovation.

## V. Committee Reports

Director Daly indicated a correction to the name of Senator Cadman in the Government Relations minutes.  This has been corrected. Stan Gronek with ATU had noted an error on the Board minutes for the reported $300M for RAM.  This has also been corrected.
