PUBLIC PARTICIPATION




Katie Witt, member of the Longmont City Council, who was representing NATA
expressed general support for the approach to the risk allocation matrix (RAM) but
expressed needing more clarification on (1) what jurisdictions and amount above the
current 2.5% level have been contributed from local sources and (2) information on how
the projected 127M for the sales tax audit has been calculated. She expressed a desire
by NATA to participate in this sales tax audit/parity discussion. She also expressed a
desire by NATA that these funds are allocated to the north/northwest corridor.
Howard Gelt, also with NATA, reemphasized the desire that in the interest of equity
parity, the monies from the RAM should be allocated to the north.
Gene Putnam, Transportation Planning Manager for the City of Thornton, stated that he

supports the comments made by Katie Witt. They are in general support for the RAM but
need further discussion related to: increase in local match above the 2 ½%; What others
have contributed in this process; and trying to get to 104th versus the 72 Street that RTD
has proposed. He stated that sadly RTD is not on time nor on budget.
