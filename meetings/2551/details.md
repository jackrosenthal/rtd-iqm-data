### B. Recommended Actions

There were no recommended actions.

#### 1. I-225

Henry Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, stated that the Kiewit Team continues to test the R Line and the entire team is working days and nights to continue their work.  He said that once Kiewit finishes their work, Rail Operations can complete pre-revenue testing.  He commented that the biggest challenge right now is the train traffic interface in the downtown loop.  He added that testing is underway, but an opening date will not be released at this time.  He remarked that the R Line, minus the downtown loop, is ready to be transferred to Rail Operations.

#### 2. North Metro Operations & Maintenance

Henry Stopplecamp stated that this item deals with how RTD will operate and maintain North Metro.  He said last time he approached the Board there were three items to consider: extend the contract with Denver Transit Partners (DTP), put the Commuter Rail under RTD Rail Operations, or hire a Third Party operator.  He remarked that staff has explored all three options, and it would be cost effective to allow DTP to maintain the commuter rail fleet.  He added that staff continues to review the options and they are examining the cost benefits and associated risks.

### D. Other Matters

Director Menten asked for the status of the Intergovernmental Agreements (IGA) for the West and North Metro Lines.

Henry Stopplecamp indicated that the IGA’s for the West line are completed.  He said for North Metro, the IGA’s for construction are in place, but staff still has to put into place IGA’s for Operations and Maintenance.

Director Bagley stated that he had attended the Denver South Economic Partnership Holiday event and he had over 20 conversations about the Southwest Corridor extension.  He wanted to hand that off to the new Board as there is interest in getting that project completed.

Henry Stopplecamp noted that there will be a University of Colorado A-Line Technical Update on Wednesday, December 14th from 12:30 – 2:00 p.m.  He added that a third temporary shelter had been installed at Broadway and Lincoln, and all temporary shelters will be completed by this week.

Director Menten asked from a drivers point of view, how long are drivers actually waiting at the gate crossings on the University of Colorado A-Line.

Henry Stopplecamp stated that the crossing arms are only down for one minute.  He remarked that there is a longer wait when Union Pacific changes tracks, as their trains cause RTD’s crossing arms to go down too, but the wait times are not longer than a minute.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 9:26 p.m.
