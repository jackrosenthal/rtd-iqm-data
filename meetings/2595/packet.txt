GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2018
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability
Background
Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2018 relates to
fiscal sustainability. The Board and staff identified the following specific focus areas:











Consider Additional Revenue Streams
Financial Planning
Maximize Partnerships
CBA/Pension
Manage Third Party Expectations
Increase Reserves
Federal and State Funding
Minimize Borrowing and Debt
Use Innovative Approaches
Rolling Stock

Consider Additional Revenue Streams/Funding Sources
RTD continues to consider additional streams. Examples include:
 Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
 January 1, 2016 implementation of the new fare structure and rates
 Implement a naming rights program
 Expand advertising to digital formats
 Pursuing a long-term solution to maintaining and operating the 16th Street Mall
 Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales
 Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD
operations
 Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes
 Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise
 Continue to seek refinancing of debt to lower interest and principal payments
RTD will continue to investigate and pursue new funding sources. RTD will continue to
consider additional revenue streams through collaboration with stakeholders and the private
sector.
Financial Planning
Financial planning consists of evaluating current and future financial state by using known
variables to predict future revenues and expenditures. Each year RTD staff updates the
Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), a six-year plan for the Base System, and the Annual Program
Evaluation (APE), a six-year plan for the FasTracks system. In addition, the long range plan
1

Packet Pg. 4

Attachment: 04.25.17 GM Tactical Plan Fiscal Sustainability 2018 Packet (3123 : Supporting Information - 2018 Tactical Plan)

2.1.a

is prepared for both the Base System and FasTracks and the planning horizon is currently
2040. In addition to being utilized for the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP)
and Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), the SBP and APE provide a snapshot each year for
the RTD Board and Staff to plan for the future and understand the impacts of decisions that
have been made and those that are made today, and the impact on future revenues and
operations. The SBP and APE become the basis for the annual budget each year. To remain
fiscally sustainable, RTD must annually balance the SBP and the APE while meeting service
needs, addressing state of good repair, large infrastructure needs such as bus and rail
facilities, and building financial reserves.
Maximize Partnerships
Partnerships are very beneficial to RTD. Collaborating to achieve mutually beneficial
financial and operational goals, while sometimes challenging is essential. RTD partners on
a regular basis with the state, local municipalities, federal government, and the private
sector. One recent example is the refinancing of the Denver Union Station Project
Authority’s (DUSPA) TIFIA and RRIF loans. RTD worked with the City and County of Denver
to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement to refinance and pay off the loans. This will
save RTD nearly $6 million per year for the next 23 years. RTD continues to work with our
partners in the District to further projects with mutually beneficial financial arrangements.
CBA/Pension
In March of 2013, RTD and the Union executed a five-year agreement. That agreement is
scheduled to expire in February of 2018. In the latter half of 2017, RTD and the Union will
commence negotiations for the next contract. Covered in the agreements are such things
as:
 Wages
 Benefits
 Work rules
In early 2017, we initiated a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for
negotiations. Major areas of focus will be wage, benefits, and work rules. There will be
challenges in addressing competing priorities within the fiscal constraints of the RTD budget,
and the current condition of employment in Colorado, specifically the Denver metro area.
RTD employees participate in one of three different retirement plans. They are: (1) Salaried
Defined Benefit Plan, (2) Salaried Defined Contribution Plan, and (3) the Regional
Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Pension Trust (for
Represented employees).
1. Salaried Defined Benefit Plan
a. Plan closed to new salaried participants on January 1, 2008
b. Current funded Ratio is 78.3%
c. Current RTD contribution is $4.6 million/year still short of actuarial
recommendation of $7.6 million/year
d. Currently expected to reach 100% of funding in 2043

iv. Early retirement reduction changed from 5% from age 55 to 2.5% from
age 60
v. Sick and vacation no longer included in pension benefit calculation
vi. Interest on employee contributions is changed from 5% to 3%
We will continue to monitor the financial status and report to the Board on all the plans.
Manage Third Party Expectations
Increasingly RTD is receiving unsolicited requests from stakeholders and constituents that
are very difficult if not impossible to honor or fulfill from a financial and operational
perspective. Many of these requests fall outside of RTD’s approved financial plan and RTD
existing policy. These requests put RTD in a very difficult and awkward situation on many
occasions. RTD wants to be a good, responsive partner, but we must focus on our purpose
and fiscal sustainability.
RTD will continue to work with stakeholders and be responsive by explaining RTD policy
and financial condition. RTD will also be collaborative in discussions, hearing and receiving
from stakeholders. For example, we recently were compared to King County in the Seattle
area and their low income fare program. King County is a county, and counties are
responsible for social service programs. We are not a county and should not assume the
responsibilities of others for social service programs within the RTD district.
RTD staff will continue to make the Board aware when these type of informal or formal asks
occur so the Board is as informed as possible in case the Board is approached by local
governments, community members or other stakeholders.
Many of the requests that we have received have been around creating special passes or
pilot programs for particular groups of constituents around the District. RTD has convened
a Pass Program Working Group with District-wide stakeholders. Their mission is to make
recommendations on possible revisions to RTD pass programs. The work of the group is to
be completed in 2018. Although not necessarily set up for this specific purpose, hopefully

2.1.a

2.1.a

Increase Reserves
The Board has adopted 2016 Fiscal Policies which includes a Fund Balance Policy. This
policy states the following:
RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to provide for
unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs
or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue. The
Base System, should strive to maintain a total balance at an amount approximately equal to
three (3) months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation among the
following three reserve funds: the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating
reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance. For FasTracks, the total of the Boardappropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to three (3) months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding
depreciation. RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance
replenishment. For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an especially
appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.
In 2017, RTD established an operating reserve as was outlined in the 2017 tactical plan.
This reserve will allow for more flexibility in dealing with revenue changes as they could be
adjusted through the reserve rather than cutting back previously approved projects or service
levels.
Building reserves will allow for more flexibility in dealing with future revenue shortfalls which
is important because of the inherent economic volatility of the District’s largest revenue
source, sales tax. Growth of these reserves requires discipline to set aside funds in the
short term rather than spending the funds on service in the short term. This short-term
constraint on spending is a strategic effort to improve the long term fiscal sustainability of
RTD.
Federal and State Funding
Federal transportation funding is integral to RTD’s operations and capital programs. We
receive approximately $71 million per year for operations from FTA and have received full
funding grant agreement dollars as well as CMAQ and STP-Metro dollars for various projects.
RTD is monitoring the new federal administration’s budget summary regarding new starts,
small starts and TIGER grant funds. Although this may not have an immediate impact on
RTD, the possible elimination or reorganizing of these programs could preclude RTD from
getting funds from a program the agency has greatly benefitted from in the past. RTD staff
will be diligent in advocating for protection of these important funding sources and staying
on top of future proposals that may impact transportation funding.
Currently the Colorado legislature is considering several referred measures, the most
prominent being H.B. 17-1242. This bill would increase the state sales tax to provide

this working group will produce results that will provide possible recommendations around
the pass programs.

additional funds for transportation with a portion going to CDOT to support the issuance of
bonds, the cities and counties, and a portion to the transportation options account. This bill
reduces the road safety surcharges imposed on motor vehicles during the period that the
new sales and use tax is in effect. Since RTD does receive FASTER funds from CDOT on a
regular basis, this mostly will have an impact of the amount of funds RTD may receive. If
this passes the legislature, it would need to go to the ballot in November 2017. Should any
state funding measure pass, RTD will work with all regional stakeholders to address any
possible benefits to RTD.
Minimize Borrowing and Debt
RTD issues debt for large capital projects and rolling stock. RTD had the following debt
outstanding as of December 31, 2016 (totaling $3,978,918,095).






Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (Base System) - $120,525,000
Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks) - $1,917,941,384
Eagle P3 TABOR Portion of Service Payments - $589,913,540
DUSPA - $151,263,171(refinanced in February 2017)
Lease Purchase Agreements/COPs - $1,199,275,000

When deciding to issue debt, several things are taken into consideration: (1) the amount of
outstanding debt, (2) the debt service coverage ratio, (3) the ability to repay the debt, (4)
the desire to issue debt, and (5) the ability to cash fund. Additionally, RTD seeks to build
reserves to possibly issue future debt for FasTracks completion as soon as feasible.
RTD has examined all these factors and has chosen to use cash for the near term rather
than issue additional debt. At this time, RTD is not scheduled to issue debt until 2023 for
rolling stock. RTD will continue to review the use of debt during the SBP, APE, and financial
plan process.
Use Innovative Approaches
RTD has been known nationally for its use of innovative approaches such as the Eagle P3
project, Denver Union Station, and the use of Certificates of Participation (COPs) on the
North Metro Project just to name a few. In order to complete the remaining FasTracks
projects we will have to continue to look for new and creative ways to finance, fund, build,
and operate these corridors. These approaches could include identification of new funding
sources and savings in construction or ongoing operating costs. RTD will also seek
partnerships and continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders and private sector.
Rolling Stock
RTD has traditionally managed rolling stock well, often exceeding FTA recommended useful
life through robust maintenance and state of good repair programs. Rolling stock
maintenance is addressed in the annual RTD operating budget. Rolling stock replacement is
addressed through the 6-year SBP. These processes will be continued to maintain RTD
rolling stock in a state of good repair and to plan for proper replacement.

Strategic Goal #2
Workforce and Human Capital
Background
One of RTD’s greatest resources is its employees. RTD has 2,893 employees. Of the
2,893, 874 are salaried employees and 2,019 are represented employees and fall under
RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). As a part of this goal, the Board and staff
identified specific focus areas. Each of the following focus areas are addressed below:


Recruitment and Retention
As the economy has improved and unemployment has dropped to 2.4% in the 10-county
Denver Metro area and 2.6% for the State (Denver Business Journal, April 2017), recruiting
and retention have become much more challenging particularly in the areas of bus operators,
light rail operators, and mechanics. Hiring qualified applicants is not just a Human Resource
function, so recognizing that, RTD established a Recruitment and Retention Working Group
over a year ago. This group is tasked with working together to improve our recruitment
process and increase retention. Members of that working group include: AGM of Rail, AGM
of Bus, AGM of Communications, AGM of Finance and Administration, HR, Marketing, State
of Good Repair, and Bus Operations. The following improvements have been made and will
continue:

In 2016, RTD hired 344 bus operators, 29 mechanics, and 92 light rail operators for a total
of 465 hires. In 2016, there were 192 more hires for these same occupational groups or a
70% increase over 2015. However, in 2016 we also had 267 bus operators leave or net
+77, 17 mechanics leave or net +12, and 64 light rail operators leave or net +28. While
we saw improvements in recruiting, it remains very challenging to sustain significant gains
in a 2.4% unemployment environment.
Continued and new efforts include:

market competitive in a very low unemployment environment
Review methods of scheduling runs to determine economic impacts of fewer split
shifts and shorter split shift time spreads
Review shift schedules to determine economic impacts and practicality of other work
schedules, for example 4, 10 hour shifts instead of 5, 8 hour shifts
Recruit part-time operators, especially retired operators and evaluate possible
methods to utilize part-time positions to possibly reduce the number of split shifts
Continue to monitor workforce regarding retirements, and
Continue with RTD professional development and training programs as described in
the next section.
Professional Development and Training
RTD has a very robust professional development and training program. Each salaried
employee is offered $2,000/ year and each represented employee is offered
$2,000/year (an increase of $500 from 2017) towards education and training. In
addition, RTD offers “free of charge” classes such as Word, Excel, Power Point, and
other classes to provide job enrichment and professional development for employees
to learn new skills and develop new skills to be able to compete for promotional
opportunity. RTD also has the Leadership Academy and the MAX program.
The Leadership Academy is designed to support RTD’s emerging leaders, salaried and
represented, by focusing on the relationship of mission, values, culture, and strategic
priorities. Members of this one-year educational program engage in a comprehensive
coursework that provides them with the tools and resources to successfully guide
RTD in the coming years. Employees selected for the program benefit from
professional training and mentoring. By offering a dynamic environment for the
development of leadership mastery, organizational stewardship, business
fundamentals, and technical competencies, the Leadership Academy promotes the
advancement of RTD employees. Since its inception, over 120 employees have
completed the program. With more graduates by the end of 2017.
The Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is a program designed to create future
Transit Leaders and to provide the public with continuity through the evolution of the
3

Packet Pg. 11

2.1.a

industry and the needs of our patrons. MAX is designed to leverage best practices of
the industry in order to minimize the learning curve and reduce the cost and time to
implement new programs. MAX participants are from RTD, Dallas, Atlanta, and Los
Angeles. Current RTD participants in the program must also be graduates of the
Leadership Academy. The primary goal of the MAX program is to expose and develop
our future leaders by working with other transit agencies.
We also utilize other development programs through the Eno Foundation and APTA
for an advanced learning path program: examples include the Eno Mid-Managers
course and Transit Executive Seminar; and Leadership APTA.
Maintain Proper Service Levels and Staffing
Maintaining existing service levels is paramount to our customers to retain and increase
ridership, especially with the opening of new lines in 2016/2017. Unfortunately, service
cuts have had to occur in the past. In 2009, a service reduction of 6% was needed and
again in 2012 an 8% service reduction was implemented. Fortunately, with steadily
increasing sales and use tax revenue since 2009, RTD has not had to make additional service
cuts. However, at some point in the future, revenues will not increase at the current rate.
RTD will remain focused on recruitment and retention to maintain staffing to deliver current
service levels and be prepared to deliver future service levels as additional projects begin
revenue service.
Ridership
Maintaining and increasing ridership is important to the agency. RTD will continue
efforts to make the RTD system attractive to riders. Patrons tend to make decisions
while considering the following factors: safety, cost, convenience, reliability and
predictability. RTD will continue efforts addressing these factors including the use
of technology to make improvements where practical and cost-effective. Examples
include the delivery of mobile ticketing and the future release of a Request for
Information to query the private sector on possible use of technology/services to gain
improvements in Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, and Mobility on Demand. It is important
to note that while considering technology/services such as Transportation Network
Companies (TNC’s), we must adhere to the U.S. DOT requirements. The U.S DOT
recently sent correspondence to all transit agencies reminding agencies of our
obligation to assure equity and access for services offered.
One of the ways to combat having to make service reductions is to have sufficient reserves
to be able to withstand fluctuations in the economy. As mentioned above, it is prudent
when economic conditions are favorable, as they are now, to make sure that reserves are
adequately funded so that service reductions are not required in the future to balance the
budget.
Equal Opportunity Employer
RTD is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate against any employee or

job applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sex or gender,
pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, genetic
information, or any other characteristic protected by law.
RTD reaches out during our recruitment process to various organizations throughout the
District to attract diverse applicants. Examples of those organizations include:








Workforce centers
Community Colleges and Universities
Churches
Community Centers
Chambers of Commerce such as the Hispanic and Indian Chambers
Veterans Affairs
Organizations supporting people with disabilities

In addition, RTD completes workforce analysis on an ongoing basis to further its strategic
goals and pursuant to Federal Transit Authority requirements. This continuous analysis and
monitoring allows RTD to address workforce gaps.

Strategic Goal #3
Asset Management/State of Good Repair
Background
In 2018 RTD will continue transitioning its major emphasis from designing and building new
facilities to operating and maintaining existing assets. At the same time, the Asset
Management and State of Good Repair (SGR) program is maturing to encompass all asset
types and to meet newly mandated regulatory requirements. Emphasizing life-cycle
management principles will assure safety, system performance and efficiency. Good asset
management and State of Good Repair is a strategic data-driven approach to management
that guides company investments, resources, and policy decisions to achieve goals.
The descriptions below provide the tactical approaches to accomplish this goal. Each of
these areas will be addressed in 2018.






Deferred maintenance
Maintain infrastructure
Take care of what we have before expanding
Don’t give up the base
Manage and expansion of facilities

Deferred Maintenance
The United States transit industry has an estimated $90 billion backlog of assets that may
not be in a suitable state of good repair. At times maintenance on a capital asset may be
deferred due to either budget constraints, competing financial priorities or availability of
human resources. RTD’s practice is to perform maintenance on assets according to
predetermined maintenance schedules that are entered, tracked and reported in RTD’s
maintenance management system. RTD’s contractors that are responsible for asset
maintenance use a similar approach. At all times, RTD’s goal is to maintain an asset in a
state of good repair, meaning that the asset condition assessment score is between 2.5 and
5. We have a good record of performing preventative maintenance on rolling stock,
infrastructure and facilities. We have also been successful in extending asset lifecycle,
particularly rolling stock, by having robust maintenance programs. Deferred maintenance
can represent investment needs including the cost to rehab or replace an asset whose
condition is below the state of good repair. This condition is referred to as “Backlog”. Items
in backlog are tracked as a proportion of total assets and have a monetary value assigned
equal to the investment required to renew the asset’s condition and ensure continued safe
and efficient use. Each year during the SBP process, projects are reviewed and prioritized
based on their current asset condition scores, criticality to RTD’s service, and safety. Areas
of focus in this area include the following:




Development of Capital Needs Inventory (CNI)
Prioritization of maintenance and renewal projects in SBP

Safety Management System Approach
The Federal Transit Administration integrated safety into the new asset management and
state of good repair regulations. This integration strategically links into the new set of
safety regulations currently being promulgated by the FTA. The new safety regulations
will require transit agencies to implement a Safety Management System (SMS) approach.
Safety Management System is a comprehensive, collaborative, organization-wide, datadriven approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk
mitigations. This system will build on RTD’s existing safety foundation to mitigate risk,
detect, and proactively correct safety problems. The agency will be able to share and
analyze safety data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully.
SMS is the formal, top-down business approach to managing safety risk including the
necessary organizational structures, accountabilities, policies and procedures. RTD has
adopted SMS and is working toward initial implementation.
Maintain Infrastructure
RTD’s systems rely on maintaining infrastructure for service delivery.
Maintaining
infrastructure supports safety, system performance and efficiency.
The lifecycle
management and maintenance of all assets involves a common set of elements. In order to
achieve and maintain a “State of Good Repair” evaluation of the lifecycle cost, physical
condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary. Asset Management is the
link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive
maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance including reporting
performance restrictions for Fixed Guideways.
Regarding the light rail system, the Central Corridor began revenue service in 1994. The
system requires day-to-day maintenance as well as scheduling periodic service disruptions
to perform major maintenance activities including: rail replacement, ballast tamping, switch
maintenance and replacement, traction power and signal maintenance.
The state of good repair data-driven practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize
the total cost of ownership, and manage risks. These elements are common to all asset
classes. Steps to achieving this goal include:






Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Evaluate all current maintenance strategies and plans
Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all system
infrastructure
Integrate safety management system approach

2.1.a

2.1.a

Increasingly, the U.S. DOT has emphasized the need for transit agencies to maintain existing
assets in a state of good repair. This new regulation (Asset Management and State of Good
Repair) also integrates state of good repair with safety management systems and new
regulations regarding safety. RTD assures that existing assets are appropriately maintained
through the SBP, APE and annual budgeting processes. This aligns with the Federal Transit
Administration’s emphasis on the need to maintain, rehabilitate, and replace existing transit
investments.
This starts with the Strategic Budget Planning (SBP) process and the District’s ability to
direct resources towards assets that are in need of reinvestment due to backlog or safety.
Assets that are no longer in a state of good repair, scoring below a 2.5 on the National
TERM scale, are considered to be in backlog. Assets that are scoring below the 2.5
threshold are flagged for a safety review as well. Assets in backlog will be tracked in the
Capital Needs Inventory (CNI). The CNI will be a supplemental input to the SBP and APE
processes. The CNI will ensure our existing assets receive the funding necessary to fulfill
our commitment to state of good repair. Areas of emphasis will be:





Create a Capital Needs Inventory
Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all SGR
qualified assets
Develop methodologies to optimize for capital investment and maintenance decisions
Annually budget for major life-cycle activities, renewals, and replacements of assets
over short and long term horizons

Don’t Give Up the Base
Similar to the previous objective, focus on maintaining base system services will be achieved
through the SBP and annual budget processes and targets related to the base system.



Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all SGR
qualified assets
Publish a Transit Asset Management State of Good Repair plan (TAMP).

Manage and Expansion of Facilities
RTD’s current facilities include:









Two light rail maintenance facilities
One commuter rail maintenance facility
Four bus maintenance facilities
Denver Union Station
Civic Center Station

Taking Care of What We Have Before Expanding

2.1.a

Light rail and commuter rail stations, and
Park-n-Rides.

Most RTD facilities are operating at capacity and expansion of any facility would be
challenging. The bus maintenance facilities are of particular concern given their age (ranging
approximately 27 – 40 years old) and the inability to expand capacity. RTD manages and
maintains these facilities through the SBP and annual budgeting process. RTD’s practice is
to perform maintenance on facilities according to predetermined maintenance schedules that
are entered, tracked and reported in RTD’s maintenance management system. A number of
facility-related projects are submitted each year in the SBP process to maintain facilities in
a state of good repair and assure that all facility equipment and systems are available. These
projects are prioritized during the SBP process to address the most critical needs as more
requests are received than RTD is able to fund in any given year.
RTD will need a new bus maintenance facility should the District expand operations beyond
the current number of buses and subfleets. A new facility should be planned as part of the
SBP process.
The approach to state of good repair for RTD facilities is similar to all assets, considering
evaluation of the lifecycle cost, physical condition assessment, and performance of each
class of assets is necessary. Asset Management is the link between life-cycle management
expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to
asset performance including mean cost per square foot and frequency and time out of
service. This data-driven practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total
cost of ownership, and manage risks. These elements are common to all asset classes but
differ in implementation. Steps to achieving this goal include:






Identify asset and business risks
Dashboard Key Performance Indicator’s (KPI’s)
Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of facilities
Evaluate all current expansion policies, plans, and maintenance strategies
Forecast operations and maintenance costs using historical comparisons.
