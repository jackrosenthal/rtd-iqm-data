## II. General Manager 2018 Tactical Plans

General Manager Genova stated that on March 4, 2017, Board Members along with the Senior Leadership Team (SLT) convened at a Retreat to discuss strategic goals and priorities for RTD which would drive the 2018 budget cycle.  The three goals that came out of the Retreat were:

- Fiscal Sustainability (Strategic Goal #1)

- Workforce and Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)

- State of Good Repair (Strategic Goal #3)

Fiscal Sustainability

General Manager Genova stated that throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source of revenue.  One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2018 relates to fiscal sustainability and the Board and staff identified the following specific focus areas:

- Consider Additional Revenue Streams

- Financial Planning

- Maximize Partnerships

- CBA/Pension

- Manage Third Party Expectations

- Increase Reserves

- Federal and State Funding

- Minimize Borrowing and Debt

- Use Innovative Approaches

- Rolling Stock

Consider Additional Revenue Streams/Funding Sources

General Manager Genova commented that RTD continues to consider additional revenue streams and examples include:

- Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State

- Implementation of the new fare structure and rates as of January 1, 2016

- Implementation of a naming rights program

- Expanded advertising to digital formats

- Pursuing a long-term solution to maintaining and operating the 16th Street Mall

- Endorsing and supporting efforts to collect sales tax revenues on internet sales

- Sale of assets and easements that do not interfere with existing or future RTD operations

- Sale of other assets not required for transit purposes

- Continued pursuit of federal and state competitive grants as opportunities arise

- Continued efforts to seek refinancing of debt to lower interest and principal payments

General Manager Genova noted that RTD will continue to investigate and pursue new funding sources and will also consider additional revenue streams through collaboration with stakeholders and the private sector.

Financial Planning

General Manager Genova explained that RTD’s Financial planning consists of evaluating current and future financial state by using known variables to predict future revenues and expenditures.  Each year RTD staff updates the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), a six-year plan for the Base System, and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE), a six-year plan for the FasTracks system.  In addition, the long range plan is prepared for both the Base System and FasTracks and the planning horizon is currently 2040.  In addition to being utilized for the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) and Regional Transportation Plan (RTP), the SBP and APE provide a snapshot each year for the RTD Board and Staff to plan for the future and understand the impacts of decisions that have been made and those that are made today, and the impact on future revenues and operations.  The SBP and APE become the basis for the annual budget each year.  He noted that, to remain fiscally sustainable, RTD must annually balance the SBP and the APE while meeting service needs, addressing state of good repair, and large infrastructure needs such as bus and rail facilities, while building financial reserves.

Maximize Partnerships

General Manager Genova noted that partnerships are very beneficial to RTD.  He commented that collaborating to achieve mutually beneficial financial and operational goals, while sometimes challenging, is essential.  He stated that RTD partners on a regular basis with the state, local municipalities, federal government, and the private sector.  One recent example is the refinancing of the Denver Union Station Project Authority’s (DUSPA) Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) and Railroad Rehabilitation & Improvement Financing (RRIF) loans.  RTD worked with the City and County of Denver to come to a mutually beneficial arrangement to refinance and pay off the loans that will save RTD $6 million per year for the next 23 years.  He stated that RTD continues to work with partners in the District to further projects with mutually beneficial financial arrangements.

CBA/Pension

General Manager Genova commented that in March of 2013, RTD and the Union executed a five-year agreement which is scheduled to expire in February of 2018.  He stated that in late 2017, RTD and the Union will commence negotiations for the next contract and the agreement will cover such things as:

- Wages

- Benefits

- Work rules

In early 2017, RTD staff initiated a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for negotiations.  The major areas of focus will be wages, benefits, and work rules.  He noted that there will be challenges in addressing competing priorities within the fiscal constraints of the RTD budget, and the current condition of employment in Colorado, specifically in the Denver metro area.

He highlighted that RTD employees participate in one of three different retirement plans: (1) Salaried Defined Benefit Plan, (2) Salaried Defined Contribution Plan, and (3) the Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Pension Trust (for Represented employees).

1.       Salaried Defined Benefit Plan

a.       Plan closed to new salaried participants as of January 1, 2008

b.       Current funded ratio is 78.3%

c.       Current RTD contribution is $4.6 million per year which is still short of actuarial recommendation of $7.6 million per year

d.       Expected to be 100% funded in 2043

2.       Salaried Defined Contribution Plan

a.       Applies to all new salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008

b.       Board adopts a contribution amount each year of between 7%-9%

c.       The contribution rate has been 9% since 2008

3.       Union Trust Pension Plan is for all Union employees

a.       Contributions are not sufficient to fund liabilities

b.       Fund is currently projected to be fully depleted by 2035

c.       Current funded ratio is 48.5%

d.       Contributions for 2017 are 13% from RTD and 5% from the employee

e.       In 2010, changes were made for employees hired after January 1, 2011

i.  Changed vesting from 5 to 10 years

ii. Benefit multiplier decreased from 2.5% to 1.0%

iii.          Unreduced retirement changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service

iv.           Early retirement reduction changed from 5% from age 55 to 2.5% from age 60

v. Sick and vacation is no longer included in pension benefit calculation

vi.           Interest on employee contributions changed from 5% to 3%

He added that staff will continue to monitor the financial status and will report to the Board on all the plans.

Manage Third Party Expectations

General Manager Genova remarked that RTD is increasingly receiving unsolicited requests from stakeholders and constituents that are very difficult, if not impossible to honor or fulfill from a financial and operational perspective.  Many requests fall outside of RTD’s approved financial plan and existing RTD policies.  He stated that the requests put RTD in a very difficult and awkward situation on many occasions and while RTD wants to be a good and responsive partner, the agency must focus on its purpose and fiscal sustainability.

He added that RTD will continue to work with and collaborate with stakeholders and be responsive by explaining RTD policy and financial condition.  He noted for example, that RTD was recently compared to King County in the Seattle area and their low income fare program.  He explained that as a county, King County, and other counties are responsible for social service programs.  As RTD is not a county, it should not assume the responsibilities of others for social service programs within the District.

He stated that RTD staff will continue to make the Board aware when these types of informal or formal requests occur so that the Board is as informed as possible in case the Board is approached by local governments, community members or other stakeholders.

He noted that many of the requests RTD has received have been for special passes or pilot programs for particular groups of constituents within the District.  He highlighted that RTD has convened a Pass Program Working Group with District-wide stakeholders and their mission is to make recommendations on possible revisions to RTD’s pass programs.  He stated that the Pass Program working group will be completed in 2018, and hopefully they will provide recommendations that can be implemented to the pass programs.

Increase Reserves

General Manager Genova commented that the Board had adopted 2016 Fiscal Policies which included a Fund Balance Policy that states the following:

RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and FasTracks to provide for unanticipated expenditures of a nonrecurring nature, to meet unexpected increases in costs or to mitigate service disruptions as a result of economic downturns affecting revenue.  The Base System, should strive to maintain a total balance at an amount approximately equal to three (3) months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation among the following three reserve funds:  the Board-appropriated fund, the unrestricted operating reserve, and the remaining unrestricted fund balance.  For FasTracks, the total of the Board-appropriated fund and unrestricted fund balance should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to three (3) months of FasTracks operating expenses excluding depreciation.  RTD will consider and pursue resources that will be directed to fund balance replenishment.  For example, non-recurring revenues and budget surpluses are an especially appropriate source for replenishing fund balance.

He added that in 2017 RTD established an operating reserve as outlined in the 2017 tactical plan.  He noted that the reserve will allow for more flexibility in dealing with revenue changes as they could be adjusted through the reserve rather than cutting back previously approved projects or service levels.

He remarked that building reserves will allow for more flexibility in dealing with future revenue shortfalls which is important because of the inherent economic volatility of the District’s largest revenue source, sales tax.  Growth of these reserves requires discipline to set aside funds in the short term rather than spending the funds on service in the short term.  This short-term constraint on spending is a strategic effort to improve the long term fiscal sustainability of RTD.

Federal and State Funding

General Manager Genova stated that Federal transportation funding is integral to RTD’s operations and capital programs.  He explained that RTD receives approximately $71 million per year for operations from the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) and has received full funding grant agreement dollars as well as Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Act (CMAQ) and Surface Transportation Program (STP-Metro) dollars for various projects.  RTD is monitoring the new federal administration’s budget summary regarding New Starts, Small Starts and Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant funds.  Although this may not have an immediate impact on RTD, the possible elimination or reorganizing of these programs could preclude RTD from getting funds from a program the agency has greatly benefitted from in the past.  RTD staff will be diligent in advocating for protection of these important funding sources and will continue to review future proposals that may impact transportation funding.

General Manager Genova commented that currently, the Colorado legislature is considering several referred measures, the most prominent being HB17-1242.  This bill would increase the state sales tax to provide additional funds for transportation with a portion going to the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) to support the issuance of bonds, the cities and counties, and a portion to the transportation options account.  This bill would also reduce the road safety surcharges imposed on motor vehicles during the period that the new sales and use tax is in effect.  Since RTD receives Funding Advancements for Surface Transportation and Economic Recovery (FASTER) funds from CDOT on a regular basis, this mostly will have an impact of the amount of funds RTD may receive.  He stated that if this bill passes the legislature, it would need to go to the ballot in November 2017.  Should any state funding measure pass, he stated that RTD will work with all regional stakeholders to address any possible benefits to RTD.

Minimize Borrowing and Debt

General Manager Genova explained that RTD issues debt for large capital projects and rolling stock and RTD’s outstanding debt as of December 31, 2016 was $3,978,918,095.

- Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (Base System) - $120,525,000

- Sales Tax Revenue Bonds (FasTracks) - $1,917,941,384

- Eagle P3 TABOR Portion of Service Payments - $589,913,540

- DUSPA - $151,263,171(refinanced in February 2017)

- Lease Purchase Agreements/COPs - $1,199,275,000

General Manager Genova said that when deciding to issue debt, several things are taken into consideration: (1) the amount of outstanding debt, (2) the debt service coverage ratio, (3) the ability to repay the debt, (4) the desire to issue debt, and (5) the ability to cash fund.  Additionally, RTD seeks to build reserves to possibly issue future debt for FasTracks completion as soon as feasible.

He noted that RTD has examined all of these factors and has chosen to use cash for the near term rather than issue additional debt.  At this time, RTD is not scheduled to issue debt until 2023 for rolling stock and RTD will continue to review the use of debt during the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), Annual Program Evaluation (APE), and financial plan process.

Use Innovative Approaches

General Manager Genova remarked that RTD has been known nationally for its use of innovative approaches such as the Eagle P3 project, Denver Union Station, and the use of Certificates of Participation (COPs) on the North Metro Project.  In order to complete the remaining FasTracks projects RTD will have to continue to look for new and creative ways to finance, fund, build, and operate these corridors.  He noted that new approaches could include identification of new funding sources and savings in construction or ongoing operating costs.  He added that RTD will also seek partnerships and continue to work collaboratively with stakeholders and private sector.

Rolling Stock

General Manager Genova stated that RTD has traditionally managed rolling stock well, often exceeding FTA recommended useful life through robust maintenance and state of good repair programs.  He noted that Rolling stock maintenance is addressed in the annual RTD operating budget and Rolling stock replacement is addressed through the 6-year SBP.  He said that these processes will be continued to maintain RTD rolling stock in a state of good repair and to plan for proper replacement.

Workforce and Human Capital

General Manager Genova acknowledged that one of RTD’s greatest resources is its employees.  He noted that RTD has 2,893 employees: 874 are salaried employees and 2,019 are represented employees and fall under RTD’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).  He said that as a part of this goal, the Board and staff identified specific focus areas addressed below:

- Collective Bargaining Agreement

- Pension

- Recruitment and Retention

o        Family-friendly Opportunities

o        Wages

o        Retirements

o        Part-time Opportunities

o        Scheduling

- Maintain Proper Service Levels and Staffing

- Equal Opportunity Employer

Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)

General Manager Genova informed the Board that in March of 2013, RTD and the Union executed a five-year agreement and that agreement is scheduled to expire in February of 2018.  He stated that in late 2017, RTD and the Union will commence negotiations for the next contract and the agreement will cover such things as:

- Wages

- Benefits

- Work rules

In early 2017, RTD staff initiated a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for negotiations.  The major areas of focus will be wages, benefits, and work rules.  He noted that there will be challenges in addressing competing priorities within the fiscal constraints of the RTD budget, and the current condition of employment in Colorado, specifically in the Denver metro area.

Pension

General Manager Genova highlighted that RTD employees participate in one of three different retirement plans: (1) Salaried Defined Benefit Plan, (2) Salaried Defined Contribution Plan, and (3) the Regional Transportation District and Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Pension Trust (for Represented employees).

1.       Salaried Defined Benefit Plan

a.       Plan closed to new salaried participants as of January 1, 2008

b.       Current funded ratio is 78.3%

c.       Current RTD contribution is $4.6 million per year which is still short of actuarial recommendation of $7.6 million per year

d.       Expected to be 100% funded in 2043

2.       Salaried Defined Contribution Plan

a.       Applies to all new salaried employees hired on or after January 1, 2008

b.       Board adopts a contribution amount each year of between 7%-9%

c.       The contribution rate has been 9% since 2008

3.       Union Trust Pension Plan is for all Union employees

a.       Contributions are not sufficient to fund liabilities

b.       Fund is currently projected to be fully depleted by 2035

c.       Current funded ratio is 48.5%

d.       Contributions for 2017 are 13% from RTD and 5% from the employee

e.       In 2010, changes were made for employees hired after January 1, 2011

ii. Benefit multiplier decreased from 2.5% to 1.0%

iii.          Unreduced retirement changed from age 55 with 20 years of service to age 60 with 20 years of service

iv.           Early retirement reduction changed from 5% from age 55 to 2.5% from age 60

v. Sick and vacation is no longer included in pension benefit calculation

vi.           Interest on employee contributions changed from 5% to 3%

Recruitment and Retention

General Manager Genova noted that as the economy has improved and unemployment has dropped to 2.4% in the 10-county Denver Metro area and 2.6% for the State (Denver Business Journal, April 2017), recruiting and retention have become much more challenging, particularly in the areas of bus operators, light rail operators, and mechanics.  He explained that hiring qualified applicants is not just a Human Resource function, so recognizing that, RTD established a Recruitment and Retention Working Group.  He stated that this group is tasked with improving RTD’s recruitment process and increasing retention.  He said that members of the working group include:  AGM of Rail, AGM of Bus, AGM of Communications, AGM of Finance and Administration, HR, Marketing, State of Good Repair, and Bus Operations.  He noted that the following improvements have been made:

- “RTD is Hiring” messages on all buses and RTD vehicles.

- Advertising on billboards

- RTD Hiring Bus

- Holding “One-Stop Job Shops”

- Hiring Bonus of $2,000

- Referral Bonus of $1,000

- Increase in shift differential and split shift pay

General Manager Genova commented that in 2016 RTD hired 344 bus operators, 29 mechanics, and 92 light rail operators, for a total of 465 hires.  In 2016, there were 192 more hires for these same occupational groups or a 70% increase over 2015.  However, in 2016 we also had 267 bus operators leave, or net +77, 17 mechanics leave, or net +12, and 64 light rail operators leave, or net +28.  While RTD had improvements in recruiting, it remains very challenging to sustain significant gains in a 2.4% unemployment environment.

He noted that continued and new efforts include:

- Targeting specific sectors of the community that might produce more applicants for bus operators, light rail operators, and mechanics

- Additional research on what attracts people to RTD so staff can appeal to that dynamic

- Reviewing wages and benefits to assure that RTD is market competitive in a very low unemployment environment

- Reviewing scheduling methods to determine economic impacts of fewer split shifts and shorter split shift time spreads

- Reviewing shift schedules to determine economic impacts and practicality of other work schedules, for example 4, 10 hour shifts instead of 5, 8 hour shifts

- Recruiting part-time operators, especially retired operators and evaluating possible methods to utilize part-time positions to possibly reduce the number of split shifts

- Continuing to monitor workforce regarding retirements, and

- Continuing with RTD’s professional development and training programs as described below:

Professional Development and Training

General Manager Genova explained that RTD has a very robust professional development and training program, and each employee is offered $2,000 per year towards education and training.  He added that RTD offers “free of charge” classes such as Word, Excel, Power Point, and other courses to provide job enrichment and professional development for employees to learn and develop new skills to be able to compete for promotional opportunity.  In addition, he stated that RTD also has the Leadership Academy and the Multi-Agency Exchange (MAX) program.

General Manager Genova stated that the Leadership Academy is designed to support RTD’s emerging leaders by focusing on the relationship of mission, values, culture, and strategic priorities.  Members of this one-year educational program engage in comprehensive coursework that provides them with the tools and resources to successfully guide RTD in the coming years.  Employees selected for the program benefit from professional training and mentoring by offering a dynamic environment for the development of leadership mastery, organizational stewardship, business fundamentals, and technical competencies that promotes the advancement of RTD employees within the program.  Since its inception, over 120 employees have completed the program with more graduates expected by the end of 2017.

He noted that the MAX program is designed to create future Transit Leaders and to provide the public with continuity through the evolution of the industry and the needs of our patrons.  MAX is designed to leverage best practices of the industry in order to minimize the learning curve and reduce the cost and time to implement new programs.  MAX participants are from RTD, Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), and Los Angeles Metro (Metro).  The primary goal of the MAX program is to expose and develop our future leaders by working with other transit agencies, and current RTD participants in the program have graduated from the Leadership Academy.

He added that RTD also utilizes other development programs through the Eno Transportation Foundation and the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) for an advanced learning path program.  Examples include the Eno Mid-Managers course and Transit Executive Seminar, and Leadership APTA.

Maintain Proper Service Levels and Staffing

General Manager Genova explained that maintaining existing service levels is paramount to RTD’s customers in order to retain and increase ridership, especially with the opening of new lines in 2016 and 2017.  Unfortunately, service cuts have had to occur in the past: in 2009, a service reduction of 6% was needed and in 2012, an 8% service reduction was implemented.  He noted that fortunately, with steadily increasing sales and use tax revenue since 2009, RTD has not had to make additional service cuts.  He stated that RTD will remain focused on recruitment and retention to maintain staffing in order to deliver current service levels and will be prepared to deliver future service levels as additional projects begin revenue service.

Ridership

General Manager Genova stated that maintaining and increasing ridership is important to the agency.  RTD will continue efforts to make the RTD system attractive to riders and noted that patrons tend to make decisions while considering the following factors: safety, cost, convenience, reliability and predictability.  RTD will continue efforts addressing these factors including the use of technology to make improvements where practical and cost-effective.  Examples include the delivery of mobile ticketing and the future release of a Request for Information to query the private sector on possible use of technology/services to gain improvements in Call-n-Ride, Access-a-Ride, and Mobility on Demand.  He said it is important to note that while considering technology/services such as Transportation Network Companies (TNC’s), we must adhere to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements.  The U.S DOT recently sent correspondence to all transit agencies reminding them of their obligation to assure equity and access for services offered.

General Manager Genova said one of the ways to combat having to make service reductions is to have sufficient reserves to be able to withstand fluctuations in the economy.  As mentioned above, it is prudent when economic conditions are favorable, as they are now, to make sure that reserves are adequately funded so that service reductions are not required in the future to balance the budget.

Equal Opportunity Employer

General Manager Genova explained that RTD is an Equal Opportunity Employer and does not discriminate against any employee or job applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sex or gender, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.

He added that RTD reaches out during the recruitment process to various organizations throughout the District to attract diverse applicants.  Examples of those organizations include:

- Workforce centers

- Community colleges and universities

- Churches

- Community centers

- Chambers of commerce such as the Hispanic and Indian Chambers

- Veterans Affairs

- Organizations supporting people with disabilities

In addition, he noted that RTD completes workforce analysis on an ongoing basis to further its strategic goals and pursuant to Federal Transit Authority requirements.  He stated that this continuous analysis and monitoring allows RTD to address workforce gaps.

State of Good Repair/Asset Management

General Manager Genova commented that in 2018 RTD will continue transitioning its major emphasis from designing and building new facilities to operating and maintaining existing assets.  At the same time, the Asset Management and State of Good Repair (SGR) program is maturing to encompass all asset types and to meet newly mandated regulatory requirements.  He said that emphasizing life-cycle management principles will assure safety, system performance, and efficiency. He noted that good asset management and SGR is a strategic data-driven approach to management that guides company investments, resources, and policy decisions to achieve goals.

He added that the descriptions below provide the tactical approaches to accomplish this goal.  Each of these areas will be addressed in 2018:

- Deferred maintenance

- Maintain infrastructure

- Take care of what we have before expanding

- Don’t give up the base

- Manage and expansion of facilities

Deferred Maintenance

General Manager Genova remarked that the United States transit industry has an estimated $90 billion backlog of assets that may not be in a suitable state of good repair.  At times, maintenance on a capital asset may be deferred due to either budget constraints, competing financial priorities or availability of human resources.  He stated that RTD’s practice is to perform maintenance on assets according to predetermined maintenance schedules that are entered, tracked and reported in RTD’s maintenance management system and RTD’s contractors that are responsible for asset maintenance use a similar approach.  At all times, RTD’s goal is to maintain an asset in a state of good repair, meaning that the asset condition assessment score is between 2.5 and 5.  RTD has a good record of performing preventative maintenance on rolling stock, infrastructure and facilities and has been successful in extending asset lifecycle, particularly rolling stock, by having robust maintenance programs.  He added that deferred maintenance can represent investment needs, including the cost to rehab or replace an asset whose condition is below the state of good repair.  This condition, referred to as “Backlog”, are tracked as a proportion of total assets and have a monetary value assigned equal to the investment required to renew the asset’s condition and ensure continued safe and efficient use.  Each year during the SBP process, projects are reviewed and prioritized based on their current asset condition scores, criticality to RTD’s service, and safety.  Areas of focus in this area include the following:

- Development of Capital Needs Inventory (CNI)

- Prioritization of maintenance and renewal projects in SBP

- Dashboard backlog reports

- Creating automated system notifications of assets in backlog

- Accountability and transparency

o        Reviewing maintenance and investment processes and procedures

o        Regulatory compliance

- Integrated safety management system approach

Safety Management System Approach

General Manager Genova mentioned that the FTA integrated safety into the new asset management and state of good repair regulations.  He said this integration strategically links into the new set of safety regulations currently being promulgated by the FTA.  The new safety regulations will require transit agencies to implement a Safety Management System (SMS) approach.  SMS is a comprehensive, collaborative, organization-wide, data-driven approach to managing safety risk and assuring the effectiveness of safety risk mitigations. This system will build on RTD’s existing safety foundation to mitigate risk, detect, and proactively correct safety problems. He added that the agency will be able to share and analyze safety data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully. SMS is the formal, top-down business approach to managing safety risk including the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities, policies and procedures. He noted that RTD has adopted SMS and is working toward the initial implementation.

Maintain Infrastructure

General Manager Genova remarked that RTD’s systems rely on maintaining infrastructure for service delivery.  Maintaining infrastructure supports safety, system performance, and efficiency.  He said that the lifecycle management and maintenance of all assets involves a common set of elements and in order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good Repair” evaluation of the lifecycle cost, physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary.  Asset Management is the link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance including reporting performance restrictions for Fixed Guideways.

He commented that the Central Light Rail Corridor began revenue service in 1994.  The system requires day-to-day maintenance as well as scheduling periodic service disruptions to perform major maintenance activities including: rail replacement, ballast tamping, switch maintenance and replacement, traction power and signal maintenance.

The state of good repair data-driven practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and manage risks.  These elements are common to all asset classes and steps to achieving this goal include:

- Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes

- Identify asset and business risks

- Evaluate all current maintenance strategies and plans

- Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all system infrastructure

- Integrate safety management system approach

Taking Care of What We Have Before Expanding

General Manager Genova added that increasingly, the U.S. DOT has emphasized the need for transit agencies to maintain existing assets in a state of good repair.  This new regulation (Asset Management and State of Good Repair) also integrates state of good repair with safety management systems and new regulations regarding safety.  He remarked that RTD assures that existing assets are appropriately maintained through the SBP, APE and annual budgeting processes and this aligns with the FTA’s emphasis on the need to maintain, rehabilitate, and replace existing transit investments.

He stated that this starts with the Strategic Budget Planning (SBP) process and the District’s ability to direct resources towards assets that are in need of reinvestment due to backlog or safety.  Assets that are no longer in a state of good repair, scoring below a 2.5 on the National Transit Economic Requirements Model (TERM) scale, are considered to be in backlog and are flagged for a safety review as well.  Assets in backlog will be tracked in the Capital Needs Inventory (CNI) that will be a supplemental input to the SBP and APE processes.  The CNI will ensure RTD’s existing assets receive the funding necessary to fulfill the commitment to state of good repair and areas of emphasis will be:

- Creating a Capital Needs Inventory

- Measuring and analyzing age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all SGR qualified assets

- Developing methodologies to optimize for capital investment and maintenance decisions

- Annually budgeting for major life-cycle activities, renewals, and replacements of assets over short and long term horizons

Don’t Give Up the Base

He noted that, similar to the previous objective, focus on maintaining the base system services will be achieved through the SBP and annual budget processes and targets related to the base system.

- Measure and analyze age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of all SGR qualified assets

- Publish a Transit Asset Management State of Good Repair plan (TAMP).

Manage and Expansion of Facilities

RTD’s current facilities include:

- Two light rail maintenance facilities

- One commuter rail maintenance facility

- Four bus maintenance facilities

- Denver Union Station

- Civic Center Station

- Downtown Boulder Transit Center

- Boulder Junction at Depot Square

- A number of support and administrative facilities

- Light rail and commuter rail stations, and

- Park-n-Rides.

General Manager Genova commented that most RTD facilities are operating at capacity and expansion of any facility would be challenging and that the bus maintenance facilities are of particular concern given their age (ranging approximately 27 – 40 years old) and the inability to expand capacity.  RTD manages and maintains these facilities through the SBP and annual budgeting process and RTD’s practice is to perform maintenance on facilities according to predetermined maintenance schedules that are entered, tracked, and reported in RTD’s maintenance management system.  A number of facility-related projects are submitted each year in the SBP process to maintain facilities in a state of good repair and assure that all facility equipment and systems are available.  These projects are prioritized during the SBP process to address the most critical needs as more requests are received than RTD is able to fund in any given year.

He noted that RTD will need a new bus maintenance facility should the District expand operations beyond the current number of buses and sub-fleets and a new facility should be planned as part of the SBP process.

General Manager Genova added that the approach to SGR for RTD facilities is similar to all assets, considering evaluation of the lifecycle cost, physical condition assessment, and performance of each class of assets is necessary.  Asset Management is the link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance including mean cost per square foot and frequency and time out of service.  This data-driven practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and manage risks.  These elements are common to all asset classes but differ in implementation and steps to achieving this goal include:

- Identifying asset and business risks

- Dashboard Key Performance Indicator’s (KPI’s)

- Measuring and analyzing age, utilization, cost, condition and performance of facilities

- Evaluating all current expansion policies, plans, and maintenance strategies

- Forecasting operations and maintenance costs using historical comparisons.

Chair Hoy thanked the General Manager for his presentation and stated he would take questions from the Board.  He reminded the Board that their questions should be focused to 2018 as this presentation covered items for implementation next year.

Director Broom asked what the Pension Trust plan provides once the pension trust runs out of money.

General Manager Genova stated that he did not know if that scenario was designated or discussed in the current trust.  He asked Bruce Abel to provide additional commentary.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, stated that nothing in the documentation addresses that particular circumstance.  He remarked that there are a variety of alternatives currently under discussion as to what strategies are available to address certain circumstances.

Director Broom commented that he grew up in central Illinois and many companies recruited from the agricultural areas.  He noted that agricultural workers made great employees because they are familiar with using large equipment and he suggested looking in that area for new hires.

Director Lubow asked, in relation to the Pension Trust plan, who decided that RTD could only add funds and inquired if that was a statutory requirement.  She added that RTD has very little power and she did not know why.

General Manager Genova explained that the Union Pension Trust manages the program.  The contribution made by the employee and the employer is negotiated as part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  He said that there might be some statutory requirements in how trusts are managed but that is how RTD’s is set up.

Director Lubow remarked that it might be worthwhile to rethink how RTD interacts with the pension trust.

Rolf Asphaug, General Counsel, stated that this is an issue for the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  He added that with additional supervision or control comes additional liability and most companies, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements, try to have as little as possible other than the contributions.

Director Lubow asked about the temporary wage adjustment and how that would work.

General Manager Genova said that he asked Finance team to look at the financial impact of raising the operator wage by $1.00 an hour.  He said that, if a wage adjustment was implemented, it would be in place until a new collective bargaining agreement took effect and it would not be binding or negotiated.

Director Lubow inquired about the request for information and asked if that is something that RTD is already in the process of working on.

General Manager Genova said yes and stated that he had assigned that task to Mr. Abel.  He said that RTD has had many conversations with a variety of companies, and in RTD’s competitive procurement environment, staff needs to be able to go through a process that works efficiently.

Director Archuleta said there are almost 120,000 people in the metro area who do not speak English very well.  He said that they listen to Spanish radio, or watch Spanish TV and recommended advertising jobs through those mediums.

Director Menten asked if staff had researched the returns from digital advertising formats.

General Manager Genova stated that RTD has a need to be able to communicate information to its patrons in a more efficient way, particularly around Union Station.  He said that ideally, an advertising firm would partner with a technology corporation and there would be no cost to RTD.

Director Menten added that in the presentation where it said “increase revenues or explore options” she does not support a tax increase.  She also thanked the General Manager and staff for minimizing borrowing and debt.

Director Tisdale commented that he is concerned with the sale of assets and easements and said as a property owner RTD could lease assets rather than selling them.  He asked if staff had considered leasing opposed to outright selling as that would create a continuous revenue stream.

General Manager Genova noted that staff would add his comments to the appropriate section.

Director Tisdale also questioned the Board’s use of cash for the near term rather than issuing additional debt and asked if the “near term” was defined and adopted as a policy by the Board.

Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, said by default, yes.  She explained that Board policy is 1.2 times the debt service coverage, and by adopting that amount, RTD will not reach the 1.2 times coverage until 2023.  She said that when Director Tisdale asked if it was by Board policy, it is a combination of RTD’s current financial position and the direction by the Board to limit as much debt as possible in the near term.  She added that currently RTD is not planning to issue any debt until 2040 and that debt issuance will be revisited during the APE, SPB, and the long range plan.

Director Tisdale added that he had spoken with representatives at Arapahoe Community College and they are interested in setting up an apprenticeship program for RTD, similar to the program at the Community College of Denver.  He added that other community colleges in the metro area would be tremendous resources for RTD as well.

Mr. Abel remarked that RTD is working with Front Range Community College in Fort Collins and their automotive Associates of Arts (AA) program.  He said that in the summer of 2016, RTD had 10 students that participated in the Diesel Technology Training Program (D-Tech) and at the end of the program 8 students applied for and secured jobs at RTD.  He noted that the programs second year will begin this summer.

General Manager Genova noted that he wanted to specifically thank Ms. McKillop, Mike Meader, Chief Safety Officer and Assistant General Manager of Safety, Security & Asset Management, Lou Cripps, Senior Manager of Asset Management, and the SLT team for reviewing and compiling ideas for tonight’s presentation.

Director Williams stated that the Denver Metro Chamber has a new Youth Initiative program and they will be providing student interns to RTD.

Director Francone inquired if RTD had considered some type of food vendor or food sales at light rail stations.  She noted that in Paris, New York, or London, someone could get off the train on their way home and buy milk and bread.

General Manager Genova stated that concessions do come up from time to time, and RTD has had minor concession activity but they never panned out.  He said that the Romancing the Bean coffee shop at the Littleton Downtown Station has survived because of everything else around them and, while RTD has had interest in the past, concessions have not panned out financially.

Director Francone noted that the food trucks outside of Union Station seem to do well.

General Manager Genova said food trucks would be a good option because they are mobile but he would have to check with Real Property to see what requests have been submitted.

Director Francone asked if there was a difference between unsolicited requests and unsolicited proposals.

General Manager Genova indicated that there is a formal process for unsolicited proposals for Procurement and Real Estate, but there is not a policy for unsolicited requests.

Director Francone asked if staff had spoken to Dave Britton at Uber lately as he was eager to speak to staff.

General Manager Genova commented that he had not spoken to Mr. Britton in a while.

Director Francone stated that she had been in touch with Roger Vesely, Manager of Staffing and Recruiting, about recruiting efforts with veterans.  She added that her experience in Colorado has been that there are a number of people whose first language is English, however, they prefer to receive their communications in Spanish.  She noted that there is a large Hispanic population in Denver and there is an opportunity for RTD to partner with Univision or Entravision.  She further added that the Hispanic Contractors Association has been a very generous partner with RTD and that is another avenue that deserves exploration.  She noted that she has been working with the Arapahoe Community College and the Emily Griffith Technical College but said very little has come from those efforts.

Chair Hoy asked those participating via phone if they had any questions.

Director Anderson said that she likes the idea of advertising and is excited.  She agreed with Director Broom about the agricultural population, however, it is difficult now with the 2.4% unemployment.  She said it is going to be difficult and RTD is going to have to pay competitive wages to attract people to drive busses.  She noted that Arvada High School is a community in transition and they have a program to teach people to become mechanics.  She added that she would speak with staff offline because Arvada High School is doing good things to train people at the age of 18 to go out and make a living.  She commented that RTD can discuss debt but needs to be cautious with it.  She further added that she is not opposed to going out to the taxpayers for a tax increase in order to meet current service demands.

Director Sisk stated that HB1242 will not come out of the legislature.  He said that he appreciated the efforts of staff and agreed with the comments made tonight.  He said that the labor force issue is important and RTD will have to find innovative ways to attract new employees.

Director Deadwyler asked why the Union pension plan contributions are disproportionate.  She noted that most companies match contributions but RTD is far exceeding the match amount.

General Manager Genova stated that RTD contributes 13% and the employee contributes 5%.  He added that matching programs, such as a 401(k) or other similar programs, are outside of the traditional pension programs.

Director Deadwyler commented that during the last collective bargaining negotiation, the union did not get a raise but they got a bonus instead.  She noted that bonuses are taxed at a higher rate and almost half of that bonus went to the federal government for taxes.

Mr. Abel stated that the $1,250 was equivalent of giving a 3% raise and it was grossed up so that each employee netted $1,250.

Director Menten remarked that RTD owns property that it does not need, and those properties should be sold.  She said that RTD is not meant to be a landlord and it is not supposed to land bank to compete with the private sector.  She added that, in regards to the pension percentages, it was written that way because staff wrote the proposal and had it approved by the Board.  She noted that there is a vast difference between salaried and represented employees.

Director Lubow noted that there is a large Afghan refugee community in the metro area and RTD should advertise jobs to that group as well.

Director Broom stated that higher pension contributions would mean less tax that the employee would have to pay.

Chair Hoy commented that, in his experience, an experienced employee is a lot cheaper to retain than to replace.  He said it is cheaper to train and also cheaper in respect to safety.  He stated that RTD’s emphasis needs to be focused on retention instead of recruitment and added that the 2.4% unemployment rate is considered full employment as people are usually transferring from one job to another.  He noted that the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is working to get people employed and they may have grants that RTD could get.  He added that he appreciated everyone’s involvement, thoughts, and their time.

## III. Other Matters

General Manager Genova stated that RTD is in the middle of a triannual review.  He remarked that FTA’s contractors are here this week and staff will have an exit briefing with them on Thursday.

Director Francone noted that last week she attended the Jefferson County Health and Human Services workshop on Aging Well.  She commented that there was no mention of public transportation and work needs to be done to remind them of the services RTD offers.  She added that she visited the workforce development center for Jefferson County and there was no information about RTD and they would be a good recruitment source as well.

Director Solano said he received a call from an Adams County Commissioner about the North Broadway and US36 Park-n-Ride and inquired if that parking facility would be eliminated.

Mr. Abel remarked that staff is currently working on the service plan for that area but is not aware of how that facility may be impacted at this time.

Director Menten asked what dollar figure and acreage is needed for a new bus facility.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would need at least $50 million but probably closer to $75 million.  She noted that the actual dollar amount and acreage depend on several things, and since RTD has great needs, the structure would most likely have to be financed.

## IV. Adjourn

Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 7:30 p.m.
