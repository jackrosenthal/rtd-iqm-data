Date: February 5, 2014

From:

David Genova, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Contract Award for the District Shops HRU
Project.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible
bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of $2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit
(HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the
project budget in the amount of $322,103.
BACKGROUND
The scope of the District Shops HRU project is to replace 16 HRU’s that are beyond their useful life with
new units. The existing units were installed when the building was constructed in 1989. The 100%
outside air HRU’s provide gas heating, evaporative cooling, and energy recovery. The units exhaust
100% of the air supplied. The energy recovery section tempers incoming air to cool it in the summer and
warms it in the winter using energy absorbed from the exhaust air process.
DISCUSSION
The project was advertised on September 30, 2013. The pre-bid conference was held on October 15,
2013 and the bids were received on October 29, 2013 as follows:
1. JCOR - $2,669,400
2. Legacy - $2,733,500
DBE INVOLVEMENT
The DBE goal was advertised at 7% with JCOR meeting the goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the project is included in the 2014 approved budget. With the transfer the construction
budget will be $2,669,400: $1,877,837.20 from federal grant CO-04-0043 with $469,459.80 of local
match and $257,682.40 from the State of Good Repair (SOGR) grant with $64,420.60 of local match.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager,or his designee, to award a
contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. In addition, a transfer shall be
made from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of $322,103.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee
to award a contract to the low, responsive, responsible bidder, JCOR, in the not-to-exceed amount of
$2,669,400 for the District Shops Heat Recovery Unit (HRU) project. Also, do not authorize a

Packet Pg. 3

1.B.1

transfer from the State of Good Repair federal grant to the project budget in the amount of
$322,103. Project shall be rebid. This is not recommended as the bids are considered competitive,
and delay may result in the loss of grant funds.
3. Do nothing. Cancel project and redirect funds. This is not recommended as the project has been fully
designed and the existing units are beyond their useful life and need replacement. Additionally, any
delay may result in the loss of grant funds.

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Transfer of Funds from Light Rail Capital to
Light Rail Expense

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to approve the transfer of $703,000 in approved 2014
capital to an expense line to facilitate the development of revised Light Rail Vehicle specifications.
BACKGROUND
The RTD Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at the November 2013 meeting. One of the
capital projects approved at that meeting was funding to purchase Track Maintenance Equipment for the
Maintenance of Way Division of Rail Operations.
Since that time we have determined that in order to move forward with the purchase of new Light Rail
Vehicles scheduled for 2015 we need to develop a revised specification.
DISCUSSION
In order to develop a revised specification we need to get outside assistance from LTK, doing business
FRSC, as we have in the past. This will require a transfer of funds from capital to expense to fund the
work order on a contract that already exists.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will not create a financial impact to the district since it is a transfer from capital to
expense. It will have a zero effect on the current approved budget.
DBE PARTICIPATION
The DBE requirements were satisfied when the current agreement with LTK (FRSC) was approved.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee, to approve this transfer in order to
develop a revised specification for Light Rail Vehicles to be ordered in 2015.
2. Do not authorize the transfer which will cause a delay in the purchase of Light Rail Vehicles
which have been scheduled for 2015.

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Access-a-Ride Budget Transfer

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize a budget transfer in the amount of $5,271,915 to re-allocate previously approved Access-aRide 2014 funding from budget accounts associated with the expired Access-a-Ride service provider
contracts to budget accounts associated with the new Access-a-Ride service provider contracts.
BACKGROUND
The 2014 Access-a-Ride budget was prepared in mid-2013 and was based on the Access-a-Ride service
provider model that was in effect at that time. This model included four (4) dedicated-vehicle service
providers. In late-2013, the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts were re-bid and in November of
2013, the Board of Directors approved the award of the Access-a-Ride service provider contract to three
(3) dedicated-vehicle and one (1) non-dedicated-vehicle service providers. As a result, the 2014
approved budget funds for Access-a-Ride need to be re-allocated to the service providers chosen to
provide service in the new Access-a-Ride contract. The Board of Directors approved the 2014 budget at
the November 2013 meeting.
DISCUSSION
The total budget dollars being transferred, or re-allocated, is $5,271,915. This budget transfer will result
in some budget line items being reduced and others being increased, and the net effect on the 2014
budget is zero.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This transfer will have no impact on the approved 2014 budget because it is simply a re-allocation of
previously approved funds.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the budget transfer as recommended in order to proceed with the contract awards.
2. Do not approve the budget transfer. This course of action is not recommended as it will cause a
delay in the processing of the Access-a-Ride service provider contracts for 2014.

Subject:

Access-a-Cab Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the Board of Directors
authorizes the General Manager, or his designee, to execute all documents necessary to extend
Agreements with Metro Taxi, Yellow Cab, and Union Taxi Inc., to provide Access-a-Cab services. In
addition, as long as the program remains successful and beneficial to RTD, the General Manager, or his
designee, is hereby authorized to negotiate and enter into agreements with each participating cab
company in subsequent years, hereafter.
BACKGROUND
In March of 1997, the RTD Board of Directors introduced the Access-a-Cab program to our Access-aRide program participants. The program offers flexibility in transportation services for individuals with
disabilities. Passengers are permitted to schedule same day trips with local taxi cab companies. Local
taxi companies currently participating include Yellow Transportation, Union Taxi, and Metro Taxi.
DISCUSSION
The subsidized Access-a-Cab program has proven to be very popular. Trips that are taken using the
Access-a-Cab service involve a lesser RTD subsidy per ride than trips taken on the regular Access-aRide service. All persons using Access-a-Cab are certified as eligible to use our Paratransit service,
Access-a-Ride. The budget for 2014 is as follows: Metro Taxi, $1,200,000, Yellow Cab, $800,000,
and Union Taxi Inc., $150,000. Funding for the Access-a-Cab is budgeted annually based on ridership
and anticipated demand.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the Access-a-Cab service are included in the 2014 approved budget. Funds for Access-a-Cab
service in future years will be requested as part of future budget processes.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the recommended continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program.
2. Do not approve the continuance of Agreements for the Access-a-Cab program. This is not
recommended as it will increase overall subsidy costs for our programs to serve individuals with
disabilities.

Subject:

May 2014 Service Changes

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the May 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A resulting in
an annualized cost increase of approximately $1,440,000 and, further, to authorize the General Manager
or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is
impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will continue adjusting services in
response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. With the
opening of the Union Station Bus Concourse a service plan has been developed; rerouting existing bus
service from the former Market Street Station to the new underground Bus Concourse facility at Denver
Union Station. Additionally, the Free MetroRide is a new service proposed for the downtown Denver
area. The Free Metro Ride would provide additional distribution/circulation service during peak periods to
supplement the existing Free Mall Ride service. Service changes not associated with or included in the
Denver Union Station Service Plan are also proposed to maintain system on-time performance and
provide the appropriate level of service according to customer demand. We will monitor customer
response to the implementation of Union Station Service Plan service and propose adjustments as
appropriate.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Two public hearings were held on January 29, 2014 where the primary subject was the opening of the
Denver Union Station Bus Concourse. Comments from these meetings and the service change website
are summarized in Attachment B of this report. It should be noted that three public hearings were held in
November 2013 to discuss the initial bus service plan for the opening of the DUS Bus Concourse.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the

Packet Pg. 11

1.B.5

modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to

Attachment: May 2014 Service Change Attachment A (1872 : Board Report May 2014 Service Changes)

The current 6:20pm trip, leave from Civic Center Station, has been shifted to a leave time
of 6:30pm, due to an interline and deadhead issue, as well as the request for a somewhat
later last-trip northbound trip time, by current passengers. No cost anticipated

1.B.5.b

This meeting was attended by 23 members of the public and RTD Board members Director Bill James
and Director Natalie Menten. RTD staff in attendance included: Robert Rynerson, Jeff Becker, Jessie
Carter, Doug Monroe, Chris Marko, and Diane Marquiss.
The comments from public largely centered on the proposal affecting the area around 18th Street
between Wazee and Wynkoop Streets accessing the DUS bus concourse. It was the view of those who
spoke that the routing was a burden unfairly placed on the residents in the area. The attendees
suggested alternative routings be studied to provide a more equitable distribution of the bus traffic
going into DUS. It was pointed out that pedestrian safety along with parking access were of great
concern.
Other comments were heard in favor of changes made to the Route 9 and comments made on behalf of
riders of late night/early light rail service.

Public Hearing
RTD Administrative Offices Rooms T & D
Wednesday January 29, 2014 6:00 p.m.
This meeting was attended by 13 members of the public, three RTD employees, and board member
Director Natalie Menten. The current proposals for the Denver Union Station bus concourse and how
they had changed from the original proposals was discussed. Thanks was expressed by members of the
public to RTD for modifying the original plans to no longer include Route 15Ltd running along 18th
Street. The routing of Route 0 to and from the Union Station Bus Concourse was also discussed, with
various alternatives suggested.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: February 6, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

February 5, 2014

Board Meeting Date: February 11, 2014

Subject:

Service Performance 2012 Networked Family
of Services

Overview
RTD’s Mission is: "To meet our constituents' present and future public transit needs by offering safe,
clean, reliable, courteous, accessible and cost-effective service throughout the district." Service
development and performance analysis require that we ask several questions. What are the markets or
demand? Should service be provided and how much? What type of service should be provided? RTD’s
general approach is as follows. Develop a family of services suited to a variety of markets. Connect all
the services together in a network or system to accommodate today’s dispersed travel patterns. Match
the level-of-service with demand, thus improving performance and sustainability.
Performance is a term often used interchangeably with effectiveness and efficiency. The effectivenessproductivity charts in this report present these measures for all RTD services. Effectiveness measures
attainment of the objective-maximize ridership within the budget-and is presented on the y-axis as
subsidy per boarding. Efficiency-productivity or output/input-is presented on the x-axis as
boardings/vehicle hour. The charts offer a convenient, comparative analysis of all classes of services,
illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
RTD service standards are depicted in the charts to help make judgments about performance. Each
rectangle labeled by service type represents the domain for routes that meet or exceed minimum
performance requirements for that service class. Minimums are defined statistically to represent routes
meeting or exceeding 10% of the performance for all routes in each category. So this is a case where
it’s bad to be “outside the box”.
Routes that perform minimally get minimum service frequency, typically every 30 minutes during peak
periods and 60 minutes off-peak. The charts also depict guidelines for routes where ridership
significantly exceeds the minimum, and passenger loads justify more frequent service. The orange,
dotted, vertical line at 25 boardings per hour represents the typical minimum productivity for a route to
justify 15-minute frequency, and the green line at 40 boardings per hour for 10-minute frequency.
Please note that these are true apples-to-apples comparisons of performance: all fare revenues,
boardings and costs-both operating and amortized capital-are included. For complete, detailed
information see RTD’s Service Standards (attachment B).

 Boardings: Unlinked passenger trips; includes transfers as boardings.
 Hours: In-service, vehicle hours, not including dead head garage time or layover/recovery.
 Fare Revenues: Cash, ticket, & tokens allocated by route by farebox recorded boardings.
Monthly pass revenues are allocated by class of pass and the number of uses by route.
Revenue from Eco, CU, and Auraria passes are allocated individually by the counts for each
route weighted by the ratio of the class of service fare to the local fare.
 Costs: All operating, maintenance and administrative costs for providing current service, plus
depreciation on all RTD assets. Excludes interest and any costs attributed to future projects.
RTD’s cost allocation model allocates costs to each route based on its miles, hours, and peak
vehicles. Individual accounting line items are assigned to the most relevant variable by the
model.
 Subsidy: Costs minus Fare Revenues.
Standards
RTD has established guidelines in its Service Standards that the least productive 10% of routes
based on either subsidy per boarding or boardings per hour need to be evaluated for
marketing, revision or elimination, or if both measures fall below 25% for a route. The
performance charts illustrate the acceptable performance domain containing all routes meeting
the 10% minimums for each class of service. The calculation of the 10% and 25% standards are
made from the annual, un-weighted data, assuming the data have a normal distribution and
using the appropriate formulas for standard deviation and confidence intervals; however, the
standard deviation is applied to the weighted average. The following table gives the current
year weighted averages and standards by class of service.

Definitions

1.C.1.c

The following routes were discontinued or merged January 2012 due to budget needs for “right-sizing”
RTD services and based on their performance: #2 East 1st Ave, #4 Morrison Rd, #44Ltd 44th Ave, #48X
Green Valley Ranch merged with #47X, #58X West 58th, Route #60 South Pierce converted into South
Jeffco CnR, Route #63X Lockheed/Waterton converted into South Jeffco CnR, #79 East Florida Ave
replaced by 79/83Ltd, #93X, #121 Peoria Ltd merged into #121, #203 Boulder/Lafayette Via Baseline
merged with #225, #301 & #302 & #303 converted into Longmont CnR, Superior CnR.
The following provides status as of January 2014, listed in route number order.
Route 3 Ltd East Alameda — This is a well utilized route that easily meets the boardings per hour
standard. However, its subsidy per boarding is higher than most other CBD Local routes because the
3Ltd is a peak period, peak direction only service and is thus more expensive to operate.
Route 6X Federal Center Station/I-25&Broadway – Discontinued April 2013 with the West Corridor
restructuring.
Route 9 West 10th Ave – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 31X North Federal – This route will continue to be monitored.
Route 32 West 32nd Ave/City Park — This route dipped below the subsidy standard for the second
time in 2011. January 2012 service east of downtown was discontinued on weekends and midday
frequency reduced; discontinued night service west of downtown. It currently meets the boardings
standard.
Route 34 West 3rd Avenue Commuter —This is a small route that has been restructured several
times in recent years and serves passengers with disabilities.
Route 45 Montbello/Green Valley Ranch – Significant portions of this route are under development;
performance will be monitored.
Routes 47X Green Valley Ranch/Montbello Express — This route was combined with the Route 48X
Green Valley Ranch Express for improved performance overall January 2012. This route is only
marginally below standards. It will be replaced by the Airport Line in 2016.
Route 48 East 48th Ave/Commerce City – While the Route 48 serves the Central Business District, a
significant portion of the route serves a lower density industrial area that includes RTD District Shops
and Platte Division.
Route 54 Montbello Industrial Park — Discontinued off-peak service January 2012 and service
reduced further for January 2014.
Route 79Ltd – This route was newly reinstated and it appears that it will meet standards in 2013.
Route 80X West 80th – This route will continue to monitored.

Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain

1.C.1.c

Route 116X South Simms – Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.
Route 145X Brighton/DIA Express – This is a policy route that just barely misses standards.
Route 209 CU/Table Mesa PnR – Route restructured with August 2013 service change.
Route 323 Skyline Crosstown — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 324 – Main St Crosstown - Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 326 Northside Loop Clockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 327 Northside Loop Counterclockwise — Restructured Longmont routes January 2013.
Route 401 Ranches Crosstown — Discontinued midday weekday and weekend service west of Mineral
Station and replaced with S Jeffco call-n-Ride January 2012. This route currently meets the boardings
standard. Service reduced in January 2014.
Route 403 Lucent Blvd — Service realigned for January 2014.
Route 410 Franktown/Parker — This route was substantially revised with the reinstatement of Route P
Parker/Denver spring 2007. Service was reduced to every 30 minutes peak and every two hours midday.
Service was reduced to peak period only May 2009. Additional trips added January 2014 in response to
public meetings where constituents noted that this would make the route more attractive. Will be
monitored for response.
Route DD Boulder/Colorado Blvd —Due to declining ridership from the University Hospital move to
Anshutz-Fitzsimons Medical Center, service has been steadily reduced for several years; it will eventually
be discontinued and fully replaced by the Route DM Boulder/Anshutz-Fitzsimons.
Route J Longmont/East Boulder – Current ridership meets the minimum standard, though subsidy level
falls short of the standard. This route will be continue to be monitored and is under consideration in the
NAMS study.
Route R/RC Brighton/Denver — Additional service was added in January 2011 to attract additional
riders. This route will be monitored for its performance.
Route T Boulder/Greenwood Plaza — This route was discontinued November 2006 with the opening of
the Southeast Corridor. Responding to customer complaints, the RTD Board reinstated the route in
March 2007. This route will be revisited when Union Station construction provides the needed bus-rail
connections.
Route AA Wagon Road/DIA — Performance is just slightly below subsidy/boarding, but meets
boarding/hour standard. Will be monitored.
Route YL Lyons/Longmont - Discontinued this grant funded service January 2014.

Attachment: Notes on Routes Outside Their Acceptable Performance Domain - Attachment C (1871 : Service Performance 2012)

Route 100X South Kipling - Restructured April 2013 with the West Corridor restructuring.

Belleview Call-n-Ride – This is a new grant funded Call-n-Ride and is being monitored. Changed the flex
route portion to on-demand January 2014.
Highlands Ranch Call-n-Ride — It was proposed to discontinue service in 2009; however, the RTD Board
chose, according to policy, to retain it due to lack of alternatives and the high proportion of riders with
disabilities.
Federal Heights Call-n-Ride - This is a new grant funded Call-n-Ride and is being monitored.
C-Line Rail — This line is only slightly below standards.
E-Line Rail — This line easily meets boardings per hour standard and is slightly below the subsidy per
boarding standard. The ridership performance was affected by a cost savings effort in the January 2012
service change.
