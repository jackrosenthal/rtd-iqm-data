BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
May 2022 Service Plan

Committee Meeting Date:
March 9, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
March 22, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the May 2022 Service Change package as revised and summarized
in Attachment A and to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute contract
amendments as necessary for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Ford, Chief Operations Officer
Jessie Carter, Senior Manager of Service Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Commensurate with the service change and voting process detailed in the Collective Bargaining
Agreement (CBA) shared between RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001, the May 2022
Service Change Proposal facilitates both an opportunity for bus and rail operators to select new work
assignments and the opportunity for Service Development staff to make adjustments to the operations
plan for the transit network. Current system-wide ridership trends are relatively stable, showing an
overall increase in ridership with a customary drop in ridership associated with the holiday season (see
Figure 1 in Attachment B). However, operator availability challenges still exist, made worse by absentee
issues relating to COVID-19, making it more difficult to both maintain system on-time performance and
expand service offerings to customers.
DISCUSSION
Following the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, relating most directly to Customer Excellence and recognizing
the agency’s “people power” problem, the proposals herein are directed at improving on-time
performance, adhering to the CBA and adjusting service levels to match anticipated summer ridership
demand.
The Board-adopted guidance for proposed service changes continues to be:
• Service performance evaluation based on established Service Standards
• The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets
• The availability of alternative services to affected riders
• Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible
• Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also, disparate effects on low income and minority populations

Response to changes in the communities where services are provided

Given the current economic conditions due to the COVID-induced economic slowdown, the overarching
guidance for the proposed May 2022 service changes come from the Board adopted guidance for
COVID-19 Budget Reductions, especially Principle number three (3):
“We will prioritize mobility for people who must depend on transit during the pandemic: we will strive to
maximize mobility during the pandemic for those customers who most depend upon our services to
access essential jobs and their necessities, while also keeping our community activity centers
appropriately connected.” A summary of the list of service proposals are provided below, which are
detailed in Attachment A.

Route reductions and suspensions have had a significant impact on mobility. The metropolitan Denver
area is expanding rapidly, and as a result, more reliable transportation options are desired. However,
obtaining and maintaining the necessary resources, which include labor, facilities and vehicles; has
been a challenge during the pandemic. As witnessed from the gathered input from the public comment
process, customers expect RTD to live up to its reputation for providing convenient and dependable
service.

KEY FEEDBACK
Customers have expressed their dissatisfaction with canceled, halted, or limited services. The
widespread view is that RTD service must return to full service. Customers have stated that traveling
with RTD is a less optimum option than using alternative modes of transportation because of
irregularity in services. The following are the items that garnered the most feedback:
•

Support for the Route 228 Reconfiguration

•

FF branches: reinstate all FF branches

•

Reinstate the GS

•

Route 10: reinstate east of 9th and Clermont and adjust running
time

•

Route 20: change WB early morning trip to earlier departure

•

Route 76: return to regular service

•

Route 169L: increase frequency

•

Reinstate C and F lines
