### C. 2016 - 012 : Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza Transfer Center

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached resolution certifying easements as necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Motion:               Director Anderson made the motion to approve the Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza Transfer Center

Director Sisk seconded the motion.

Discussion:               Director Walker recused himself from this action item as he works for one of the parties involved in the transaction.

Director Francone asked Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, to clarify the purpose of this resolution.  Henry Stopplecamp explained that staff is asking the Board to approve beginning the process of acquiring two easements though the eminent domain process.  He noted this is RTD’s standard process for acquiring property and easements and added that the easements are needed for power and sanitation as part of the new transfer center.

Director Francone noted that there were also traffic concerns warranting the movement of the current facility.  Henry Stopplecamp said that was correct but these easements are primarily to service the driver relief kiosk and the lighting of the new facility.  There are also two to three buses at any one time parked at the current facility and staff’s goal is to have all three buses in a safe location away from the traffic at Southwest Plaza.

Director Francone inquired if construction of the transfer center would also cover a complete reconstruction of the road.  Henry Stopplecamp indicated that it would only be for 1200 feet of roadway.

Director James explained that this action item is only coming to the Board because of the easement acquisition.  He thanked staff for the extensive background for this action item and reiterated that this real estate transaction is necessary for operations.  He reminded the Board that there are many other operational projects that do not require Board approval but this one does because of the easements.  Henry Stopplecamp noted that Anthony Forrester and Susan Altes provided the memo to the Board.  He said that it was a team approach to provide the Board with the information they needed.

Director Menten thanked staff for the background information but indicated that after speaking with Bus drivers and driving around the medical center, she is still going to be a no vote considering RTD’s financial position.

Chair Tobiassen indicated he would support this action item as it is part of RTD’s capital priority program.  He added that this is important and the Board should approve it so that it can be done.

Vote on

The Motion:               The motion passed with 10 in favor (Anderson, Archuleta, Deadwyler, Hoy, James, Lasater, Lubow, Sisk, Solano, Tobiassen) and 2 opposed (Francone, Menten).  Director Walker recused himself from this action item.  Directors Bagley and Folska were absent.

Director Francone recognized Nate Currey, Senior Manager of Public Relations and Information, and Nadia Garas of DDP for their assistance giving KLZ AM Radio a tour of the University of Colorado A Line.  She explained the radio hosts were not exactly fans of RTD but Nate and Nadia were spectacular.  They were patient, informative, full of facts, fun and professional.  She thanked General Manager Genova and Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, for allowing them to come on the tour with her.  She said that as a result of staff’s work, there are three new converts.

Director Menten inquired about the B Line handout that the Board received.  She indicated that on the first page under General Information it notes that Westminster Station will provide 650 parking spots, but page 3 says 600.  She asked for further clarification as to which number was correct.  General Manager Genova said that staff would clarify and correct that handout.

Director Menten further inquired about the parking fee at Westminster Station.  She noted that the first 90 days would be free and then the regular parking fee would apply, but she asked for clarification as to what is considered RTD’s regular fee.  General Manager Genova stated that after the preliminary 90-day period, the RTD parking management program will be implemented at the Westminster facility and the fees would be similar to those facilities in the managed program.  If someone lives inside the District, the first 24 hours are free and then it is $2.00 per day.  If someone is out of District it is $4.00 per day.  He added that staff is planning to have additional information from our stakeholders before next week’s Study Session that will focus on parking.
