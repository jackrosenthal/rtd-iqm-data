Review requested changes to GM Core and Task Goals for 2017 presented
by GM Genova


Committee Chair Francone reminded the Board that the updated performance
appraisal from Dave Genova was included in the packet and asked GM Genova to
speak to the amended Goals. Barbara McManus suggested it be reviewed for
Smart Goals as well as moving it forward in the process to save time since each
goal would be reviewed individually. Dave Genova indicated he had made the
changes discussed in the May meeting and would outline those changes as he
moves through the core and task goals.

Core Goal #1 - Successful Delivery of Transit Services: Attain 80%
performance measures
GM Genova outlined what adjustments he had made to the goal giving the
example of the addition of providing “noteworthy and outstanding” services

for all RTD supported special events while providing normally scheduled
services in the category of “Exceeds Expectations”. Director Anderson
reminded GM Genova that he was asked to amend the Achieved Goal to add
the monitoring of Denver Transit Partners (DTP) performance and compliance
and report this information to the Board. GM Genova apologized for the miss
and thanked Director Anderson for her reminder. Director Anderson asked if
the Committee could move to accept the change as an amendment.

Director Menten suggested in the “Exceeds Expectations” category the she
would like to see “and” instead of “or” for the two goals listed. Committee
Chair Francone noted that the 90% is a hefty goal and thinks combining the
goals would not be realistic.
Director Bagley moved to vote on the goals as amended and Chair Tobiassen
seconded. Seeing no other questions Director Bagley asked for ayes to
accept Core Goal #1 as amended. The amended goal was passed
unanimously.


Core Goal #2 - Strong & Ethical Leadership Articulates vision, forms cohesive
team, regular team-building sessions, builds and maintains effective executive
team, and handles conflict
GM Genova spoke to the changes that were requested to add specific
examples of local and national recognition to both 1 and 2 in the “Exceed
Expectation” category. He reviewed the verbiage and the Committee agreed
the changes met the requested criteria. Committee Chair Francone asked if
there was any discussion.
Director Menten said, as she has requested last meeting and in the past, she
would like to see in the “Exceeded Expectation” category an “and” that
speaks to team building and an in-house employee survey. She feels this
would be a helpful indicator on how the employees view RTD leadership.
GM Genova stated that RTD was looking into doing an employee survey in
2017 but was not sure if it would be approved through the budget process.
He also did not know if the format that was planned would provide valuable
information for the Board. He reviewed the past survey and much of the
criteria would not satisfy what was being asked.
Dave Genova suggested looking at the continuous improvement process
being worked on agency wide as an additional gauge to cross functional
communication and perhaps do a Survey Monkey with those teams. Director
Bagley added that it would be difficult getting represented employees to
participate and that finding a baseline that would be an acceptable
percentage agency wide could be difficult to attain. He recommended that
Packet Pg. 5

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 28, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley made the motion and Chair Tobiassen seconded. The
amendment passed unanimously.

6.A

Chair Tobiassen said he would like to see what such a survey would look like
as many surveys are not effective. He thought perhaps a 360 survey with
Senior Leadership could be effective but much work would need to be done
to develop such a survey. Director Menten said she had suggested this last
year as well and would like to see this move forward in the future. Chair
Tobiassen felt this was a subject that should be brought up at the beginning
of the year at the SLT/Directors Advance and it was not the role of this
Committee to amend the goal established by the full Board. Committee Chair
Francone said she understood there should be some measure but currently
does not know what that would look like and reiterated that timing would not
allow such an effort for the 2017 goals.
Director Bagley called for the question and made the motion to move forward
with the vote on Core Goal #2. Director Anderson seconded with the motion
passing 6-1 with Director Menten voting no.


Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management Oversees operating and
FasTracks budgets, ensures compliance with local, state, and federal
reporting, and development of financing plans for future projects.
GM Genova clarified in the “Exceeds Expectations” category that there is an
“or” between number 1 and number 2 and not an “and” making both the
goal. Committee Chair Francone asked for a motion.
Director Bagley made the motion to approve Core Goal #3 and Chair
Tobiassen seconded. There was no discussion on this item and the motion
passed with a 6-1 vote with Director Menten voting no.
Director Menten asked if she could comment on her no vote. She stated that
for the record, in the future she would like to see in the “Exceeds
Expectation” category “strong financial management that we would
aggressively do everything possible to decrease debt load as to not endanger
future service”.



Core Goal #4 Ensures Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)/Affirmative
Action (AA)/Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE)/Small Business
Enterprise (SBE): As written in Achieved Goal Criteria below.
GM Genova spoke to the changes that were requested in the “Exceeds
Expectation” category which included adding “specific examples or articles in
national publications or presenting to national audiences” and reiterating that
there is an “or” and not “and” between goals 1 – 4. He spoke to the
Packet Pg. 6

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 28, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

perhaps part of what the Committee should do as a project in 2017 is to
work with staff on a survey that would effectively rate internal satisfaction.
Director Walker added he is afraid we would on only get a snapshot and is
not comfortable for the GM to be evaluated in that manner as there were too
many unknowns.

6.A

Director Bagley made the motion to approve Core Goal #4 and Director
Walker seconded with the motion passing unanimously.


Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach: Keeps
Board informed, periodically meets with Board members, delivers
presentations in local and national venues, and continues Public
Information/Public Relations planning and implementation.
GM Genova outlined the changes that were updated from the request at the
last meeting. He added clarification and specific samples in the “Exceeds
Expectations” category as requested of Directors Bagley and Walker.
Director Menten asked GM Genova if he would add under “Exceeds
Expectations” the posting of audio of the Board meetings on the website.
Chair Tobiassen mentioned this was brought up last year and was voted
down. Director Bagley said this is something he has been wanting and has
had discussions with staff, which he will continue to follow up on even when
he leaves the Board. Chair Tobiassen say he feels there is general opposition
from some of the Board members and that would need to be looked at.
Director Anderson thinks that this is an operational function and not a
function of the General Manager and should be handled by staff. Committee
Chair Francone asked if there was any additional discussion. As there was
none she called for the vote.
Director Tobiassen made the motion to approve Core Goal #5 and Director
Bagley seconded. The motion passed 6 – 1 with Director Menten voting no.



Task Goal # 1 Fiscal Sustainability.
GM Genova said the goal had no adjustments requested and only a spelling
correction was made. Committee Chair Francone asked if there was any
discussion. Seeing none she called for a vote.
Director Bagley made the motion to approve Task Goal #1 and Director
Walker seconded. The motion passed unanimously 7 – 0.



Task Goal # 2 – Workforce/Human Capital.
GM Genova outlined the changes that were requested in the “Exceed
Expectations” category by adding specific language defining agency
Packet Pg. 7

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jun 28, 2016 3:30 PM (Committee Reports)

addition of a number 5 in the “or” category under “Exceeds Expectations” as
“recognizing DBE/SBE firms for showing annual improvement in terms of
revenue growth, capacity building, and prime contracts”. This addition was
in response to Director Menten’s request of challenging the DBE/SBE firms to
graduate from the program. GM Genova said this addition would gauge and
recognize each firm showing improvement but noted there was no way to
force a firm to go through the graduation process. Committee Chair
Francone asked if there was any other discussion, seeing none she called for
the vote.

6.A

recognition local or nationally for our employee program, in local or national
publications or presenting to national audiences.



Task Goal # 3 State of Good Repair – Operations and Maintenance
GM Genova stated there had been no requested changes to this goal but that
he would like to add an “or” to the “Exceeds Expectations” category as
follows: initiate the International Standards Organization (ISO) certification
process for asset management. He commented that it takes some time to
get through this certification and thinks it would be a value add and a
significant body of work. Director Anderson said this is a great idea but
having gone through this in the past with fire and police departments, it is
costly she would want to make sure it would not be a burden on the agency
in any way. GM Genova said this would be done without any additional
staffing. Committee Chair Francone asked for a vote.
Director Bagley made the motion to approve Task Goal #3 and Chair
Tobiassen seconded. The motion passed unanimously 7 – 0.

Director Bagley made the motion to approve moving the 2017 Goals as amended
forward to the full Board at the July 19, 2016 Board Meeting. Chair Tobiassen
seconded. Director Menten clarified that the Committee was making the final
approval of the 2017 Goals today and would not be meeting again on July 12.
Committee Chair Francone stated that was correct.
The motion passed 6-1 with Director Menten voting no.

III.

Review for SMART Goals
This item was discussed during review of the changes to the GM Core and Task
Goals.

IV.

Review GM Performance June Survey Results
Barbara McManus passed out a copy of the analysis of the Survey Monkey results
and discussed the methodology and the timing in comparison with past surveys.
The survey was based on GM Genova as Interim GM starting in March of 2015
through June of 2016. Director Bagley mentioned that in the past there had been
no GM Oversight committee and this was a result of the state audit. Barbara
McManus said she had reviewed the recommendations and the process outlined for
the Committee this year follows the processed set forth as a result of the audit.
Some questions were asked clarifying the number of survey participants and how
the scaling was set up to generate the results. The general consensus was that this
was a good baseline for 2016 and the results were for the most part favorable.
Director Bagley confirmed the next survey would be administered in October prior to

the final evaluation for the 2016 performance appraisal. Chair Tobiassen indicated
that in an interim position your hands are tied and it is difficult to make too many
changes and the October results would be a better indicator.

Chair Tobiassen thanked Barbara McManus and George Hovey for their work in
putting together, implementing and evaluating the Survey Monkey data. Director
Bagley echoed the Chair’s comments.

V.

GM Committee to provide Preliminary Consensus/Recommendation to
prepare final Goals to the full Board on July 19th
The GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee agreed to move the
2017 GM Core and Task Goals forward during the review of changes to the Core
and Task Goals.

VI.

Questions and Next Steps
Director Menten asked if the Committee could get an update on the status of audio
being posted to the website. Dave Genova said he would have Nate Currey attend
the Executive Committee meeting on July 14th to give an overview of the project to
date. Director Menten mentioned that the audio already exists and wonders if it is
possible to post those files. Chair Tobiassen said there is a process to getting that
done that the file format would need to be evaluated to determine how best these
files could be handled.
Director Anderson said that Adams County Commissioner Eric Hanson was involved
in an accident which caused extensive damage to his eye. Chair Tobiassen shared
that Josh Blue, the comedian, performed at the ADA Symposium and made the
comment that we are all just a second away from a disability.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Board Update B Line
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs,
reminded the Board the B Line Grand Opening would be on Monday, July
25th. He asked Greg Straight, Engineering Project Manager, to review the
Power Point presentation included in the July 5th, 2016 FasTracks
Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.
Greg Straight stated one important item to note is that the B Line does not
have any public at-grade crossings like there are along the University of
Colorado A Line. He explained this adds to staff’s confidence in the B Line
opening being very successful and on-time.
Greg Straight shared that testing and construction were going well. The
System Performance Demonstration is underway and will last 21 days. The
final platform punchlist work is underway with the canopy installation
complete. Additionally, the elevator construction continues along with the
installation of lighting on the platform canopy and walkway. He commented
that the City of Westminster (City) is building the parking garage, plaza area
and park on the south side of the station. He indicated the City is on track
for completion by opening day.
Greg Straight said that in addition to construction, the B Line team has
conducted an extensive safety outreach program. He noted eight schools
were identified within one mile of the line. He stated such activities such as
classroom presentation, mock crossing and assemblies have reached more
than 5,000 students.

Henry Stopplecamp stated if there was to be paid parking different from that
of our other parking facilities the City would be responsible for parking
management. He reminded the Board that per the State Legislature, parking
will be free for the first 90 days as notification of costs must be posted for
that time period. He indicated that staff and the City are currently in
discussions about how to move forward.
General Manager Genova shared that as of right now it appeared the City
would implement RTD’s parking management program after the initial 90
day period for evaluation; however, he said this could change as discussions
continue. He informed the Board that the July Study Session would include
a thorough discussion of parking such as the recent parking analysis study,
review of the current parking management program, parking structures
where there are Intergovernmental Agreements with a city, etc.
Director Archuleta shared that he has received over 100 emails from the
Sunnyside neighborhood wanting the B Line to stop at the 41st and Fox
station. He asked if this would be happening any time in the near future.
He said he wants to give them facts, not vague statements. Henry
Stopplecamp stated there is always the possibility the 41st and Fox and
Pecos stations could be added but the B Line would not be stopping at them
opening day. General Manager Genova explained that those two stations
were part of the G Line construction process so they would not be through
the certification process by B Line opening day. He reiterated that staff is
going through an evaluation about the feasibility of the B Line stopping at
them at a future date but no decisions have been made.
Director Anderson inquired if there would still be an Eagle P3 Elected Official
Briefing that was included on the Board’s Two Week Calendar for Thursday,
July 7th. She also wondered if the artwork would be finished in time for
opening day. Greg Straight said he would have to look into both of her
questions and get back to her.
Committee Chair Hoy shared that as it relates to the artwork, he recently
talked with one of the City Council members and it is touch and go. The
City is hoping it will be done but would not gamble on it.

Packet Pg. 12

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley asked for further information about the details surrounding
the parking structure the City was building and if the City would be
implementing paid parking different from that of RTD’s parking fees. Greg
Straight explained that originally the lot was planned as a surface lot;
however, in a joint effort RTD agreed to provide the City with a credit to use
toward a parking structure.

6.B

Director Francone asked if staff had an estimate of the ridership numbers for
the B Line stop at 41st and Fox. She pointed out that the community is
being very vocal and asked staff to keep that in mind when making
decisions. Greg Straight reiterated that there will be nothing in the
infrastructure to preclude service if and when it makes sense. Henry
Stopplecamp stated the original ridership models showed very few people
stopping from the B Line at 41st and Fox when it ends at Westminster. He
said the ridership goes up significantly when the B Line is extended to
Boulder.
Director Anderson pointed out that the G Line will provide 15 minute
frequencies during peak service hours while the B Line provides only 30.
She believes the Sunnyside community will be quite well served by the G
Line.
Committee Chair Hoy indicated he would be happy to speak with any
Director offline about questions regarding the B Line stops.
Director James wondered if staff knew what the City had planned related to
development around the Westminster Station. Bill Sirois, Senior Manager of
Transit Oriented Communities, said his understanding is that there is an
Adams County Housing Project advancing near the station. He noted there
are a lot of interested parties but does not know specifics. Committee Chair
Hoy stated that the City was keeping their development plans close to the
vest at this time but there have been a lot of inquiries.

• Future Construction FasTracks Corridors Federal Funding Analysis
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, introduced Brian
Welch, Senior Manager of Technical Service, and explained that Brian
Welch’s team is the team that took RTD through the most recent Small
Starts Grant process for the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE). He stated this
team is very familiar with the New Starts and Small Starts funding criteria.
Bill Van Meter shared this team used the same rigor to complete an analysis
of the remaining unfunded FasTracks corridors to determine their probability
in qualifying for federal funds.
Brian Welch reviewed the Power Point presentation that was included in the
July 5, 2016 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet. He pointed
out that since FasTrack’s approval in 2004, The FTA’s Capital Investment
Grant Program (CIG), that includes the New Starts and Small Starts grants,
was heavily re-structured under MAP-21 (Moving Ahead for Progress in the

21st Century) and further refined under the FAST Act (Fixing America’s
Surface Transportation). He explained that criteria for the CIG Program was
divided into two criteria. A project must receive an average of “Medium” or
3.0 on a 5.0 scale in both criteria to be eligible. The first is Project
Justification, consisting of six criteria of equal weight. The second is Local
Financial Commitment with is three components with a 25%/25%/50%
weighting. The components of each criteria are:
 Project Justification
o Mobility Improvements: total linked trips on the project
o Environmental Benefits: reduction in vehicle miles traveled
o Congestion Relief: number of new transit trips
o Cost-Effectiveness: capital and operating* costs per trip
(*O&M not included for Small Starts)
o Economic Development: transit supportive plans and policies
o Land Use: Legally binding affordability restricted housing;
existing corridor and station character
 Local Financial Commitment
o Current Financial Condition: fleet age, bond ratings, ratio of
assets to liabilities, service history, etc.
o Commitment of Funds: committed vs budgeted vs planned,
private contributions, etc.
o Financial Capacity and Reasonableness of Assumptions:
assumptions compared to history, reasonableness of cost
estimates, state of good repair, ability to withstand shortfalls
or overruns, etc.
Brian Welch stated when evaluating the remainder of the Central, North
Metro, Northwest Rail and Southwest Rail projects against the Project
Justification Criteria, only the Central Rail Extension would receive a ranking
of “Medium”. He said when evaluating the Local Financial Commitment
none of the four projects would achieve a “Medium” rating based on current
and anticipated RTD financial projections and forecasts.
Bill Van Meter indicated that while the presentation was not as positive as
everyone would like, staff will continue to look at other strategies to fund
the unfunded corridors. He pointed out that both the I-225 and North Metro
to 124th projects moved forward without federal funding; however, he
stressed that any successful funding strategy would have to include
significant non-RTD funds, similar to SERE. He said staff would be providing
further details during the review of the 2016 Annual Program Evaluation
(APE) that would be presented at the next Financial Administration and Audit
Committee Meeting.
Committee Chair Hoy stated it is apparent that RTD is in competition with
the rest of the nation on New Starts and Small Starts Grants. He noted
each of the unfunded projects within RTD are essentially in competition

amongst themselves. He indicated he has heard loud and clear from staff
that the unfunded projects do not rate high nationally for funds. He believes
it may come down to RTD’s private and public partners to bring more to the
table, as was done on SERE. He asked if that was a fair assessment of the
current financial situation of these projects. Bill Van Meter stated that was
accurate. He noted that the FTA and Federal Government do change their
priorities and funding requirements though so there may be opportunities
down the road to revisit these projects. He reminded the Board that the
Denver Regional Council of Governments (DRCOG) is also closely involved in
providing some of the key socioeconomic, land use, etc. projections.
DRCOG is constantly updating and refining their assumptions to make sure
the data is accurate. As their projections change it could also change a
projects potential eligibility.
Director Folska asked for the length and estimated cost to build the Central
Corridor. She said it was her understanding that RTD already applied for a
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grant for
this project. Bill Van Meter stated it was a little less than one mile and is
projected to cost $140 million in Year of Expenditure (YOE) dollars. He
reminded the Board that RTD did apply for a TIGER Grant but was not
successful. He indicated staff applied for another TIGER Grant for the
Central Corridor State of Good Repair as well as some pocket track, which is
a key element of being able to build the extension in the future in addition to
current operational benefits.
Director Solano asked if any progress has been made on the extension of the
North Metro Line to Highway 7 since the project had been defederalized. Bill
Van Meter explained that the defederalization occurred to allow for the
current construction of the North Metro Line to 124th. He said staff has met
with Adams County and the City of Thornton but nothing has panned out todate.
Director James noted an area of interest he has outside of RTD is affordable
housing. He said it sounds as if there is a legal requirement for affordable
housing in the vicinity of a project which enhances the project’s rating. He
asked for further information about how these legal requirements are
defined. Brian Welch explained that the wording is very specific and
convoluted. Essentially there needs to be evidence that if an area has
affordable housing prior to a project, it will not go away when the project is
built.
Director Bagley encouraged staff to continue a rigorous review of all projects
in the future, even if there is a Public Private Partnership (PPP) or significant
local funding. General Manager Genova stated that every project requires a
rigorous review. That will not change whether a project was federally
funded or not.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their analysis. She said it was
disappointing but not at all surprising; however, she also thinks in a certain
sense it frees RTD to look at other options. She stated RTD has a fiduciary
duty to make sure any plan is a fiscally sound plan but maybe there are
options not subject to the FTA’s rules.
Director Walker wondered where staff thought the Capital Investment Grant
criteria might be heading in the next 10 years as staff said it can change.
Brian Welch stated the FAST Act was a 6 year bill. He said there could be
new rules proposed depending on the wishes of the administration at the
time but it is a slow process to get from philosophy to rulemaking.
Director Francone thanked staff for an informative and helpful presentation.
She asked for the definition of linked trips versus new transit trips. She also
wondered how affordable housing is defined. Brian Welch explained that
new transit trips were easy to define as they were people that did not
previously use the system. As for a linked trip, it is someone already riding
the system but will use the new system once it is in place, so they are not
considered new riders. He said that affordable housing is based on the
definitions for the various metropolitan organizations.
Director Francone asked if there was a federal cap on the private
commitment of funds for projects. Brian Welch stated there was no cap on
the amount of non-agency private money that could be used for a project.
Director Bagley indicated that while some may see this as liberating that
RTD does not have to conform to federal standards on the unfunded
projects; he reminded the Board that FasTracks has always been defined as
the three legged stool: federal, RTD, and the private/public partners. The
Federal Government was RTD’s partner long before he was ever on the
Board.
Director James thanked staff for their efforts. He thinks it is strategic
thinking at its best. He said this is much like the Fiscal Sustainability Task
Force in examining cost effective alternatives. He pointed out this is very
similar to the golden rule of real estate: those that have the gold make the

Director Anderson shared that she recently read an article about Boulder and
population densities. She noted there has always been a housing deficit in
Boulder as they preferred lower-density zoning. She said in her experience
with Arvada, the City Council had the gumption to design a great city that
provides a great housing mix. This positioned Arvada to be competitive as it
relates to the G Line. She believes this is a good opportunity for cities
around our projects to work with DRCOG and improve their density and land
use plans so in the future they might be competitive.

rules. He thinks if the FTA is interested in sponsoring a project RTD will
follow their rules. If not then RTD will need to work with other partners to
come up with funding ideas.
Committee Chair Hoy said this is very good information for the Board to sit
back and ponder what staff has presented.

C. Updates

• Local Update - CRL Associates
Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, noted that Roger Sherman
of CRL Associates, was unable to attend tonight’s meeting. She said his
report was included in the July 5, 2016 Government Relations Committee
Agenda Packet and asked if there were any questions.
There were no questions from the Board members.

• State Update - Brandeberry McKenna
Jenifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry~McKenna (BBMK), commented that the
major event at the State Capitol this time of year is the budget. She said
there has been some forecasting done but the more relevant numbers will be
available in the fall. She stated preliminary forecasts for Fiscal Year 20162017 show the General Fund revenue is expected to be 2.6% short of the
amount needed to fully fund the budget and required reserve.
Jenifer Brandeberry indicated BBMK has also been following the Colorado
Primary Elections. She said BBMK would provide the Board with a summary
of the outcomes. She shared that BBMK will be meeting with the
candidates prior to the fall election. She pointed out that the Senate is
Republican controlled by one seat so she anticipates a lot of money will be
spend on those contested seats.
Jenifer Brandeberry indicated the Transportation Legislation Review
Committee (TLRC) has posed their schedule with the first two meetings

being State tours. She stated the first legislative meeting will be on August
1 with a presentation from CDOT and a discussion of House Bill 16-1031
related to changes to transportation commission districts.

Director Bagley wondered if Jenifer Brandeberry had a sense of how
accurate the shortfall projections are for the next Fiscal Year. Jenifer
Brandeberry explained that traditionally those figures really do shift over the
summer and fall. She noted Colorado is fairly healthy fiscally because of the
constitutional restraints. She believes there will be a large debate about
infrastructure and funding. Director Bagley thinks there is a lot of
uneasiness and risk avoidance given the uncertainty between now and the
election. He stressed the importance of the Board being thoughtful and
understanding that the economic situation may get worse from what is
forecasted.

• Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs
Mike Dino, Squire Patton Boggs, noted both the House and Senate are back
in session. He indicated the Senate has passed their appropriations bill
related to transit which included $150 million for the Eagle P3 project. He
said the House has only managed to get their transportation bill out of
committee. He believes there will be continuing resolutions for
appropriations through the November elections.
Mike Dino reminded the Board that RTD submitted an application for a
Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant in
the amount of $12 million for State of Good Repair work along the Central
Corridor. He noted there were 585 TIGER applications submitted seeking
$9.3 billion in funding for the $500 million that is available, so the grant
process will be highly competitive.
Committee Chair Folska shared that when she was in Washington, D.C. for
the Accelerate Colorado trip she heard that Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee Chair Shuster was interested in coming to Denver for a tour and
visit. She asked if anyone had followed up on this. Mike Dino indicated he
would look into Congressman Shuster’s schedule and what he would be
interested in visiting.

Colorado’s roads. She said any assistance or guidance BBMK could provide
would be appreciated.

B. Recommended Actions

• Amendment to Lease for Office Space at Civic Center Plaza – 1560
Broadway, Suites 510, 605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to
negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend and extend the
lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District and
CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza,
LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510,
605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th
floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the building
commonly known as Civic Center Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs
personnel, IT personnel, Paratransit Services and Contracted Services. This
amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add
approximately 3,046 square feet to the 6th floor and will amend and extend
all previous leases and amendments to provide for all to expire on December
31, 2022. On the original 73,480 square feet, base rent began at $16.50
per square foot, has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the
final year of the lease at $21.50 per square foot, January 1, 2022 through
December 31, 2022. (Rent for the remaining 11,423 square feet will be
$20.00 per square foot in the final year). Funding for the space to be used
by the FasTracks program was included in the 2015 Annual Program
Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year budgets. Funding for the
space to be used by the base system will be appropriated in future year
budgets.

6.D

Motion:

Director Lubow made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 19, 2016
Board Meeting.

Discussion:

Susan Altes, Senior Manager of Real Property, explained that
FasTracks originally looked for office space back in 2005.
After a lengthy examination of the available office space in the
Central Business District (CBD), staff determined that a
presence at the end of the 16th Street Mall would be
appropriate. She said that over the years a number of
departments have relocated to Civic Center such as IT,
Paratransit Services, Contracted Services, Capital Programs
and Planning. Susan Altes indicated as part of the evaluation
process staff looked at options to centralize all RTD employees
but it was determined to be cost prohibitive at this time.
Leases will begin to expire in 2017 and in the best interest of
the District, staff is recommending all of the leases be
renewed through December 31, 2022. She added that staff
was able to negotiate a very good below market rate for RTD
that includes $2.2 million dollars in a tenant allowance that
can be used for improvements to the space or for rent. She
shared she has done a lot of comparisons with similar Class A
office space in the area and comparable space would be $40
per square foot. The space at civic center would be $33 per
square foot once operating costs are included.
Director Folska asked if RTD owned the building at Civic
Center Plaza. Susan Altes indicated that RTD never owned
the building, but it did own the air rights at one time. Director
Folska added that the market rate sounds like a very good
deal, but it does not seem essential to have staff at the other
end of the mall. She thinks staff should be located in an area
where overhead costs are less as it is prudent to tighten RTD’s
financial belts given the current sales and use tax revenue
projections. For this reason Director Folska stated she would
be voting no.
Director Bagley said it appeared to him there was no exit
strategy should the decision be made to construct a new
building or consolidate operations. Susan Altes explained that
the leases would terminate if there was a failure to appropriate
funds during the annual budget process.

Packet Pg. 24

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Solano seconded the motion.

6.D

General Manager Genova explained that FasTracks employees
were referred to as Capital Program Employees. He added
that staff has completed a detailed analysis to see what RTD’s
needs will be in the future. He noted there will be some
reduction in staff as FasTracks projects are completed, but the
Capital Programs department will still be maintained for such
work as State of Good Repair. He indicated that due to RTD’s
financial condition and inability to bond, it was decided against
adding an addition to the Blake street building. After the build
out of FasTracks, RTD will re-evaluate how to move forward.
It is imperative that employees are able to commute from any
part of the Metro area to the offices and having a major
presence near a transit site that we own is also important.
Henry Stopplecamp, Acting Assistant General Manager of
Capital Programs, added that 80% of the employees at Civic
Center Plaza are Base System employees.
Chair Tobiassen asked why RTD requires a Class A building
and noted that Class B buildings would be more than
adequate. He agreed it was convenient for employees to
travel to Civic Center but believes Class A buildings are
reserved for high level, private businesses. Susan Altes
commented that some Real Estate professionals in the city
classify this building as Class A and others classify it as a
Class B. She pointed out that about 60% of the Civic Center
tenants are State of Colorado employees.
Director Francone inquired if there would be any financial
penalties if the leases are terminated in the future at Civic
Center Plaza. Susan Altes said there would not be a financial
penalty.
Committee Chair James inquired about the financial costs to
operations that could result from moving to a different location
and having employees need to travel even farther for meetings
than they do now. General Manager Genova indicated that
RTD’s desire was to have a single campus, but with the
remaining FasTracks projects, staff decided against that
option. He added that going back and forth from Blake to
Civic Center Plaza is already a challenge for staff and it would
Packet Pg. 25

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Bagley commented that FasTracks was winding down
and inquired if there were still going to be a significant number
of FasTracks employees beyond 2019.

6.D

Committee Chair James wondered if his assumption that RTD
would lose the $2.2 million in tenant allowances if the leases
were not renewed was correct. He noted that the lease rate is
much lower than current market rates and inquired as to how
staff garnered such a great discount. Susan Altes stated
Director James was correct that there is a current tenant
allowance of $1.2 million with an additional $1 million if the
leases were extended. She said staff would have to get busy
in spending the $1.2 million as to not lose the credit. She
explained that as it relates to the lease rates, RTD has
developed a great relationship with the owners of Civic Center
Plaza since the early 1980s. They understand how
government works and they are not surprised by some of the
requirements that RTD has as a government agency.
Director Folska asked if the Platte building could have a
vertical addition to make more room for staff. Henry
Stopplecamp explained that the Platte building was not built to
support an addition. He added that the Platte building is
maxed out of space and staff is having difficulties maintaining
the bus operation training course. He said staff has been
looking throughout the District but RTD does not have enough
money to build a new building. Director Folska commented
that RTD can do better. She does not think there is enough
justification to support paying for CBD office space.
Director Menten asked if staff planned to use the $2.2 million
tenant allowance toward rent if this did proceed forward. She
thinks this should be used right away. Henry Stopplecamp
stated some would be used for rent but there is also some
remodeling that needs to be done.
Director Francone inquired as to how long RTD has had the
Civic Center Plaza lease and if any tenant allowance money
had been used toward rent. She said she agrees with Director
Menten that this should be used toward rent right away. She
stated she likes new carpet too but it is not in her budget.
Susan Altes said that the initial lease began in 2005. She
indicated none of the tenant allowance had been used to-date
which is why $1.2 million was available.
Director Francone further inquired about the classification of
the building. She noted it was compared to Class A buildings
Packet Pg. 26

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

be even more challenging if staff were moved further away
from the CBD.

6.D

Director Bagley questioned the time constraints for signing the
new lease and asked if this must be approved tonight.
General Manager Genova explained that the preference would
be to get this finalized tonight as the rate might be in jeopardy
since the Civic Center improvement is underway. He believes
approving the lease is a reasonable move for the District.
Director Menten inquired about the warehouse that RTD
acquired near the Peoria station and asked if it would be a
suitable solution for office space. Henry Stopplecamp
explained that the warehouse would need to be converted to
office space. He shared that staff looked at using part of the
building for the Treasury and it would cost at least $5 million
dollars to make part of the building usable.
Director Walker asked how much it would cost to move
100,000 square feet of office space. Henry Stopplecamp
noted that he did not have exact figures but the cost would be
considerable. Director Walker added that his office was
consolidated and moved to a new space a few years ago and
it has been a constant issue ever since. He noted that
sometimes it is more expensive to move than it is to stay.
Chair Tobiassen agreed with Director Walker that it is not in
RTD’s best interest to leave this lease and hope for the best.
He added that if the Board is truly concerned about
consolidating staff to one facility that should be discussed at
the March retreat and added to the long term strategic plan.
Committee Chair James remarked that he agreed with Chair
Tobiassen. He reiterated that moving staff affects operations
and should not be taken lightly.

Packet Pg. 27

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

for comparables but it was also likened to Class B space. She
asked if comparables had been done for Class B space as well
when evaluating the cost. Susan Altes explained that the
classification is subjective and different agencies list it as
Class A or Class B+. She believes the comparables would be
pretty close but she would have to do some research to
confirm. She thinks the cost would still be below a Class B+
in RTD’s negotiated rate.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED.

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the
Board of Directors pass the attached resolution certifying easements as
necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center project
and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state
eminent domain law.
Motion:

Director Bagley made the motion to move this
item to the full Board at the July 19, 2016
Board Meeting.
Chair Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Director Walker recused himself from the Board meeting during
this action item as he works for one of the parties involved in
this transaction.
Henry Stopplecamp explained that the Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center project would benefit RTD and its patrons. He
said the project would improve safety, provide drivers with a
relief station, bring patrons closer to the pedestrian bridge over
Wadsworth, and overall improve RTD’s operations. The goal
with passing this action item is to acquire the necessary
easements to move the project into construction.
Susan Altes noted the easements are for a sanitary line and an
electrical line. These are two very small easements but
required for building the Transfer Center.
Committee Chair James remarked that this authorization is
only for the easements. The Board is not authorizing the
construction of the Transfer Center. Henry Stopplecamp
noted that the Board had already approved this project as part
of the 2016 Amended Budget but reiterated that the action

6.D

Director Folska said she did not recall authorizing this Transfer
Center. She expressed concern that RTD was spending $1.8
million just so drivers could have a bathroom and asked for the
total budget for this project. Henry Stopplecamp explained
that the primary focus was having a safe location where buses
could get off the main roadway. Tony Forrester, Engineer,
stated the overall budget is $1.8 million, which includes the
easements, driver relief facility, transfer center and 1,200
linear feet of two lane road. Director Folska inquired if the
driver relief facility would be similar to the one at the
Englewood Station. Tony Forrester indicated he was not
familiar with the driver relief facility at Englewood Station, but
this one would be a nice concrete structure.
Director Folska stated she was hard pressed to support this
based on RTD’s financial outlook. She wonders if this is really
necessary right now or if other options can be considered in
the meantime. Henry Stopplecamp said staff had looked at
other options and this was determined to be the best one.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
commented that the conversation seemed to imply the main
reason behind staff’s recommendation was to provide a
restroom facility; however, staff has attempted to improve
operations at Southwest Plaza for years. He said this is an
opportunity while staff makes improvements to also add a
driver relief facility. This project has been passed up for a
number of years through the Strategic Budget Plan process
because it was not a vital need, but it is time to complete this
project.
Director Folska stated she understands how staff determines
which projects are needed or deferred but still wonders if this
project could be deferred until after the election in November.
She said she would be voting no this evening and asked staff
to get with her offline.
Director Menten shared that she had some time to do some
digging and believes there is a solution to this issue that will
not require as much capital. She indicated that Swedish
Medical Center – Southwest ER has a long circular drive for
bus turn around. She added that she spoke to a
representative at the hospital and they are willing to let drivers

item tonight was only to secure the easements needed to
begin the project.

use their restrooms as the building is open 24/7 and they can
even have free coffee. This location is also closer to
Clemmons Park, which would better serve Columbine High
School. She asked if someone could tell her why this solution
would not be viable.

Bruce Abel commented that staff would need to look at the
operational impact of stopping at the medical facility. He
indicated that without evaluating the specifics he cannot
provide an exact estimate this evening but Service Planning
would do the analysis.
Director Menten said she would vote no for this item until
staff provided the comparison for her suggestion. She
believes there would be benefits to RTD’s ridership if the
routes stopped at the medical facility.
Director Francone noted this started off as a $10,000 line item
a few years ago and now it is up to $1.8 million. She asked if
staff could provide her with the ridership numbers for this
station and inquired the cost of pursing Eminent Domain
should the parties not wish to sell. Susan Altes stated
Eminent Domain can range from $50,000 to $100,000, and
she believes one property might have to go through that
process.
Director Solano asked if the easements are adjacent to each
other and which property would potentially require the
Eminent Domain. Henry Stopplecamp stated the easements
were in different locations. Susan Altes indicated that SRC
Property Trust, the company that owns the Sears building, had
not been very receptive.
Chair Tobiassen asked where staff was in terms of a contract
for this project. Henry Stopplecamp explained that the design
was completed in house, but there is not a contract to build
the facility at this time. Chair Tobiassen noted that Southwest
Plaza is a busy shopping center and he has heard about this
project for years. He added if staff moves the station to a
place that is unknown, it would cause additional issues. He
Packet Pg. 30

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 5, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Henry Stopplecamp explained that if RTD’s busses run on that
circular road as designed, RTD would eventually have to
replace the road. He stated it comes down to bus operations
as stopping at the medical building would put the buses out of
the route.

6.D

does not see how RTD can make such a substantial change
without getting input from the public. He thinks since this
project has been in the works for a few years the Board should
move forward and get it done. If additional service is needed
in that area it should go through the public input process.

Director Lubow expressed that she is not familiar with the
area, but what concerns her is the lack of confidence by some
Board members related to staff’s analysis about why this
project is appropriate. She added that if Directors have issues,
they should take those to staff to discuss beforehand so that
it does not take up a lot of Board time.
Director Menten inquired if there would be any significant
impacts to operations if the Board delayed this item for one
month. Henry Stopplecamp remarked that by holding off on
this item, it would delay the project another month or more,
which would put it outside of this year’s construction season.
Committee Chair James asked staff to provide the Board with
additional background details to illustrate how this project
moved up the priority list prior to the Board Meeting. Henry
Stopplecamp said staff would provide the Board with a
whitepaper that addressed the entire project, not just the
easements.

staff has been working with both entities for a comprehensive security plan. He
added that Mayor Hancock recently unveiled part of that plan and a security
manager has been hired full time. He noted the Meet in the Street events had
already begun. He said he has not heard of any negative impacts to those events
based on the few incidents that have been reported.

B. Recommended Actions
There were no recommended actions.

C. Updates

• Union Time Clock Project Update
Heather Copp, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of
Finance and Administration, commented that last fall staff discussed the
union payroll tracking system with the Board as staff wanted to move to a
cloud based system for the 11 year old aging system. She noted that there
were issues with the sole source vendor and it became clear that RTD was
not going to get the outcome it wanted. Staff terminated that contract and
moved forward to remediate the existing system as best as they could. She
explained that currently there is a maintenance contract to keep the time
clock running as long as possible, but staff is presently exploring a new
vendor through a new RFP process. She indicated it is a mini RFP process
later this month with two separate vendors that have already been vetted
through the state and it should take 6-12 months for implementation. At
this point in time the goal is to get a new, reputable vendor on board as
quickly as possible. For now, it will only be for union and maintenance
employees but may eventually be expanded for the entire agency.
Director Folska asked what constitutes a mini RFP process. Heather Copp
explained that instead of sending out a RFP to the entire world, staff has
identified vendors that have already gone through a full RFP process with
the State or other transit agencies. Since the vendors have already been
vetted and won an award it shortens the timeframe from 6-8 months to 2
months. There are two vendors nationally and internationally known in the
payroll area that staff is considering: Kronos and ADP.
Committee Chair Menten indicated that she and Vice Chair Lubow would like
to take a closer look at the vendor who failed on this project. Heather Copp

Director Hoy was absent. Director Anderson participated via phone.

6.E

noted if the Board would like to know more about the vendor with whom the
contract was terminated, Rolf Asphaug, Acting General Council, could
discuss that at an Executive Session in August.
Director Sisk added he thinks it is important to examine this further. He
commented that he is not a fan of sole source contracts and would like to
know more of the implications of what RTD lost going with the sole source
contract.

• May 2016 Monthly Financial Status Report
Doug MacLeod, Controller, indicated that the May 2016 Financial
Statements were included in the July 12, 2016 Financial Administration &
Audit Committee Agenda packet. He added that the report included the
amended budget figures that were approved in June. He explained that
Sales and Use tax is 4.4% under budget, but staff expects that to be back
on track next month as there were two large refunds in May. Ridership is
still short of the budget by 3.6%. Fare revenue is better with a 6.5%
increase above the budget year to date. He added staff expects fare
revenue to stabilize once the University of Colorado A Line has been online
for a few months.
The Board had no questions.

• SmartCard Project Update
Tonya Anderson, Manager of Electronic Fare Operations, indicated the
outcome of the security assessment may require an update to RTD’s
disaster recovery plan. She added that staff has completed all of the site
surveys for King Soopers in relation to the merchant retail point of sale and
staff is currently drafting a response to Albertsons/Safeway’s legal team
related to RTD’s terms and conditions.
Heather Copp noted the last time she and Tonya Anderson were in front of
the Board they spoke about the delay on going live with the web portal. She
added that staff was not comfortable and did not feel that the RTD
environment was secure enough for the public. Xerox provided part of the
security assessment but they did not provide a Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI) assessment. During review of the security
assessment there were medium and low priority items identified that were
remediated by Xerox. There were also additional items that needed to be
addressed that are currently being discussed. She added that in the
meantime, RTD has hired a third party assessor to complete an evaluation on
our behalf. She noted that the third party came on board on July 5th and
Packet Pg. 35

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Anderson remarked that RTD’s Legal Department should have all of
the pertinent information.

6.E

Heather Copp explained that she thinks the history of the project would help
the Board understand the delays better. She commented that the project
has been going on for a period of time, as it began in 2008. In 2013 staff
went live with phase 1 of the project which encompassed the ECO, NICO
and College Passes. The part of the project that has been delayed is the
part for the general public. She explained there were issues with the
renewals of the passes and staff wanted to get that ironed first. She added
that staff is optimistic about the web portal, but the security issues must be
addressed. She said after the third party assessment, staff will have a
baseline for moving forward for any additional upgrades or enhancements.
Committee Chair Menten reiterated that phase 1 went live in 2013 and it
works fine as there is no payment component. She noted that phase 2 is an
issue because of the payment portal for those that want to pay with a credit
card.
Heather Copp remarked that PCI compliance is the minimum compliance that
we can settle for which is what is required of the vendor.
Committee Chair Menten noted she is concerned with the term ‘minimum
level’ but understands that is the terminology for the industry.
Chair Tobiassen thanked staff for their cyber security efforts. He noted PCI
compliance is a high level standard and he is confident that the independent
audit will be beneficial for RTD.
Director Francone thanked staff for the update and asked for an estimated
date when the web portal will be available to the public. Heather Copp
explained that once the third party report is received in August, staff will
have a better estimate of when the program can go live. She stated staff
might have to mitigate issues, but hopefully they are simple. As of now,
staff is not comfortable with providing a date. She added that the pilot
program is still active and staff is collecting information as it comes in. She
noted the mobile ticketing option probably will not be available until next
year.
General Manager Genova added mobile ticketing is not part of this project
and is separate.
Director Anderson commented that she appreciates all of staff’s care with
their approach to the sensitivity of credit card numbers. She is happy that
staff wants to get the project completed correctly.
Packet Pg. 36

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

they will need six weeks to complete their evaluation. She commented that
once the evaluation is received, staff will have a better idea if any issues
remain and how to mitigate those to determine the new go live date.

6.E

Director Deadwyler asked if the results of the report would be provided to
the Board in August. Heather Copp remarked that staff would have to
review the report first, and since it is due in August she was not sure if that
allowed staff ample turnaround time before presenting the results to the
Board.
Committee Chair Menten noted she was concerned since it has taken so
long to build this system and asked if it would be an outdated system by the
time it goes live. Heather Copp said it would not. She said the web portal
will be current and it is a tool that anyone will be able to use. She added
that staff is trying to keep up with a variety of different tools that the public
will want to use to purchase their tickets.
Director Folska asked if a payback or return on investment was considered
before entering into the contract. She noted $28 million is a lot of money to
invest in a system for the public to buy tickets. Heather Copp indicted that
staff would find out that information and provide it to the Board.
Director Lasater said technology on the web is changing every 6-12 months.
He added it is extremely irritating that Xerox cannot do what his company
could have completed in half of the time. He added it is infuriating that the
web portal is still not complete, nor is it effective or secure.
Director Lubow asked if RTD has completed an analysis to determine
whether Xerox’s performance has been adequate under the contract.
Heather Copp explained that staff did a total review of the contract in
January. She added that staff has continual reviews and meetings with
Xerox related to what has been delivered.
Committee Chair Menten inquired as to how many other transit agencies are
working with Xerox, and if so, have any had issues comparable to ours.
Heather Copp noted the only example she has is Houston Metro, but staff
would need to research if they had any issues with Xerox.
Director Folska asked what staff’s findings were after the review of the
contract. Heather Copp indicated the contract is complicated. She
explained that staff went through the contract to show what we requested
that was not delivered and Xerox came back with items that staff asked for
Packet Pg. 37

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Deadwyler inquired about the third party assessing our system and
said that five and a half years ago the Board thought this project would be
up and running then. She asked how much stock staff is putting in the third
party vendor. Heather Copp indicated the severity of the report will affect
the timeline. She added that staff does not think there will be any major
issues to mitigate, but she could not give a definitive go live date.

6.E

that were not covered under the contract. She noted it is an ongoing
negotiation process and it is extremely complicated. She explained there are
a lot of disagreements as to what they think they have completed and what
staff thinks they have competed.

Director Solano asked if the issues are contractual or technical, and if they
are technical, are RTD’s in house engineers reviewing the information.
Heather Copp explained that the issues for the web portal delay are
technical. She stated RTD employees are not doing the code work as that is
proprietary to Xerox. She added that staff has been unable to review the
code as our staff does not have access to Xerox’s systems, so we must rely
on them to provide information to us.

• 2017-2022 SBP Update
Jannette Scarpino, Senior Manager of Budget and Financial Analysis,
indicated this is the second draft of the 2017-2022 Strategic Budget Plan
(SBP). She reminded the Board that the first draft had a funding gap of
$220 million over the six year period. She noted staff identified our
minimum and must have projects along with the fleet needs. She
commented that the fleet will be financed by a combination of Certificates of
Participation (COPs) and the Capital Acquisition Fund, and then staff will
accommodate the remaining project requests to the extent that funds
permit. She explained that a balanced SBP is when there is a positive
unrestricted year end fund balance over the six year period. She remarked
that the SBP includes service and projects funded from the Base System at
0.6% sales and use tax and operating activity from FasTracks Operations
funded by 0.4% sales and use tax. She commented that FasTracks future
expense and projects are included separately in the FasTracks Annual
Program Evaluation (APE) financial plan. She added when variables are
examined, uncontrollable and controllable factors must be reviewed:
Uncontrollable
 Sales/use tax revenue
 Fuel price volatility
 Inflation rate
 Nature/speed of economic growth
 Interest rates on debt
 Ridership
 Grant Revenue/Federal appropriations

Packet Pg. 38

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Folska asked to review staff’s internal analysis and findings.
Heather Copp indicated she would speak with RTD’s legal department but
she does not think they will want to release that at this time since the
contract is still being negotiated.

6.E

Jannette Scarpino noted that revenue assumptions include a 10% fare
increase in 2019 and 2022 per Board policy. Sales and Use Taxes include
the March 2016 forecasted data from CU Leeds School of Business will be
the baseline for future projections. She added expenditure assumptions
have diesel budgeted at $2.23 per gallon, and only the minimum/must have
projects for 2017-2018 and the fleet are included.
Jannette Scarpino indicated that the project requests initially totaled over
$770 million. The new minimum/must-have projects for 2017-2018 have
been significantly reduced to allow staff to build up the operating reserve
and create a new capital acquisition fund. She noted projects may be added
to the SBP if sales and use tax revenue improves to support the project
expenditures or if there are excess fund balances at year-end.
Director Folska commented that she heard recently that the Federal
Government expected the price of gas to go up $2.00 per barrel. Jannette
Scarpino indicated she did not hear that specifically but noted it is trending
up right now and added it is a volatile commodity that is influenced by global
events.
Director Lubow asked if capital expenditures included buses. She noted
there were several deferred items near and dear to her and asked staff to
speak with her offline about those items.
Director Francone noted some portion of the capital replacement fund would
be used to offset debt needs and asked for more details about that.
Jannette Scarpino explained that staff plans to grow the replacement fund
at a much more substantial rate than in years past. She added that staff
wants to grow the replacement fund and the unrestricted operating fund as
much as possible to provide a funding source should there be an economic
downturn or shortfall in revenue. She explained that RTD’s debt issuance is
the COP issuance and staff wants to lessen RTD’s dependence on debt
markets by combining some level of debt issuance with some use of our
capital replacement fund.
Director Francone asked for an explanation of what local government capital
requests are. Jannette Scarpino said it is not uncommon for RTD to partner
with local governments to complete work at their request. She added that

 Service levels
 Operating costs/expense projects
 Capital investment in projects
 Fund balance development

6.E

some of those projects RTD takes an ownership in, which is why it falls
under capital projects.

Director Sisk asked if staff was in a position to lock in a fuel rate today.
General Manager Genova indicated staff could, but they are watching the
markets on a daily basis and they think the best opportunity will be in the
fall.
Director Folska inquired if there was such a thing as good debt for transit
agencies. Jannette Scarpino explained that our debt has helped us grow,
which could be considered good debt.
Director Anderson thanked staff for including a line item for unrestricted
operating revenue. She noted that Denver’s economy has been successful
for quite a while, but she does not think it will last. She added that having a
cushion for when bad times come is a great idea so that RTD will not have
to cut service. She referenced the service cuts in 2011 and noted how
painful it was. She remarked if RTD has a good financial cushion, it can
always provide good service.

• 2017-2040 APE Timeline
Susan Cohen, Senior Manager of Finance and Electronic Content
Management, noted this is an overview of the Annual Program Evaluation
(APE). She explained that every year staff does a comprehensive annual
evaluation and in that process staff updates the project capital costs and
operating cost to reflect current conditions. Staff also updates revenue
conditions to current forecasts and updates the financial plan to reflect the
current circumstances. She added that next Tuesday is the Board of
Directors budget training and in two weeks, the Study Session. She further
added that August 2nd will be an overview of the project status, August 9th
will be the final presentation of the financial plan and August 16th will be the
request for adoption.
There were no questions from the Board.

• Quarterly Audit Update
Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop, Internal Audit Manager, indicated the two audit
reports were included in the Financial Administration and Audit packet. She
noted the two reports covered position changes and salary increases. She
commented that the first audit for salary increases reviewed opportunities to
Packet Pg. 40

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

Director Sisk remarked that it appears our fare revenue percentage is slipping
and noted it used to be close to 20-21% when looking at sources. Jannette
Scarpino explained that staff dialed back the fare revenue for the amended
budget because they felt that number was too optimistic. Heather Copp
added this is different than the fare box recovery ratio.

6.E

Director Francone asked what are the consequences of not following
through with suggestions and/or recommendations from the auditors. Ann
Marie Issac-Heslop indicated that the auditors perform their audits and make
recommendations. The auditors usually work with management on
suggested recommendations to bring RTD to a place where it can achieve
what it needs at a reasonable cost. She added management will respond to
recommendations by saying concur, partially concur or disagree. She noted
that before management responds, an auditor has sat down with them to
discuss the item. She indicated that her department follows up on their
recommendations, and management is usually in concurrence.
Director Folska asked that the Board be privy to the responses from
management. Ann Marie Isaac-Heslop indicated that the final reports can be
provided to the Board if they ask.
General Manager Genova stated that every time there is a recommendation
or subsequent management response there is an internal audit follow up.
Director Folska noted she wants to see every time staff has disagreed and
why. General Manager Genova stated he has yet to see an audit report
where staff disagreed with internal audits recommendations.
Director Anderson indicated she is looking forward to the General Manager’s
report on these two particular issues as they are very important to the
operation of this agency.

• Eagle P3 Financial Presentation
Heather Copp noted she was asked to provide the Board with a detailed
summary covering the Eagle P3 Project. She explained that the concession
agreement is a design, build, finance, operate and maintain agreement for 34
years. The 34 years include 5 years of design/build and 29 years of
maintenance and operation. She commented that RTD sets and retains the
fares, owns the assets, and pays the traction power and security costs. She
noted that RTD’s funding sources are sales tax bonds, TIFIA Loan, Full
Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA) and Sales and Use taxes (PayGo). Denver
Transit Partners (DTP) receives constructions payments from RTD as well as
Private Activity Bonds (PABS) and they have an equity commitment from
their stakeholders. She explained that all of those funds are used for
mobilization and design, construction costs, financing costs, DTP overhead,
interest payments on PABS and rolling stock.
Heather Copp stated the operation phase is beginning and to pay for that
there are fares, grants and taxes. DTP has TABOR payments and service
Packet Pg. 41

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

change positions by adding responsibilities or elevating the position and
making changes accordingly. The second audit covered general salary
increases within RTD.

6.E

Director Solano inquired if the recent legal success for the amendment
affects funding. Jenifer Ross-Amato, Acting Associate General Counsel,
explained that is a different issue that relates to RTD’s sales and use tax.
She commented that it was with the Court of Appeals and RTD has not
heard if it will be appealed to the Colorado Supreme Court. At this point
RTD is the party that prevailed, but the case can be appealed up one more
level and she added that there are complicated legal issues at play.
Director Lubow asked if staff could address how the University of Colorado
A line performance issues are reflected in the payment to DTP. General
Manager Genova explained that every month staff validates the invoice
information from DTP and discerns if there were any other issues that would
affect the monthly payment. He indicated that there have been some
disputes and until resolved, they are not part of the payment. Heather Copp
indicated that there are two places where those line items show up and they
are listed as availability and performance deductions. She added that she
cannot provide exact amounts at this time. Director Lubow said that she is
personally interested to see how effective the adjustment factor really is and
asked staff to provide her with additional details. Director Francone
commented that she thinks Director Lubow is trying to find out if DTP has
received a full check or has RTD withheld any funds. Heather Copp
explained there were deductions but she does not have the exact amounts
on hand.
Director Sisk commented that without DTP, RTD does not have the three
commuter rail lines. He added there are certain assumptions of risk but RTD
has to work though it as a partnership. He further added that RTD made
good debt when it entered into the agreement with DTP. He remarked that
we should look at the project in its entirety to see how it has evolved. RTD
has a long working relationship with DTP and it should not view it in an
isolated way.
Chair Tobiassen indicated that when he was elected to the Board they were
discussing going through the process of reviewing bids from three vendors
for this project. He added that it became a major driver for employment in
Packet Pg. 42

ability payments. She explained that the payments will not begin until
2017. Under the concession agreement, DTP received lump sum payments
from 2011-2017. For 2017-2044 DTP will receive annual TABOR payments
that are fixed and not subject to inflation. She noted that currently, DTP
receives a monthly service availability payment from RTD to cover operation
and maintenance costs. She explained that the availability payment is
adjusted by the availability factor and the availability ratio. She added that
the calculations require a lot of people to review to ensure that the numbers
are correct and it will become more complicated once the additional lines are
opened.

the region and RTD and DTP built an infrastructure project that we could not
have afforded at any other time. He commented that RTD will need to work
with DTP to solve technical issues from time to time but we cannot throw
them under the bus when things do not work well.

Director Solano said he heard that Philadelphia was having issues with their
Hyundai-Rotem commuter rail cars and asked if RTD had the same type of
vehicle. General Manager Genova explained that RTD’s rail cars are similar
but not the same. He noted that they are examined daily and RTD is not
having the same issues that Philadelphia is having. He added that commuter
rail cars are not built on an assembly line like automobile cars; they are built
as they are ordered.
Director Anderson stated that DTP took all of the risk when it partnered with
RTD. She added that she appreciates all of the people who have worked
hard to get this done, including the Board members from 2008-2010 who
signed the papers. She noted that RTD is the envy of the nation because of
this project and thanked everyone for the good job they have done.

D. Other Matters
Director Bagley shared that he and 5 other members of the Board attended the
Mayor’s State of the City address at DIA. He encouraged those that did not attend
to read the article in the Denver Post. He added that the Board should take a tour
of the parcels around Union Station to see what economic developments are
occurring.

B. Recommended Actions

• Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that
the Board of Directors approve the RTD Service Standards as revised July
2016, thereby adopting the updated policies and standards as included in
Attachment B.
Motion:

Director Sisk made the motion to move this item
to the full Board at the July 19, 2016 Board
Meeting.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Discussion:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations,
reminded the Board that staff presented the revised Transit
Service Policies and Standards at the last Operations and
Customer Service Committee Meeting. He reiterated that
while Service Standards have been in place for a number of
years, this action is to formalize the process through the
Transit Service Policies and Standards document. He
indicated the changes had been sent to RTD’s various
stakeholders and discussed with any interested parties.
Bruce Abel noted that Committee Vice-Chair Walker did reach
out to him to ask for clarification on item 2.4.4 – SeniorRide
and Senior Shopper. The language reads: “A minimum of 10

Director Hoy was absent. Director Bagley left before the meeting began and Director
Anderson participated via phone.

6.F

Director Deadwyler expressed concern about this language.
She asked staff if there was a way to make it clearer because
interpretations can change as time goes on. Bruce Abel said if
it was agreeable to the Board, staff would work on clarifying
this item prior to the Board Meeting on July 19. The Board
unanimously supported the suggestion.
Director Francone asked for confirmation that discussions
about the changes to the Transit Service Policies and
Standards document had taken place with Jefferson County.
Jeff Becker, Senior Manager of Service Development,
explained that the document had been sent to Jefferson
County but they did not attend any meetings or provide any
feedback.
Director Francone asked if there were any significant changes
to section 12 that outlines the Service Change process or if
this is just articulating what already occurs. Bruce Abel stated
it is just putting into writing what has been the practice for
quite some time.
Director Francone asked if she was correct that a minimum
warrant could be considered demand as it related to the
criteria for shelters. Bruce Abel explained a good way to look
at it is determining at what point a shelter is warranted. He
said that is where the term comes from.
Committee Chair Anderson thanked staff for revising the
Transit Service Policies and Standards as having an updated
policy helps RTD better work with our communities as our
service continues to evolve.
Director Folska inquired as to the minimum warrant required
for a shelter to be installed. Jeff Becker stated it was 40
boardings per day at a stop. He said there could be other
factors taken into consideration such as if the stop was in
front of an assisted living community. Bruce Abel stressed
that this is guidance for staff but not the final determination.
Packet Pg. 46

Minutes Acceptance: Minutes of Jul 12, 2016 5:30 PM (Committee Reports)

passengers per trip is required. Scheduled events that do not
generate reservations of at least 2 groups of 10 may not be
rescheduled for the next 12 months.” Bruce Abel explained
the intent behind this language was that it be provided as
guidance rather than prescriptive. The intent is that staff
cannot schedule trips but may elect to do so depending on
circumstances.

6.F

He stated the budget would always be the final guidance;
however, staff can still be creative in coming up with solutions
to best serve the community.

Committee Vice-Chair Walker declared the motion PASSED unanimously.

C. Updates

• Proposed Fall 2016 Service Change
Bruce Abel commented that service changes usually take place three times a
year but due to the openings this fall the service changes are not necessarily
sticking to the normal schedule. He said the most notable service change
would be the opening of the G Line and all the associated new bus feeder
service. He indicated there was no date out yet as staff continues to work
with Denver Transit Partners. This is the service change information staff
will be taking out to the public for comment over the next few months. He
reminded the Board that the G Line service plan was approved some months
ago. This just outlines the additional changes that will take place as part of
that runboard.
Jessie Carter, Manager of Service Planning and Scheduling, shared that the
proposal contains mainly system maintenance and small incremental
increases in service outside of the recommendations for the G Line. He
pointed out that this proposal included the grant funded Route 62 again,
which was previously postponed due to roadway construction issues. He
explained it was brought back into this proposal with changed language to
note that the route would be implemented once the roadway was complete.
Director Francone thanked staff for the changes to the 15 and 15L as well
as the C Line. She said having earlier service on the C Line will be a huge
help in allowing her constituents to catch early morning flights. She
complemented the entire service planning and light/commuter rail teams.
She shared she has ridden from her home in Littleton to DIA several times
and it has been nothing but a success. She has heard nothing but good
things from her constituents.
Director Sisk thanked staff for the additional Flatiron Flyer service that was
being added as part of the proposal. He thinks they have shown a great
reaction in terms of listening to the constituents.

6.F

Committee Vice-Chair Walker agreed with Director Francone that the earlier
C Line service will really help his constituents catch their early morning
flights.

Bruce Abel shared that in late May staff met with the Mayor of Lafayette
and Boulder County Commissioners regarding a grant application they were
submitting to support a fare buy up demonstration for all riders that board at
the Lafayette Park-n-Ride for a period of two months. He said the goal of
the demonstration was to evaluate the induced demand that would result
from free fares. In June, Lafayette and Boulder County were advised that
the grant application was approved for 2017 funding during the high ozone
days. Bruce Abel stated since those discussions Lafayette and Boulder
County have approached RTD about beginning the demonstration the Fall of
2016 but staff is reluctant given the number of things already happening.
He said staff would continue to have conversations with Lafayette and
Boulder County.
Director Menten asked if this meant fare would only be free on a day when a
high ozone alert had been issued. Bruce Abel explained the grant was
submitted for use during the spring/summer high ozone period. The fare
would be free for a full two month demonstration period.
Director Lubow stated she supports the fare buy-up on the part of Lafayette
and Boulder County just as she supports the Longmont fare buy-up program.
She thinks increased transit use is wonderful, especially if it does not
negatively impact RTD.
Chair Tobiassen wondered what would happen if everyone from Boulder
County decided to go to Lafayette to take the bus down to Denver Union
Station. Bruce Abel explained something like a fare buy-up would require an
Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) that addresses such things as who pays
for increased demand, is there adequate rolling stock, etc. He said all of
those things would still need to be addressed with Lafayette and Boulder
County in an IGA.
Director Sisk said that he too was supportive of this idea. He thinks it is an
exellent opportunity to increase ridership while having Boulder County and
Lafayette pay not just for current fare box revenue but actual ridership.
Director Folska agrees this is an excellent idea. It does not just cover the
Route L but the Hop, Skip, Jump and everything in between.

 "Meet in the Streets" Update (no back up)

Director Folska asked staff to make sure that the cost of marketing,
activation activities, etc. compared to actual sales and use tax revenue is
taken into consideration as staff completes their analysis of the events. She
also wonders what long-term obligations RTD would have to continue to
repave the mall if the 16th Street Mall Shuttles were permanently relocated.
Bruce Abel stated the impact on sales and use tax revenue during the
activation events will be part of the evaluation criteria. He said he is not
sure how the long-term maintenance of the mall might look in the future but
moving the Shuttles could have an impact on those conversations.
Director Menten asked if there has been a substantial increase in the number
of tickets or arrests that have been made on the Mall since increased
enforcement has begun. General Manager Genova shared that in his own
personal experiences the appearance and activities have improved from his
perspective. He said that specific numbers would need to be requested from
the Denver Police Department.

 University of Colorado A-Line Update (no back up)
Terry Emmons, Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, shared that
after the July 4th Holiday weekend average weekday ridership is at 17,300,
which is very successful for the start of a new corridor. He said on-time
performance for Week 11 saw good improvements at 92%. He recognized
this is not quite the level expected but it is moving in the right direction.
Overall on-time performance is still hovering just under 90%.
Terry Emmons commented that his team was just informed that DTP
successfully completed testing of the wireless crossing improvements on
non-revenue trains so they will begin upgrading the software in the revenue
trains. He said this should lead to significant improvement on the warning
times for the at-grade crossings.
General Manager Genova recognized Aaron Epstein, Ann Herzenberg and
Nadia Garas from Denver Transit Partners (DTP) who were all in attendance
this evening.
Director Folska shared that she loved the University of Colorado A Line train.
She said it is like the party train as people riding are just so fun and lively.
She stated she seems to make new friends every time she gets on. Director
Folska recognized the snafus that have occurred were bad but when putting
them into comparison with how frequently the train runs with no issues she

thinks DTP and RTD are doing a wonderful job. She cannot wait for the B
and G Lines to come online.

Director Deadwyler noted the University of Colorado A Line runs through her
District and initially she was bombarded with complaints; however, she
continued to encourage people to use the service and now they love it. She
said she does still hear complaints that the train is making people late to
work so she hopes the on-time performance can improve to above 90%
soon.
Director Solano commented that on the trip referenced by Director Francone
the conductor was not announcing the stops as the train left DIA. He asked
staff to look into this as it can be a detriment to our visually impaired riders.
Chair Tobiassen shared that he asked General Manager Genova to have staff
put together a technical briefing on how the system works for the University
of Colorado A Line to cover things like Positive Train Control. He said he
would be working with staff to get a time on the schedule to cover this for
any Director that would be interested.
General Manager Genova indicated he wanted to recognize a group that is
not talked about much and that is the University of Colorado A Line Security
Officers. He noted they are providing more than just security as they are
also the second crew member as required by the Federal Railroad
Administration. He stated they have been working very hard and are really
great ambassadors for our service. He shared he often receives
compliments about their courtesy and ability to answer questions.
Committee Vice-Chair Walker said he also receives a lot of compliments for
the Security Officers.

D. Other Matters
Director Anderson noted this has been not only a particularly bad week for police
officers but for transit security officers (TSOs) as well. She asked staff to extend
RTD’s condolences to the Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) Association for the loss
of their transit security officer. She also wants to make sure RTD’s TSO’s know
how much the Board appreciates the protection they provide. General Manager

Director Francone agreed with Director Folska. She commented that
recently she rode the University of Colorado A Line with Directors Archuleta
and Solano and it is true that you do make new friends. She said it has a
different vibe than the light rail services. She thanked Terry Emmons for his
quick response in making repairs to a damaged sign at the Mineral Station.
She asked if staff could provide a week-to-week overview of the ridership
and on-time performance as it is very helpful for her when she receives
questions out in the community.

6.F

Genova shared that he had reached out to the DART General Manager as well as
their Transit Police Chief. He said an account had been set up for the officers
family where people could make contributions if they are so inclined. He said RTD
would be following up with something else as well to let them know we continue
to think about them as an entire agency.

Director Menten asked for a refresher as to how we were alerting riders with
strollers that they needed to be collapsed prior to boarding. Bruce Abel explained
that on the bus side passengers are notified via an automatic stop announcement
prior to boarding that their strollers much be collapsed. He said this is a result of
the settlement agreement that was reach with the Colorado Cross Disability
Coalition. He noted one continual area that needs to be balanced is if an individual
boards with an unfolded stroller but has a disability or the child has a disability.
That is an exception to the rule. Terry Emmons explained that if someone is in the
reserved area with a stroller and a wheelchair needs to board the operator is
instructed to ask the passenger to move or collapse the stroller; however, not all
passengers comply. Director Menten indicated she was hearing this was an issue
on the W Line and asked to speak with Terry Emmons offline.
Committee Vice-Chair Walker expressed his gratitude for the people on the front
line, the operators and TSOs. He said they do a fantastic job of interacting with
the customers and keeping the peace. He asked staff to pass along his thanks.

C. Updates

• Civil Rights Committee Updates
RTD Triennial DBE Goal and Methodology
Zamy Silva, Senior Manager of Civil Rights, shared that her team had been
going through the Triennial DBE Goal evaluation. There was a public
announcement of the proposed goal on Thursday, June 9, with Chair
Tobiassen and General Manager Genova in attendance. The overall DBE
Goal of 24% was submitted to the FTA for approval with comments from
the public due by August 1st. She said in addition to the public
announcement, staff has also been conducting a Community Engagement
Consultation Series with our various chambers that represent the DBE/SBE
community.
Director Menten asked how the public could submit comments. Zamy Silva
indicated the proposed goal was published on the Civil Rights page of the
RTD website where comments could be submitted. She said comments
could also be submitted directly to the FTA as well.
Director Francone asked if the chambers that staff met with only
represented the Denver area or if they served the entire District. Zamy Silva
stated the chambers served DBE/SBEs that were throughout the entire RTD
District. She noted it is a federal requirement to meet with these companies
one-on-one if RTD plans to have a project within their area.
National ADA Symposium
Ed Neuberg, ADA Manager, reminded the Board that this year RTD was a
major sponsor for the ADA Symposium. He said this event has been taking
place for 15 years but this is the first time a transit agency has been a

6.G

Director Folska requested that Mr. Neuberg remember to introduce himself
each time he presented to the Board so those that cannot see him will know
who is speaking.
Chair Tobiassen congratulated staff on the Symposium. He said he did not
get to attend all of it but what he did was really outstanding. Chair
Tobiassen shared that the head of the Great Plains ADA Center, which runs
the Symposium, told him that RTD really set the new standard for the
Symposium in the future. He reiterated that all he heard from the attendees
was praise for the efforts from the RTD staff.
Committee Chair Deadwyler shared that she too attended the Symposium.
She thought it was a great event and was amazed at how much she learned.
She said she was surprised to learn that the Symposium was actually geared
toward ADA consultants and how they can help make life better for those
with disabilities. She noted she met one woman who worked with a prison
in Washington, D.C. and it was very interesting to learn about the
accommodations made for prisoners with disabilities.

D. Other Matters
Director Folska noted that last time Ed Neuberg presented to the Board she asked
him for a history of ADA in Denver. She thinks with this being an election year it
will be very important to have for any new Board members as part of the
onboarding training. She thinks it will be important for ADA to be integrated
throughout the entire training process.
Director Folska shared that she would love to see an initiative from the ADA office
to address how to change attitudes and beliefs about people with disabilities.
Zamy Silva stated staff is working on a number of ADA initiatives but they are all in
the development stages.

sponsor. He shared that this was a well attended event with over 800
attendees representing all 50 states and even some international attendees.
He thanked General Manager Genova, Scott Reed, Assistant General
Manager of Communications, and Steve Reilly, Manager of Marketing
Communications, for their efforts in securing guest passes for all attendees.
The guest passes were a huge hit. He said every time someone found out
he was with RTD they thanked him for the pass. The attendees really
thought it was great that a transit agency was so supportive of the
Symposium. He thanked everyone for their support as he believes it shows
the magnitude of support at RTD for the disabled community.

The additional question that had been asked was what the cost would be to move staff
from Civic Center. Director Deadwyler asked what the issue was at the committee
meeting regarding this item. Dave answered the overall cost of the prime leased space
in the Civic Center building and the thought that there might be the opportunity to save
money by relocating to less expensive space already owned by RTD. Dave spoke to the
market research that had been completed over the last few years in looking to renovate,
add space or relocate as part of the renovation of Market Street and the current 1600
Blake location. The size of space needed coupled with the cost on moving made this
choice cost prohibitive and with several FasTracks projects still to complete the decision
was made to pass on the project. Dave went on to say some research had been done in
the Aurora market and the pricing in many cases was the same with the added challenge
of finding a space that was large enough. Taking all the information into consideration,
the square foot pricing negotiated by Susan Altes was a great price.
Director Solano asked if the Telephone Information Center (TIC) would be moving to Civic
Center. Dave Genova stated that RTD owns a building close to the Ball Park called the
711 Building and that space was being considered for the relocation since that group
would be growing.
Director Deadwyler asked if the parking lot at 1600 Blake would be going away and if the
Board Meeting facility would be moving. GM Genova said the same amount of spaces
would be available in the underground parking lot of the new renovation once construction
was completed and that there were no plans to move the Board meeting space. Chair
Tobiassen noted that while the construction was being completed the parking would be
displaced. Dave Genova said he did not know what that looked like at this time.
Dave Genova went on to speak about the questions asked regarding agenda item C,
Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza Transfer Center. Director Francone asked
how the price grew to such a large dollar amount from a relief station to improvements to
a Transfer Station. GM Genova outlined the capital improvement that would be required
to complete the Transfer Station such as extending the infrastructure to bring the Transfer
Station closer to the pedestrian bridge and allow for 2 additional busses. The added
improvement would require the easements being requested in this Board action. GM
Genova asked if it would help in the decision making process if he provided a complete
listing of expenses. It was decided that would be added to the packet and sent to the
Directors via e-mail.

510, 605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099, and the questions that were asked in the
committee meeting. GM Genova gave an overview of the staffing housed at Civic
Center as follows: 280 staff members of which 35% or 62 people are contractors
mostly in the Access-a-Ride call center. IT and Engineering were also housed in Civic
Center and 10% of the FasTracks team.

Director Francone asked about signage because she has not seen any when she was
looking at the stop, and would like to see this remediated. Director Francone described
the layout of the current stop and transfer center. Director Solano asked if this was just
for the easements needed to proceed. Chair Tobiassen confirmed that this action needed
to be completed before staff could move forward in building the full structure. GM
Genova said staff would need to come back with the project plan once the land was
obtained and improvements were complete.
Chair Tobiassen asked if there was parking at the proposed transfer center. GM Genova
stated there were no plans to add parking additional but there was currently parking for
200 at that location.
Director Deadwyler asked about the Approval of General Manager’s 2017 Goals and the
results of the Survey Monkey that had just been completed. Barbara McManus explained
the item the Board would be approving is the 2017 Goals and the Survey Monkey results
just completed was for the 2016 Evaluation of the General Manager. Once the 2017 Goals
were approved the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee
would continue the 2016 GM evaluation by distributing the June survey results as a baseline
for 2016. Director Deadwyler thanked Barbara McManus for the clarification
Director Solano asked about item A, Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards, and
the change to the verbiage that was requested in committee. Barbara McManus pointed the
committee to the highlighted portion of page 21 in the Executive Committee Agenda Packet
that reflects the requested changes. After review of the revision the Chair asked for a
motion to move the Board Meeting Agenda forward.
Motion:

Director Paul Solano made the motion to
approve moving the July 19th Board
agenda to the full Board.
Director Deadwyler seconded the motion.

Chair called for the question and the agenda was approved unanimously.

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute
all documents necessary to amend and extend the lease agreements by and
between the Regional Transportation District and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC,
formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center

Chair Tobiassen asked about the investment needed for this project. Nate Currey stated
that the hardware investment would be less than $1000, which would include back up
equipment as well. Director Francone asked what staff time would be required in
implementing this process. Nate Currey said there is usually someone from the
communication team is in attendance but that would need to be looked at once the
decision was made to move forward. Nate added there was a transcription component as
well that could help the Board Office with the minutes.
GM Genova asked about the archiving and the retention process. Barbara McManus noted
this would have to be reviewed with legal and described what was being looked at in
terms of archiving on the network. Barbara went on to say that the Board Office would be
working with the Accela software team to look at placing a link on the meeting portal to
access the video. She said if this was added to the current process there are no issues
but RTD’s status and legal obligations would need to be reviewed if the process changed.
Chair Tobiassen asked for consensus to move forward with a pilot starting with the
committee meetings in August and as well as at the Board meeting to verify the equipment
works during public participation. A majority of head nods confirmed the pilot would move
forward. Director Solano asked if all the Directors would be notified that they would be
recorded in advance. Chair Tobiassen said all would be notified.
Chair Tobiassen thanked Nate Currey and Libby Winter for their time and efforts and said
he looked forward to the pilot results.

IV.

Other Matters
GM Dave Genova gave an overview of the Employee Recognition Events that would take
place starting the end of July and continue through the beginning of August. Dave
outlined that Senior Leadership would host events at each of the divisions and a barbeque
would be held at 1600 Blake for staff housed at Blake and Civic Center. Dave stated the
events were listed on the Two Week Calendar and that all the Directors were encouraged
to attend.

streaming and video recording for the Board and committee meetings. Nate introduced his
assistant, Libby Winter, a Public Information Specialist on the north metro team. Nate
demonstrated the 360 aspect of the recording and passed around his phone for the
committee to see how it would work. Libby explained that the videos would be uploaded
to the RTD YouTube site after editing and annotations were completed. Chair Tobiassen
suggested a pilot program so the committee and Board could review prior to full
implementation.

GM Genova gave an overview of the July 25th opening of the B Line and events
surrounding the opening. Dave indicated all the teams were working hard to make this
happen and he hoped to see all the Directors at the Gala next Sunday the 24th.

Director Solano asked if the Active Walking events on the 16th Street Mall Meet could be
scheduled more towards the evening. GM Genova said these events were set up by the
City and County of Denver and that RTD had no control over the scheduling.
Chair Tobiassen initiated a discussion around the “Meet in the Streets” events and
mentioned he and his wife Carol went the last one. He said it reminded him more of a
carnival setting and noted many of the events do not go through the evening and seemed
to be broken down by about 7:00PM.

Retiree Awards
Chair Tobiassen noted there were seven retirees this month with four in attendance.
General Manager Genova stated that the retirees covered several different departments in
RTD and asked the various Assistant General Manager’s to come forward to present their
retiree to the Board.
Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, recognized Casandra Santos
for her 28 years of service. He noted that Communications is sad to see her leave, but
happy that she can move on to the next stage in her life. He commented that it has been
a pleasure working with Casandra and she has done a remarkable job over the years.
Will Adams, Senior Manager of Customer Care, explained that on his third day at RTD in
2013, he met Casandra. At their first meeting, the first word out of her mouth was that
her name was spelled with only one S. She was a pleasure to work with and together
they made a lot of great changes. He congratulated her and indicated that she will be
greatly missed.
Casandra Santos indicated that she started when the Alameda facility was open and she
was one of the first employees at District Shops. She claimed that this was the shortest
28 years that she has ever seen.
Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, celebrated Brenda Tierney for her
29 years of service with RTD. He added that Public Information is her forte, but that was
not her only accomplishment. Brenda assisted with the Central Rail Line, she spend five
years managing the Board Office and was always ready to stretch the limits to ensure our
ridership was well served. He noted that after her time at RTD, Brenda will begin working
at CIS Communications to assist CDOT.

Scott Reed remarked that Brenda was a hybrid employee because she was part of both the
Planning and Public Information teams. She was always her own manager, which was the
best thing that could have happened as she was a rare person who could handle any
situation. She has always done things her own way and has been extremely successful.
Brenda will be greatly missed.
Brenda Tierney stated that she was touched by Bill’s and Scott’s words. She indicated it
was an honor and privilege to have RTD as a part of her life for almost 30 years. She
thanked everyone and noted that everyone would be missed.
Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager of Bus Operations, commended Philip Zike for his
36 years of service at RTD. He noted that Philip has been married for 40 years and has
one daughter and one granddaughter. Rumor has it that Philip will be enjoying golfing,
camping and drag racing during his retirement. Bruce said all of Philip’s years of service
are greatly appreciated.
Philip Zike remarked that he was very lucky to work at RTD for as long as he did. He
added that if he had the opportunity to do it again, he would do it all the same way.
Bruce Abel stated that Marie Washington, another long time stalwart, was retiring after 33
years of service. He noted that in her long RTD career, Marie was a bus operator, street
supervisor, light rail operator and a transportation manager. He shared that after her
retirement, she plans to spend time with her family, travelling and focusing on her
volunteer work. He added that Marie has been a big part of the RTD family and she will
be greatly missed.
Marie Washington thanked everyone and said it was an honor and a privilege to work for
the District for 33 years. She added that every day she worked with remarkable people.
She thanked everyone for the opportunity and sent out her blessings to the Board and
staff.
General Manager Genova noted that the other retirees were not able to attend the Board
meeting to receive their plaques. He stated that their commitment to RTD was great and
they will be missed.
Chair Tobiassen acknowledged Susan Beiker, Property Accountant with 38 years of
services, Helen Casillas, Senior Materials Management Specialist with 38 years of service,
and Gail Nadius, Bus Operator with 30 years of service, who were unable to attend this
evening. He pointed out that the number of years of service for all of this month’s retirees
was stunning. He appreciates all they have done for RTD.

Public Participation
Chair Tobiassen stated public participation was open to anyone that wanted to address the
Board. He reminded the audience that each speaker is allowed three minutes.
 Doug Gragg, Denver, shared that he had two topics to discuss with the Board. First
was that he found a new hobby and he would be attending the Denver City Council
meetings as their meetings are much more exciting than RTD Board Meetings.
Second, he noted that the University of Colorado A Line had a pronounced noncompliance enforcement behavior. He indicated that if you appear to be a local and
have not validated your ticket, a fare enforcement officer will make you get off the
train at the next stop. However, if you appear to be a visitor, the fare enforcement
officer will only give a warning. He stated there should be uniform treatment for
everybody.
 Trupti Suthour, Denver, explained that one of the reasons she moved to the
Sunnyside neighborhood was for the commuter rail stop. She shared that she
recently learned the B Line was not going to stop at the 41st and Fox Station,
which was news to her and to others in her community. She indicated she is
encouraging her community and local businesses to email the Board about this
stop. She noted that Sunnyside is undergoing a transformation and they want it to
be a destination. She asked that the Board reconsider having the B Line stop there.
 Alex Ryan, Northglenn, explained that he works for EnerBurn and they can save
RTD 8-15% in fuel costs by incorporating an additive to the diesel fuel mix. He
noted that other transit agencies, such as Houston Metro, are currently using this
service and have seen significant savings with their fuel costs. He asked to meet
with someone from the RTD staff to discuss his company further.

Old Business
No old business was discussed.

XVI. New Business
Director Archuleta noted he has been receiving a lot of emails concerning the B Line and
the fact that it does not stop at the 41st and Fox station. He asked staff for more
information.
General Manager Genova explained that the B Line is not part of the federally funded
project like the G Line and the University of Colorado A Line are. He added that the
construction of the 41st and Fox station, as well as the Pecos Junction station, were under
the G Line construction project. For the B Line opening, those two stations will be fenced
off and closed to the public. He added that in the 2010 operating plan, the B Line was not
going to stop at those stations; but staff is evaluating that plan now and if a change
occurs it will require a change order to the concessionaire agreement.
Director Archuleta indicted that Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning,
had shared the results of a B Line ridership study with the Board and asked for additional
details of those results. Bill Van Meter explained that the study Director Archuleta
referenced examined the initial ridership demand for the B Line. The study identified the
need for the B Line to stop at those two intermediary stops when the B Line is extended
north to Longmont.
Director Bagley shared that he attended the BisNow event on the 22nd concerning real
estate issues in downtown Denver. He added that light rail and commuter rail traffic was
mentioned as being very important for high density, multi-family residential development
Director Francone shared that she attended Accelerate Colorado. She explained she went
because it is a different type of conference in comparison to the APTA Legislative. The
Accelerate Conference has about 100 Colorado executives, government members, etc.

and this assembly has one voice that is influential in a way that APTA is not. This group
draws from different segments of the Colorado economy and those differences present a
stronger voice to legislatures. She added that she was able to meet with Jefferson
County Commissioner Rosier as well as the management group in charge of the Gaylord of
The Rockies. She indicated that in order to maintain and build upon these relationships,
face to face meetings are crucial.
Director Sisk thanked RTD and the Board for what has been done for the University of
Colorado A Line. He indicated that the transition at DIA is fantastic, but noted that
queuing is an issue and suggested that ropes be installed to make sure people who were
waiting first are not pushed out of the way.
Director James thanked Director Lubow for sharing an article about the initiatives by
Alphabet, owned by Google. The article discussed the transformation of mobility and he
reiterated his concern that RTD needs to leave, follow or get out of the way for new
technology like this.
Director Bagley thanked Director Francone for her Accelerate Colorado update. He added
that he is receiving positive responses for the University of Colorado A Line, but noted that
the overhead luggage racks do not work very well. He further added that the signs list the
airport as Denver Airport instead of Denver International Airport and asked that staff look
at updating the signs so as not to confuse travelers.
Director Deadwyler noted that she too has received positive comments for the University
of Colorado A Line. She also thanked Barbara McManus, Acting Executive Director for the
Board Office, and Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager of Communications, for
organizing the Juneteenth festivities. She commented that staff rarely hears the
acclamations that they should receive.
Chair Tobiassen thanked Director Deadwyler and Director Folska for attending the R Line
open house. He added that he would prepare his trip report for Accelerate Colorado as he
has done in the past and provide it to the other Directors.

&

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the RTD Service Standards as revised July 2016, thereby adopting the updated policies and
standards as included in Attachment B.
BACKGROUND
RTD has had service standards in place since 1987, which have provided a rational, equitable and
sustainable approach to developing and evaluating all its services for the benefit of the District’s
constituents as a whole. The last revision was adopted in 2002 and in 2008 RTD commissioned our
Service Development consultant to provide a thorough review of our standards in relation to transit
industry peers.
DISCUSSION
Many changes have occurred in our industry as well as to RTD needs since 2002. The acquisition of
automatic vehicle location and passenger counting has provided a profusion of valuable data for
improved analytics and reporting, such as better measurements for on-time performance and crowding.
Our Geographic Information System is used to illustrate service classification and the effects of service
changes on Access-a-Ride customers. Consideration of FTA regulations for Tile VI and Environmental
Justice are now expressly incorporated into the Standards. To address the diverse needs of the RTD
constituencies, RTD has developed guidelines regarding shuttles and circulators as well as a cost sharing
policy. In addition, recommendations have been incorporated into the revised standards for: the service
classification system; new service warrants; service design and performance standards; demandresponsive transit; and standards for transit-dependent riders.
These and other revisions developed since 2002 were vetted with extensive involvement of RTD Service
Development, Engineering and Planning Technical Services staff. In 2015 RTD invited review and
comment from our stakeholders and held several meetings with all those representatives who were
interested (about a dozen). As a result a number of revisions were incorporated into the document,
although some that require much more extensive analysis were postponed for future consideration.
Attachment A provides highlights of the revisions.
FINANCIAL IMPACTS
No direct financial impacts are incurred with the adoption of this update to current policy. Financial
impacts will be determined by the actual application of these standards.

Highlights of Revisions to the Transit Service Policies & Standards
The following follows the Table of Contents of the document.
1. Introduction
Due to the implementation of FasTracks and resulting service restructuring, the routes
in the Express, Regional and SkyRide service classes are reassigned into either the
Regional class or the Local CBD class based on the length of the non-stop portion of
the route. Also the Urban classification is now specifically defined as having 35% or
more of route length within a ¼ mile buffer with population+employment density of
12 per acre or greater; and Suburban class with 34% or less.
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
Rail and Enhanced Bus (BRT) minimums were added to the table of minimum
frequencies.
2.3.3 Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard
From the latest customer and industry research, RTD now defines the amount of
crowding on a route as the percent of total trips during a defined time period that
exceed the comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3 square feet per standee (level-ofservice D and E).
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
A new section was added summarizing US DOT requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit for individuals who cannot readily access the RTD bus and rail system.
2.5 Reliability
A new section was added defining on-time for fixed-route service as not more than 1
minute early to not more than 5 minutes late.
3.3 Roadway Design Goal
This now references the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities document, Transit
Access section.
4. Shelters
A new section was added defining the minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter
as 40 boardings per day at a stop.
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Call-n-Ride is included as an appropriate service for areas with 3 - 12
population+employment per acre.
5.2.2 Maximum Target Service levels
This section was deleted as not needed.
5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage
A new section was added summarizing the FTA requirements for ADA complementary
paratransit services.
6. Transit Access
A new section was added referencing the Engineering staff’s Bus Transit Facilities
document, Transit Access section.
7.2 Standards for Events
The paragraph that “RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance
projections if the promoter is willing to subsidize such service” is deleted. This is
charter service and not permitted by FTA.
8. Shuttles & Circulators

Packet Pg. 80

Attachment: Atch A - Highlights of Revisions to Transit Service Policies & Standards (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

11.A.a

A new section was added that provides guidelines and requirements to stakeholders in
local communities who would like to develop such services. It addresses such
characteristics as population density, major activity centers, transit friendly
environment, minimum service levels and fares.
10. Title VI Compliance
A new section was added that RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI
Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter
4.4.
12. Service Change Process
A new section was added describing the typical runboard process for analyzing,
proposing and implementing service changes.
13. Cost Sharing Policy
A new section was added detailing this policy that facilitates partnerships with RTD to
demonstrate new or expanded services using funds obtained from grants and
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments. The
guidance outlines financial feasibility, vehicle availability, local government and
community support and performance requirements.

1. Introduction

RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

1.1 Overview

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.b

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 55, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Revised July 14, 2016

Packet Pg. 86

Attachment: Atch B - Service Standards Final (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.b

New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.

To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures
The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 99,
and may be revised if necessary.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure combines fare revenue and total cost impacts to
produce a measure that comprehensively reflects the District’s allocation of resources. The
effectiveness-productivity chart, Error! Reference source not found., presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and
productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis.
The chart offers a
convenient comparative analysis of all
classes of services, illustrating both
absolute and relative performance. When
standards and guidelines are applied,
judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and
Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum
Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
frequencies specified below. Existing
services that cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum
passengers per hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as
candidates for service changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available
resources. These service changes may include providing service with longer headways if
no other viable alternative exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service
changes and/or promotional efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and
annual calculated standards. Routes providing frequencies higher than the policy minimum
must be justified by ridership demand as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
The following table indicates the minimum frequency standard for types of service and
time of day by corridor (multiple routes sharing a segment).

Table 1 Minimum Service Frequency

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Regional, and SkyRide routes, the standard
is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.
2.3.2.1

Performance Standards

These measures and the effectiveness-productivity for all routes and services and the class

2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards
The standard for evaluating specific trips on a route varies by time of day as shown in the

Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.

11.A.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:






Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations

branches or end segments

The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be
modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.
2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Regional routes which meet the following maximum travel
time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the entire route. This
maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line haul travel time,
whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

11.A.b

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.b

RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint
at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is 3 to 12
persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on passenger boardings per
revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this

service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.

SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may be reconsidered as to whether or not to schedule such event(s) during the next 12
months.
SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width, roadway
grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and overhead
clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details.

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.
Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.b

RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with route spacing. Actual route
spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and productivity of existing service
in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs
 Carry longer distance traffic flow
 Speed limit 30 mph or faster
 Road width two plus lanes in each direction
5.2.1 Minimum Service Levels
Areas with 3-12 residents and employees per acre
 Peak period Park-n-Ride service if either the travel time to the Denver CBD by Express
bus or rail, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.
 Call-n-Ride service.
Areas with 12 or more residents and employees per acre:
 Local service on major arterials with pedestrian access within 1/4 mile.
 Peak period, Limited, Express, or Regional service from Park-n-Rides if either the travel
time to the Denver CBD by bus, or a bus/rail timed connection, exceeds 20 minutes.

radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.

circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”
[§37.121]

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Guidelines and
Criteria, included here by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with
local jurisdictions in planning transit access (including projects under construction).

7. Service Guidelines for Special Events and Special Services
7.1 Derivation of Standards
The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity
centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.


A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.

service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.



Offers bi-directional service.



Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:
[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category Costs applied according to
RTD Cost Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]

Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.
The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.
If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.

2. Low-Income Populations (150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines)

11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed
in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

11.1 Purpose of the Standard
This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

11.2 Determination of Transit Dependency
Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

11.3 Application of Transit Dependency Standard

Packet Pg. 100

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.b

Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

12. Service Change Process
The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.

The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

13.2 Guidance
13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.




Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.

Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.



Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an
entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.





Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.



At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

1. Introduction
1.1 Overview
RTD continually receives requests for changes to existing service and for new service in
growing areas of the District. Additionally, RTD may be operating some services that are
not attracting enough riders to justify their cost. In order to be consistent in the
evaluation of service proposals, and to ensure that the service being provided represents
the most cost-effective use of the District's resources, a set of service standards is
maintained by RTD.
The specific standards, targets or minimum/maximum values for the standards, and a
procedure for applying these standards, are presented in this document. Since service
standards are intended to optimize usage of the District's resources, they are updated
periodically to reflect changes in the District goals and resources. The procedure for
updating the standards is described in Section 1.3.

1.2 Application of Service Standards
There are two primary applications for the ongoing use of the service standards. These
are the use of standards to evaluate existing services, and use of standards to evaluate
proposals for new service.
The application of standards to existing routes is a flexible process. The purpose of the
standards is to help identify routes which are most in need of service changes, such as
restructuring to eliminate lower productivity segments or branches, adjusting service
frequency to better reflect the demand for service, or providing additional promotion of
less patronized routes where appropriate. Routes, which do not meet standards, are not
automatically designated for elimination. Elimination of routes is only intended as a last
resort, when it has been determined that no cost-effective actions are available to improve
the productivity of the route.
The standards for evaluation of existing routes are not intended to preclude changes to
routes that meet these minimum standards. In many cases, it may be possible to improve
the productivity of routes that meet the minimum standards by making changes to
headways or trip times. Since the overall mission of RTD is “To meet our constituents’
present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable, courteous,
accessible and cost-effective service throughout the District,” these standards should not
be used to prevent changes to improve the efficiency of existing routes, as long as the
changes meet the route design standards.
The availability of financial resources, represented by the annual budget, is the bottom line
for these standards. Service expansion may occur when additional funds are available and
contraction may occur otherwise. In any case, selection of which services to provide or
curtail is based on these performance standards and no service is considered guaranteed

The evaluation of new service proposals will take place as proposals are received or needs
identified. The most recent values of the standards for existing routes will be used to
evaluate the proposed new services. Decisions regarding implementation of new routes
will be made through the service planning process. New routes and services will be
expected to meet all applicable design standards described in Sections 2, 3 and 554, but
will not be expected to meet the productivity standards described in Section 2.3.2.1 until
they have been in operation for at least six months. Demonstration, experimental, and
cost sharing services are also handled in this manner.

1.3 Updating of Service Standards
The service standards are intended to support the goals and objectives of the District.
Since these objectives and the resources available to attain them can be expected to
change over time, the standards will be revised periodically to reflect those changes.
The service standards will be reviewed on a bi-annual basis. At that time, experience
with the service standards over the previous time period, as well as changes in the
District's goals and objectives, will be used to determine whether any standards should be
added or revised.
The numerical values of productivity standards will be updated each year, using ridership,
revenue and cost figures for the most recent twelve-month period for which data are
available. The rankings are based only on those routes that existed for the entire year.
Routes which were eliminated during the year will not be included because they cannot be
identified as candidates for revisions. Routes that were introduced during the year will not
be included in determining the new standards since they are not required to meet the
productivity standards until they have been in operation for at least six months. However,
these routes will be evaluated separately, using the service standards contained in this
document.
The updating procedure will compare the values of the productivity standards with those
in effect for the previous year. Operating cost data for the previous year will be revised to
account for system-wide increases or decreases in operating cost.

2. Performance Standards
2.1

Derivation and Use of Standards

The productivity standards are used to identify routes and services for appropriate
marketing and possible revision or elimination. Separate standards are identified for each
class of service. Routes are evaluated on ridership (either boardings per in-service hour or
per trip, depending on the class of service) and on the economic measure of subsidy per
passenger. These standards are based on the performance of the least productive 10
percent of the routes in each service class for either the ridership or economic measure, or

Revised July 7, 2016July 7, 2016April 15, 2016 2

or beyond review. The RTD Board of Directors, with input from RTD staff and the public,
is responsible for making decisions on service recommendations.

Packet Pg. 119

Service Development Policies & Standards

on the least productive 25 percent of routes in both measures. The basis for the
standards will be reviewed in conjunction with the cost recovery standards in Section 996,
and may be revised if necessary.
New services should meet the applicable standards for their class of service after six
months of operation. All new services will be reviewed after six months of operation and
routes that have not shown adequate progress toward meeting the standards will be
targeted for cost-effective actions to increase productivity or for elimination.
For the purpose of applying the standards, Local and Limited routes will be divided into
three groups based on area-type land-use designations: CBD routes (routes which serve
the Denver Central Business District), Urban routes, and Suburban routes. These
groupings of Local and Limited routes will enable the comparison of routes with similar
service characteristics. Express, Regional and sky Ride routes will be evaluated as
separate classes due to their different service characteristics. For the purposes of
evaluating productivity, Light Rail will be measured against the standards established for
CBD Local routes, except where otherwise noted.
To meet the RTD mission to provide cost-effective service throughout the District, RTD
has developed different types or classes of service that serve specific markets and,
therefore, have different performance expectations. Due to their different service
characteristics Express, Regional and SkyRide were treated as separate classes. However,
due to the deployment of rail, BRT and resulting service restructuring, these classes are
reconfigured. The routes in these three are reassigned into a new, consolidated Regional
class or the Local CBD class. Regional class includes routes providing high-speed service
on limited access highways from suburban and outlying communities to downtown
Denver, Denver International Airport and other metro, major employment centers, and
provided at distances of approximately 6 miles or more. Local services have three subclassifications: CBD—any route serving downtown Denver; Urban—35% or more of route
length within a ¼ mile buffer has population+employment density of 12 per acre or
greater; and Suburban—34% or less. Call-n-Ride and Access-a-Ride are separate classes.
Enhanced bus and BRT routes may warrant future consideration regarding their operation
with: dedicated right-of-way; partially dedicated ROW; limited or express mode; priority
over other traffic; and various speeds appropriate to context. [Please see attachment A
Service Classes for details on how these revisions affect current routes.]
The standards for evaluating portions of routes are intended for use in identifying needed
service improvements, for making modifications to specific portions of existing routes, or
for identifying low productivity segments of routes.
These standards could be used in situations such as isolating low productivity portions of
otherwise productive routes or measuring options for bringing unproductive routes into
compliance with the overall service standards. These standards may also be used to
evaluate proposals for new route extensions or deviations on existing routes.

2.2 Ridership and Economic Measures

Service Development Policies & Standards

The RTD’s approach is to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel
markets. All services are designed to match the level of service with demand, thus
improving performance and sustainability. This results in multiple domains of acceptable
performance for the various classes of service. Standards are best set by first determining
measures of performance and objectives. The core objective is to maximize overall
ridership, to the extent allowed by the available resources.
2.2.1 Performance Objective
Service allocation is driven by the RTD adopted mission statement: “To meet our
constituents’ present and future public transit needs by offering safe, clean, reliable,
courteous, accessible cost-effective service throughout the District.”
Performance Measures
 Passengers/hour (productivity)
 Passengers/trip (Regional class
productivity)
 Subsidy/passenger (cost
effectiveness)
The subsidy per passenger measure
combines fare revenue and total cost
impacts to produce a measure that
comprehensively reflects the District’s
allocation of resources. The effectivenessproductivity chart, Error! Reference source
not found.Figure 1 - Effectiveness - Figure 1 Effectiveness - Productivity Chart
Productivity Chart, presents economic
effectiveness on the vertical axis, and productivity, or boardings per hour, on the
horizontal axis. The chart offers a convenient comparative analysis of all classes of
services, illustrating both absolute and relative performance.
When standards and
guidelines are applied, judgments can be made.

2.3 Fixed Route Service Design and Evaluation Standards
2.3.1 Minimum Service Frequency
New routes shall provide the minimum frequencies specified below. Existing services that
cannot meet these minimum standards while adhering to the minimum passengers per
hour or trip standards defined in Section 2.3.2 shall be identified as candidates for service
changes or appropriate marketing promotion within available resources. These service
changes may include providing service with longer headways if no other viable alternative
exists. Elimination of the route may be considered if service changes and/or promotional
efforts do not improve productivity.
These are “policy” service levels and represent a compromise between economic
efficiency and the functionality of the system. To be sustained at these levels, a route
must meet the minimum ridership performance standards discussed in Section 2.3.2.1 and

2.3.2 Minimum Ridership Performance
This standard applies to routes operating at the minimum service frequency target. For
Local and Limited routes, the standard is passengers per hour based upon the bottom 10%
and 25% of routes in the respective class. For Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes, the
standard is passengers per trip.
These standards are derived from system averages by class of service. All routes must
meet their applicable minimum standards. Those that do not meet these standards will
need to be modified or marketed in some way in order to bring them up to the minimum
standards. Those that are not brought up to the minimum standards are subject to
cancellation. Routes that meet their applicable minimum ridership standards justify a
service level at the minimum service frequencies outlined in Section 2.3.1. Higher
frequencies must be justified by ridership as outlined in Section 2.3.4.

On rail, the first trip of the operating day in each direction, operated as the “Sweep
Train” and pull-outs, is exempted from the minimum ridership standards.
Maximum Load (Crowding) Standard

For Local and Limited routes in the peak, the maximum load standard is 125% of a seated
load at the maximum load point. For Local and Limited routes outside of the peak, and for
Express, Regional, and SkyRide routes at all times, the maximum load is the seated
capacity of the vehicle.
Service frequencies shall be adjusted so that the following maximum load standards are
met at least 60 percent of the time:


Local and Limited Service:
Peak periods – 125 percent of seated load on RTD's present bus fleet. The
maximum time that an individual passenger should be expected to stand on a given
trip is 15 minutes.
Off-peak periods - seated load



Express, Regional, and SkyRide Service:
Seated load at all times.



Light Rail vehicles:

Attachment: Redlined Service Standards - Proposed Revisions 2016 (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

2.3.2.2 Specific Trips Ridership Standards

Packet Pg. 123

Service Development Policies & Standards

Peak periods – 125 passengers per vehicle
Off-peak periods – seated load
Special events – 165 passengers per vehicle
From the Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual: “From the passenger
perspective, the passenger load on a transit vehicle affects the comfort of the on-board
vehicle portion of a transit trip-both in terms of being able to find a seat and in overall
crowding levels within the vehicle. From a transit operator's perspective, a poor quality of
service may indicate the need to increase service frequency or vehicle size to reduce
crowding and increase passenger comfort.”
RTD defines crowding as a seated load plus the standing passenger space, as calculated
for each vehicle by subtracting the area occupied by seats and other objects from the
gross interior floor area. The amount of crowding on a route is defined as the percent of
total trips during a defined time period that exceed a comfort passenger level of 4.3—5.3
square feet per standee, generally having these characteristics (See page 5-24 of the
Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual, 3rd Edition,
http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_rpt_165ch-05.pdf):
 Standing load without body contact
 Standees have similar amount of personal space as seated passengers
 Reasonably easy circulation within vehicle
The maximum number of standees can be computed for each vehicle by determining its
standing passenger square footage and dividing by 4.3—5.3. For any service class during
any defined period (e.g., AM early, AM peak, midday), when 10% or more of the
directional trips exceed the computed maximum standees at the maximum load point,
further investigation of potential remedies, such as changing the bus assignment or
frequency of service, is warranted. For special events heavier loads are expected and
acceptable, but when 10% or more of trips during the take-away have 4 or less square
feet per standing passenger, further investigation of potential remedies is warranted. See
Attachment D Crowding Report Examples for reference. The Percent of Total Trips chart
(lower right) with level-of-service D or E would indicate crowding.
2.3.4 Demand Based Service Frequency
Service frequency in the RTD network is based on clock-pattern schedules. This pattern
provides consistent and easy to understand schedules for our customers, and makes
possible the provision of timed transfer connection hubs, whereby multiple routes are
scheduled to meet at one location to facilitate connections. In general, routes are
scheduled to operate in even increments of 30 minutes, or every 60, 30, 15, 10, 7.5, or 5
minutes. However, other frequencies may be provided depending upon passenger
demand, or operational and scheduling needs.
For routes meeting the above frequency, ridership, and load standards, frequency better
than every 30 minutes may be provided when and where justified by ridership. This
standard applies equally to all service categories. In order to be sustainable, higher
frequency service must meet the following criteria:

Incremental frequency necessary to maintain the appropriate load standard during any
30 minute time period.
Appropriate vehicle assignment as outlined in Section 2.3.5
When a service exceeds the maximum load standard, higher frequency may be justified
during that time period and/or route segment.
If a service with better than the minimum frequency has passenger loads that can be
accommodated with a lower frequency without violating the load standard, then
frequency may be reduced.
As a general guideline, a typical productivity by service frequency, for a whole route or
a segment or time period is provided in Table 3 Demand Based Service Frequency

Small 27’-30’ Bus: Appropriate for lower volume Local routes where ridership does
not require a standard bus, or for routes where specific operating concerns preclude
use of standard buses and for Call-n-Ride.
Standard 40’ Transit Bus: The standard equipment for Local and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Articulated 60’ Bus: Appropriate for higher volume Limited and Express Regional
services. May also be used on Regional and SkyRide trips in the Express fare category.
Intercity Coach: Appropriate for Regional and SkyRide services.

2.3.6 Design and Evaluation of Portions of Routes
The standards for evaluating portions of routes cover two areas in which minor
modifications may be made to routes without changing the overall structure of the route:
 midline segments or midline deviations
 branches or end segments
The governing standards for overall route productivity were presented earlier. Since trips
provided during marginally productive hours of the day or trips over marginal segments
often increase the attractiveness of the overall service, an otherwise productive route may
be able to support some less productive trips or portions of the route. However, if a route
cannot meet the overall service standards for its class of service, there may not be
productive segments to enhance the unproductive segments. Therefore, specific
segments, branches, or trips which meet the standards for portions of routes may still be

2.3.6.1 Midline Segments and Midline Deviations




A midline segment or deviation of a Local or Limited route should generate enough
boardings per hour of service provided to meet the standard for its class of service
(CBD, Urban and Suburban). Boardings in both directions will be counted.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause a reduction in the overall boardings
per hour for the route.
If a route is changed, the change shall not cause the route to violate any route design
standards as defined in Section 2.3, or the overall productivity standards as defined in
Section 2.

2.3.6.2 Branches and End Segments









A branch or end segment of a Local or Limited route should generate enough boardings
to meet the ridership standard for its class of service (CBD, Urban and Suburban).
Boardings generated along the branch are defined as all passengers boarding the bus
along the branch or end portion of the route, and all outbound passengers alighting
along this section.
Local collector portions of Express and Regional routes which meet the following
maximum travel time standard, shall meet the ridership productivity standard for the
entire route. This maximum travel time is equal to 15 minutes or 50 percent of line
haul travel time, whichever is less.
For shorter segments, the minimum ridership standard is reduced by the ratio of actual
travel time to the maximum allowable travel time. Thus, if the actual travel time along
the collector is half of the maximum allowed, it must average half the number of
boardings per trip specified in the minimum ridership productivity standard.
A new extension to a route that does not meet the minimum ridership productivity
standard must attract sufficient ridership for the entire route to meet the minimum
ridership standard for its service class.
A route extension will not be initiated if it violates any of the route design standards
found in Section 2.3, or causes the route as a whole to fall below the minimum riders
per unit of service or standards found earlier in Section 2.3.2.

2.4 Demand Response Service Design and Evaluation Standards
RTD continues to develop a family of transit services suited to a variety of travel markets.
The goal of this approach is to match the type and level of service to the demand in a
given service area, thus improving performance and sustainability. As such, a variety of
non-fixed route services are provided by the RTD including the following.
2.4.1 Call-n-Ride
Rather than operating on a fixed route and schedule, demand responsive Call-n-Ride
service is characterized as a shared ride within a defined geographic service area and the
need for the passenger to arrange for pick-up in advance or be at a designated checkpoint

Revised July 7, 2016July 7, 2016April 15, 2016 9

Attachment: Redlined Service Standards - Proposed Revisions 2016 (2844 : Revised RTD Transit Service Policies & Standards)

modified in order to raise the productivity of the entire route, if the overall route does not
meet the service standards for its class of service.

Packet Pg. 126

Service Development Policies & Standards

at prescheduled times. A Call-n-Ride service area averages about 7 square miles or
between about 2 to 30 square miles depending on its number of vehicles and service
configuration—predominantly station feeder or community-based service. Call-n-Ride often
provides first/last mile access to the broader RTD network of services through timed
connections at transfer centers and Park-n-Rides. Population plus employment is
predominantly 3 to 12 persons per acre. Call-n-Ride service is evaluated based on
passenger boardings per revenue hour and subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.2 Access-A-Ride
Access-a-Ride provides ADA complementary paratransit in the District to individuals who
cannot readily access the bus and rail system. As per US DOT requirements the
passenger’s trip origin and destination must be within ¾ mile of RTD’s non-commuter bus
route system, during the same days and hours of their operation and within the District
boundaries, and curb-to-curb service must be provided. However, RTD provides door-todoor service as a reasonable accommodation. Trips must be booked at least one day and
up to 3 days in advance; however, RTD also offers subscriptions.
All applicants must qualify for certification under the guidelines established by the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, complete a functional evaluation in person,
provide a physician’s statements to verify disability and must meet one of the following
criteria:
 Be unable to get to and from a bus stop or on and off a lift-equipped bus by yourself
 Have a cognitive disability that prohibits your understanding of how to complete bus
trips
2.4.3 Vanpooling
Vanpooling is a public transportation option in which commuters, whose residences are
geographically clustered, ride together to and from their work sites in a van that is driven
by one of the vanpool participants. Typically vanpools make one roundtrip per day and
carry from 5 to 14 riders. Vanpooling offers greater opportunities for increased capacity
compared to carpooling and offers a cost-effective alternative to conventional transit in
areas of low employment density and longer commute distances. RTD contracts for this
service with DRCOG to subsidize the portion of the commute trip within the District.
Vanpool service is evaluated based on subsidy per passenger boarding.
2.4.4 SeniorRide and Senior Shopper
SeniorRide Special Events transports groups to a variety of cultural, educational and
entertainment events. The Schedule of events is published 3 times a year to the public.
Service is available on a first come first served basis. A minimum of 10 passengers per
trip is required. Scheduled events that do not generate reservations of at least 2 groups of
10 may not be rescheduled for the next 12 months.

Service Development Policies & Standards

SeniorShopper buses have established routes that provide trips to major grocery stores.
Service is available Monday through Friday. A minimum of 10 passengers per trip is
required.
RTD provides services to enhance the welfare of certain groups of persons such as the
current services offered for shopping and recreational trips for elderly persons or persons
with disabilities. Since SeniorRide and Senior Shopper service are point to point services,
these services are evaluated based on passenger boardings per trip. Refer to Appendix A
for current standards.

2.5 Reliability
On-time for fixed-route service is defined as not more than 1 minute early to not more than
5 minutes late. RTD sets annual objectives for on-time performance by class of service
and which are reported in the Quarterly Performance Report. [Improved methods for
monitoring, identifying the causes and remedying unreliable service are currently in
development.]

3. Geometric Design Standards
3.1 Directness of Route
Routes shall be designed to be as direct as possible and to provide maximum accessibility
to transit.
 Deviations from a direct path from end-to-end of the route shall account for no more
than one-quarter of the end-to-end travel time of the route.


For a specific deviation, the total additional travel time for all through passengers
should not exceed three minutes for each rider boarding or alighting along the
deviation.
In mathematical terms, this means that the quantity
Pt * VTT < 3 minutes
Pd
where: Pt = through passengers
VTT = additional vehicle one-way travel time
Pd = passengers served by deviation

3.2 Stop Spacing Standards
Bus routes shall adhere to the following stop spacing standards. Placement also
considers: the balance between pedestrian access and route travel time; ADA
requirements; adjacent land uses; streetscape conditions and property ownership.
3.2.1 Minimum

Limited service, residential and commercial areas – 1,250’ (4 stops/mile)
Limited service, limited stop zone – 8,000’ (1 stop/1.5 miles)

3.3 Roadway Design Goal
New bus routes should not be operated along streets that do not meet minimum
standards:, such as for bus turning radius, pavement strength/loading, lane width,
roadway grade, shoulder width on rural roads (for pedestrian waiting and safety) and
overhead clearance. Refer to the RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria Section 1 –
Transit Access for specific details [currently in development].
 Turning radius - 35' minimum
 Street surface must be asphalt or concrete
 For deep-strength asphalt: 7" for existing street; 11" for new street
 For concrete pavement : 8.5" design thickness; 8" existing thickness
 Lane width - 10' minimum
 No speed bumps
 Bridges - rated for H-20S loading (all legal weights)
 Shoulder width on rural roads - 6' minimum
 Overhead clearance - 12' minimum (16' 6" for structures on new roads)

4. Shelters
The minimum warrant for the placement of a shelter is 40 boardings per day at the stop.
Stops with the highest average of daily boardings will take top priority for shelter
placement. [Revised standards are currently in development and will reference the RTD
Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria.]

5. Area Coverage Standards
5.1 Purpose and Application
The purpose of these standards is to define a reasonable level of service to all areas of the
District and to help RTD maintain this service level. Since the RTD service area includes
many different types of development, and population densities and land use vary widely
across the District, it would not be reasonable to expect all areas to support the same level
of service. Moreover, different types of service may best meet the needs of different
areas, and RTD's resources can be used in a more productive fashion if service can be
tailored to the needs of particular areas. Area coverage standards provide guidelines for
tailoring service to the needs of communities and help ensure that all areas receive a level
of service that is commensurate with their needs.

Service Development Policies & Standards

Levels of service for specific areas also depend on the productivity of existing services. If
existing or proposed services cannot meet the productivity standards outlined in Section 2,
RTD may choose not to provide the minimum level of service. Financial constraints may
also limit RTD's ability to meet the area coverage (or any other) standards.

5.2 Coverage Levels Outside the Denver CBD
The area coverage standards for areas outside the Denver Central Business District (CBD)
are based on a combined density measure. This measure adds population and employment
to determine potential demand for transportation to and from a particular area.
[Attachment B shows the density classifications overlaid with RTD services for the entire
District.]
The area coverage standards presented below deal with minimum and maximum route
spacing. Actual route spacing and service frequency will depend on demand and
productivity of existing service in the area.
For use in this document, arterial roadways are defined as follows:
 Traffic flow controlled by traffic signals as opposed to stop signs

Within the District:
49 CFR 37.131 - Service criteria for complementary paratransit.
“(1) Bus.
(i) The entity shall provide complementary paratransit service to origins and
destinations within corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of
each fixed route. The corridor shall include an area with a three-fourths of a mile
radius at the ends of each fixed route.
(ii) Within the core service area, the entity also shall provide service to small areas
not inside any of the corridors but which are surrounded by corridors.
(iii) Outside the core service area, the entity may designate corridors with widths
from three-fourths of a mile up to one and one half miles on each side of a fixed
route, based on local circumstances.
(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, the core service area is that area in which
corridors with a width of three-fourths of a mile on each side of each fixed route
merge together such that, with few and small exceptions, all origins and
destinations within the area would be served.
“(2) Rail.
(i) For rail systems, the service area shall consist of a circle with a radius of 3/4 of
a mile around each station.
(ii) At end stations and other stations in outlying areas, the entity may designate
circles with radii of up to 11/2 miles as part of its service area, based on local
circumstances.
“(3) Jurisdictional boundaries. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
paragraph, an entity is not required to provide paratransit service in an area outside
the boundaries of the jurisdiction(s) in which it operates, if the entity does not have
legal authority to operate in that area. The entity shall take all practicable steps to
provide paratransit service to any part of its service area.”
“Requirements for complementary paratransit do not apply to commuter bus …
fixed route bus service, characterized by service predominantly in one direction
during peak periods, limited stops, use of multi-ride tickets, and routes of extended
length, usually between the central business district and outlying suburbs.”
[§37.121]

6. Transit Access
RTD has guidelines for access to its facilities for pedestrians, bus riders, bicyclists,
passenger loading, and parking. The RTD Bus Infrastructure Design Criteria, included here
by reference, is intended to be used by RTD in conjunction with local jurisdictions in
planning transit access (including projects under construction) [separately under
development].

5.2.2 Access-A-Ride - ADA Required Service Area Coverage

Packet Pg. 131

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.c

The following guidelines for provision of bus and/or train service to special events are
based on prior RTD Board actions and on the public convenience and necessity to:




Protect neighborhoods from the impact of events which are so large as to overwhelm
the surrounding supply of parking, and
Serve customers by offering adequate service for events which are predictably large
enough to overload the normally available transit service, and
Protect taxpayers by only serving those events that have a predictable level of transit
demand great enough to justify the operation of special routes.

7.2

Standards for Events

RTD, within the limits of its budget, will operate special service:




For events at Invesco Field at Mile High stadium with projected attendance of over
55,000, for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
For events at Coors Field with projected attendance of over 40,000, for which the
crowd is expected to all be present at one time.
At other venues where the ratio of projected attendance to available on-site parking is
6:1 and for which the crowd is expected to all be present at one time.

This service will not be provided when substantial numbers of the event patrons can be
expected to arrive in privately operated or non-profit owned buses or regularly scheduled
RTD service.
RTD will provide Express Shuttle service to Invesco Field and Coors Field from selected
Park-n-Rides for events described in this section. The General Manager must specifically
authorize Park-n-Ride service for other events.
RTD may also provide service at events with lower attendance projections if the promoter
is willing to subsidize such service. The RTD Board adopted a specific subsidy formula in
September 1987: “the prorated share of RTD’s incremental cost of service, plus a 10%
administrative service fee, the share to be based on the percentage shortfall in ridership
between the minimum ridership of 1650 passengers going to the event and the actual
number of passengers carried, based on RTD traffic checks.”

8. Shuttles & Circulators
8.1 Characteristics
Shuttle and circulator routes are not defined as a separate class of service, but are
typically proposed to serve specific, local, community-focused needs. Shuttle and
circulator routes are generally defined by the following characteristics: short routes,
usually less than 5 miles long; operate on local streets and arterials; connect major activity

7.1 Derivation of Standards

Packet Pg. 132

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.c

8.2 Guidelines for Success
Several factors are critical to shuttle and circulator success. As a guideline to make
informed decisions, the following characteristics must be present and considered.


A sustained average population density of at least 10 people per acre along the length
of the route is a minimum requirement; a critical mass of potential riders is needed to
succeed.



Connects community residences with major activity centers such as colleges, high
schools, middle schools, shopping districts (but not auto-centric malls), medical
centers, and downtowns that appeal to all market segments (youth, families, seniors)
and can serve a variety of trip purposes.



Transit friendly environment: pedestrian friendly, walkable streets are a minimum;
mixed land uses; areas of clustered shopping or employment; public spaces; and
bicycle parking/paths.



To attract spontaneous walk up use, the headway needs to be15 minutes or less for a
service span for the intended markets, typically 6:00 – 18:00 or longer.



Offers bi-directional service.



Does not substantially duplicate a service of comparable utility.

9. System-Wide Cost Recovery Standard
The state required system-wide minimum cost recovery ratio is 30 percent. This ratio is
calculated by the following formula:

[Farebox Revenues + Advertising Revenues + Lease Revenues + FTA Operating
Assistance + Other Non-Sales Tax Revenues ] / [Category I Costs +Category II Costs +
Local share of depreciation on RTD assets] [Category Costs applied according to RTD Cost
Model Memo, June 15, 2010, as updated (See summary below)]
Cost Model Summary
With the exception of Private Carrier costs, all costs are allocated to routes by one of
three methods: hours, miles or vehicles. The RTD Bus Cost Model has five cost categories:
Variable/Direct, Variable/Indirect, Private Carrier, Retained Costs and Depreciation. Private
Carrier costs are allocated to routes by the number of hours the contractor operates the
route, multiplied by the average hourly rate billed for that particular contract, plus the
average hourly cost for fuel.

centers; and serve short passenger trip lengths within a single community. Fares must be
set according to RTD Fare Policy.

Packet Pg. 133

Service Development Policies & Standards

The annual budget and six-year Strategic Budget Plan are evaluated using this cost
recovery standard.
If the standard is not met, several courses of action may be taken. The RTD Board has
adopted a policy of evaluating the fare structure as part of the annual budget process;
fares may be changed at that time to provide additional revenue. RTD may also choose to
market its services more aggressively to attract more customers and their fares, or RTD
may look for revenue from other sources. The productivity standards in Sections 2 and 3
may be used to reduce the costs of providing service while disrupting service to as few
passengers as possible.

10. Title VI & Environmental Justice Compliance
RTD follows FTA Circular 4072.1B “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal
Transit Administration Recipients,” Chapter 4.4.
Title VI Protected Classes are race, color and national origin.
Environmental Justice Protected Classes are as follows:
1. Minority Populations:
 American Indian and Alaska Native, which refers to people having origins in any of
the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and
who maintain tribal affiliation or community attachment.
 Asian, which refers to people having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far
East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent, including, for example, Cambodia,
China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam.
 Black or African American, which refers to people having origins in any of the Black
racial groups of Africa.
 Hispanic or Latino, which includes persons of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South
or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race.
 Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, which refers to people having origins in
any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.
2. Low-Income Populations (150% of Federal Poverty Guidelines)

10.11. Standard for Service for Transit Dependent Persons and
To Social Service Destinations
For purposes of these service standards, transit dependent riders are defined as riders who
either live in a household which does not own a car or who have a physical or mental
disability that prevents the transit patron from driving a car. Social Service destinations
are those destinations that are provided as a public service that may not have consistently
sufficient ridership to otherwise warrant the establishment or continuation of a route or
route segment. Examples of social service destinations would include county court
facilities, hospitals, schools, or public institutions which have been situated or constructed

Service Development Policies & Standards

in isolated locations prior to the establishment of RTD or following review and comment by
RTD of the proposed development plans of such institution or agency, by the appropriate
jurisdiction.

10.111.1

Purpose of the Standard

This standard is intended to provide for consideration of transit dependency in service
decisions. This standard does not guarantee a minimum level of service to all transitdependent riders. However, it will ensure that transit-dependent riders and/or the need to
have access to social service destinations are identified and considered when decisions are
made to reduce service levels in an area.

10.211.2

Determination of Transit Dependency

Whenever RTD plans changes to an existing route where there is no alternative service
available to meet the area coverage standards in Section 5 such as a change in routing or
span of service, transit-dependent riders will be identified through on-board surveys. This
survey will ask questions about riders' travel habits and demographics, and it will attempt
to identify transit-dependent riders and their destinations.

10.311.3

Application of Transit Dependency Standard

The applicable minimum productivity standards for a route will be reduced by one-half the
percentage of ridership that is defined as transit dependent. Thus, if 60 percent of the
riders on a route are transit dependent, the route must achieve 70 percent [100 percent
minus (60 percent divided by 2)] of the applicable productivity standards (ridership and
economic) in order not to be considered a poor performer.
Applicable ridership standards for fixed route services may be found in Section 2.3, and
for non-fixed route services, in Section 2.4.
If the on-board survey reveals that the route does not serve the destinations desired by
transit-dependent riders, RTD may restructure the route to improve service and increase
ridership. This could include changing the routing or schedule to serve passenger needs.
RTD wishes to provide transit dependent riders with service that fits their needs and to
provide service to social service destinations when there is even a modicum of recognized
demand.
Another consideration to be given in whether or not to eliminate a route with some transit
dependent passengers is the impact on required Access-A-Ride services. The Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires that eligible persons with disabilities be provided with
paratransit service if they have trip origins and destinations within a defined service area
three-fourths of a mile from a non-commuter fixed route. If accessible fixed route service
is considered for removal from a portion of the defined paratransit service area, an
estimate of the demand for substitute Access-A-Ride service for persons with disabilities
who require lift-equipped buses must be completed and a cost-benefit analysis performed
for the alternatives (leaving fixed route versus providing Access-A-Ride service).

11.A.c

The following is a description of the steps necessary in developing and implementing
service changes, which are typically conducted each year in January, May and
September—also called runboards—as required by Board policy and the Collective
Bargaining Agreement.
Proposals are derived from a variety of inputs continuously throughout the year including:
periodic customer, household and employer surveys; stakeholder meetings; service
performance evaluation; and changing demographics and land uses. They are compiled for
each runboard and evaluated based on a number of factors, including RTD annual budget,
RTD Service Standards, effects on the transit network and on transit dependent markets
(Title VI), cost-effective services throughout the District and responsiveness to changes in
the communities within RTD. A Board paper is compiled and presented to the Board,
stakeholders and public for consideration.
Staff then discusses the proposals with members of the Board, stakeholders and senior
staff and coordinates with other staff including Marketing, Operations, Facilities and
Finance. Modifications are made as warranted and then the proposals enter the pubic
engagement process: formally scheduled public hearings; informal presentations upon
request; repository for customer input—service.changes@rtd-denver; responses to General
Manager and Board Member requests. Upon completion of public engagement, all
previous input is compiled and evaluated and revisions to the proposals are made as
warranted. A final Board report is prepared with a summary and details of proposed
changes and a summary of public hearings and other public input for approval of the
Board.
The approved changes then go into a comprehensive production process which includes:
schedule creation; bus and operator requirements and assignments; compliance with
privatization policy; runcutting and compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement;
marketing promotions and public relations; bus stop and on-street changes; printed and
electronic public information, including maps and timetables; and validation and
distribution of all data within the Transit Information Exchange System (TIES).

13. Cost Sharing Policy
13.1 Background
On June 21, 1994, the RTD Board of Directors passed a resolution, Transit Service CostSharing Policy, to provide guidance to RTD staff in responding to the increasing number of
requests for new service. This policy authorized the General Manager to pursue cost
sharing as a method of providing transit service using RTD revenues and other funds
voluntarily pledged by private employers, businesses or local governments; this has
resulted in a number of RTD partnerships in demonstrating new services. The following
incorporates this experience and provides guidance on the application and limitations of
cost-sharing arrangements.

12. Service Change Process

Packet Pg. 136

Service Development Policies & Standards

11.A.c

13.2.1 Financial Feasibility
Financial feasibility depends not only on the availability of funds, but also on consideration
of fares, cost/revenue allocation and equity.








Net operating cost (subsidy) needs to be defined so that all partners are treated
equitably. Net cost is the total operating cost less farebox revenue and other operating
revenues and any grant revenues secured on behalf of the proposed service. The
application of grant revenues prior to the net cost sharing allows all partners to
participate in the benefits of grant funding.
Cost-sharing projects need to adopt the RTD fare structure for similar services for
reasons of equity. Furthermore, this places all projects on the same revenue basis for
calculating net operating cost. Project sponsors may propose a fare that does not
follow the RTD fare structure. For these projects the partner is required to fund the full
difference in revenue between the comparable RTD fare and the project fare, based on
actual ridership. The adoption of any non-conforming (economically or technically) fare
is always subject to Board approval.
Costs associated with vehicles are addressed project by project. Vehicles can be
purchased outright by project sponsors with grant funds or provided from the RTD
inventory. Should new vehicles be required, grants should fund their acquisition and
the local share split equally by the cost-sharing partners. If no grant funds are used,
RTD will limit its share to 10%, half of the usual local share when grant funds are
used. If the RTD operates the service and agrees to provide the vehicles from its
inventory, capital costs need not be included as part of the project cost unless special
accommodations are required.
Cost-sharing projects are new or expanded transit services and RTD’s share must be
budgeted out of allocations for new services for the entire District. Thus any partner
with expectations for RTD financial or operational participation must first obtain
commitment from RTD before applying for project grants. In addition, each project will
be subject to the appropriate RTD and DRCOG planning processes, especially as
regards estimates of costs, ridership, revenue and other benefits.

13.2.2 Vehicle Availability
RTD may have, with some minor modifications, vehicles readily available to provide the
proposed service. In some cases projects require a specialty or significantly modified
vehicle that must be acquired, subject to RTD approval for fleet maintenance compatibility.
Financing these vehicles is addressed above. Sometimes the availability of operators has
been more critical.
13.2.3 Local and Community Support
Local and community entities (e.g., government, employers, businesses and associations)
generally initiate cost-sharing transit projects concomitant with other plans and
developments in the community. Thus the proposed transit project is designed to address
a specific development or perceived need. To advance their project for implementation, an

13.2 Guidance

Service Development Policies & Standards

entity such as a city, will offer to share in the net costs of providing the service. RTD
needs to be responsive to these requests, but keep them in the context of the needs of
the entire District.





Projects generally have substantial institutional support; however they are subject to
the same public scrutiny, for example public hearings, as any other proposed service
change. Implementation of any cost-sharing project will continue to be subject to
RTD’s public review process.
RTD generally provides 50% of the local share of the net operating and/or capital cost
of a project. This cost-sharing ratio may be adjusted in consideration of the District
budget and policies.
Cost-sharing arrangements for each project are of limited duration for which agreed
upon performance milestones must be reached (see below). The purpose of the test
period is to assess the sustainability of the service and decide RTD’s and its partners
continuing participation. The test period is typically set at one, two or three years, as
appropriate to the project. Performance milestones must be set and evaluated and a
recommendation regarding continuation made for each year of the project.

13.2.4 Performance
Cost-sharing services will have clearly defined evaluative criteria agreed upon within the
cost-sharing agreement and prior to implementation.








At a minimum these criteria will include average daily ridership and RTD Service
Standards within the appropriate class of service for passenger boardings per hour and
subsidy per boarding. Additional criteria may also address issues related to project
objectives, such as new riders. State mandated cost recovery may also be considered.
Expectations of performance will be laid out in the form of milestones, such as a range
or minimum attainment at the end of each year.
During the first year performance will be assessed to determine if expectations have
been met and if continuation of the service is warranted. Often an experimental
service will need to be changed to improve performance. As warranted the same
assessment will be made in each succeeding year during the test period. This
assessment and recommendation regarding continuation will be reported to the RTD
Board each year of the test period.
If the cost-share service meets expectations and RTD Service Standards during the test
period, RTD will consider extending the period of its participation and increasing its
share of net cost; however, RTD is under no obligation to continuing any service
beyond the cost-share agreement, even if it meets Service Standards. If the cost-share
service does not perform up to expectations, RTD funding participation in such project
will be reduced or discontinued. These decisions are subject to the customary financial
and Board review.
Should RTD decide to discontinue or reduce its funding of the project service, a
sponsoring partner may choose to continue its funding by entering into a cost-sharing
agreement with RTD. This agreement will specify the service to be provided and its
cost, will be annually reviewed for potential renewal and will be subject to all RTD
Service Standards, budgeting and public processes.

Amendment to Lease for Office Space at Civic
Center Plaza – 1560 Broadway, Suites 510,
605, 610, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099

General

Board Meeting Date: July 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to amend and
extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District and CO-Denver Post
Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC
for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5 th, 6th, 7th and 10th
floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center
Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT personnel, Paratransit Services and Contracted
Services. This amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046
square feet to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for
all to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 square feet, base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot, has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of the lease at $21.50
per square foot, January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the remaining 11,423 square
feet will be $20.00 per square foot in the final year). Funding for the space to be used by the FasTracks
program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be appropriated in future year
budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be appropriated in future year
budgets.
BACKGROUND
In 2005 the Planning and Development Department of RTD required office space for employees and
contractors to be housed together for the management, planning, design and construction of the
FasTracks Project. Property Management with the assistance of a broker viewed and evaluated several
downtown office buildings within a reasonable distance of RTD’s main administrative office at 1600
Blake Street and adjacent to transit. Several other factors, including cost, network cabling, ability to
expand and public meeting facilities were used in evaluating space. Currently, RTD’s Planning and
Capital Programs departments and IT personnel occupy the space on the 5th, 6th and 7th floors of the
Civic Center Plaza. In January of 2006, Paratransit Services and its related call center moved into the
building on the 10th floor. In May 2012, IT required additional space on the 10th floor and a lease was
entered into.
DISCUSSION
The proposed lease extension for the current office space and the addition of 3,046 square feet on the
6th floor will provide needed office space for the current users through 2022. The Civic Center Building
is considered to be Class A office space. Current market rents for Class A office space average $24 per
square foot, with operating expenses at approximately $9.00 per square foot for a total rent per square
foot of approximately $33. The lease extension as negotiated provides for a base rent of $16.50 per

Packet Pg. 155

12.B

square foot annually with a $0.50 per square foot annual increase. In addition, RTD is responsible for
its’ pro rata share of operating expenses, historically and currently approximately $7.00 per square foot
annually. At approximately $23.50 to $26 per square foot, the negotiated extension is below or at
market rate.
Using information collected from CoStar, JLL (Jones Lang Lasalle) and other sources, lease comparables
were evaluated. Recent renewal rates average just over $40.00 per square foot in gross effective rent
(including operating expenses and net of rent abatement). As part of the negotiation of the extension
and amendment, a tenant improvement allowance of $1,056,910.00 will be given to RTD who will have
the option to apply toward tenant improvements or to defray future rents. Extension of the current
leases will provide a significant presence at the newly refurbished Civic Center Station and provide
needed office space.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Annualized base rent for the entire leases premises will be approximately $1.5 million for the first year
and approximately $1.8 in the final year. Funding for future year leases of office space to be used by the
FasTracks program is included in future years in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and the funding
for space used by the base system will be appropriated annually. RTD has the ability to use the
approximate $2.2 million allowance provided by owner at any time during the term of the lease
(approximately $1.2 million from previous extension and $1 million with the current extension).
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary
to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional Transportation District
and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC and EOPOne Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650, 700, 1000, 1075
and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903 square feet, in the
building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza for Planning and Capital Programs personnel, IT
personnel, Paratransit Services and Competitive Services and Transportation Contracts. This
amendment will consolidate all leased space into one lease, will add approximately 3,046 sq. ft.
to the 6th floor and will amend and extend all previous leases and amendments to provide for all
to expire on December 31, 2022. On the original 73,480 sq. ft., base rent began at $16.50 per
square foot base rent and has increased annually by $0.50 and will conclude in the final year of
the lease at $21.50 per sq. ft., January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. (Rent for the
remaining 11,423 sq. ft. will be $20.00 per sq. ft. in the final year). Funding for the space to be
used by the FasTracks program was included in the 2015 Annual Program Evaluation, and will be
appropriated in future year budgets. Funding for the space to be used by the base system will be
appropriated in future year budgets.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to amend and extend the lease agreements by and between the Regional
Transportation District and CO-Denver Post Tower, LLC, formerly known as CO-One Civic Center
Plaza, LLC and EOP-One Civic Center Plaza, LLC for office space in Suites 510, 605, 610, 650,
700, 1000, 1075 and 1099 on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 10th floors, containing approximately 84,903
square feet, in the building commonly known as Civic Center Plaza.

Acquisition of Easements - Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center

General

Board Meeting Date: July 19, 2016

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors pass the
attached resolution certifying easements as necessary for construction of the Southwest Plaza Transfer
Center project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain
law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the contractor for the construction of the
Southwest Plaza Transfer project the right of way necessary for certain utility easements for the
construction of the project. Easement needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared
beginning the formal acquisition process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may
ultimately result in court proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the
acquisition of the easements identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the
contractor and/or construction activities.
DISCUSSION
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property,
including easements, for a public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent
domain. RTD staff and its outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and
adhere to these processes, which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in
court filing and eminent domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and
right of way plan specifies the property that has been delineated by design and authorizes the General
Manager and/or his designee to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Acquisition of right of way is included in the project budget for the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center
project.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2016
SOUTHWEST PLAZA TRANSFER CENTER PROJECT EASEMENT ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the Southwest Plaza
Transfer Center Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plan;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just
compensation to acquire the easements; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate
condemnation proceedings to acquire the identified easements and to obtain
immediate possession of the easements; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall
have the authority to amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of
the easements as it deems necessary in the best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to
exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title
38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by
the Southwest Plaza Transfer Center Project, although financially compensated
according to the law, makes a significant personal sacrifice for the public good, a
sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public
purpose, that there is a public need and necessity to acquire the easements within
the corridor for and in furtherance of a public purpose, and that the acquisitions are
for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as
the Board’s delagatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed
easements.

Packet Pg. 160

12.C

The Board directs that the RTD delagatees should negotiate in good faith for
the acquisition of the easements and if the delagatee is unable to acquire any
easement through good faith negotiations, then the RTD may acquire such
easement through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of
the easements as soon as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2016.

Board Meeting Date: July 19, 2016

Subject:

Approval of General Manager’s 2017 Goals

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee that the
Board of Directors approves the General Manager’s goals for 2017 as defined in the attached General
Manager’s Performance Evaluation Form.
BACKGROUND
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee works with the General
Manager to enhance its oversight responsibilities for the General Manager’s performance and to develop
processes that are approved by the full Board and are transparent to the public.
On July 20, 2010, the Board formalized and approved the goal setting process for the General Manager.
That process defines the steps the Board will follow in establishing the annual goals for the General
Manager. Beginning in 2011, these goals include core and task goals. Core goals are based on the
General Manager’s job description and are generally considered part of the ongoing responsibilities of the
General Manager. The task goals are a compilation of the priorities from the annual Joint Board and
Staff Advance Planning Session that occurs in the first quarter of the year.
One of the steps in the process is to formalize the General Manager’s annual goals utilizing the RTD
employee performance evaluation form consistent to all salaried RTD employees. This action item is to
formalize that process.
The General Manager Oversight and Performance Management Committee Chair and the full committee
have reviewed the 2017 core and task goals with the General Manager and approved the goals as
amended at the June 28, 2016 committee meeting to move to the full Board for approval.
DISCUSSION
Please refer to the attached General Manager Performance Evaluation form which identifies the five core
goals for 2017 and the three task goals for 2017. The attached General Manager Tactical Plan for 2017
is submitted as a supplement to this document.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
No financial impact in approving the 2017 Goals.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept this recommended action for approval of the General Manager’s 2017 goals. This
approval completes the formalized process as approved by the Board members for goal setting.
2. Do not accept this recommended action. Work with the General Manager Oversight and
Performance Management Committee and the General Manager to amend the 2017 goals. This
will significantly delay the schedule established for the approval of the goals.

3. Do nothing. Accept the risk and consequences of not complying with the State Auditor’s
recommendation for a clear, documented and timely process.

RATING SCALE GUIDELINES
EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS:
Performance in this goal was beyond the expectations of the position in one or more of the following areas: the objectives and/or
responsibilities were significantly expanded upon by the employee to better address the task; significant additional and unexpected tasks
were successfully accomplished; objectives were consistently met well ahead of the deadline in order to facilitate future progress;
innovations had a major effect on the division or organization. Not every goal has the potential for an “Exceeds Expectations” level of
rating, since many goals must be completed exactly as described.
ACHIEVED GOAL:
Performance in this goal was consistently met. The objectives normally fell into the following area(s): the objective was accomplished and
was thorough and complete; and/or was accomplished efficiently; and/or met the deadlines; and/or was competently performed; and/or met
the quantity expectations; and/or met the quality expectations. Failure to meet any of these standards was typically due to conditions
outside the control of the employee.
NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
Performance in this goal failed to meet the minimum expectations of this position. The objectives always or frequently fell into one or more
of the following area(s): was not accomplished; was not accomplished by the deadline; was only accomplished due to other(s) performing
some or all of the portions of the task; was accomplished but quality was unacceptable; was accomplished but quantities were lower than
acceptable. This rating means that immediate and significant improvement is needed. An action plan to improve performance should be put
in place.

Proposed Tactical Plans for Strategic Goals/Priorities from March 5, 2016
RTD Board/Senior Leadership Team (SL T) Advance

Gen~neral Manager and CEO

On March 5, 2016, Board members and the SLT convened an Advance to mutually
discuss and agree upon strategic goals for the agency . These goals/priorities are meant to
drive the 2017 budget cycle. For example, goals established at the 2015 Advance are
driving the 2016 budget cycle and priorities.
The Board will recall that we came out of the Advance with three priorities:
•

Fiscal Sustainability (Strategic Goal # 1)

•

Workforce/Human Capital (Strategic Goal #2)

•

State of Good Repair (Strategic Goal #3)

In accordance with the Board Policy on the Goal Setting process for the General Manager,
the General Manager is to present the agreed upon goals/priorities with his tactical plan to
implement those priorities/goals at the April 26, 2016 Board Study Session.
I will present the tactical plan at the Board Study Session on Tuesday, April 26, 2016. In
advance of the short presentation at the Committee, please find attached the proposed
tactical plans that staff proposes to implement to realize the strategic goals set forth.
As always, we welcome your input/feedback.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #1
Fiscal Sustainability
Background
Throughout its history, RTD has had to adapt its service levels and capital programs to
different financial conditions due to the variability in sales and use taxes, its largest source
of revenue. One of the strategic goals established by the RTD Board for 2017 relates to
fiscal sustainability. The Board and staff identified the following specific focus areas:







Building Reserves
Discuss Impacts
Maintain Service Levels
Monitoring
Live within our Means
Identify new revenue sources

Building Reserves
The Board has adopted 2016 Fiscal Policies which includes a Fund Balance Policy. This
policy states the following:
 RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance in the Base System and in the FasTracks
operating budget, to provide for unanticipated expenditures. The unrestricted fund
balance will be comprised of a Board Appropriated Fund, a Capital Replacement
Fund, and an Undesignated Working Capital Fund. For the Base System, the total
of these three funds should be maintained at an amount approximately equal to
three (3) months of Base System operating expenses excluding depreciation. For
FasTracks, the total of these three (3) funds should be maintained at an amount
approximately equal to two (2) months of FasTracks operating funds excluding
depreciation. RTD will replenish fund balances as soon as economic conditions
allow. At the end of Calendar Year 2015, the Base System had a fund balance, as
prescribed above, of $79.5 million.
Based on three months of operating
expenditures that amount for year end 2015 should have been $104 million.
FasTracks had a fund balance, as prescribed above, of $18 million. The Base
System is not scheduled to reach the three month threshold until the end of
Calendar Year 2019.
In recent years, RTD has seen significant growth in the sales and use tax, i.e., 9.8% in
2014 and 5.2% in 2015. This level of growth won’t last forever and consideration should
be given to meeting the three months fund balance sooner rather than later. In addition,
RTD should consider establishing an operating reserve that would be budgeted each year
to be more responsive to forecasted revenues verses actual revenues. This would allow
for more flexibility in dealing with revenue changes as they could be adjusted through the
reserve rather than cutting back previously approved projects or service levels.
Building reserves would allow for more flexibility in dealing with future revenue shortfalls

12.D.c

which is important because of the inherent economic volatility of the district’s largest
revenue source, sales tax. Growth of these reserves requires discipline to set aside funds
in the short term rather than spending the funds on service in the short term. This shortterm constraint on spending is a strategic effort to improve the long term fiscal
sustainability of RTD.
Discuss Impacts
Each year RTD staff updates the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP), a six year plan for the Base
system, and the Annual Program Evaluation (APE), a long range plan (2040) for FasTracks.
In addition to being utilized for the DRCOG Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP) and
Long Range Plan (LRP), it provides a snapshot each year for the RTD Board and Staff to
plan for the future and understand the impacts of decisions that have been made and
those that are made today, and the impact on future revenues and operations. The SBP
becomes the basis for the annual budget each year. To remain fiscally sustainable, RTD
must annually balance the SBP while meeting service needs, addressing state of good
repair and building reserves.
Maintain Service Levels
Maintaining existing service levels is paramount to our customers especially with the
opening of five new lines of service in 2016. Unfortunately, service cuts have had to
occur in the not so distant past. In 2009, a service reduction of 6% was needed and
again in 2012 an 8% service reduction was implemented. Fortunately with steadily
increasing sales and use tax revenue since 2009, RTD has not had to make additional
service cuts. However at some point in the future, revenues will not increase at the
current rate and with the opening of five new service lines, operating and maintenance
costs will increase.
One of the ways to combat having to make service reductions is to have sufficient
reserves to be able to withstand fluctuations in the economy. As mentioned above, it is
prudent when economic conditions are favorable, as they are now, to make sure that
reserves are adequately funded so that service reductions are not required in the future to
balance the budget.
Monitoring
Monitoring of RTD’s financial condition is done at a variety of levels. Each month the
Board of Directors is provided a monthly financial report. The monthly financial report is
reviewed at the Finance and Administration committee each month. This report details
budget to actual both on a monthly basis as well as a year to date basis. This report also
contains a status of net position as well as an up to date accounting of the FISA. In
addition, beginning in mid-2015 staff began forecasting year end revenue shortfalls/
surpluses based on forecasts verses actuals.
At a staff level, monthly reports are provided by Accounting to the AGMs and budget
analysts so that expenditures can be monitored and corrective action taken. In addition,

Attachment: GM Tactical Plan for 2017 Goal #1 - Fiscal Sustainability Final (2855 : Approval of General Manager?s 2017 Goals)

12.D.c

Packet Pg. 178

each quarter in accordance with the Management Directive on Variance Reporting, each
Department head is required to submit an explanation to budget regarding any variance
between planned and actual expenditures that is +/- 10% and $100,000 or is deemed to
be material. This directive is intended to ensure that any issues are identified early in the
process and adjustments can be made to stay within budget.
Live within our Means
According to MoneyTalksNews.com there are 10 ways to make sure you can live within
your means.











Know your income and expenses
Track your expenses
Separate wants and needs
Don’t compete “with the Joneses”
Pay in cash
Keep an emergency fund
Save money wherever possible
Cut down on expenses
Boost your income
Don’t deprive yourself

Although these ways are intended for personal use, they are very applicable to RTD. As
was discussed above in both impacts and monitoring, RTD needs to develop a budget and
then monitor revenues and expenditures to ensure that if revenues are not meeting
expectations or expenditures are higher than anticipated then corrective action is taken
before it is too late.
The SBP project selection process is designed to try to separate the wants from what is
really needed to maintain, operate, and sustain the RTD system. Projects are scored based
on how they meet RTD’s mission as well as the consequences of not doing the project.
The more difficult one is not competing with other agencies or what other governments
are providing. It is easy to want to provide additional services and the best new thing to
our customers, but RTD may not be able to afford those without jeopardizing existing
service and infrastructure.
RTD has issued debt to fund projects and assets. Currently all voter authorized debt has
been issued for the Base System and most of the voter authorized debt has been issued
for FasTracks. RTD needs to be prudent in issuing additional debt to make sure that it fits
in with both short and long term financial considerations.
In 2016, RTD is looking at cutting expenses that don’t affect service, such as travel, food,
and other operating items that are nice to have but aren’t necessary to provide service to
our customers.

Packet Pg. 179

In building our reserves, it was discussed that money should be saved when revenues are
healthy and reserve funds should be built in order to provide for shortfalls that will
eventually occur.
The next section discusses opportunities for increasing resources. RTD has a proven track
record of being able to find opportunities to increase revenues.
The last item is “don’t deprive yourself.” There is such a thing as being too lean. RTD
needs to ensure that our system is safe and the infrastructure is being maintained.
Identification of New Revenue Sources
To date, RTD has implemented many things that have helped increase existing revenue
sources. They are:
 Increased sales tax revenue through exemption parity with the State
 January 1, 2016 implementation of the new fare structure and rates
 Implemented a naming rights program
Partnerships





Implementation of public private partnerships (P3) proposals for FasTracks, and for
other projects that provide benefits to RTD and fit within the financial plans
Pursuit of partnerships with FasTracks stakeholders to obtain additional local match
funds to complete FasTracks corridors
Leasing and contracting for the operation and management of assets that can be
operated by third parties at a cost savings, such as parking facilities
Development of shared facilities including parking, transfer centers, plazas,
walkways and bike-facilities at transit oriented or joint development projects where
RTD and developers can combine resources and reduce costs for site development
and amenities and operating cost

In March of 2013 RTD and the Union executed a five year agreement. That agreement is
scheduled to expire in February of 2018. In the latter half of 2017, RTD and the Union
will commence negotiations for the next contract. Covered in the agreements are such
things as:
 Pension
 Health and Welfare Trust
 Salary and Progression
 Working Conditions
In early 2017, we will initiate a negotiating team workgroup to begin the framework for
negotiations. Economic challenges are anticipated to address wages, pension, and health
and welfare.
Health and Welfare
The Union Health and Welfare Trust are governed by six Trustees. Three are appointed by
the Union and three are appointed by the General Manager. This governing body is
responsible for making plan decisions such as the employee contributions, deductibles, and
co-pays. These decisions of course affect the cost of the plans to both RTD and the
employees.
Over the last couple of years it has become apparent that this plan has become less and
less solvent. In 2015, the plan was struggling to meet its monthly obligations and health
care providers were being paid months in arrears. The Trustees met and made some plan
changes in late 2015, which are projected to allow the plan to remain solvent at least
through 2016. The Health and Welfare plan will have to be addressed in the next contract
negotiations with the Union.
Morale
The 2015 All Employee Survey indicated a large percentage of employees are engaged and
sense a feeling of enablement. However, approximately 40% of employees have low
levels of both engagement and enablement which may contribute to low morale. The
survey also indicated that communication up and down the chain of command and across
work groups can be improved. Additional survey responses from employees regarding
strategy, vision and decision-making at RTD were identified as areas for improvement.
RTD has undertaken three continuous improvement pilots to address morale issues
revealed in the Employee Survey and explore different paths to address the concerns
voiced in the survey.
Customer Care and Platte Bus Maintenance with support from policy analysis staff are
piloting process improvement training and facilitation called RTD Peak Academy (modeled
on the City and County of Denver’s Peak Academy lean process improvement
methodology). These trainings and continued support through Innovation Labs and
specialized workshops aim to give employees at every level of the organization tools to
identify and eliminate waste and coaching to propose innovations that serve internal and

Additionally, the Rail Operations Department has begun an intra-departmental pilot focused
on identifying and exploring employee concerns with monthly meetings modelled on the
successful Safety Meetings RTD has conducted for years. The policy analysis group is also
piloting a new tool, RTD Connect, for bus and rail operators to interface with support
staff.
Continuous improvement methods designed to create employee resolution and ownership
will continue throughout the organization. A follow-up survey will be conducted in 2017
to measure improvement from the baseline established in 2015.
Recruitment and Retention
As the economy has improved and unemployment has dropped to under 3% in the Denver
Metro area, recruiting has become much more challenging particularly in the areas of bus
operators, light rail operators, and mechanics. Hiring qualified applicants is not just a
Human Resource function, so recognizing that, RTD established a Recruitment and
Retention Working Group late last summer. This group is tasked with working together to
improve our recruitment process and working on ways to increase retention. Members of
that working group include: AGM of Rail, AGM of Bus, AGM of Communications, AGM of
Finance and Administration, HR, Marketing, State of Good Repair, and Bus Operations.
The following improvements have been made:
 “RTD is Hiring” messages on all buses and RTD vehicles.
 Advertising on billboards
 RTD Hiring Bus
 Holding “One-Stop” Hiring sessions on weekends and weeknights
 Hiring Bonus of $2,000
 Referral Bonus of $1,000
 Increase in shift differential and split shift pay
Since the inception of these changes late last year, the number of new applicants has
increased by 89.3% and new hires in the targeted areas has increased by 83.6%.1
Continued efforts include:
 Targeting specific sectors of the community that might produce more applicants for
bus operators, light rail operators, and mechanics.
 More research on what attracts people to RTD so we can appeal to that dynamic
 Looking at pay and benefits for these occupational groups through future CBA
negotiations
Efforts thus far, have been to focus on recruitment with several items focused on
retention. A recent review showed that approximately 7% of bus operators left within the
first 18 months. We are closely monitoring recruitment and retention vis-a-vis the
improvements made to date.

RTD has a very robust training and development program. Each salaried employee is
offered $2,000/ year and each represented employee is offered $1,500/year towards
education and training. In addition, RTD offers “free of charge” classes such as Word,
Excel, Power Point, and other classes to provide job enrichment. RTD also has the
Leadership Academy and the MAX program.
The Leadership Academy is designed to support RTD’s emerging leaders by focusing on
the relationship of mission, values, culture, and strategic priorities. Members of this oneyear educational program engage in a comprehensive coursework that provides them with
the tools and resources to successfully guide RTD in the coming years. Employees
selected for the program benefit from professional training and mentoring. By offering a
dynamic environment for the development of leadership mastery, organizational
stewardship, business fundamentals, and technical competencies, the Leadership
Academy promotes the advancement of RTD employees. Since its inception 95 current
employees have completed the program. The 2016 Leadership Academy class has 25
employees who will graduate in December of 2016 increasing the total number of
employees who have completed the program to 120.
The Multi-Agency Exchange Program (MAX) is a program designed to create future Transit
Leaders and to provide the public with continuity through the evolution of the industry and
the needs of our patrons. MAX is designed to leverage best practices of the industry in
order to minimize the learning curve and reduce the cost and time to implement new
programs. MAX participants are from RTD, Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Current RTD
participants in the program must also be graduates of the Leadership Academy.
Goals of the MAX Program are to (1) Provide a better understanding of transit industry
needs between agencies (2) Create an environment that provides a positive network for
learning and support in our unique industry (3) Provide a safe platform for candid
interactions between all agencies (4) Define high impact areas within our agencies,
including: Safety, Run cutting, Operations, Human Resources, and Capital Programs. The
4 agencies of the 2016 MAX program are focusing on Security, Recruitment and
Retention, and Employee Development as high impact areas. Since its inception in 2011,
26 current RTD employees have completed the program.
We are exploring the feasibility of an agency-wide mentoring program for employee
development utilizing Leadership Academy graduates as the core cadre for the program.
We are working on an advanced program learning path for graduates of the Leadership
Academy and the MAX program that would include a combination of newly developed
internal classes as well as external leadership programs such as Leadership APTA and Eno
Foundation courses.
We are continuing, in partnership with IT, to seek a platform to deliver computer based
training (CBT) that will communicate with our Oracle Learning Management system.
Managers/senior leaders from other departments either have developed or would like to
partner with Education CBT training courses in areas such as, but not limited to Ethics,

Succession Planning
Over 54% of RTD’s workforce is over the age of 50, including 4 employees over the age
of 80. Although employees seem to be working longer, eventually they will leave taking
years of knowledge with them. Two of the efforts that are intended to assist with
succession planning are the Leadership Academy and the MAX program. Another large
issue that needs to be addressed is Information Governance. Many RTD employees are
vested and eligible to retire. Knowledge management and retention of institutional
knowledge is critical to the continuity of business and it is imperative that RTD develop
and implement systems and processes to capture this historical information. That
information needs to be available to new employees in the form of Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and the ability to access past information. The ECM project authorized
by the Board last year is a key mechanism to address SOPs and provide ready access to
information.
In 2012, each major department began identifying key positions and the associated
requisite skills within their department. As these become clearly identified and included
into SOPs, development paths can be created for employees who wish to move into those
positions. All departments will update their leadership and succession plans in 2017.
Recognition
One of the 2013 Leadership Academy class projects was entitled “Employee Value
Program.” The team developed a project vision to describe the intended outcome of the
program. It was, “To have and keep happy employees by engaging both employees and
managers.” This vision was supported by the program mission: “To use spot on
recognition to motivate employees to provide safe, reliable, and courteous service.” The
project team also developed specific goals to measure the effectiveness of the Employee
Value Program:




To encourage goal alignment from top to bottom throughout District
To encourage the documentation of criteria so employees know what to work
towards and can easily reference those goals and criteria.
Improve recognition delivery and tracking, making the reward effective and
meaningful.

Based on the research and the employee survey, the project group developed
recommendations for an on-going Employee Value Program:
 Continuation and enhancement of existing formal recognition programs
 Establishment of informal recognition programs
 Development of employee recognition training for all managers and supervisors at
RTD
 Establishment of a permanent rotating Employee Recognition Committee to oversee
the Program

As part of this project, an employee survey was conducted and an implementation plan
developed. To date, this project hasn’t been implemented. We will review this work in
2017 and determine if this or a like plan should be initiated.
Working Conditions
RTD employees work in a variety of settings including: on-board operators; maintainers at
maintenance divisions; field staff working on maintenance, landscaping, infrastructure, and
field supervision; and office environments. Management staff maintains facilities and
working conditions to provide good work environments per work classification categories.
RTD employees are also subject to a variety of policies, procedures and rules depending on
work assignment. Efforts are made to make work policy effective and provide good
working conditions. RTD conducted stay interviews with front line workers to determine
employees concerns.



From the Stay interviews conducted by ET&D, LR and HR, front line workers raised
concerns about rest breaks/relief stations and the demanding schedule that
prevents the opportunity to take advantage of them. Operators understand the
necessity for split shifts; however, some split schedules are too lengthy, stretching
out their days considerably.
Safety was brought up, with some operators suggesting a driver “barrier” would
make them feel safer (a barrier to separate operators from the public on buses),
while others prefer no barrier.
Consistency in supervisor treatment was raised, for example some supervisors
demanding specifics for the reason the driver is calling in sick.
Complaints come to the attention of the driver immediately; compliments take too
long.
The extra board is difficult for a new driver.

We will continue to monitor work areas and work policy to create efficient and desirable
working conditions.

GM TACTICAL PLAN FOR 2017
Strategic Goal #3
State of Good Repair – O&M
Background
In 2017 RTD will experience expanded operations and maintenance resulting from the
opening of five lines in 2016 and continued emphasis on the base system. At the same
time, our Asset Management and State of Good Repair program matures to encompass all
asset types.
RTD relies heavily on physical assets and exercising life-cycle management principles for
better operating results, system performance and efficiency. Assets exist to support the
delivery of transit service, so their value is dependent on RTD’s objectives, expectations
and system needs.
Asset Management consistently applied from the highest levels enables RTD to work
collectively and more effectively in realizing and extracting value from our assets. Asset
management, because of its interplay with other agency functions, provides an excellent
catalyst for the integration of all organizational strategies, goals and objectives.
Good asset management or State of Good Repair is a strategic data-driven approach that
guides our investments, resources, and policy decisions to achieve goals. Results help us
highlight areas of challenge, identify necessary adjustments, and communicate measured
success. International Standards Organization or ISO 55000 is one of the best examples of
the application of organizational management system and subsequently, supports working
towards achieving and maintaining a “state of good repair”. The descriptions below
provide the tactical approaches to accomplish this board goal while supporting and aligning
with RTD’s missions and all other agency goals.
The objective of RTD’s State of Good Repair program is to optimize the use or value from
our assets at the lowest possible cost of ownership while managing other risks.
Certification to the ISO 55000 Standard will provide evidence that RTD’s investment and
expenditure on assets meets with this overall objective and is in alignment with RTD’s
overall business strategy. Moving this goal forward also demonstrates to both regulators
and other stakeholders that assets are being appropriately maintained while addressing
short, medium and long term risks. In addition, independent certification provides evidence
of compliance to safety critical systems and procedures.
ISO 55000 is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
should begin pursuit as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management.
Benefits from the goal of State of Good Repair and the ISO standard encompass the
following aspects:




Safety and Reliability
Maintaining What we have
Ensure Service & Accessibility

Safety & Reliability
We continue to view safety as our #1 priority. RTD has an unwavering commitment to
provide safe services to our customers and stakeholders. RTD will implement the FTA’s
mandated Safety Management System framework including:




Dashboard safety reports
Document and implement the Asset Management / State of Good Repair safety
connection
Creation of automated system notifications of asset requiring further safety
evaluations

The Nexus between State of Good Repair and Safety was established with the passage of
MAP-21. The FTA adopted the principles and methods of Public Transportation Safety
Management Systems to guide its development and implementation. Safety Management
System (SMS) is a comprehensive, collaborative organization-wide data-driven approach to
managing safety risk. This system will build on RTD’s existing safety foundation to
mitigate risk, detect and proactively correct safety problems, share and analyze safety
data more effectively, and measure safety performance more carefully. SMS is the formal,
top-down business approach to managing safety risk, which includes a systemic approach
to managing safety, including the necessary organizational structures, accountabilities,
policies and procedures.
A fundamental aspect of RTD’s Asset Management program is the monitoring of asset
condition and performance as an indicator of system health. The data derived from
condition assessments inform the RTD of some practices related to SMS, to the extent
that an asset's condition could impact its safety. Maintaining assets in a state of good
repair will drive high reliability.
Maintaining What We Have
The operations and maintenance areas within departments do an exceptional job
maintaining what we have through established maintenance programs. RTD will continue
to utilize current maintenance programs and continue to submit strategic budget plan
(SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of good repair. It should be noted that many
SBP projects that are submitted are deferred due to a lack of resources. This has been a
recurring concern during the SBP process for the last several years. RTD prioritizes SBP
requests, however, resource limitations prevent all projects, some of which may be linked
to state of good repair, from being addressed.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets, exercising a life-cycle management approach
creates better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all assets involves a common set of elements.

In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the lifecycle cost,
physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary. This data-driven
practice aims to maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and
manage risks. These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in
implementation. Steps to achieving this goal include:






Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Evaluate all current maintenance strategies and plans
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all rolling stock,
infrastructure and facilities, and
Generate an annual report on RTD’s state of good repair.

Ensure Service & Accessibility (see also Maintain Service Levels)
In order to ensure that services continue to meet the ever-changing needs of our
communities, we must focus on reliability and accessibility. In addition to these objectives
RTD implements service changes three times per year. These changes compounded with
the opening of 5 lines will necessitate emphasis be placed specifically on our service &
accessibility. We will continue to focus on service planning to:



Comply with service standards,
Measure productive of service by route / line – insure expansion and cuts follow a
policy related to highest service and accessibility standards.

Service and accessibility are dependent on our system availability and maintenance. We
will continue to recruit and retain employees to assure delivery of service, and we will
continue with maintenance programs so that assets are available and accessibility is
preserved.
Maintain Infrastructure
Maintaining the condition of our transit infrastructure is critical for RTD and one that poses
pressing challenges for most of the Nation’s transit systems. RTD has several categories
of infrastructure: rail and bus maintenance facilities; track, power, signal and
communication systems; stations and park-n-rides; and various IT and security-related
systems. RTD’s bus maintenance divisions are approximately 30-40 years old and present
a variety of on-going maintenance challenges. Many of these challenges are addressed
through SBP projects, however, it is important to realize the age of these facilities and plan
for the long-term replacement as well as day-to-day maintenance. The original light rail
system is now over 20 years old and beginning to require some replacement and major
maintenance activities as well as day-to-day work. The focus of RTD’s SBP program
should prioritize infrastructure maintenance.

The Board of Directors and RTD staff have taken the lead in the industry to comply with
MAP-21 and Fast Act established and forthcoming standards. The final State of Good
Repair / Asset Management rule making is expected in mid-2017 and RTD has been
intimately involved at the national level in shaping this legislation. The goal is that RTD
will be fully compliant and meet the implementation schedules set forth by the FTA, and
Department of Transportation. As industry leaders the secondary goal is to examine the
benefits of the full implementation of the ISO 55000 international standard. Because the
ISO standard is the highest standard in obtaining optimum value from physical assets, RTD
will pursue it as the next step in its strategic approach to asset management. Long-term
benefits from the standard encompass the following aspects:




Maintain Facilities
RTD has thousands of facilities and related assets that range in age from over decades old
to new construction. Maintaining the condition of our transit facilities is critical for the
safe and reliable delivery of service. The operations and maintenance areas within
departments do an exceptional job maintaining what we have through established
maintenance programs. RTD will continue to utilize current maintenance programs and
continue to submit strategic budget plan (SBP) projects to maintain assets in a state of
good repair.
Since RTD relies heavily on physical assets exercising a life-cycle management approach
supports better operating results, system performance and ultimately lower costs. The
lifecycle management and maintenance of all facilities assets involves a common set of
elements. In order to achieve and maintain a “State of Good repair” evaluation of the
lifecycle cost, physical condition, and performance of each class of assets is necessary.
The link between life-cycle management expenditures such as rehabilitation, preventive
maintenance, and unplanned maintenance to asset performance include mean cost per
square foot and frequency and time out of service. This data-driven practice aims to
maximize asset performance, minimize the total cost of ownership, and manage risks.
These elements are common to all asset classes, but differ in implementation. Steps to
achieving this goal include:




Complete asset register capturing all necessary attributes
Identify asset and business risks
Measure and analyze age, cost, condition and performance of all facilities.
