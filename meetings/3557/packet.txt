Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
1660 Blake Street
Denver, CO 80202
Dear Board of Directors:
We are in the process of planning for the audit of the financial statements of The Regional Transportation
District (“RTD”) for the year ended December 31, 2022. An important aspect of planning for the audit is
communication with those who have responsibility for overseeing the strategic direction of the RTD and
obligations related to the accountability of the RTD. At RTD, these responsibilities and obligations are held
by the Board of Directors, collectively and individually; therefore, it is important for us to communicate with
each of you in your role as a member of the Board of Directors.
As part of this communication process, we plan to speak with the Audit Committee Chair, regarding our
responsibilities under generally accepted auditing standards and the planned scope and timing of our audit.
The purpose of this letter is to provide each of you with a summary of those discussions and to provide you
with the opportunity to communicate with us on matters that may impact our audit.
Our Responsibility Under Generally Accepted Auditing Standards and Generally Accepted
Government Auditing Standards
As stated in our engagement letter addressed to RTD and dated January 9, 2023, our responsibility, as
described by professional standards, is to express an opinion about whether the financial statements
prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented, in all material respects, in conformity
with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve
you or management of your responsibilities.
In accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAO Standards), we are required
to communicate all noncompliance with provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, or grants that have a
material effect on the financial statements that comes to our attention. GAO Standards also require that we
report any instances of abuse identified during that audit that could be quantitatively or qualitatively material
to the financial statements.
We expect to include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the auditor’s report, if implementation results in
a material amount, informing the users of the financial statements about the implementation of GASB 87,
Leases. The proposed wording of the emphasis of matter paragraph follows:
As explained in Note XX, RTD adopted the provisions of Governmental Accounting Standards
Board Statement No. 87, Leases, which gives guidance on the identification and reporting of lease
activities. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.
Overview of the Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit
Our audit fieldwork will include three phases. The planning and preliminary information-gathering phase will
occur during December and January; the risk assessment phase in February 2023; and the rest of our audit
procedures will be performed during March 2023.

January 10, 2023

To plan an effective audit, we must identify significant risks of misstatement in the financial statements,
including those related to changes in the financial reporting framework or changes in the entity’s
environment, financial condition, or activities, and design procedures to address those risks.
We identified the following significant risks of misstatement:


Proper accounting treatment for ARPA funding received by RTD including accuracy and
completeness of the Schedule of Federal Awards (SEFA)



Risk that expenses could be double counted in multiple grant reimbursements



Proper accounting and reporting for new GASB 87 standard

In response to these identified significant risks, we will perform the following:


Assess whether the ARPA funds were spent in accordance with the Act and that related
transactions are recorded correctly in the general ledger. We will also test and assess the
completeness of the SEFA in conjunction with the Single Audit of Federal Awards.



Reconciliation of grant revenues to amounts recorded in the financial statements



We will obtain RTD’s evaluation of the impact of GASB 87 and audit those conclusions to ensure
proper adherence and changes to RTD’s general ledger

We will gain an understanding of accounting processes and key internal controls through a review of the
accounting procedures questionnaires and control procedures questionnaires prepared by management.
We will confirm through observation and inspection procedures that accounting procedures and controls
included in the questionnaires have been implemented. In addition, we plan to perform testing of the
effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. We will not express an opinion on the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting; however, we will communicate to you significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses identified in connection with our audit.
The concept of materiality is inherent in our work. We place greater emphasis on those items that have, on
a relative basis, more importance to the financial statements and greater possibilities of material error than
with those items of lesser importance or those in which the possibility of material error is remote.
Information from You Relevant to Our Audit
An important aspect of this communication process is the opportunity for us to obtain from you information
that is relevant to our audit. Your views about any of the following are relevant to our audit:


RTD’s objectives and strategies and the related business risks that may result in material
misstatements



Matters that you consider warrant particular attention during the audit and any areas where you
want to request additional procedures be undertaken



Significant communications between RTD and regulators



Understanding of RTD’s relationships and transactions with related parties that are significant to
RTD and any concerns regarding those relationships or transactions



The attitudes, awareness, and actions concerning:

The actions of the Board of Directors in response to developments in accounting standards,
regulations, laws, previous communications from us, and other related matters and the effect of
such developments on, for example, the overall presentation, structure, and content of the financial
statements, including the following:
o

The relevance, reliability, comparability, and understandability of the information presented
in the financial statements

o

Whether all required information has been included in the financial statements and whether
such information has been appropriately classified, aggregated or disaggregated, and
presented

If you have any information to communicate to us regarding the above or any other matters you believe are
relevant to the audit, or if you would like to discuss the audit in more detail, please call me at 810.766.6022.
Thank you for your time and consideration in this important aspect of the audit process. You can expect to
hear from us again after the completion of our audit when we will report to you the significant findings from
the audit.
Very truly yours,

Enterprise Risk Management – Process Overview
Enterprise Risk Management is:
The “culture, capabilities, and practices, integrated with
strategy setting and performance, that organizations
rely on to manage risk in creating, preserving, and
realizing value” (1).
Purpose:
RTD participated in a formal enterprise risk assessment
(ERA) across all of its functions. Management will utilize
the ERA results to identify and mitigate potential key
risk events. RTD’s management will also use the ERA
results in corporate governance discussions with the
Board of Directors.

Risk Ranking Process
The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) survey asked each participant to rate potential risk events based on the
severity, probability, and risk preparedness. Participants were asked to consider the following:
Severity – If the risk event occurs, how severe will the consequences be given the controls and processes in place to
mitigate or lower the impact?
Probability – What is the likelihood that the controls and processes designed to mitigate this risk event will not prevent
or detect the risk event?
Risk Preparedness – When assessing the risk preparedness, reflect on the RTD's current processes and controls
designed to prevent the risk event and/or manage the risk event if it does occur. The key questions to consider when
rating the risk preparedness are:
1.

How well is RTD monitoring potential risk events?

2.

Has RTD implemented controls and processes for preventing, where possible, the risk event from occurring?

3.

How prepared is RTD to address the risk event if it occurs?

From Management Group Respondents:

 In the past, there has been an inability or lack of desire from leadership to make difficult decisions. Not the case at
the moment but must be considered for the future.

 RTD has become involved in areas outside of their operational scope (e.g., having mental health people on staff for
the public).
