RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

Transit is only efective when riders can access it. First and Last Mile (FLM) is the problem of getting to transit (frst mile) and getting
to your fnal destination (last mile).
Not all trips are the same, and frst mile trips
often difer from last mile trips in length, mode
of travel, and purpose. Similarly, trips to access transit are not necessarily limited by a
one-mile radius but can difer depending on
the mode of travel used to access the transit
service.

What’s in the Plan?
This First and Last Mile Strategic Plan (the
Plan) covers FLM strategies for multiple types
of transit stations and stops in a variety of settings. Recommendations include:
•

Strategies related to new infrastructure

•

Methods to reuse current infrastructure

•

General FLM guidance

•

Transportation demand management
(TDM)

•

New transportation services

This Plan is not intended to be a prescriptive
guide to implementing FLM strategies and
recommendations, but provides a framework
from which to select a tailored set of FLM
strategies to improve transit access.

T
AF 9

DR 3/

Diferent levels of transit service may have
diferent catchments for a FLM trip. For example, an end-of-line light rail service with high
frequency will likely have a wider catchment
area than a local bus stop along an urban
arterial roadway.

Why is FLM important to transit
agencies?

FLM is an essential concept for transit agencies. Improving access to and from transit for
a wider breadth of people will ultimately lead
to a better catchment for transit ridership. This
includes providing better access to transit for
multiple modes, rather than focusing on one
specifc mode, and introducing new incentives
and travel options to access transit.

Flexibility during a changing mobility
landscape
During the 18 months this Plan was developed, the mobility landscape changed dramatically. Shared scooters were introduced to
the Denver region, while some micromobility
and shared dockless bike providers dissolved
or left the region. RTD reacted to emerging
technologies and the shifting landscape in
several ways. First, RTD developed the Regional Mobility Working Group, comprised of
mobility practitioners from agencies across
the RTD region. The Regional Mobility Work-

1.C.1.b

RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

Since the summit, RTD has engaged and delivered on multiple new mobility ideas. Notable developments include:

VISION AND GOALS
The Plan’s vision is to defne strategies and
policies that will improve multimodal transportation and connectivity to RTD services and
facilities by making RTD more accessible to
more people, thus increasing ridership.
The Plan aims to improve transit accessibility
by empowering local jurisdictions, transportation management associations (TMAs), and
other partners to understand the range of FLM
solutions that are available and then apply
those solutions to specifc station areas. As
FLM strategies and recommendations often
span across jurisdictional boundaries, partnerships will be key to implementation.

Revamp and renaming of RTD’s Call-nRide service to FlexRide, which introduced
a mobile app to book trips

•

Partnerships with Transportation Network
Companies (TNCs) to improve access to
RTD service

•

Develop attainable strategies to improve
multimodal access and remove barriers
to and from RTD facilities

•

The deployment of the region’s frst autonomous transit shuttle

•

•

The execution of license agreements with
e-scooter/e-bike share companies to deploy on RTD property

Defne clear roles and responsibilities
for the implementation of FLM strategies
and recommendations

•

Improve transit “usefulness” to a greater
portion of the public

•

Consider implications of rapid changes
in technology that may impact the future
of transportation and FLM solutions

T

•

To better meet these changing times, the Plan
has become more than a static, stand-alone
document. The Plan has been developed to
form a living, dynamic framework for FLM to
ensure integration of future changes in the
mobility landscape.

The Plan has multiple goals, as defned below:

Throughout the process of developing the
Plan, partnerships, and information sharing
were two key components. The project team
brought together two stakeholder groups to
help guide the development of this Plan:
•

The Internal Working Group (IWG) made
up of RTD staf

•

The Project Planning Advisory
Committee (PPAC) made up of local and
regional agencies, TMAs and non-profts

The Plan also included public outreach, using
an online comments tool and several events
where people could provide comments on
their FLM issues and barriers.

ing Group had several objectives, including
collaboration and the sharing of information
and ideas across the region. This resulted in
the planning and execution of RTD’s Transportation Transformation (T2) summit, which was
held on September 13, 2018. The T2 summit
brought people from across the region together to learn about new mobility technology
and to gather input for the role of RTD in the
changing mobility landscape.

KEY RECOMMENDATIONS

1.C.1.b

RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

The typologies used in this Plan are based on
the Denver Regional Council of Governments
(DRCOG) Generalized Zoning (2016). Typologies are arranged on a continuum of very
high to very low employment density, residential density, and transit frequency, with Urban
Core having the highest densities and transit
frequencies and Rural the lowest.
Diferent density and land use contexts demand diferent types of FLM strategies. What
works well for improving FLM access in an
urban setting may be much less efective in
a Suburban-Residential area, and vice versa.
Therefore, identifying the typology for each
transit study area is the frst step in an FLM
analysis.
Figure 1.1 shows the basic characteristics of
the fve typologies. See Chapter 3 for more
information about typologies, including the
applicability of recommendations to diferent
typologies.

RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

Overlays are additional context types that are relevant to transit access. Transit stations or stops with
overlays have particular needs or considerations that should be taken into account when conducting an
FLM analysis. For instance, locations with a High Accessibility Needs overlay may require the prioritization of Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) infrastructure. Locations that are within a High Propensity
for Change overlay will require more fuid strategies to account for the changing built environment or
demographics. Figure 1.2 includes descriptions of each overlay. For additional information on overlays
see Chapter 3.
Description

Historically
Vulnerable
Populations

This overlay uses a combination of six socioeconomic indicators, including age, language, race, income,
education, and access to a vehicle, to identify where historically vulnerable populations are concentrated.
Research suggests that this combination of factors can be used to determine areas where more people may
rely on walking, bicycling, and transit to complete most of their trips, relative to other areas within the District.
The analysis does not assess the quality of transit services (or other transportation infrastructure) in these
areas, but can be used as a planning tool to guide how and where these assessments are conducted.

Diferent than transit equity, this focuses on locations with a high dependency on transit due to individual
physical ability. For example, this would include locations near hospitals, or with many people who are elderly or require ADA accessibility. FLM solutions can expand the range of travel options available to people with
mobility challenges.

Locations with a high shift/visitor variability or irregular commute pattern (e.g., outside of the usual peak
times). Examples include shift work at industrial centers, retail centers, or universities.
High Shift/
Visitor
Variability

Locations with extremely high numbers of visitor trips at very specifc times, such as, Broncos Stadium at Mile
High stadium or Pepsi Center.

High Visitor
Trips
Locations in areas with a high propensity for change will require more fuid strategies as the location moves
from one type of built environment and/or surrounding demographics to another.
High
Propensity for
Change
In locations with very high levels of parking utilization or locations that are currently not meeting the demand
for parking, FLM solutions can reduce the need to build more parking and encourage alternative access to
stations other than Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) trips.

The FLM strategies toolkit includes strategies
for improving FLM access organized into fve
themes: Reuse and Improvements of Existing
Infrastructure, New Infrastructure, FLM General Guidance, TDM, and Transportation Service.
Themes vary in their applicability to typologies.
Diferent agencies are also responsible for implementing the strategies falling under the diferent
themes. For instance, New Infrastructure focuses

primarily on the construction of infrastructure on
RTD property, while TDM strategies are typically
spearheaded by other agencies, such as a TMA.
Once an existing conditions analysis for a location
is complete, practitioners can select strategies
from the toolkit depending on the station typology, overlays (if any), and other needs of the study
area. Toolkit themes are described in Figure 1.3.

RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

The project team focused on the Urban, Suburban-Mixed, and Suburban-Residential typologies
for a number of reasons: the vast majority of RTD
transit locations (95 percent) fall within these
types, they encompass the broadest range of
FLM strategies, and implementation of strategies
at these locations has the highest potential for
impact. Though FLM strategies are most relevant
to these three typologies, with careful analysis
they can still be applied efectively to Urban Core
and Rural transit areas.
Figures 1.4 - 1.6 list the representative transit locations analyzed by typology, including any relevant
overlays. Appendix C contains the full existing
conditions and recommendations for each station.

The fnal key output of this Plan is the analysis of
15 RTD representative transit locations. The project team analyzed rail stations, Park-n-Ride stations, and bus stop locations from Urban, Suburban-Mixed, and Suburban-Residential typologies.
For each location, they conducted feld work and
gathered data on four factors pertaining to FLM:
Active Transportation, Curbside Management and
Parking, Transit Frequency and Travel Patterns,
and Land Ownership. The existing conditions fndings, including the typology and overlays (if any)
informed the selection of strategies from the FLM
strategies toolkit.

RTD FIRST LAST MILE STRATEGIC PLAN

In order to further examine and test some of the FLM strategies outlined in this Plan, the project
team identifed three pilot projects that RTD will develop and implement following Plan completion. The three pilot projects will cover wayfnding, mobility hubs, and microtransit. Further detail
is provided in Appendix E.

HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT
This document is intended to be used by local governments and other agencies to understand
FLM solutions and how they can be implemented at any location in the RTD district. The typologies, overlays, FLM strategies toolkit, and representative transit locations analyses contained
within the FLM framework are intended to guide users on how to complete their own FLM plan
for one or more stations. The four step process illustrated in Figure 1.7 will guide you through an
FLM analysis and application of strategies.

Step 1. Identify a typology and any overlays

The frst step in conducting a FLM analysis is to identify the typology of your transit station or
stop. Appendix A includes a typology map of the entire RTD district, as well as a spreadsheet
with every RTD station and stop listed with its associated typology. Also identify any overlays
that apply to your station or stop. See page 3-30 for full descriptions of each overlay.

Step 2: Choose a representative transit location that is similar to the station of
interest
The second step is to identify one of the representative transit locations below that is similar to
your station of interest. See Appendix B for the representative transit locations existing conditions analysis and application of FLM strategies. Use this as a guide when conducting your own
analysis.

Step 3: Conduct analysis for each focus area

Collect data for each of the focus areas below. See Chapter 3 for more information about these
focus areas. Pages 3-27 through 3-30 include detailed descriptions of how the project team
conducted assessments of active transportation and curbside management and parking.

Step 4: Apply *toolkit strategies
The fourth and fnal step is to apply strategies (pictured b from the FLM toolkit that are most
applicable to your station. The typology is the frst indication of the potential strategies that are
likely to be relevant, but ultimately, the results of the existing conditions analysis in Step 3 will
guide the specifc strategies that you choose. The result will be a tailored set of FLM strategies
that, once implemented, will improve FLM access to your station. Appendix C includes the FLM
toolkit and resource sheets for each strategy. The resource sheets include a description of the
strategy, a discussion on how they are applicable to the overlays and typologies, implementing
agencies, potential funding sources, and a case study or resource for further information.
