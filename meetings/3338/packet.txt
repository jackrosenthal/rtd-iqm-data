BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2021 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report
to Governance

Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Regional Transportation District’s Annual Comprehensive
Financial Report, that includes audited financial reports relating to the year ended December 31, 2021.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Byron Aten, Senior Manager, Accounting
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Colorado state statutes require an annual financial audit be performed on the financial statements of
governmental agencies by independent certified public accountants. RTD is required to provide these
annual audited financial statements to the State of Colorado, external entities and other government
organizations to be in full compliance with legal covenants, debt agreements and other contractual
agreements. The audit firm Plante Moran, PLLC, performed the financial audit of RTD’s financial
statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.
In addition to the financial statement audit requirements set forth in state statute, the audit also was
designed to fulfill the requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984. A Single Audit is required by
the Federal Transit Administration to review the expenditures of federal grant awards.
DISCUSSION
As stated in Plante Moran’s unmodified opinion, the financial statements in the enclosed Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
RTD as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for the
2021 and 2020 fiscal years in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with the adoption of this recommended action.

May 23, 2022
Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District
State law requires that all general-purpose local governments publish within seven months of the
close of each fiscal year a complete set of financial statements presented in conformance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards by a firm of licensed certified public accountants. Pursuant to that
requirement, the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report of the Regional Transportation District
(RTD) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, is hereby issued.
This report consists of management’s representations concerning RTD’s finances. Consequently,
management assumes full responsibility for the completeness and reliability of all of the
information presented in this report. To provide a reasonable basis for making these
representations, management has established a comprehensive internal control framework that is
designed both to protect the government’s assets from loss, theft, or misuse and to compile
sufficient, reliable information for the preparation of RTD’s financial statements in conformity with
GAAP. The cost of internal controls should not outweigh the benefits, RTD’s comprehensive
framework of internal controls has been designed to provide reasonable rather than absolute
assurance that the financial statements will be free from material misstatement. As the General
Manager and CEO, I assert that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this financial report is
complete and reliable in all material respects.
RTD’s financial statements have been audited by Plante & Moran, PLLC, a firm of licensed certified
public accountants. The goal of the independent audit was to provide reasonable assurance that
the financial statements of RTD for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, are free of material
misstatement. The independent audit involved examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements; assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management; and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. The independent auditor concluded, based upon the audit, that there was a
reasonable basis for rendering an unmodified opinion that RTD’s financial statements for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2021, are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP. The independent
auditor’s report is presented as the first component of the Financial Section of this report.
The independent audit of the financial statements of RTD was part of a broader, federally
mandated “Single Audit” designed to meet the special needs of federal grantor agencies. The
standards governing Single Audit engagements require the independent auditor to report not only
on the fair presentation of the financial statements, but also on the audited government’s internal
controls and compliance with legal requirements, with special emphasis on internal controls and
legal requirements involving the administration of federal awards. These reports are in RTD’s
separately issued Single Audit Report.

GAAP requires that management provide a narrative introduction, overview, and analysis to
accompany the basic financial statements in the form of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A). This letter of transmittal is designed to complement the MD&A and should be read in
conjunction with it. RTD’s MD&A can be found immediately following the report of the
independent auditors.
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (RTD)
RTD provides public mass transportation service to the Denver metropolitan area. In 1969, the
Colorado General Assembly (Assembly) found that public transit was a necessary part of the
growing Denver metropolitan region. The Assembly found that public sector involvement was the
best method to ensure the continuation of this vital service. Thus, RTD was created as a political
subdivision of the State effective July 1969 “to develop, maintain, and operate a public mass
transportation system for the benefit of the District.”
RTD boundaries now include Jefferson, Boulder, and Denver counties, most of the City and County
of Broomfield, and portions of Adams, Douglas, Weld, and Arapahoe counties. Over 3.09 million
people reside within RTD’s 2,342 square mile service area.
Since 1983, RTD has had a 15-member Board of Directors that are elected by their constituents
to serve four-year terms to govern RTD. There are approximately 207,000 residents per director
district. The RTD Board of Directors is responsible for setting policy, overseeing the agency’s
annual budget, and establishing short and long-range transit goals and plans in concert with local,
state, and federal agencies.
In 2021, RTD employed 2,507 people, making it one of the largest employers in the eight-county
area. In addition, RTD contracts with private carriers to provide paratransit service branded
“Access-a-Ride”, fixed route bus and commuter rail services employing 2,099 individuals. Besides
its administrative headquarters in Denver, RTD has seven operating facilities (excluding
purchased transportation services), including four in Denver, one in Aurora, one in Englewood,
and one in Boulder.
The financial reporting entity includes all the financial activities of RTD, as well as those activities
of its component unit, the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (the Authority), a nonprofit corporation
established to facilitate RTD’s use of lease/purchase financing. In addition, the financial reporting
entity also includes activities of the RTD Salaried Pension Plan and RTD Salaried Employee 401(a)
Plan for which there is a fiduciary relationship.
RTD also maintains budgetary controls. These controls ensure compliance with legal provisions
embodied in the annual appropriated budget approved by RTD’s Board of Directors. The budget
sets forth proposed outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service,
and capital assets. The level of budgetary control (that is, the level at which expenditures cannot
legally exceed the appropriated amount) is established at the project level.
The annual budget serves as the foundation for RTD’s financial planning and control. All
departments of RTD are required to submit requests for appropriation to the General Manager

and CEO on or before August 1st of each year. The General Manager and CEO uses these requests
as the starting point for developing a proposed budget. The General Manager and CEO then
presents this proposed budget to the Board of Directors for review prior to October 15th. The
Board of Directors is required to hold a public hearing on the proposed budget and to adopt a
final budget no later than December 31st.
Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except that the Board of Directors has the authority, as
stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry-over the unused portion of the funds for
capital projects not completed, for a period not to exceed three years.
RTD’s policy also authorizes the General Manager and CEO to approve certain line-item transfers
within the budget. Budget-to-actual comparisons are provided in the Supplemental Information
Section of this report.
Factors Affecting Financial Condition
The information presented in the financial statements is perhaps best understood when it is
considered in the broader perspective of the specific environment within which RTD operates.
RTD serves the eight-county region considered the Denver metropolitan area. It is the most
populated area of the state and the economic barometer of Colorado. Employment in the Denver
Metro area is dominated by small businesses. These companies represent a diverse mix of
industries and are located throughout the Denver metropolitan area, providing a geographic
balance in employment centers.
The Colorado Legislative Council (CLC) in its March 2022 report forecasts that the outlook for the
economy is clouded by emerging challenges. Although economic activity has rebounded and
exceeded pre-pandemic levels, employment has not recovered in several hard-hit industries.
Increasing inflation, supply chain challenges, a tight labor market and concerns about the
escalating conflict in the Ukraine all point to the potential for an economic downturn.
Economists for CLC reported the following key economic indicators for the Denver Metro Area
(Inflation is based on National numbers):

On November 3, 1992, the voters of Colorado approved a constitutional amendment known as
the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR), that limits taxes, revenue, and spending for state and local
governments effective December 31, 1992. On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District
exempted RTD from Tabor’s revenue and spending limitations through December 31, 2005. On

On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in the District’s sales and
use tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted the District from any revenue and
spending limitations under TABOR on the additional tax and on investment income generated by
the increased tax revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements
included in the FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, the District’s
sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed
through FasTracks and the TABOR restriction exemption will expire.
Long-term Financial Planning
Each year the Board of Directors adopts a financially balanced Mid-Term Financial Plan (MTFP),
which is the six-year operating and capital improvement plan for RTD including both the Base
System and FasTracks. The MTFP is a component of the long-term transportation planning
program for the Denver metropolitan area evaluated by the Denver Regional Council of
Governments (DRCOG). While the MTFP is developed separately for the Base System and
FasTracks, RTD integrates both plans into a single medium and long-range Financial Plan which
includes the entirety of RTD in a single report. This financial information forms the basis for the
development of RTD’s annual budget. In November 2021, the Board of Directors approved the
2022-2027 MTFP.
Long-term financial planning seeks to allocate resources among related and, at times, competing
activities and to optimize those resources in a manner consistent with defined organizational goals
and objectives.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION
RTD management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure
designed to ensure that assets are protected from loss, theft, or misuse and that adequate
accounting data are compiled to allow for the preparation of financial statements in conformity
with GAAP. RTD has designed its internal control structure to provide reasonable, but not
absolute, assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance
recognizes that: (1) the costs of a control should not exceed the benefits likely to be derived and
(2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgment by management.
Single Audit: As a recipient of federal assistance, RTD is responsible for ensuring that an
adequate internal control structure is instituted to ensure compliance with applicable laws and
regulations related to those programs. This internal control structure is subject to periodic
evaluation by management and the RTD internal audit staff.
As part of RTD’s single audit, tests are made to determine the adequacy of the internal control
structure, including that portion related to federal financial assistance programs, as well as to

November 2, 1999, the voters of the District further exempted RTD from Tabor’s revenue and
spending limitations for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the construction of
the Southeast and Southwest light rail lines or to operate such for as long as any debt remains
outstanding, but in no event beyond December 31, 2026.

1.D.1.b

We make lives better
through connections.

Fiscal Policy: RTD follows a fiscal policy approved by the Board of Directors annually or as
necessary due to modification. The fiscal policy contains policies for revenue, investments,
expenditures, capital improvements, fund balance, debt, budgeting, accounting and grants.
Debt Administration: RTD formulates its debt policy to protect its credit ratings and soundly
manage its assets and liabilities. Included in this policy is a requirement that debt will not be
used to finance current operations. Another requirement precludes financing capital projects
beyond the useful life of the project. Additional policies go beyond these essential guidelines and
result in further protection. RTD has separate ratings for its 1.0% sales and use taxes. Base
System bonds secured by the 0.6% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa1”, by
Standard and Poor’s Corporation as “AAA” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”. FasTracks Bonds that
are secured by the 0.4% sales tax are rated by Moody’s Investors Service as “Aa2”, by Standard
and Poor’s Corporation as “AA+” and by Fitch Ratings as “AA”.
Cash Management: The main objective of RTD’s cash management program is the protection
of investment principal while providing optimal levels of cash throughout the year. The RTD
investment policy is modified periodically to adapt to changes in eligible investments, benchmarks,
and specific objectives.
During the year, RTD invested its cash in various investment vehicles including money market funds,
U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, discount notes, commercial paper, repurchase
agreements, and variable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities. The total average return on
investments for the year was 0.2%.
Risk Management: RTD employs a combination of self-insurance and purchased insurance in
its efforts to protect assets and control and prevent losses.
The areas of self-insurance are worker’s compensation, automobile, general liability and felonious
assault. RTD is self-insured for liability, the limits of which are $387,000 per person and
$1,093,000 per occurrence as specified under the Colorado Governmental Immunity statute for
claims arising on or after January 1, 2018 and before January 1, 2022. The self-insured retention
for worker’s compensation claims is $2,000,000 per claim, with any amounts above this covered
by purchased insurance up to the legal limits of liability under the Colorado worker’s compensation
statute.
Commercial insurance policies provide coverage including: property coverage up to $500,000,000
for buildings, their contents, and rolling stock (other than collision); a Commercial Crime Policy
with a limit of $10,000,000; a $5,000 bond for CDL Testing Performance Bond; $2,600,000
Workers’ Compensation Bond; travel insurance for employees on RTD business; fiduciary
coverage on the Trustees of the Union Pension Trust, Salaried Pension Trust, Represented Health
and Welfare Union Trust, and the employees administering the health benefits program for
salaried employees with a limit of $8,000,000; Cyber Liability policy with a limit of $10,000,000;
Drone policy with a limit of $10,000,000. With the growth of Commuter Rail Transit (CRT)

no instances of material weakness in the internal control structures or significant violations of
applicable laws and regulations. A separate report was prepared for this purpose.

services, RTD has added Railroad Protective and Railroad Liability commercial insurance policies
that provide coverage when required under operational needs.

Awards: The Government Finance Officers Associations (GFOA) awarded a Certificate of
Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting to RTD for its Annual Comprehensive Financial
Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. RTD has submitted it’s 2020 Report and will
submit its 2021 Report for award of this Certificate.
In order to receive the Certificate of Achievement for Excellence in Financial Reporting, RTD must
publish an easily readable and efficiently organized Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the
contents of which must conform to program standards. This report must also satisfy both GAAP
and applicable legal requirements.
The Certificate of Achievement is valid for one year only. It is my belief the current Annual
Comprehensive Financial Report meets the program’s requirements and RTD will be submitting it
to the GFOA to determine its eligibility for another certificate.
Acknowledgements: Timely preparation of the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report was
made possible by the dedicated services of the Finance Department led by Doug MacLeod, Chief
Financial Officer. I extend my sincere appreciation to each member of the department for their
contributions. Moreover, I thank the Board of Directors for its continued support and leadership.

Sincerely,

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado
Report on the Audits of the Financial Statements
Opinions
We have audited the financial statements of the business-type activities and fiduciary activities of the Regional
Transportation District (the "District") as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related
notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the District's basic financial statements, as listed in
the table of contents.
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the accompanying financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the respective financial position of the business-type
activities and fiduciary activities of the District as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the respective changes in
its financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the years then ended in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We did not audit the financial statements of the Salaried Pension Plan, a fiduciary fund of the District, which
represents 76.9 percent, 76.9 percent, and 70.0 percent of the assets, net position, and revenue of the fiduciary
activities, respectively, for 2021 and 78.1 percent, 78.1 percent, and 58.1 percent of the assets, net position, and
revenue of the fiduciary activities, respectively, for 2020. Those financial statements were audited by other
auditors, whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for
the Salaried Pension Plan, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (GAAS) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards,
issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the District and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the
relevant ethical requirements relating to our audits. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The financial statements of the Salaried
Pension Plan were not audited under Government Auditing Standards.
Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for the design, implementation, and
maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events,
considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern
for 12 months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise
substantial doubt shortly thereafter.

Independent Auditor's Report

1.D.1.b

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our
opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and, therefore, is not a
guarantee that audits conducted in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a
substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a
reasonable user based on the financial statements.
In performing audits in accordance with GAAS and Government Auditing Standards, we:

• Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audits.
• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining,
on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audits in order to design audit procedures that are

appropriate in the circumstances but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
District's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.

• Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting
estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements.

• Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the District's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audits, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that
we identified during the audits.
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that the management's
discussion and analysis and required supplementary information, as identified in the table of contents, be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management
and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, which considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in
an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States
of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods of preparing the information and
comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us
with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audits of the Financial Statements

1.D.1.b

To the Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District, Colorado

Our audits were conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively
comprise the District's basic financial statements. The supplemental information, as identified in the table of
contents, is presented for the purpose of additional analysis and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the
underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements. The information has been
subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and certain additional
procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other
records used to prepare the basic financial statements or to the basic financial statements themselves, and other
additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. In
our opinion, the supplemental information is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial
statements as a whole.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information included in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. The
other information comprises the introductory and statistical sections but does not include the basic financial
statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinions on the basic financial statements do not cover the other
information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.
In connection with our audits of the basic financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the basic financial
statements or whether the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work
performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required
to describe it in our report.
Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report dated May 23, 2022 on our
consideration of the District's internal control over financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain
provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, grant agreements, and other matters. The purpose of that report is
solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial reporting and compliance and the
results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the District's internal control over
financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with
Government Auditing Standards in considering the District's internal control over financial reporting and
compliance.

The management of the Regional Transportation District (RTD) offers users of its financial statements this
narrative overview and analysis of the financial activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.
This discussion and analysis is designed to assist the reader to focus on significant financial activities and
identify any significant changes in the financial position of RTD. It should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements that follow this section. All amounts, unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in
thousands of dollars.
Financial Highlights
In December 2019, a novel strain of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19, emerged. The virus
subsequently spread globally resulting in a worldwide pandemic and caused significant disruptions to the
economy and public transit through 2021. As a result of COVID-19, RTD experienced a significant reduction
in ridership, fare revenues and its largest source of revenues, sales and use taxes beginning in March 2020.
With the onset of the Pandemic, RTD instituted several measures to reduce costs and align services with
customer needs. While sales and use taxes rebounded sharply in 2021, ridership and fare revenue have
experienced modest recoveries but remain significantly lower. RTD continues to monitor the effects of
COVID-19 on transit and will make the necessary adjustments to adapt its services and expenditures to
available resources.
In March 2020, RTD was awarded $232,254 in federal COVID-19 relief grant funding through the
Coronavirus, Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act to maintain transit operations. The CARES Act
funding was fully drawn by RTD during 2020. In January 2021, RTD was notified of an additional federal
COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental
Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) of $203,368 which was fully drawn by RTD during 2021. In March 2021, RTD
was notified of another federal COVID-19 relief grant apportionment through the American Rescue Plan Act
(ARPA) of $338,468. Each of these three apportionments have been and will be utilized to sustain transit
operations. In November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law
which will provide additional federal funding primarily directed towards asset repair and replacement.
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, total assets and deferred outflows of resources of RTD exceeded total
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources by $3,462,798 and $3,361,993, respectively. The amount of
unrestricted net position as of December 31, 2021 was $252,843 compared to $1,165 in 2020. RTD’s 2021
unrestricted net position was positively impacted by expenditure reduction efforts in response to the impact
of COVID-19, improved sales and use tax collections as well as additional federal COVID-19 relief funding.
The net position of RTD increased by $100,805 (3.0%) during the current year compared to a decrease of
$25,115 (0.8%) in the previous year. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the aforementioned cost
reductions, tax collections and federal funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The increase for
2020 was due to cost reductions and federal funding in response to COVID-19.
RTD experienced an approximate 60% decrease in ridership due to COVID-19 beginning in March 2020
followed by an additional 6.8% decrease in 2021 which negatively affected fare revenues. Fare revenue is
a significant source of funding for RTD.

1.D.1.b

For 2021, total operating expenses exceeded total revenues resulting in a loss before non-operating revenue
and expenses of $825,504 compared to a loss of $869,060 for 2020. The decrease in operating loss for
2021 was primarily due to a reduction of operating expenses resulting from decreased service provision
resulting from decreased demand during the COVID-19 Pandemic. RTD anticipates operating losses each
year, as these losses are subsidized by non-operating sales and use tax, grant revenues and other
miscellaneous income.
RTD’s total debt decreased $88,597 (2.7%) and decreased $83,422 (2.2%) in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Outstanding debt decreased in 2021 and 2020 due to payment of outstanding principal balances and, to a
lesser extent, refinancing of outstanding obligations for interest savings.
Capital grants and local contributions decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in 2021 and decreased $28,320 (22.7%)
in the previous year. The decrease in both years was a result of lower capital grant eligible expenditures
as the funded FasTracks capital expansion project winds down.
Grant operating assistance decreased $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021 due to a lower federal grant apportionment
of $203,368 from CRRSAA funding than in 2020. Grant operating assistance increased $230,585 (267.3%)
in 2020 as a result of receiving $232,254 from the CARES Act. This federal COVID-19 relief funding in both
years was unprecedented and resulted in substantially higher federal funding than previous years.
RTD’s capital assets, net of depreciation, decreased $318,453 (4.8%) in 2021 and decreased $241,786
(3.5%) in 2020. The decrease in both years was due to a reduction in capital additions as large expansion
projects were placed in revenue service and systematic depreciation was applied.
Basic Financial Statements
Management’s Discussion and Analysis serves as an introduction to RTD’s basic financial statements. RTD’s
financial statements are prepared using proprietary fund (enterprise fund) accounting that uses a similar
basis of accounting as private-sector business enterprises. Under this method of accounting, an economic
resources measurement focus and an accrual basis of accounting are used. Revenue is recorded when
earned and expenses are recorded when incurred.
The basic financial statements are comprised of four components: statements of net position; statements
of revenues, expenses and changes in net position; statements of cash flows; and notes to the financial
statements.
The statements of net position present information on assets and deferred outflows of resources and
liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as the net
position. Over time, increases or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the
financial position of RTD is improving or deteriorating. The statements of revenues, expenses, and changes
in net position present information on operating revenues and expenses and non-operating revenues and
expenses of RTD for the fiscal year with the difference, the net income or loss, combined with any capital

24

Packet Pg. 39

Attachment: 2021 ACFR (4661 : 2021 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

RTD’s sales and use tax revenues are its largest single source of revenues. These tax revenues were
negatively impacted by the economic effects of COVID-19 in 2020 with a 4.1% decrease followed by a
19.6% increase in 2021.

grants and local contributions to determine the change in net position for the year. That change combined
with the previous year-end total net position reconciles to the net position total at the end of the current
fiscal year. All changes in net position are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the
changes occurs, regardless of the timing of the related cash flows.
The statements of cash flows report cash and cash equivalent activities for the fiscal year resulting from
operating activities, capital, and related financing activities, noncapital and related financing activities and
investing activities. The result of these activities added to the beginning of the year cash balance reconciles
to the cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the current fiscal year. The statements of cash
flows, along with the related notes and information in other financial statements, can be used to assess the
following: RTD’s ability to generate positive cash flows and pay its debt as the debt matures; the reasons
for differences between RTD’s operating cash flows and operating income (loss); and the effect of investing,
capital, and financing activities on RTD’s financial position.
The notes to the financial statements provide additional information that is essential to fully understand the
data provided in the statements of net position, statements of revenues, expenses, and changes in net
position, and statements of cash flows.
RTD provides bus, paratransit, light rail and commuter rail service in a 2,342 square mile area (District) in
and around metropolitan Denver, Colorado. The activities of RTD are supported by a 0.6% and a 0.4%
sales and use tax collected within the District. The 0.6% sales and use tax is used to fund the Base System
operations of RTD. The Base System operations provide the bus and the majority of current light rail services
in the Denver area. The 0.4% sales and use tax funds the FasTracks build-out program and operation and
maintenance of those program elements as well as providing for enhanced transit services in the District.
Additional revenue sources include fare collections, federal, state, and local financial assistance, investment
income, and other income such as advertising and rental income.

In 2021, current assets increased by $121,866 (13.4%) primarily due to an increase in cash from higher
sales and use tax collections and federal COVID-19 relief grant funding.
In 20210, capital assets net of accumulated depreciation decreased $318,452 (4.8%) primarily due to the
depreciation of assets.
Total liabilities and deferred inflows decreased $156,358 (3.6%) in 2021 primarily due to debt service
payments reducing outstanding obligations as well as favorable investment returns in pension funds which
have reduced projected retirement obligations.
The net position of RTD increased by $100,805 (3.0%) during the current year compared to an increase of
$25,115 (0.8%) in the previous year. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the aforementioned cost
reductions, increased tax collections and federal funding in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The
increase in 2020 was due to cost reductions and federal COVID-19 relief funding.

Passenger fares – Passenger fares provided 6.7% and 6.6% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Farebox receipts, monthly and annual pass revenue, and special event fares for bus and rail
services are included in passenger fares. Passenger fares increased by $2,658 (3.5%) in 2021 compared
to a decrease of $78,125 (50.6%) in 2020. Passenger fare changes in 2021 were due to a full year of
operations of the N Line and stabilization of ridership losses from COVID-19. The decrease in 2020 was
due to the loss of ridership due to COVID-19.
Advertising and other – Advertising and other revenue provided 0.4% and 0.5% of total revenues in
2021 and 2020. This revenue category primarily includes revenues from advertisements on RTD’s buses
and external wraps on light rail vehicles as well as revenue from naming rights. Advertising and other
income decreased $1,986 (32.1%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $370 (5.6%) in 2020. The decreases
in both years were primarily due to lower advertising revenues from lower advertisement sales resulting
from COVID-19 impacts to the economy.
Sales and Use Tax – Sales and use tax provided 64.7% and 55.1% of RTD’s total revenues in 2021 and
2020, respectively. Sales and use tax is a dedicated 1.0% tax imposed on certain sales within the District.
Sales and use tax increased $124,309 (19.6%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $26,753 (4.1%) in 2020.
The increase in 2021 resulted from a recovery in spending within the District after the initial economic
shocks of COVID-19 reduced spending in 2020 which resulted from continued population growth, low
unemployment as well as growth in personal income.

1.D.1.b

Grant operating assistance – Grant operating assistance provided 25.6% and 27.6% of total revenues
in 2021 and 2020. Grant operating assistance decreased $17,796 (5.6%) in 2021 compared to an increase
of $230,585 (267.3%) in 2020. The operating assistance is a federal grant revenue program used to perform
capital maintenance and maintain RTD’s revenue fleet of bus, paratransit, and rail vehicles. The revenue
decrease in 2021 was the result of lower federal COVID-19 relief grant collections while the sharp increase
in 2020 resulted from the first apportionment of COVID-19 federal funding to maintain certain operating
levels in order to serve ongoing public transit needs.
Investment Income – Investment income provided 0.2% and 0.8% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020.
Investment income decreased $6,564 (73.2%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $8,704 (49.3%) in 2020.
The decrease in 2021 was due to the lower interest rate environment and 2020 including a realized gain
from debt refinancing.
Other Income/Gain on sale of Assets – Other income provided 1.0% and 0.9% of total revenues in
2021 and 2020. Other income includes interest subsidy income, rental income from retail space, parking,
and miscellaneous other items. Other income increased $1,199 (11.5%) in 2021 compared to a decrease
of $16,185 (60.9%) in 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to less activity with asset disposals.
The decrease in 2020 resulted from having no realized one-time gains such as those that occurred in the
prior year.
Capital grants and local contributions – Capital grants and local contributions provided 1.5% and 8.4%
of total revenues in 2021 and 2020. Capital grants and local contributions decreased $79,008 (82.1%) in
2021 and decreased $28,320 (22.7%) in 2020. The decreases in both years resulted from lower
infrastructure expenditures due to completion of FasTracks expansionary projects.

Salaries and wages – Salary and wage expense is one of the largest expense categories accounting for
17.3% and 17.3% of the total RTD expenses in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Salary and wage expenses
decreased by $8,856 (4.6%) in 2021 compared to an increase of $2,098 (1.1%) in 2020. The decrease in
both years was due to reductions in service and staffing shortfalls due to COVID-19.

31

Packet Pg. 46

Benefits – Fringe benefits accounted for 5.7% and 4.8% of total expenses in 2021 and 2020. Fringe
benefits increased by $6,386 (11.8%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $381 (0.7%) in 2020. The
increase in 2021 was due to higher pension liabilities from lower investment returns and the decrease in
2020 was due to a decrease in compensation resulting from expense reduction efforts in response to COVID19 as well as recognition of lower pension liabilities due to favorable pension investment returns.
Materials and supplies – The materials and supplies expense category accounted for 3.7% and 3.8% of
the total expenses in 2021 and 2020 respectively. Materials and supplies expenses decreased $2,445
(5.8%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $12,875 (23.4%) in 2020. The decrease in both years was due
to reduced service levels due to COVID-19 with a more substantial decrease in 2020 resulting after prior
years included increases as materials and supplies were increased for the opening of new rail lines in
addition to reduced uses of consumable materials such as fuel and parts.
Services – Services expense accounted for 7.0% and 7.5% of total expenses in 2021 and 2020. Services
expense includes contracted services such as security services, vehicle, equipment and right of way
maintenance services, advertising and marketing services, and legal services. Services expense decreased
$10,173 (12.0%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $11,412 (11.9%) in 2020. The decrease in both years
resulted from service expense and project reductions to adjust to lower revenues caused by the COVID-19
economic effects.
Utilities – Utilities accounted for 1.6% and 1.4% of total expenses in 2021 and 2020. Utilities expense
includes electric, telecommunications, water and sewer, and natural gas for facilities as well as traction
power for rail lines. Utilities expense increased $1,306 (8.1%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $1,617
(9.1%) in 2020. The increase in 2021 resulted from higher traction power costs while decrease in 2020
resulted from a decrease in rail service and the associated electric power as a result of service reductions
for COVID-19.
Insurance – Insurance accounted for 0.9% and 0.9% of total expenses in 2021 and 2020. Insurance
expense includes RTD’s self-insured cost for general liability and worker’s compensation claims as well as
the premium cost for excess insurance lines, cybersecurity and railroad liability insurance. Insurance
expense decreased $82 (0.8%) in 2021 and decreased $647 (6.0%) in 2020. The decrease in both years
was due to lower frequency and severity of claims as RTD has focused additional cost containment efforts
in this area.
Purchased transportation – The purchased transportation expense category accounted for 16.3% and
18.2% of the total expenses in 2021 and 2020. Purchased transportation represents the costs of contracted
transportation services for bus, commuter rail, Access-a-Ride, and FlexRide services. Purchased
transportation costs decreased $29,217 (14.3%) in 2021 and increased $405 (0.2%) in 2020. The decrease
in 2021 was due to service reductions from COVID-19 impacts while the increase in 2020 was due to
additional rail corridors being opened of which the increased costs were partially offset by service reductions.
Leases and rentals – Leases and rentals include lease expense for office space, office equipment, Parkn-Ride facilities, and use of communication towers and accounted for 0.3% and 0.3% of total expenses in
2021 and 2020, respectively. Leases and rentals expense decreased $195 (5.7%) in 2021 compared to an
increase of $193 (6.0%) in 2020. The decrease in 2021 resulted from cost reduction efforts to mitigate

Miscellaneous – Miscellaneous expense includes other incidental operating expenses not included in other
defined categories and accounted for 0.2% and 0.2% of total expenses in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Miscellaneous expenses decreased $333 (13.1%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $2,507 (49.6%) in
2020. This category includes additional one-time project expenses creating fluctuations between years.
Depreciation – The depreciation expense category accounted for 31.8% and 30.3% of the total expenses
in 2021 and 2020, respectively. RTD’s depreciation expense is a straight-line non-cash systematic allocation
of the cost of capital assets over the estimated useful life of the assets. Depreciation expense increased
$725 (0.2%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $15,584 (4.4%) in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was due
to retirement of assets and the increase in 2020 was primarily related to placement in service of the majority
of the FasTracks Project infrastructure for rail corridors.
Interest expense – The interest expense category accounted for 14.4% and 14.9% of the total expenses
in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense decreased $12,959 (7.8%) in 2021 and decreased $33,790
(16.8%) in 2020. The decrease in both years was attributable to lower outstanding balances resulting from
paying down principal. In addition, in 2021, a refinancing was completed to realize savings from lower
market rates of interest.
Other expense – Other expense includes miscellaneous non-operating expenses not classified in other
expense categories and accounted for 0.6% and 0.3% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Other expense
increased $2,965 (77.6%) in 2021 and increased $698 (22.3%) in 2020. The increase in both years was
due to retirement of capital assets resulting in losses.
Capital Assets – Investments in capital assets include land and right-of-way, buildings and improvements,
leasehold improvements, revenue and non-revenue vehicles, shop and service equipment, security and
surveillance equipment, computer equipment, and furniture. RTD’s investment in capital assets, net of
accumulated depreciation in 2021 was $6,281,605 compared to $6,600,057 in 2020. The decrease in capital
assets in 2021 was $318,452 (4.8%) compared to a decrease of $241,786 (3.5%) in 2020. The decrease
in both years was due to additional accumulated depreciation.
Capital Assets - The following table summarizes capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, as of
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Sales tax revenue bonds – RTD issues sales tax revenue bonds to fund the acquisition and construction
of assets. These bonds are secured by future sales and use tax revenues. The sales tax revenue bonds
were $2,056,875 and $2,062,918 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The sales tax revenue
bonds decreased $6,043 (0.3%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of $4,746 (0.2%) in 2020. The decrease
in both years was due to payment of principal on outstanding debt.
Certificates of participation - Certificates of participation (Certificates) relate to financial obligations

RTD. Certificates are lease-purchase financial obligations secured by the underlying assets. Outstanding
Certificates were issued with the proceeds being used to acquire certain equipment, facilities and
infrastructure to be used by RTD. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates as
its own debt. Certificates outstanding were $955,782 and $1,011,319 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. The Certificates outstanding decreased $55,537 (5.5%) in 2021 compared to a decrease of
$77,993 (7.2%) in 2020. The decrease in both years is due to payment of outstanding principal.

Economic Factors and Subsequent Events after adoption of the 2021 Budget
RTD is dependent on sales and use taxes, which are the largest single source of revenue for RTD,
representing 64.7% and 55.2% of the total revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales and use tax
revenues are affected by the local economy in which changes will affect the level of funding available to
RTD during its fiscal year. RTD’s 2021 sales and use taxes increased 19.6% in 2021 due to a recovery from
the economic effects of COVID-19.
RTD is dependent on passenger fares collected for transit services that it provides. Passenger fares
accounted for 6.7% and 6.6% of total revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Passenger fare collections
were significantly impacted by COVID-19 and lower ridership in both years.
RTD is dependent on federal and local grant funding as well as local capital contributions for both operations
and capital expenditures. Grant operating assistance provided 25.6% and 27.6% of total revenues in 2021
and 2020, respectively which represented a more substantial portion of revenues in both years being

Each year, RTD may propose an Amended Budget at any point to the Board of Directors for appropriation
in order to adjust revenue and expenditures for the remainder of the fiscal year according to existing
economic conditions and fiscal results. RTD may also present budget amendments to the Board of Directors
for approval at any time during the fiscal year to accommodate economic factors.
In 2020, RTD reached final completion on the remaining FasTracks Project elements for which funding had
been identified. Additional FasTracks elements approved by the voters of the District have been deferred
due to a lack of current identifiable funding.
Requests for Information
This financial report is intended to provide an overview of RTD’s finances for those with an interest in this

N OTE A – SUM M AR Y OF SIGNI FI CANT ACCOUNTI NG P OLI CI ES
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) was created as a transportation planning agency,
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, by an Act of the Colorado General Assembly
(the Act), effective July 1969 (Title 32, Article 9, C.R.S., 1973, as amended). In 1974, the
Act was amended and RTD became an operating entity charged with the responsibility for
development, operation and maintenance of a public mass transportation system for the
benefit of the citizens of the District. The District is comprised of 15 separate districts
located in Denver, Boulder, Broomfield and Jefferson counties, and certain portions of
Adams, Arapahoe, Douglas, and Weld counties.
RTD is governed by a publicly elected board of directors consisting of 15 members. Each
board member is elected to serve a term of four years by the constituents of the District in
which the board member resides. As required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(GAAP), these financial statements present RTD and its component units. The component
unit discussed in note A. 2. is included in RTD’s reporting entity because of the significance
its financial relationship with the RTD.
In 1988, a Senate Bill was enacted (privatization legislation) requiring RTD to implement by
March 31, 1989, a plan to competitively bid contracts for the provision of at least 20% of
RTD’s bus service by private contractors. In 1999, the Bill was amended requiring RTD to
increase this provision to at least 35% of fixed route bus service. In 2003, the Bill was
amended to require that at least 50% of RTD’s vehicular service be operated by private
transit companies. In May of 2007, the legislation was amended to provide for “a system
under which up to 58% of the District’s service” is provided by private contractors.
2. Financial Reporting Entities
Blended Component Unit
The Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority) was formed in 1987 as a nonprofit
corporation on behalf of RTD for the purpose of issuing certificates of participation in a
public offering collateralized by an installment purchase agreement with RTD. RTD’s
General Manager appoints the Board of Directors of the Authority. The Authority serves as
a financing mechanism for various financing arrangements for RTD. RTD follows
Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) pronouncement 14 (GASB 14) and 61
(GASB 61) which provide guidance regarding the inclusion of component units in the primary
government’s financial statement presentation. The activity related to the underlying
financial obligations of the Authority has been included as a blended component unit in
RTD’s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. No separately
audited financial statements are prepared for the Authority.
Fiduciary Funds
GASB 84 requires that funds held in a trustee or custodial capacity that meet certain criteria
be included in RTD’s financial statement presentation. Those criteria include the
governmental agency having control of the assets of the fiduciary activity and the existence
of a fiduciary relationship with the beneficiaries. RTD has determined that the RTD Salaried

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2021 and 2020 (Dollars in Thousand)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Basis of Accounting
The accounts of RTD are reported as a Proprietary Fund. Proprietary funds are accounted
for on the flow of economic resources measurement focus and use the accrual basis of
accounting which reports all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, deferred
inflows of resources, revenues, expenses, gains and losses. Revenue is recognized when
earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred. Proprietary funds
distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-operating items. Operating
revenues and expenses generally result from providing services and producing and
delivering goods in connection with a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The
principal operating revenues of RTD are charges (fares) to customers for services. Operating
expenses include the cost of services, administrative expenses and asset depreciation. All
revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported as non-operating revenues
and expenses.
It is RTD’s policy to apply Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in its
presentation of financial statements. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are
available for use, it is RTD’s policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted
resources as they are needed.
4. Cash and Cash Equivalents
RTD considers all highly liquid investments, both restricted and unrestricted, with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
5. Interest Bearing Investments
Investments with a maturity date, when purchased, of less than one year are carried at cost
or amortized cost which approximates fair value. Investments with a maturity date of more
than one year from the date of purchase are carried at fair value.
6. Inventories
Inventories consist primarily of materials and supplies used in the ordinary course of
operations. Materials and supplies are stated at cost using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

7. Other Current Assets
Certain payments to vendors reflect costs applicable to future accounting periods and are
recorded as prepaid items. Escrows are deposits held in the custody of a third party until a
certain condition has been met such as retainage for construction projects. At the time
projects are completed, escrows are generally applied toward the cost of the project or may
be forfeited upon breach of contract.

this report.

December 31, 2021 and 2020 (Dollars in Thousand)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accounts receivable are stated at the amount management expects to collect from
outstanding balances. Management provides for probable uncollected amounts through a
charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still outstanding after management
has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation
allowance and a credit to accounts receivable. Changes in the valuation allowance have not
been material to the consolidated financial statements.
9. Restricted Assets
Restricted assets are assets restricted by the covenants of long-term financial or other
contractual arrangements.
10. Capital Assets
Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Capital assets are defined by RTD as
assets with an initial, individual cost of more than $5 and an estimated useful life in excess
of one year. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current period operating expenses
and improvements are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of property and
equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any gains or losses are included in non-operating revenue and expense. A
pro-rata share of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, which were acquired
with federal funds, is required to be reinvested in a similar asset.
Prior to 2020, interest was capitalized on assets financed with debt or certificates of
participation from the date of the borrowing until completion of the project. The amount
of tax-exempt and taxable debt and certificates of participation (externally restricted)
interest to be capitalized is the difference between the interest expense and interest
earnings on issuance proceeds. The amount of other interest to be capitalized is calculated
by weighted average construction expenditures multiplied by the weighted average interest
rate of the outstanding obligations.
Total interest cost of RTD as of December 31 2021 and 2020, respectively was $154,096
and $167,055.
11. Depreciation
Depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Land improvements
Buildings
Revenue earning equipment
Shop, maintenance and other equipment

10-20 years
30 years
8-25 years

12. Deferred Outflows/Inflows of Resources
In addition to assets, the statement of financial position will report a separate section for
deferred outflows of resources. This separate financial statement element represents a
consumption of net position that applies to a future period(s) and thus, will not be
recognized as an outflow of resources (expense/expenditure) until then.
In addition to liabilities, the statement of financial position will sometimes report a separate
section for deferred inflows of resources. This separate financial statement element
represents an acquisition of net position that applies to a future period(s) and so will not be
recognized as an inflow of resources (revenue) until that time.
13. Compensated Absences
RTD employees receive compensation for vacations, holidays, illness, and certain other
qualifying absences. The number of days compensated in the various categories of absence
is based generally on length of service. Compensated absences, which have been earned
but not paid, have been included as liabilities in the accompanying financial statements.
14. Self-Insurance
Liabilities for property damage, personal injury and qualifying unemployment benefits are
recognized as incurred on the basis of the estimated cost to RTD. In addition, RTD offers
a self-insured health benefit option as part of its employee benefits program in which costs
are recognized as they are incurred.
15. Revenue Recognition
Passenger Fares
Passenger fares are recorded as revenue at the time services are performed and revenue is
collected. Sale of MyRide stored value, mobile ticketing products, monthly passes, ticket
books and day pass tickets are recorded as income at the time of sale. Sales of collegebased passes, which are valid for a specific academic semester, are recorded initially as
unearned revenue then recognized as income at the end of each month, with the amount
recognized determined by prorating the total contract amount over the semesters/quarters
covered. Sales of EcoPass and Neighborhood Pass, which are valid through December 31
of a given year, are recorded initially as unearned revenue then recognized as income at
the end of each month, with the total contract amount prorated evenly over the number of
months of the contract.
Sales and Use Taxes
Under the provisions of the Act, as amended, RTD levies a sales tax of 1.0% on
net taxable sales made within the District and a use tax of 1.0% on items purchased for use

Fully depreciated assets, which are still in use, are included in the asset balances in the
accompanying financial statements. The cost of fully depreciated assets was approximately
$572,783 and $485,650 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

inside the District. As described in Note E, under the terms of the Sales Tax Revenue Bonds,
Series 2007A, Series 2010B, Series 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, 2021A and 2021B
bond resolutions, sales and use tax revenue is pledged for payment of debt service. Sales
and use taxes are collected by the State of Colorado Department of Revenue and are
remitted to a trustee who satisfies debt service requirements for these obligations through
remittances to a trustee and then remits the remaining balance to RTD.
Sales and use taxes are recorded as revenue by RTD in the month collected by the
merchant. Sales tax bond service will be paid from the collateralized sales and use tax
revenues in the amount of approximately $3,376,648 through 2050. Principal and interest
paid for the current year and pledged revenues received were $88,756.
Grants and Local Contributions
RTD receives grants from the federal government through the Federal Transit
Administration (FTA). Grants are also awarded to RTD by State of Colorado through the
Colorado Department of Transportation. The federal and state governments issue grants
to RTD for operations and acquisition of property and equipment.
The amount recorded as capital grant revenue was $15,739 and $66,215 in 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Operating assistance grant revenue was $299,052 and $316,848 in 2021 and
2020, respectively. Other contribution revenue was $1,430 and $29,962 in 2021 and 2020,
respectively.
In April, 2021, RTD was awarded $203,368 in federal COVID-19 relief grant funding through
the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSAA) to maintain
transit operations. The CRRSAA funding was fully drawn by RTD during 2021 and is included
in operating assistance grant revenue. RTD was awarded additional COVID-19 relief funding
of $304,227 through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) in August 2021. A portion of
these funds were also drawn in 2021 and are included in the operating assistance grant
revenue.
Grants and local contributions are recorded as revenue by RTD once all applicable eligibility
requirements are met.
16. Use of Estimates
The financial statements contained herein have been prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). GAAP are uniform minimum standards of and
guidelines to financial accounting and reporting. GAAP establishes appropriate
measurement and classification criteria for financial reporting. Adherence to GAAP provides
a reasonable degree of comparability among the financial reports of state and local
governmental units. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
involves the use of management’s estimates. These estimates are based upon
management’s best judgments after considering past and current events and assumptions
about future events. Actual results may differ from estimates.

For purposes of measuring RTD’s net pension liabilities, deferred outflows of resources and
deferred inflows of resources related to pensions and pension expense, information about
the pension plan’s fiduciary net position and additions to/deductions from the plan’s
fiduciary net position have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by the
plan. For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are
recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments are
reported at fair value.
18. TABOR (Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights) – Reserve Composition
Restricted net position represents amounts constrained by external parties or legislation. In
1992, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution referred to as the
TABOR Amendment in which certain annual limitations were placed on the growth of
government revenues. The Amendment also requires that an emergency reserve, referred
to as Restricted TABOR, of 3.0% of fiscal year spending excluding debt service be
maintained for all years subsequent to 1994 for declared emergencies.
19. Reclassifications
Certain 2020 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2021 presentation.
20. Upcoming Accounting Pronouncements

GASB 87
In June 2017, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) issued Statement No.
87, Leases, which improves accounting and financial reporting for leases by governments.
This statement requires recognition of certain lease assets and liabilities for leases that
previously were classified as operating leases and recognized as inflows of resources or
outflows of resources based on the payment provisions of the contract. It establishes a
single model for lease accounting based on the foundational principle that leases are
financings of the right to use an underlying asset. Under this statement, a lessee is required
to recognize a lease liability and an intangible right-to-use lease asset, and a lessor is
required to recognize a lease receivable and a deferred inflow of resources. RTD is currently
evaluating the impact this standard will have on the financial statements when adopted.
The provisions of this statement were originally effective for the RTD's financial statements
for the year ending December 31, 2021 but were extended to December 31, 2022 with the
issuance of GASB Statement No. 95, Postponement of Effective Dates of Certain
Authoritative Guidance.

GASB 91
In May 2019, the GASB issued Statement No. 91, Conduit Debt Obligations, which clarifies
the existing definition of conduit debt, provides a single method of reporting conduit debt
obligations by issuers, and eliminates diversity in practice associated with commitments
extended by issuers, arrangements associated with conduit debt obligations, and related

note disclosures. As a result, issuers should not recognize a liability for items meeting the
definition of conduit debt; however, a liability should be recorded for additional or voluntary
commitments to support debt service if certain recognition criteria are met. The standard
also addresses the treatment of arrangements where capital assets are constructed or
acquired with the proceeds of a conduit debt obligation and used by a third-party obligor.
The requirements of the standard will be applied retrospectively and are effective for RTD's
financial statements for the December 31, 2022 fiscal year.

GASB 92
In January 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 92, Omnibus 2020. This statement
addresses eight unrelated practice issues and technical inconsistencies in authoritative
literature. The standard addresses leases, intra-entity transfers of assets, post-employment
benefits, government acquisitions, risk financing and insurance-related activities of public
entity risk pools, fair value measurements, and derivative instruments. The standard has
various effective dates. RTD does not believe this pronouncement will have a significant
impact on its financial statements but is still making a full evaluation.

GASB 94
In March 2020, the GASB issued Statement No. 94, Public-Private and Public-Public
Partnerships and Availability Payment Arrangements, to bring a uniform guidance on how
to report public-private and public-public partnership arrangements. As a result, transferors
in public-private or public-public arrangements will recognize receivables for installment
payments, deferred inflows of resources, and, when applicable, capital assets. Operators
will recognize liabilities for installment payments and intangible right-to-use assets, and
when applicable, deferred outflows of resources and liabilities for assets being transferred.
This statement also provides guidance for accounting and financial reporting for availability
payment arrangements, in which a government compensates an operator for services such
as designing, constructing, financing, maintaining, or operating an underlying asset for a
period of time in an exchange of exchange-like transaction. The provisions of this statement
are effective for RTD’s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2023.

GASB 97
In June 2020, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board issued GASB Statement No.
97, Certain Component Unit Criteria, and Accounting and Financial Reporting for Internal
Revenue Code Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans. While this standard had certain
aspects impacting defined contribution pension and OPEB plans and other employee benefit
plans that were effective immediately, it also clarifies when a 457 plan should be considered
a pension plan or another employee benefit plan to assist in the application of GASB
Statement No. 84 to these types of plans. RTD is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on the financial statements when adopted. The provisions of this
statement related to 457 plans are effective for RTD's financial statements for the year
ending December 31, 2022.

N OTE B – DEPOSI TS AND I NVESTM ENTS

RTD’s deposits are subject to the State of Colorado’s Public Deposit Protection Act (PDPA).
Under this act, all uninsured public deposits at qualified institutions are fully collateralized with
pledged collateral which is held in custody by any Federal Reserve Bank or branch thereof, or
held in escrow by another bank in a manner as the banking Commissioner shall prescribe by
rule and regulation, or may be segregated from the other assets of the eligible public depository
and held in its own trust department. Colorado’s PDPA requires that pledged collateral to be
held is clearly identified as being securely maintained or pledged for the aggregate amount of
public deposits accepted and held on deposit by the eligible public depository. The public
depository has the right at any time to make substitutions of eligible collateral that is maintained
or pledged and is always entitled to collect and retain all income derived from those investments
without restrictions.
As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, RTD had bank deposits of $13,407 and
$11,799 collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institutions’ trust department
or agent but not in RTD’s name.

respectively, consist of a broad spectrum of individual holdings of cash and cash equivalents,
equity mutual funds and fixed income mutual funds. Because these investments are primarily
mutual funds consisting of multiple investments and also contain equity investments, credit
ratings of the underlying portfolios are not available.

Concentration of Credit R isk
Enterprise Funds
It is the policy of RTD to diversify its investment portfolio. Assets held in the investment funds
shall be diversified to eliminate the risk of loss resulting from over-concentration of assets in a
specific maturity, a specific issue or a specific class of securities. The asset allocation in the
portfolio should, however, be flexible depending upon the outlook for the economy and the
securities markets.
RTD’s investment policy outlines the following maximum exposure limits for unrestricted
investments. As of December 31, 2021, RTD followed these limits. As of December 31, 2020,

Fair Value M easurem ents
In March 2015, the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) released Statement No.
72, Fair Value Measurement and Application, which would generally require state and local
governments to measure investments at fair value. GASB's goal is to enhance comparability of
governmental financial statements by requiring fair value measurement for certain assets and
liabilities using a consistent definition and accepted valuation techniques. This standard
expands fair value disclosures to provide comprehensive information for financial statement
users about the impact of fair value measurements on a government's financial position.
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities that RTD
has the ability to access at the measurement date. Examples are derived values from the New
York Stock Exchange (NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations
(NASDAQ), Chicago Board of Trade and “Pink Sheets”.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices under Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly on the measurement date. Examples include matrix pricing,
market corroborated pricing and inputs such as yield curves and indices.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value that rely on
the reporting entity's reasonably available information concerning the assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing an asset or liability including assumptions about risk.

apply. Rather, the diversification limit shall be set as follows: no more than 75% of the portfolio may be invested in
Agencies, with any more than 25% being invested in any one Agency.

In April 2018, GASB issued Statement 88, Certain Disclosures Related to Debt, Including Direct
Borrowings and Direct Placement. The primary objective of GASB 88 related to providing
additional information regarding debt, including direct borrowings and direct placements. It also
clarifies which liabilities governments should include when disclosing information statements as a
liability that arises from a contractual obligation to pay cash (or other assets that may be used in
lieu of cash) in one or more payments to settle an amount that is fixed at the date the contractual
obligation is established. GASB 88 requires that additional essential information related to debt
be disclosed in notes to financial statements, including unused lines of credit, assets pledged as
collateral for the debt and terms specified in debt agreements related to significant events of
default with finance-related consequences, significant termination events with finance-related
consequences and significant subjective acceleration clauses.
RTD sales tax revenue bonds Series 2007A, 2010B, 2013A, 2016A, 2017A, 2017B, 2019A, and
2021AB are secured by a pledge of future sales and use tax revenues. These tax-secured future
liabilities of $3,376,648 remain outstanding through 2050. The pledged revenue includes a 0.6%
and 0.4% tax on the net taxable sales made within the District and use taxes of 0.6% and 0.4%
on items purchased for use inside the District. For the year 2021, these tax-generated revenues
were $756,974.
RTD’s Base System sales tax obligations are secured by a 0.6% sales and use tax. The Fastracks
bonds and TIFIA loan are secured by a 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge from
the 0.6% Base System sales tax. Per TABOR, at the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s
0.4% sales and use tax rate will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate and maintain the assets
financed through FasTracks. For the year 2021 and 2020, respectively, RTD paid interest and
principal for sales tax revenue bonds and TIFIA loan of $88,756 and $102,767.

Direct Borrowing/Placements include the TIFIA loan which is payable from and secured by RTD’s

2021B Sales Tax Bonds. RTD established the TIFIA loan of up to $280,000 on December 1, 2011.
The proceeds from the TIFIA loan were used to pay eligible project costs on the FasTracks Eagle
P3 Project. RTD had drawn the full amount of the TIFIA loan through 2015 with interest payments
deferred and capitalized through November 1, 2020. The total outstanding principal and interest
for the TIFIA loan as of December 31, 2021 was $0. The TIFIA loan was secured by a senior
pledge of RTD’s 0.4% sales and use tax and a subordinate pledge of the 0.6% sales and use tax.
In addition, in 2016 RTD refunded the Series 2002A Certificates with a capital lease agreement
with JP Morgan Chase Bank N.A. In 2017, RTD refunded portions of previously outstanding Series

The sales tax bonds are secured by RTD’s 1.0% sales and use tax for which debt service payments
are withheld by a trustee from the monthly remittance prior to the Colorado Department of
Revenue remitting such taxes to RTD. Withholdings are equivalent to a proportionate monthly
amount of the annual principal and semi-annual interest payments and are held by the trustee
until such debt service payments are satisfied.
Certificates are issued by the Asset Acquisition Authority, Inc. (Authority), a nonprofit corporation
and component unit of RTD. The Authority issued Certificates with the proceeds used to acquire
certain equipment, facilities and infrastructure to be used by RTD as well as for construction of
the North Metro (N Line) commuter rail line. RTD leases the equipment acquired and elements
constructed with the proceeds from the Certificates under separate master lease purchase
agreements. For financial reporting purposes, RTD accounts for the Certificates and the capital
lease agreements as its own obligations.

A TU 1001 Pension P lan – Defined Benefit (2021)

The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1001 (ATU) Pension Plan was established pursuant to a
collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between RTD and the ATU. This plan covers substantially
all full-time union-represented employees in accordance with the CBA. The plan is a single
employer defined benefit pension plan administered by Compusys, Inc.

Benefits Provided
All benefits are paid in the form of a 50% joint and survivor annuity unless this form is rejected
by the participant and the spouse.
Normal retirement benefits under the ATU Plan are paid to participants who have attained age
65 and have been in the ATU Plan for 10 years. The benefit amount is based on final average
earnings, years of employment and age at the date of retirement.
Effective January 1, 1992, any participant who has accumulated 20 or more years of credited
service and terminated employment prior to attaining age 50 will be entitled to an early retirement
benefit starting on the first day of any month after he or she has attained age 50. The ATU Plan
was subsequently amended effective January 1, 2011 for new employees in which the years of
credited service needed to qualify for a normal retirement benefit was increased from five to 10
years and the benefit multiplier for both the normal and early retirement was revised.
Death benefits state if an employee who is not eligible for a vested benefit or not eligible to retire,
should die, his or her beneficiary will be paid the accumulated employee contributions plus
interest. Upon the death of a pensioner, a funeral benefit of $2 (two thousand dollars) will be
paid in a lump sum to the pensioner’s designated beneficiary.
An individual who becomes totally disabled prior to age 65 and retires from active employment
with RTD as a direct result of being totally disabled is entitled to a disability retirement benefit
provided he or she has worked for at least 10 years for RTD in covered employment. An individual
will be considered totally disabled upon receipt of a disability award from the Social Security
Administration. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a
disability benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was revised.
An individual who terminated employment on or after January 1, 1993, for any reason other than
retirement, will be entitled to a deferred vested benefit at age 65 provided he or she had worked
for at least 10 years in covered employment for RTD. A participant is entitled to deferred, vested
benefits as early as age 50 if he or she has worked for at least 20 years in covered employment
and terminates active employment on or after attaining age 50. If an individual with 20 or more
years of service terminated employment prior to age 50, benefits will be payable at any time after
age 50. Effective January 1, 2011 the years of credited service needed to qualify for a deferred
vested retirement benefit was increased from five to 10 years and the benefit multiplier was
revised.

Single Discount Rate
Projected benefit payments are required to be discounted to their actuarial present values using
a single discount rate that reflects (1) a long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
investments (to the extent that the plan’s fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to
pay benefits) and (2) tax-exempt municipal bond rate based on an index of 20-year general
obligation bonds with an average AA credit rating as of the measurement date (to the extent that
the plan’s projected fiduciary net position is not sufficient to pay benefits).
For the purpose of this valuation, the expected rate of return on pension plan investments is
7.00%, the municipal bond rate is 2.00% (based on the daily rate closest to but not later than
the measurement date of the Fidelity “20-Year Municipal GO AA Index”) and the resulting single
discount rate is 7.00%.

Contributions
Employee contributions are a source of revenue for the Trust and prior to 2013 were based on
a percentage of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) salaried employees’ base
compensation. Due to the decreasing active population and resulting reduction in future
expected payroll, the RTD Board approved a funding policy effective January 1, 2013, where the
recommended dollar contribution up to a cap of $3.1 million is made to the Trust each year.
This funding policy was established with the goal of achieving 100% funding by the end of 2032;
however, due to net actuarial losses, the RTD Board adopted a new funding policy effective in
2016 to remove the $3.1 million maximum and allowed for an amount to be contributed to keep
the Trust “actuarially sound” based on recommendations from the Trust’s actuary and RTD’s
Chief Financial Officer. Note that the recommended contribution can fluctuate annually due to

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2020
using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with
a liability roll forward to the measurement date of December 31, 2020:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rates of return on pension plan investments were determined using
a building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return
are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
The best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following data and
reflect assumed long-term expected real rates of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the
disclosure is based:

Single Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.00%. The projection of
cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that RTD contributions would be equal
to the actuarially determined contribution rate for the applicable fiscal years. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all
projected future benefit payments of current plan members.
Therefore, the long-term
expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The discount rate does not
incorporate nor require a 20-year tax-exempt general obligation municipal bond rate (with an
average rating of AA/Aa or higher).

Sensitivity of the Net Pension Liability to Changes in the Discount Rate
The following presents the net pension liability as of 12/31/21 calculated using the discount

Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation with date of January 1, 2019,
using the following actuarial assumptions applied to all periods included in the measurement with
a liability roll forward to December 31, 2019 for disclosure purposes for the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2020:
Inflation
Salary increases
Investment rate of return

2.75%
3.70% - 6.45%, based on age
7.00%

The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a
building-block method in which best estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return are
developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset
allocation percentage including expected inflation.
Best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class included in the
target asset allocation as of the December 31, 2020 are summarized in the following data and
reflect assumed long-term expected real rate of return over a 30-year horizon upon which the
disclosure is based:

R TD P lan – Defined Contribution
Plan Description
The RTD defined contribution plan is available for full-time salaried employees hired after January
1, 2008. The RTD Board adopted Amendment 8, effective January 1, 2008 for which RTD
contributes 7-9% of the employee’s qualifying wages. Contributions totaled $4,314 and $5,603
in 2021 and 2020, respectively. RTD employees cannot contribute to this plan. Membership was
681 and 646 active employees in 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust
The Amalgamated Transit Union Division 1001 Health and Welfare Trust (Trust) was formed
pursuant to a Trust Agreement effective July 1, 1971 between Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU)
Division 1001 and an agent of a transit enterprise owned by the City and County of Denver,
through July 3, 1974 and RTD thereafter. In addition to the original Denver Metro Division,
employees of other RTD divisions have been approved for participation in the Trust benefits. The
Trust agreement shall continue in full force and effect in all its terms and provisions so long as
there continues to be a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the ATU and RTD.

contributions by the employer and employee in which the share of benefit plan contributions is
set by the CBA. RTD’s contribution was $21,061 and $22,780 for the years ended December 31,
2021 and 2020, respectively. The Trust also provides insurance coverage for felonious assault
for each employee. The Trust self-insures part of its health, life insurance and short-term
disability benefits. The Trust issues audited financial statements which include financial
information for the plan. Those audited financial statements may be obtained from the Trust:
RTD ATU 1001 Health and Welfare Trust, 2821 S. Parker Road, Suite 215 Aurora, Colorado 800142602.
Unearned Compensation Plan
RTD offers its employees an unearned compensation plan (Plan), created in accordance with
Internal Revenue Code Section 457, which is available to substantially all employees and permits
them to defer a portion of their compensation to future years. Under the terms of the Plan, the
unearned compensation is available to participants upon termination, retirement, death or in the
event of an unforeseeable emergency or other financial hardship.
Compensated Absences
RTD considers all accrued compensated absences as due within one year. Employees accrue paid
time off (PTO), vacation and sick leave based on years of service. Employees are not allowed to
accumulate more than twice their annual PTO or vacation accrual and sick leave based on years
of service. Employees are paid any outstanding compensated absence balances upon leaving
RTD. RTD records these accrued compensated absences as current liabilities under the principle
of conservatism by assuming these amounts are the most RTD would be obligated to pay.

RTD has entered into a number of transactions in which certain of its light rail vehicles have been
leased to and subleased back from certain U.S. and foreign companies and has entered into a
transaction in which its maintenance facilities have been leased to and subleased back. As part
of these transactions, RTD irrevocably set aside certain monies (which were received from each
counter party as payment for its leasing of light rail vehicles and real property) with a third-party
trustee.
The monies held by such trustees will be utilized to make the lease payments owed by the RTD
under the transactions and are therefore considered fully funded and economically defeased.

Capital Projects
As of December 31, 2021, RTD has contracts for the construction of various capital projects and
the purchase of buses and light rail vehicles. The costs to complete these projects and the
purchase of buses and light rail vehicles total $151,213 and $82,604 in 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

Grant Match Requirements
Under the provisions of current grants, RTD is obligated to satisfy certain matching requirements.
At December 31, 2021, RTD had a commitment to provide $69,774 in matching funds in order to
receive $333,152 in future federal and state grant funds.

Privatization Contracts
In response to the privatization legislation (Note A), RTD has awarded contracts for specific
groups of routes not to exceed 58% as required by law for vehicular services. As of January
2021, 56.8% of RTD’s non-rail transit services are delivered by private contractors operating
under the auspices and direction of RTD.

ADA Paratransit Service
With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, RTD was mandated to
provide paratransit service to persons with disabilities unable to use RTD’s fixed route buses. This
service, branded Access-a-Ride, is a curb-to-curb transportation system offered to persons with
disabilities who cannot functionally use RTD’s regular fixed route system. Customers eligible for
Access-a-Ride services must originate their trip within 3/4 of a mile of an RTD fixed route. Since
September 1996, RTD has been in full compliance with ADA requirement to provide paratransit
service to persons with disabilities unable to use the fixed route system.

The Eagle P3 Project construction was completed in two phases with Phase I completed in 2016
and Phase II completed in 2019. Under the terms of the Eagle P3 Project agreement, RTD made
scheduled construction payments to DTP from 2011 through 2017 for completed project
elements. RTD began commuter rail services on the University of Colorado A Line and the B
Line in 2016 and began services on the G Line in 2019. Under the terms of the concessionaire
agreement, RTD will make scheduled secured principal and interest payments to DTP from 2017
through 2044 in addition to service payments for the provision of operations and maintenance
services by DTP. The principal and interest payments are fixed amounts for the term of the
agreement while the service payments are indexed each year according to certain inflation
measurements. In addition, the service payments may also be adjusted for schedule changes,
special services and certain availability factors.
In 2013, RTD entered a contract with Regional Rail Partners to construct the North Metro Rail
Line (N Line). The N Line is an 18.5-mile electric commuter rail line that will run from Denver
Union Station through Commerce City, Thornton and Northglenn to Highway 7 at 162nd Avenue
in North Adams County. The N Line opened in September of 2020 with service extending to 124th
Avenue.
In 2014, RTD entered a contract with Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. to design and construct
the Southeast Rail Extension (SERE) Project. SERE includes 2.3 miles extending the existing

Diesel Fuel Contract
RTD contracts with Mansfield Oil Company, Inc. (Mansfield) for diesel fuel for buses. The contract
is structured as a single year contract. RTD estimates 2022 usage of about 7.75 million gallons:
4.69 million gallons of RTD’s usage and 2.91 million gallons of RTD’s private carriers’ usage.
The estimated locked-in price commitment under the Mansfield contract in 2022 is for 7.75 million
gallons of diesel fuel for both RTD and private carriers at $2.30 per gallon or $17,442.

Contingencies

Federal Grants
RTD receives federal grants for capital projects and operating assistance, which are subject to
audit by the FTA. Although the outcome of any such audit cannot be predicted, it is
management’s opinion these audits will not result in liabilities to such an extent that they would
materially affect RTD’s financial position.

Self-Insurance

Payment commitments the Eagle P3 concessionaire, Denver Transit Partners, are as follows:

RTD is self-insured for general liability and Workers’ Compensation claims. Liabilities are reported

RTD does not carry excess liability insurance for personal injury and property damage. Under
the provisions of the Colorado Government Immunity Act, the maximum liability, with certain
exceptions as defined in the Act, to RTD for claims involving personal injury and property damage
is $387 per individual and $1,093 per incident for claims arising on or after January 1, 2018 and
before January 1, 2022.
For worker’s compensation, an excess coverage insurance policy covers individual claims in excess
of $2,000. The amount of settlements has not exceeded insurance coverage in any of the past
three years.
RTD’s liability for unpaid claims includes an amount for claims that have been incurred but not
reported (IBNR). RTD’s Risk Management Division determines incurred claims by investigating
the accident and establishing a reserve. Reserves are established on the day of assignment,
reviewed at 30 days and again at 90 days. Reserves are reviewed every 90 days thereafter and
based on ultimate exposure. This amount is included in other accrued expenses in the statement
of net assets. Changes in the balances of claims liabilities for both general liability and worker’s
compensation during the past year are as follows:

Contract Disputes and Legal Proceedings
RTD is party to a number of pending or threatened tort lawsuits, workers’ compensation claims,
or labor/employment claims under which it may be required to pay certain amounts upon final
disposition of these matters. RTD also has certain contract disputes being considered in
contractual dispute resolution proceedings. RTD’s legal counsel estimates that the ultimate
outcome of these matters is sufficiently covered by RTD’s general liability or worker’s
compensation reserves, project contingencies, or insurance, or would not otherwise materially
affect the financial statements of RTD.
The concessionaire for the Eagle Project, Denver Transit Partners, has filed litigation in Denver
District Court asserting claims against RTD based on an alleged change in law. DTP has alleged
damages for those claims in excess of $120,000 and RTD has filed a counterclaim of
approximately $30,000. RTD is vigorously defending that lawsuit and believes it is likely to
prevail.

NOTE J – BUDGETARY DATA
RTD’s annual budget is prepared on the same basis as that used for accounting except that the
budget also includes proceeds of long-term debt and capital grants as revenue and expenditures
include capital outlays and obligation principal payments and excludes TABOR rebates under
Amendment 1 of the Colorado Constitution, extraordinary loss and depreciation on, as well as
gains and losses on disposition of property and equipment. The budget sets forth all proposed
outlays for operations, planning, administration, development, debt service, and capital outlays
for the fiscal year. Prior to October 15, the RTD General Manager submits to the Board of
Directors a proposed operating and capital budget for the fiscal year commencing the following
January 1, which is made available for public inspection and comment. On or before
December 31, the budget is adopted in conjunction with an appropriation resolution by the Board
of Directors, who must also approve subsequent amendments thereto. In the absence of such
adoption, RTD has authority to begin making expenditures limited to 90% of the prior year’s
approved appropriation. RTD’s policy on budget transfers authorizes the RTD General Manager
to approve certain transfers within the budget.

Unused appropriations lapse at year-end, except the RTD Board of Directors has the authority,
as stated in the adopted appropriation resolution, to carry over the unused portion of funds for
capital projects not completed for a period not to exceed three years. As of December 31, 2021,
there was approximately $428,640 of unused 2021 appropriations for capital outlays available for
carryover to 2022.
In 2021, the RTD Board of Directors approved refinancing certain debt instruments by separate
resolution independent of the 2021 approved budget appropriations. The cost of extinguishment
of this debt resulted in expenditures exceeding the initial approved appropriations in 2021.

NOTE K – TAX, SPENDI NG AND DEBT LI M I TATI ONS
In November 1992, Colorado voters passed an amendment (Amendment 1) to the State
Constitution (Article X, Section 20) that limits the revenue raising and spending abilities of state
and local governments known as the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights (TABOR). The limits on property
taxes, revenue, and “fiscal year spending” include allowable annual increases tied to inflation and
local growth in construction valuation. Fiscal year spending as defined by the amendment
excludes spending from certain revenue and financing sources such as federal funds, gifts,
property sales, fund transfers, damage awards, and fund reserves. Amendment 1 requires voter
approval for any increase in mill levy tax rates, new taxes, or creation of multi-year debt. Revenue
earned in excess of the “spending limit” must be refunded to the taxpayers unless voters approve
retention of these revenues. In addition, Amendment 1 mandates that reserves equal to 3% of
fiscal spending be established for declared emergencies.

Attachment: 2021 ACFR (4661 : 2021 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report and Report to Governance)

A reconciliation for the years ended December 31 of the annual budget, as amended, to actual
revenue and expenses is as follows:

On November 7, 1995, the voters of the District exempted RTD from the revenue and spending
limitations concerning Amendment 1 through December 31, 2005. On November 2, 1999, the

93
Packet Pg. 108

1.D.1.b

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 2021 and 2020 (Dollars in Thousand)

voters of the District further exempted RTD from the revenue and spending limitations outlined
in Amendment 1 for the purpose of paying any debt incurred to finance the Southeast Corridor
light rail project or to operate such project for as long as any debt remains outstanding, but in
no event beyond December 31, 2026.
On November 2, 2004, the voters of the District authorized an increase in RTD’s sales and use
tax rate from 0.6% to 1.0%, effective January 1, 2005, to finance the FasTracks transit
improvement program. This authorization also exempted RTD from any revenue and spending
limitations on the additional tax and on any investment, income generated by the increased tax
revenue and allowed RTD to incur debt to finance the capital improvements included in the
FasTracks program. At the time that all FasTracks debt is repaid, RTD’s sales and use tax rate
will be reduced to a rate sufficient to operate the transit system financed through FasTracks. RTD
has $3.477 billion in authorized debt, subject to Amendment 1’s limitations. This debt was
authorized by the voters of the District in 2004 to pay for the FasTracks transit improvement
program. Based on estimated fiscal year spending for 2021, $25,623 of year-end net position
has been reserved for emergencies. Amendment 1 is complex and subject to judicial
interpretation. RTD believes it follows the requirements of Amendment 1 based on the
interpretations of the amendment’s language available at year-end.

NOTE L – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On March 1, 2022, RTD and the Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) Local 1001 completed
negotiations regarding the 2022 through 2024 Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA).
Approximately 2/3 of RTD’s employees are represented by this sole RTD labor agreement. The
CBA term is retroactive to January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. Contract terms include
improved working conditions, wage increases of 16% in 2022, 4% in 2023 and 4% in 2024 as
well as improvements to retirement benefits. Retirement benefit improvements include an
employer contribution of $160,000 by April 1, 2022 to the defined benefit (DB) pension plan to
reduce the funding shortfall and increase the annual multiplier for certain employees as well as
closing the DB plan to new employees beginning January 1, 2023 and funding a defined
contribution retirement plan for those new employees.
In April 2022, RTD received notice from the FTA regarding increases in federal grant funding
apportionments from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act available beginning in 2022.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Amended Budget

Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. ___, Series of 2022 to amend and appropriate funds
to increase the 2022 Amended Budget by $79.7 million to $2,105.5 million.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD may amend its annual budget at any time during the fiscal year, with Board approval. Budget
amendments are requested primarily when new information or unplanned activities arise, since the
Approved Budget appropriation, that require additional funding, reductions to funding or reallocation of
funds to the appropriate projects, accounts and cost centers. RTD’s budgetary controls require Board
appropriation of funding in order to authorize staff to expend those funds for specified needs.
DISCUSSION
The 2022 Adopted Budget was appropriated by the RTD Board in November 2021. This budget
amendment is requested to reflect changes that have occurred in the intervening period to adjust for
revised revenue assumptions and modifications to certain expenditure appropriations.
Fiscal Policy Adherence
The RTD Board approved the 2022 Fiscal Policy in November 2021. The following are key components
of the 2022 Fiscal Policy and explanations regarding the extent to which this 2022 Amended Budget
adheres to those requirements:
•

•

•

RTD will contract with a third party to provide sales and use tax forecasts: The 2022 Amended
Budget includes the March 2022 sales and use tax forecast from the University of Colorado
Leeds School of Business
Priority will be given to replacement of existing, backlog and deferred assets before consideration
of new assets: The 2022 Amended Budget provides funding for maintenance and replacement
needs according to the Asset Management Plan.
RTD will strive to maintain a fund balance equivalent to 3 months of operating expenses,
excluding depreciation, for unanticipated expenditures and increases in costs as well as to
mitigate service disruptions during economic downturns: The 2022 Amended Budget fund
balance is equivalent to 3.0 months of operating reserves.

Packet Pg. 139

1.D.2

•

RTD will maintain a minimum net revenue coverage ratio (revenues available for debt service after
subtracting operating expenses) of 1.2 times: The 2022 Amended Budget results in a 1.4 times
revenue coverage ratio.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Below and attached are summaries and details, respectively of the changes between the 2022 Adopted
Budget and 2022 Amended Budget appropriations requested.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Internal Audit Contract

Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to enter into a
contract with RubinBrown, LLC for internal audit services for three base years and two option years,
with a total not-to-exceed contract value of $3,212,106.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Director Erik Davidson
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In December 2020, the Colorado Office of the State Auditor (OSA) completed a performance audit of
RTD, and in April 2021, the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) performed a peer review
of RTD’s internal audit function, both of which resulted in recommendations for improving RTD’s internal
audit function. RTD entered into an engagement with RubinBrown, LLP (RubinBrown) to provide
professional assistance in implementing those recommendations according to standards promulgated by
the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) as well as to provide guidance regarding the proper staffing of
RTD’s internal audit function.
The Board approved the agency’s Internal Audit Charter in July 2021 in alignment with accepted
auditing standards promulgated by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA).
In August 2021, the Board approved a recommended action regarding the Board Governance
Restructure, which established an Audit Committee “responsible for ensuring the internal audit
function’s independence and efficacy, approving the internal audit charter and annual work plan.”
In January 2022, RubinBrown issued to the Board a report recommending that the agency outsource its
internal audit function in order to leverage the professional expertise of subject matter experts while also
benefitting from the efficiencies to be gained by contracting for hourly services as opposed to retaining
full-time employees.
Also in January 2022, Board Chair Vince Buzek created an Audit Ad Hoc Committee and appointed
Directors Peggy Catlin, Erik Davidson, and Bobby Dishell, who commenced meeting in January on a
recurring basis. In the first meeting held on January 10, 2022, the members determined that the
committee’s objective would be “to establish a sustainable internal audit function with governance in

Packet Pg. 167

1.D.3

adherence to the standards and best practices to minimize risk and exposure to the enterprise for the
betterment of the agency.”
The committee members further determined that a recommendation would be presented to the Board
authorizing the General Manager and CEO to engage in a solicitation for a professional services firm for
the provision of internal audit consulting and advisory services. The corresponding recommended action
was initially considered during the Executive Committee meeting held on January 20, 2022 and later
adopted by the Board during the monthly Board Meeting held on January 25, 2022.
During subsequent Audit Ad Hoc Committee meetings, the committee further discussed the report from
RubinBrown regarding the firm’s recommendations for the agency’s internal audit function and the
enterprise risk matrix also produced by RubinBrown, as well as IIA internal audit standards and
guidelines and the status of the solicitation to procure an external consultant to provide internal auditing
services. Following discussions with Audit Ad Hoc Committee members, staff prepared a draft scope of
work, based upon the committee members’ feedback, that would eventually be used for the solicitation
of internal audit services.
DISCUSSION
Staff issued a request for proposals for the provision of internal audit services in February 2022. The
solicitation included a 10% small business enterprise (SBE) goal. An evaluation committee comprised of
three external independent members with significant internal audit expertise, as well as two RTD
employees, evaluated the proposals. Director and Audit Ad Hoc Committee Chair Peggy Catlin also
participated in the evaluation committee proceedings as an observer.
The proposals were weighted as follows:
40% for qualifications of key individuals
25% for overall experience of the firm
10% for the SBE goal
25% for cost
The proposal evaluation committee selected RubinBrown as the proposer with the highest overall score.
RubinBrown will provide internal audit services on an hours-billed basis according to the hourly rates
negotiated in the contract based on work assigned by the Internal Audit Committee.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract with RubinBrown is in an amount not to exceed $3,212,106 over five years. Funding for
the first year of internal audit services is included in the 2022 Budget.

RFP NO. 122DO004

The Regional Transportation District (RTD) is seeking a professional services firm to provide Internal Audit
consulting and advisory services. RTD seeks to outsource its Internal Audit function to ensure alignment with
recognized audit standards and practices of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) International Professional
Practice Framework (Standards), in tandem with the Global Public Sector Insight: Independent Audit Committees
in Public Sector Organizations and ensure the efficacy of this function according to auditing best practices.
Provision of these services by a qualified independent third party is the result of implementation of
recommendations from the Colorado Office of the State Auditor’s (OSA) December 2020 state performance audit
as well as recommendations from the April 2021 American Public Transportation Association (APTA) RTD Internal
Audit Peer Review (Attachments A and B, respectively).
The successful contractor will, over a three-year contract term with additional one-year options, provide RTD with
internal audit services to foster independent, objective assurance and activity designed to add value and enhance
the agency’s core business functions.
Task 1: Establish an independent internal audit team
To migrate to a fully outsourced internal audit function. This initiative is primarily being undertaken to access the
industry and specialty expertise of a professional services firm capable of providing internal audit services that
are scalable and meet the governance responsibilities of RTD.
Deliverable:
A. Assign a single point of contact as a Chief Audit Executive (CAE) and core audit team to provide these
services. The contractor will also be capable of providing internal audit services for specialty areas such
as Information Technology
Deadline: Contract week 1
Task 2: Assist with establishment of an Independent RTD Audit Committee
RTD’s Audit Committee previously consisted of a committee of the whole, which included the 15 members of RTD’s
elected Board. Best practices dictate that the Audit Committee be comprised of three to five members with the
appropriate skills and relevant experience, including a financial expert. Furthermore, these Audit Committee
members should be independent and not be employed by or provide services to the organization beyond their
duties as an Audit Committee member.

Task 3: Provide a recordkeeping, tracking, and reporting process
RTD Internal Audit currently maintains most internal audit records and workpapers in hard-copy format with
electronic records saved on network drives. Furthermore, RTD does not have a robust method for tracking audits
or follow-up activities and outsourcing the Internal Audit Function will necessitate recordkeeping by the Contractor.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Zero-Fare Ozone Grant Program Intergovernmental
Agreement (IGA)

Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO, or her designee, to enter into an
IGA with the Colorado Energy Office and to authorize the transfer of up to $2,200,000 from the
Unrestricted Fund in accordance with SB22-180 to effectuate the Zero-Fare Ozone Grant Program.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
During the 2022 Legislative Session, the Colorado General Assembly passed, and the Governor signed
into law, SB22-180, concerning programs to reduce ground level ozone through increased use of transit.
The legislation creates a grant program in the Colorado Energy Office (Office), which would provide up
to $11,000,000 in funding for RTD to implement a zero-fare period of at least 30 days during the ozone
season. To participate in the grant program, SB22-180 requires a 20% agency funding match.
DISCUSSION
In pursuing grant funding to support a zero-fare initiative during August 2022, the agency demonstrates
its commitment to meet the Strategic Priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, Employee
Ownership, and Financial Success.
Staff is seeking approval of the transfer of up to $2,200,000 from the Unrestricted Fund to be used as
the 20% agency funding match required by SB22-180 and necessary to facilitate the Office grant
application process. Further, the funding will facilitate the approval of an expected IGA with the
Colorado Energy Office necessary to incur eligible expenses and receive reimbursement from the Office.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact is estimated to be up to $2,200,000, representing the local match of 20% of the
estimated cost of up to $11,000,000 to provide zero-fare transit services during August 2022. The
estimated costs account for fare revenue not collected during the zero-fare period, as well as the local
match funding available from 2022 budget savings derived as a result of expenditures being lower than
prior appropriations.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Subregional Service Council Formation

Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the recommendations of the Subregional Service Council Working
Group as detailed herein and to direct staff to form Subregional Service Councils consistent with the
2021 Agency Responses to the RTD Accountability Committee Final Report.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
William C. Van Meter, Assistant General Manager, Planning
William Sirois, Senior Manager Transit Oriented Communities, Planning
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
In the Governance and Executive Leadership section of the RTD Accountability Committee Final Report,
the committee recommended that RTD form subregional service councils (SSCs) “to increase input from
local communities.” In direct response to Recommendations 8, 9, and 10 of the report, RTD convened a
working group of local stakeholders, including city and county staff, transportation management
associations, DRCOG and other transit advocates from throughout the district. During three meetings
held in the spring of 2022, the working group discussed the purpose, role, membership and boundaries
of the new service councils and developed a set of recommendations that will guide SSC formation.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to advance the recommendations of the RTD
Accountability Committee, as well as to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities of Community
Value and Customer Excellence. The Subregional Service Council Working Group developed the
following recommendations:
• The purpose of the SSCs will be to provide recommendations and feedback to RTD from the
subregional perspective
• The SSC meetings will generate ongoing dialogue between local communities and RTD staff in a
more formal and cooperative manner than existing service sector listening sessions
• SSCs will be advisory bodies, not decision-making bodies
• SSCs will meet three to four times each year, and their schedules will not be tied to RTD’s
service change schedule
• SSCs will be composed of:
o Staff from cities and counties
o Transit advocates representing transportation management associations, non-governmental
organizations, and customers
o RTD staff
• RTD will hold separate elected officials’ briefings up to two times each year
• SSC boundaries will be set using the travel shed model

Packet Pg. 175

1.D.5

Upon approval of this recommended action, staff will work with local stakeholders to recruit SSC
members and form the SSCs.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the recommendations of the Subregional Service Council Working Group will not result
in any direct or foreseeable agency financial impacts

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:

City of Aurora Annexations

Board Meeting Date:
June 28, 2022
RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve the revised boundary map of the District and authorize the
Secretary to certify the boundary map and description to reflect the areas newly annexed to RTD
pursuant to the provisions of CRS §§32-9-106.1 and 106.6(b), designated as follows:
a) City of Aurora Ordinances 2021-42, 2021-44, and 2021-46: Director District B (Director Lewis)
b) City of Aurora Ordinances 2020-25, 2021-25, 2021-26, 2020-066: Director District F (Director
Broom)
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
CRS §32-9-106.1 requires that RTD revise its District boundary map and legal description following any
boundary changes. Further, pursuant to CRS §32-9-106.6(b), any area annexed by an in-District
municipality on or after May 25, 1994, is automatically included in the District. The revised RTD
boundary map and legal description must be approved by the Board of Directors, and the Board
Secretary must certify the map and legal description to the state and the appropriate county.
Additionally, the Board must assign the newly annexed areas to specific Director Districts.
DISCUSSION
The adoption of this action will support the agency’s Strategic Priority of Community Value. The parcels
of land involved in the annexations described herein are all now part of the City of Aurora. Staff is
recommending that each parcel be assigned to the closest existing Director District. This table provides
the general location, acreage, zoning, and proposed Director District assignment for each parcel.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
June 14, 2022

Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chris Quinn, Planning Project Manager
Carl Green, Jr., Acting Director, Civil Rights
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
Since the agency implemented the most recent fare changes derived from the Pass Program Study
recommendations in 2019, the agency has received feedback from many customers and stakeholders
stating that current fares and pass programs are overly expensive and complicated. RTD is also
experiencing other changes that affect the outlook on fare policy. Like many other agencies in the United
States, there has been a consistent concerning trend of declining ridership over the last several years.
That trend dramatically worsened due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
DISCUSSION
The Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis project began in December 2021. The project team has
now completed the first round of public engagement, which included:
•
•
•
•
•

Public launch of the project website and social media campaign
Customer and community meetings held in English and Spanish
Focus groups led by community partners
Feedback panels representing equity, pass programs, and jurisdictional stakeholders
Online survey

Additionally, the project team has conducted internal staff interviews, focus groups, and workshops.
The presentation provides a summary of the feedback received from the outreach activities noted herein
and a summary of upcoming outreach activities.
