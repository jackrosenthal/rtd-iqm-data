Subject:

Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes
Extension and Express Bus Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the
IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment
will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.
BACKGROUND
This action addresses the 2014 goal of innovative and fiscally sustainable service delivery and the 2015
goal of improving service delivery.
In March 2012, the Board of Directors approved a commitment of $750,000 toward the local match for
CDOT’s I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project. At the time, CDOT was in the process of
submitting a TIGER IV grant submission to fund this project, and requested that RTD contribute a portion
of the local match if CDOT were to receive the grant. RTD agreed to contribute $750,000 toward the
local match based on future operating cost savings on the bus routes currently operating on I-25
between US 36 and 120th Avenue, which would save travel time by using the express lanes. CDOT
received the TIGER grant in 2012, and the IGA obligating RTD for its contribution to the project is
effective November 22, 2014.
DISCUSSION
The I-25 North Express Lanes Extension Project will make efficient use of the existing highway
pavement by adding one additional express lane in each direction on I-25 between 120th Avenue on the
north to U.S. 36 on the south and would then connect to the existing managed lanes at U.S. 36 going
south into Denver. No additional right-of-way will be needed to implement this project. This project
represents a collaborative effort among CDOT, RTD, the Denver Regional Council of Governments,
several local jurisdictions and associated agencies in developing a cost-effective, near-term solution to
address the congestion on I-25.
The IGA is between RTD and the Colorado High Performance Transportation Enterprise (HPTE), a division
of CDOT. Like the previously signed US 36 IGA, the North I-25 IGA guarantees RTD travel times on the
managed lanes and commits that tolls during the peak hours will not be lower than corresponding RTD
fares.
CDOT started work on this project in October 2013, and expects the project to be completed in October
2015. Once this work is completed, several existing routes along the north I-25 corridor will benefit
from travel time savings by using the new express lanes. These routes include the 40X, 120X and
122X express routes, and the LNX and LSX branches of the regional route L.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2014 payment would be provided through this budget transfer. Funding for the 2015
payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would
expect to see operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000 and $282,000 per year
depending on the revised schedules and resulting run cutting process.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement
Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and
Express Bus Project. Funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended
Budget.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the transfer of funds. This is not
recommended because the IGA was executed per Board action. RTD would be in default to CDOT if
the transfer were not approved because RTD would not be able to pay the invoice due in 2014.
