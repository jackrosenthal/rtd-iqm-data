#### 1. Budget Transfer for I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project

It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the transfer of $375,000 from the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project to fund the 2014 payment for the IGA for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project.  Funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget.

Motion:                 Chair Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 25, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Tobiassen seconded the motion.

Discussion:                 Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, noted that funding for the I-25 North Express Lanes Extension and Express Bus Project funding for 2014 would be provided through this budget transfer.  He said that funding for the 2015 payment will be provided in the 2015 Recommended Budget. Once the project is open, RTD would expect to see operating and maintenance cost savings of between $64,000 and $282,000 per year depending on the revised schedules and resulting run cutting process.

Director Lubow asked for clarification on the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project fund since she had never heard of it.  She wanted to know why there were funds available as well as what would need to happen in order to replace the funds if needed.  Rick Clarke answered that the Strategic Budget Plan (SBP) includes a line item for construction, replacement, and improvement of the Drivers Kiosks.  The 2014 line item still has funds available.  These funds are not anticipated to be used during the remainder of the year. Rick Clarke added that the 2015 SBP includes a line item for Driver Kiosks, so the line item will be funded then.

Director Daly wanted to make sure the operators would not be left high and dry.  Rick Clarke reaffirmed the Directors that the Drivers Kiosk Replacement Project fund is important and incorporated into the 2015 SBP.

Director Folska noted that she talked to Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager for Bus Operations, about adding a Drivers Kiosk at the W. Bowles Ave. and S. Wadsworth Blvd. intersection.  She said that operators currently use the Chili’s restaurant as a relief station.  Rick Clarke mentioned that staff is in the process of relocating the Southwest Plaza bus stop.  The relocation includes the addition of a Drivers Kiosk.  He said that staff is waiting on Southwest Plaza to confirm the new stop location.  Director Folska asked staff to keep the visually impaired community in the conversation of the bus stop relocation.

Committee Chair James declared the motion PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

#### 1. Strategic Plan Update

Brian Welch, Senior Manager for Technical Services, reviewed the RTD 2015 Strategic Plan presentation as included in the Planning & Development Committee Meeting Packet for November 11, 2014. The presentation included:

- Strategic Plan Schedule

- Proposed Plan Name (Move, Connect, Transform)

- Proposed Vision Statement (Transforming Regional Mobility and Quality of Life Through Innovation and Collaboration)

- General Manager Goals and Plan Strategies

- Draft Strategies and Initiatives

- Next Steps

Brian Welch mentioned that the intention of the update was to gather feedback from the Directors on the proposed name and the proposed vision statement.

Committee Chair James pointed out that he likes the structure/organization of the process.  He said that he had a positive reaction to the proposed plan name and proposed vision statement as they are concise and tell a story.  He reiterated to the Directors that the Board revisiting the plan frequently is an important part of the process.

Director Folska pointed out that the Planning and Development Committee Meeting packet was not ADA accessible.  Since she was not able to read it, she said that she had no information on the matter and could not make a comment.

Director Lubow thanked staff for their work.  She reiterated her position that the Board needs to give more direction.  She said that she does not relate to the proposed plan name or vision statement and that she had no input on the matter.  Director Lubow said that this does not mean the proposed plan name and vision statement are wrong.  She said that she would like to see some areas represented in the name and vision statement: FasTracks completion, fare equity, and increasing transit for constituents who paid taxes but get little transit.  She added that she was not sure where all those components would fit in.

Director Walker said that he liked the name as it stated a what, a why, and a how.  He mentioned that the vision statement seemed fine.  He noted that the strategic plan will be a long term plan.  Director Walker said that he looks forward to the next ideas staff will bring to the Directors for feedback.

Director Solano said that he is getting tied up in the words and semantics of the proposed plan name and proposed vision statement.  He mentioned that he was confused as to what the next step is.  He noted that the Fare Task Force had no Board members nor Citizen Advisory Committee members.  He wondered why the Board is included in some areas but not others.  Director Solano said that this was confusing.

Director Bagley asked staff if their intention was to have the Board approve of the proposed plan name and vision statement by vote.  Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, said that staff was looking for enough head nods to move forward.  The next step would require more involvement from the Directors.  Bill Van Meter said that a vote would be at the discretion of the Board.  Director Bagley said that he did not think staff had enough head nods to move forward.

Committee Chair James respectfully disagreed with Director Bagley.  He said that in the absence of negatives staff had the discretion to move forward.

Chair Sisk said that he appreciated staff’s work.  He noted that he supports the proposed plan name.  He said that he was having difficulty with the proposed vision statement.  He stated that “quality of life” has different meanings for different people.  He said that the proposed vision statement is not capturing what it needs to capture.

Director Folska added that dialogue is part of the process.  She said that if she knew what the proposed vision statement was she could ask staff the meaning of every word.  She stated that the reason she is passionate about public transit is because it enables everyone to reach their full potential.

Director Menten said that she was fine with what was presented.  She compared the discussion to painting a wall white or egg shell white.  She said that naming something was not of great importance to her.

Director Bagley stated that he did not hear the head nod from the Directors.  He added that the name and vision statement are not as critical as the strategy.  Brian Welch said that staff was not anticipating direction on strategy during the current meeting, just the name and vision statement.

Bill Van Meter apologized for the packet not being ADA accessible.  He read the proposed name and proposed vision statement.

Committee Chair James asked staff if they had enough feedback to move forward.  Bill Van Meter said that staff did have enough to move forward.  He noted that from the discussion it seemed that staff is moving in the right direction but needs to fine tune the vision statement in order to gather enough head nods to move forward.  Bill Van Meter noted that staff is looking forward to the strategic discussion with the Board.

Committee Chair James asked the Directors to contact Bill Van Meter or Brian Welch with any questions and suggestions.  He asked staff to contact the Directors with any questions.

#### 2. CDOT FASTER Grants

Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager for Planning, reviewed the CDOT FASTER Grants Set-Aside Project List presentation as included in the Planning & Development Committee Meeting Packet for November 11, 2014.  The presentation included a background on the grants funding process, the new 2016-17 process, and a list of the set-aside projects for the next couple of years.

Director Folska stated that she had mentioned to Dave Genova, Assistant General Manager for Safety, Security and Facilities, and Phil Washington, General Manager, to widen the light rail high blocks where room makes it feasible.  She encouraged staff to not only meet ADA requirements but to exceed them.

Director Lubow asked why the $4 to $5 million past funding was reduced to $3 million.  Bill Van Meter said that the past process was a competitive process.  The new process sets aside money for RTD projects.  RTD communicated receptivity to the new process as it eliminated the competitive factor.

Director Menten asked if the pool of funding for FASTER is the CDOT fee funding that was not taken to the voters.  Marla Lien, General Counsel, said that Director Menten was correct in that the fee funding was not taken to the voters.  Marla Lien added that she did not remember if that is the only source of funding for FASTER grants.  Bill Van Meter added that he did not recall if there are other sources of funding.  Director Menten asked staff to assist her in finding out the status of the bridges that were supposed to be repaired with what she called the “illegal tax hike” by CDOT to voters.  Bill Van Meter said that CDOT has been transparent with their plans and funding, so he should be able to access that information.

Director Menten mentioned that she did a walk-through with a sight-impaired gentleman through the West corridor to note what could be improved in the future.  She said a million dollars seems like a lot of money to replace and/or repair the yellow tactile strips.  She asked staff to explain to her offline what replacing the tactile strips entails.  She noted that Ms. Jacquez, who has participated in Board meetings’ public participation and accompanied them on the walk through, stated that someone in the planning department in the northern area of the State is familiar with tactile strips’ technological improvements.  She asked staff to connect with this planning department to see if this is something that could benefit RTD.

### D. Other Matters

Chair Sisk congratulated the newly elected Board members and the re-elected Board members on their election.  He thanked them for being willing to take the time and effort to.  He added that there will be an appropriate time in the near future to say goodbye and thank you to Director Daly and Director Rivera-Malpiede.

### F. Adjourn

Committee Chair James adjourned to the Government Relations Committee meeting at 6:49 p.m.
