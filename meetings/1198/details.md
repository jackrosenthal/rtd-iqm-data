#### 1. 2013 - 009 : Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

Motion:              Director Tobiassen made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 20, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Susan Altes, Manager of Real Property, explained that this is the third time she has presented to the Board an acquisition resolution and accompanying board action on the I-225 project.  She stated that this project is a design-build project so as the design moves further and further along, nearing 60-80%, there are design changes that come about requiring additional properties.  She stressed to the Board that these are very small property acquisitions.

Director Daly noted that some of the properties belong to American Furniture Warehouse.  He asked if they were comfortable with RTD purchasing the property.  Susan Altes explained that property owners are not approached until staff receives Board approval; however, she believes that property owners have been involved with the public information meeting process.

Director Bagley asked how RTD handles a situation in which we would need to take 80% of a property and the remaining 20% remnant really becomes of no use to the property owner.  Susan Altes explained that RTD follows the Uniform Act so if the remnant has no economic value RTD is required to make an offer to the property owner for the remnant.  She explained that the economic value is determined during the appraisal process; this means that a remnant could be uneconomic to the property owner but not the market.  Susan Altes stated that this has happened before but RTD tries to resolve that type of situation during the negotiation process.  Director Bagley asked the staff and Board to remain cognizant of the fact that a property may have economic value, just not to the current property owner.

Director Deadwyler indicated that she did have questions but thought it most appropriate to meet with staff offline.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion passed.

#### 2. Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride Facilities) by and between Regional Transportation District and Stadium Management Company, LLC

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado.  Said Subleased Premises will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters.  Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the August 20, 2013 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager for Capital Programs, explained that the environmental impact statement and ridership modeling for the West Line identified the need for a certain amount of parking around Sports Authority Field at Mile High.  He said that rather than spending a lot of money to build our own parking staff had the strategy of working with the Stadium District and Stadium Management Company (SMC) to sublease existing parking.

Susan Altes, Manager of Real Property, explained that the Stadium District currently leases the desired parking facilities to SMC, so our sublease will be with SMC.  The sublease will be for 1,100 spaces in Lot M.  Susan Altes stated that currently these spaces are sold to season ticket holders so there will be 15 days each year that the spaces are unavailable to our patrons according to the Denver Broncos’ football schedule.  She said that SMC is also retaining rights to an additional 15 days per year for concerts or special events that they may use.  The lease allows RTD to perform parking management functions allowing us to implement parking policies consistent with our other Park-n-Ride facilities as well as keep all revenue generated.  Susan Altes shared that there are also times identified in the sublease agreement that the number of parking spaces can be adjusted.

Director Folska inquired into the length of the sublease agreement and the annual cost to RTD.  Susan Altes stated the sublease agreement is a 30 year term with provisions for termination in 2016, 2023 and 2028.  She explained that there is no land available at this location for RTD to build parking.  The cost of the sublease agreement for 1,100 spaces is $677,417 annually with an agreement that every 15th year the property will be re-appraised by both parties and the cost will be re-negotiated.

Director Folska asked if there was a provision in the sublease agreement that would allow RTD to sublease the parking to a developer of high density housing.  Susan Altes said there was not a provision for this in the sublease.

Chair Anderson asked who will be responsible for the maintenance of the parking.  Susan Altes said that because RTD’s need is daily and very early in the morning, RTD will be responsible.

Director Sisk asked if the Stadium Management Company was a private LLC and how they came to own the property.  Susan Altes stated that SMC is the Denver Broncos Organization.  She explained that SMC does not own the property; the Stadium District owns the property and has a lease with SMC.  Director Sisk asked if we knew what SMC pays to lease the parking and if that was factored into the appraisal.  Susan Altes explained that the appraisal was just done on the cost to lease the lot.  She said staff would get Director Sisk information on SMC’s costs.

Director Sisk expressed concern that tax payers funded the stadium and parking lots and now we are using tax payer funds to pay the Broncos for the right to use the lot.

Director Menten noted that paving the parking lot is also included in RTD’s maintenance responsibility.  She shared that she stopped by the parking lot and it is in very bad condition.  She wonders if we have a rough idea what it will cost to get the lot looking nice.  Rick Clarke stated that staff has budgeted $500K for paving.

Director Folska commented that $500K seems like a lot to pave a parking lot.  She asked if the Broncos would help with the cost.  Rick Clarke stated that unfortunately this cost is not a lot of money.  The amount does include some repairs to the sprinkler system, conduits for parking management, etc. but it is primarily repaving.  He noted that as Director Menten said, the parking lot is not in great shape.  He said staff will put it out to bid and hopefully get a lower price but they feel good about the estimate.  Susan Altes explained that the Broncos feel the cost of paving has already been negotiated into the sublease price.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion passed.

Chair Anderson asked to explain her ‘No’ vote.  She expressed concern that we are subleasing a parking lot from the Broncos that we need to repair.  She understands that was included in the negotiations; however, she has been involved in a few negotiations regarding parking lots and she would hate for RTD to have buyer’s remorse.  Chair Anderson expressed she may change her vote at the Board meeting but needs to see more information about how the re-paving was included in negotiations.  She also expressed concern about Director Sisk’s statement that taxpayers paid for the parking lot and now we are paying the Broncos.

Director Rivera-Malpiede stated that she was the ‘Mover’ for this action but could decide to change her vote at the Board meeting.  She explained that this area was right in the middle of her District in a very low income area; she does not want her constituents to think RTD is paying for a parking lot we already own.  She asked for further information as she is not feeling settled about this action.

Marla Lien, General Counsel, explained that the Metropolitan Football Stadium District (Stadium District) is a political subdivision of the State of Colorado that was created for the purpose of planning, acquiring land and constructing a professional football stadium.  The Stadium District is authorized to levy and collect sales tax to fund their activities.  She stated that the Stadium District leases the parking and stadium to the Broncos; the money the Stadium District receives from the Broncos will eventually pay off the bonds and retire the tax.  Marla Lien explained that there is nothing that allows RTD to acquire parking, land, etc. from another state entity for free; under eminent domain the Broncos are entitled to just compensations.  She stated that RTD has no ability short of legislative change or the Broncos feeling very generous to force them to let us use the property for free.

#### 1. I-225 Rail Corridor Update

Chuck Culig, Project Manager, and Tina Jaquez, Public Information Manager, reviewed a PowerPoint presentation with the Board that is available in the August 6, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Committee Chair Hoy thanked staff for their presentation.  He thinks it is great to see all the activity happening on the line.

Director Rivera-Malpiede shared that she works very closely with people in that corridor.  She has heard nothing but rave reviews about the stakeholder meetings and she congratulated the team on their success.  Chuck Culig stated that RTD’s partners at the City of Aurora have been instrumental in the communications/meetings.  He wanted to recognize them for the support they have given RTD.

Director Solano complimented staff on the clear and concise update.  He expressed that it keeps him motivated when things are coming down the pipeline for other areas.

Director Folska believes Tina Jaquez and Chuck Culig are really outstanding.  She applauded them and their team for the efforts and hard work.  She asked Tina Jaquez if she had any more information regarding the News 4 traffic shows.  Tina Jaquez said that she does not have a lot to share about the shows but staff definitely sees it as a goal to educate the City of Aurora in how it will be to have trains running down the middle of the street.

Director Deadwyler stated that she wants to give Chuck Culig and Tina Jaquez kudos for the work they have done on the I-225 project.  She expressed that there is a vast difference in what she deals with on the north side versus the south side of her District.  She applauded them for the work they are doing in Aurora.

#### 2. Central Rail Extension Update

Andy Mutz, Project Manager, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the August 6, 2013 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

Director Walker commented that he remembers when the timing of the lights in Denver was changed but he did not look at the reasons or goals.  He wonders if the goals have been met or problems eliminated with the change.  He also wonders if there is any chance Denver will change them to something other than 90 seconds again.  Any Mutz stated that the goal of the study is to determine if we have missed something and if there is a way to use the existing infrastructure that we are not seeing.  In terms of the timing, if Denver changed the timing back to 75 seconds that would solve the Central Corridor problem.  Rick Clarke stated that staff has not heard that Denver plans to make any changes.  He explained that 90 is pretty standard; this was done because of overall traffic flows but also to help RTD when we started running 4 car trains.  Rick Clarke shared that staff did have some concerns that was expressed to the City but this is the timing they have chosen.

Director Deadwyler asked the cost of the study.  She also noted that if the timing could go back to 75 seconds that would please a lot of people in the outlying neighborhoods because they really want the 29th Avenue station re-opened.  Andy Mutz stated it is around $400K.  He explained that with regards to timing, it is ultimately up to the City and County of Denver and they seem comfortable with 90 seconds.  Director Deadwyler asked staff to meet with the City of Denver to express to them that there are a lot of people that would like to see the station at 29th Avenue returned.  Rick Clarke said that his team would get with her to discuss.

### E. Other Matters

Director Daly shared that he and several other Board members went on a tour of the East corridor with Kevin Flynn.  He said it was a fabulous tour; the progress is overwhelming.  Director Daly believes he really gained a lot from the trip and thinks his fellow Directors did as well.

Committee Chair Hoy agrees that everyone that went on the tour really enjoyed it.  He stated that it is great to see all the track laid down; it is really coming together.

Director Lubow shared with the Board that she has been dealing with the decision by CDOT to change the minimum number of riders from two to three to warrant not paying a toll in the HOV lane on the US36 BRT managed lanes.  She stated that she has been getting many irate emails and phone calls about this issue.  Director Lubow said that in researching the issue she learned that while there were many reasons the decision was made, a large factor was that the private partner in this project needs to get paid an appropriate amount of tolls per the contract.  She explained that the reason she was raising this issue is that she sees this as not the only time there will be a problem that arises from our Public-Private Partnerships.  She mentions this so that the Board and staff can be sensitive of these consequences and work to explain them to the constituents.

Director Deadwyler stated that she has been on the East line tour three times and it is really fascinating.  She encourages all the other Board members to take the tour.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 7:56 p.m. to the Planning and Development Committee.
