Date:

Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Property Acquisition for the I-225 Project

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors pass the attached
property acquisition resolution certifying properties as necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed with all requisite legal process under state eminent
domain law.
BACKGROUND
RTD must obtain possession of and make available to the successful proposer for the construction of the
I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project the right of way necessary for the construction of the project.
Property needs will be identified and specific legal descriptions prepared beginning the formal acquisition
process. This process begins with good faith negotiations, but may ultimately result in court
proceedings under eminent domain law. Staff would like to proceed with the acquisition of all property
identified, subject to any modifications or additions required by the contractor and/or construction
activities.
DISCUSSION
On September 18, 2012 and March 26, 2013 the RTD Board approved the acquisition of properties for
the I-225 project. As detailed final design has progressed by the design-build contractor, additional
acquisitions have been identified. These acquisitions are necessary in those areas for project
construction.
State and federal law mandate that specific procedures be followed in the acquisition of property for a
public project when the acquiring governmental entity has powers of eminent domain. RTD staff and its
outside counsel and property acquisition consultants are familiar with and adhere to these processes,
which commence with offers and good faith negotiations, but may result in court filing and eminent
domain proceeding to resolve property acquisitions. The attached resolution and right of way plan
tabulation sheets specify the additional property that has been delineated by design and authorize the
General Manager and/or Property Managers to certify specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
All right of way acquisition is included in the I-225 budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors pass the attached property acquisition resolution certifying properties as
necessary for construction of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project and authorize staff to proceed
with all requisite legal process under state eminent domain law.

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not pass the attached resolution. Failure to pass the
attached resolution may result in project delay.

REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT
RESOLUTION NO. ______ SERIES OF 2013
I-225 SEGMENT 2 LIGHT RAIL PROJECT PROPERTY ACQUISITION

Whereas, the Board has reviewed and approved maps of the I-225 Segment 2 Light Rail Project; and
Whereas, the Board has reviewed the attached Right of Way plans tabulation sheets, which list the
property to be acquired;
Whereas, the RTD will conduct good faith negotiations and make an offer of just compensation to
acquire the Properties; and
Whereas, to ensure timely completion of the Project, it may be necessary to initiate condemnation
proceedings to acquire the additional identified Properties and to obtain immediate possession of the
properties; and
Whereas, consistent with the intent of the Project, the RTD or its designee shall have the authority to
amend (enlarge, decrease or change) the legal descriptions of the Properties as it deems necessary in the
best interests of the Project; and
Whereas, the RTD is empowered pursuant to the laws of the State of Colorado to exercise the power of
eminent domain in the manner provided by Article I of Title 38, C.R.S.
Whereas, the Board recognizes that each and every property owner impacted by the I-225 Segment 2
Light Rail Project, although financially compensated according to the law, makes a significant personal
sacrifice for the public good, a sacrifice not made by others who benefit from the Project.
Now, Therefore Be It Resolved That:
The Board hereby finds and determines that the Project constitutes a public purpose, that there is
a public need and necessity to acquire the properties within the corridor for and in furtherance of a
public purpose, and that the additional acquisitions are for the benefit of the public health, welfare and
safety.
The Board directs that the General Manager and/or the Project Managers, as the Board’s
delegatees, shall certify the specific legal descriptions of the needed properties.
The Board directs that the RTD delegatees should negotiate in good faith for the acquisition of
the property and if the delegatee is unable to acquire any property through good faith negotiations, then
the RTD may acquire such property through the exercise of the power of eminent domain.

Packet Pg. 6

1.C.1

The Board further resolves to make every possible effort to communicate with property owners,
to recognize time constraints that may impact them, and to address concerns of owners to the
maximum extent feasible without negatively impacting the Project.
The Board finds and determines that the RTD should obtain possession of the Properties as soon
as permitted by law.
Made and adopted this ___ day of _________________, 2013.

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: August 1, 2013

From:

Richard Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

July 31, 2013

Board Meeting Date: August 6, 2013

Subject:

Sublease Agreement (RTD Park and Ride
Facilities)
by
and
between
Regional
Transportation
District
and
Stadium
Management Company, LLC

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to enter into a
Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company (SMC) on certain real
property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to
the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises
will be leased for the purpose of operating parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this
lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year
funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
BACKGROUND
The West Corridor Final Environmental Impact Statement, October, provides for RTD to lease parking
spaces from the stadium for RTD parking. The Full Funding Grant Agreement by and between the
Regional Transportation District and the United States Department of Transportation, Federal Transit
Administration acknowledges this commitment.
DISCUSSION
The lease of approximately 1,100 parking spaces, known as Lot M, will be for a term of thirty (30)
years. There are provisions in the lease for early termination of the lease in whole or in part in the 3rd
Sublease Year (2016), the tenth Sublease Year (2023) and the 15th Sublease Year (2028). The lease
can be extended twice, each for an additional fifteen (15) year period.
The lease will provide that RTD may retain any and all revenues generated from the parking of vehicles
within the Subleased Premises on all dates during the term with the exception of SMC Event Days. The
SMC shall have the exclusive right to use the Subleased Premises in connection with any event to be
held at the Stadium for fifteen (15) days, guaranteed, and may designate another fifteen (15) days
during each calendar year. SMC shall provide RTD with a written schedule of the dates which SMC
designates as the SMC Use Dates as soon as practicable after SMC’s receipt of each National Football
League schedule and will provide at least thirty (30) days prior to any of the other optional fifteen (15)
days. RTD will notice patrons of the dates parking is unavailable at this location.
RTD will be obligated to provide any and all services necessary for RTD’s operation of the Subleased
Premises during the term.
The lease will also contain provisions for possible redevelopment of the site by SMC. RTD will make
certain improvements (primarily re-paving) on the lot consistent with standards at other RTD parking
facilities and as specified by the lease.

Packet Pg. 13

1.C.2

FINANCIAL IMPACT
The rent for the first Sublease Year shall be $677,417.00. Rent shall be subject to CPI adjustment
effective the second year. This is approximately $600 per space per year, which is significantly less
than the cost of constructing new parking. The annual rent is a result of negotiation based on the RTD
appraisal prepared by Peter D. Bowes, MAI, Bowes and Company and an appraisal prepared by David B.
Clayton, ASA, JD, Clayton and Company, Inc. for the law firm Robinson Waters & O’Dorisio, P.C., legal
counsel for the Stadium Management Company.
Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013 Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and
future year funding will be included in future year FasTracks operating budgets.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute
all documents necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium
Management Company (SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at
Mile High and certain parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and County of
Denver, State of Colorado. Said Subleased Premises will be leased for the purpose of operating
parking facilities for use by commuters. Funding for this lease in 2013 is included in the 2013
Amended Budget for FasTracks operations, and future year funding will be included in future year
FasTracks operating budgets
2. Do not authorize the General Manager and/or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to enter into a Sublease Agreement for parking with the Stadium Management Company
(SMC) on certain real property, commonly known as Sports Authority Field at Mile High and certain
parking lots proximate to the Stadium all located in the City and County of Denver, State of
Colorado.
