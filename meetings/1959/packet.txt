BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: August 27, 2014

From:

Richard F. Clarke, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

August 27, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Contract Amendment; 2nd year 2014 option
2013-2015 Street Improvements & Shelter
Installations Contract # 33DM005

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to
initiate the second year of a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter
Installation contract with Manion Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment
is provided by the annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.

BACKGROUND
This action will address the General Manager’s 2015 goal of improving service delivery including
developing a cost-loaded, multi-year maintenance, repair and replacement schedule. This contract is an
on-call contract that performs street improvements, installs bus shelters and is available to perform
emergency repairs on short notice.
Due to the repetitive nature of this contract, a three-year option contract was determined to be an
effective way to manage this work for the District. Bids were received and a contract was awarded to
Manion Construction, Inc. as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder in September of 2013. The
current base contract value and amendment are as follows:
Amount
Amendments
Total
first year (base year), 2013
$ 354,061.25
$150,000.00
$504,061.25
second year, 2014 (option)
$ 371,711.30
0.00
$371,711.30
nd
Grand Total: Base Year, Amendments, and 2 year option =
$875,772.55
DISCUSSION
This second year amendment option would increase the contract by $371,711.30, creating a total
contract amount, including this amendment, of $875,772.55.
RTD Engineering develops a specific list of street improvements and shelter installations for the year.
Street improvements are related to specific locations where repairs are related to bus traffic. Locations
are determined through inspections by Engineering, reports from Bus Operations or input from local
jurisdictions. This input is evaluated and a priority list is developed.
Bus shelters are installed consistent with the program presented to the Board in August 2014. It is also
desirable to have an on-call contractor available when an unexpected emergency repair needs to be
performed on an immediate basis.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The Estimated $371,711.30 budget shall come from the 2014 and 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets
dependent on the calendar year in which the work is performed.

DBE GOAL
Manion Construction Inc. is a SBE certified contractor.
ALTERNATIVES
1.
Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Planning & Development Committee
that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all
documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year of a three-year
option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract with Manion
Construction, Inc. for $371,711.30. Funding for this contract amendment is provided by the
annual 2014 – 2015 Engineering Expense Budgets.
2.

Delay the recommended action. This is not recommended as it will delay the construction of
projects that have been identified for repairs and impact coordination efforts with various
jurisdictions.

3.

Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not authorize the General Manager, or his designee,
to execute all documents necessary to award a contract amendment to initiate the second year of
a three-year option contract for the annual Street Improvements & Shelter Installation contract
with Manion Construction, Inc. Instead develop a new Invitation for Bid (IFB) for this year’s
construction work. This is not recommended because:
a. It would create a delay in constructing the 2014 -2015 street improvements.
b. The current Contractor is providing a good quality product in a reasonable time.
c. The 2014 contract prices are considered to be fair and reasonable.
d. The district desires to partner with the DBE/SBE Community and Manion Construction is a
SBE certified contractor.

Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager

Date:

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Transfer Funds to Support the Light Rail
Gearbox Overhaul Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to transfer $676,745 from the event recorder capital
project (10360) to the Light Rail Vehicle Maintenance campaign expense line item.
BACKGROUND
In support of the Board adopted strategic goal of Innovative and Fiscally Sustainable Service Delivery,
including Asset Management/State of Good Repair, Rail Operations has been in the process of
overhauling the gearboxes on the existing fleet for several years in order to maintain the cars in the
proper manner. We have determined that additional funds are needed in order to keep this process going
for the remainder of 2014.
The event recorder project was budgeted as a capital item and it was determined that this project did
not meet the criteria for a capital project. As a result, we are requesting authorization to transfer the
capital funds to the appropriate expense line.
DISCUSSION
The gearbox overhaul program ensures that the Light Rail Vehicles are kept in good repair by
following OEM and accepted industry guidelines that dictate when this process should take place.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
This is simply a transfer from capital to expense so there is no financial impact.
DBE PARTICIPATION
DBE requirements do not apply in the case of a funds transfer.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to request the funds transfer. This is the
recommended alternative.
2. Do not authorize the transfer as requested. This will cause work to stop on the gearbox
overhaul program for the remainder of 2014.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: September 4, 2014

From:

Terry L. Howerter, Chief Financial Officer

GM

Date:

September 3, 2014

Board Meeting Date: September 16, 2014

Subject:

Contract Extension
Financial Advisors

for

First

Southwest

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration & Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to authorize the second option year of the contract with
First Southwest (FSC) for Financial Advisory Services, which will extend the performance period through
December 31, 2015 and increase the total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for
the 2015 option is included in the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense
budget for FasTracks.
BACKGROUND
In August 2010, RTD issued a Request for Proposals for financial advisory services. Six proposals were
received, and First Southwest was selected as the most qualified proposer. The contract was structured
as a three-year contract with two one-year options to be exercised at RTD’s discretion, at a price of
$120,000 per year. The original period of performance ended on December 31, 2013. RTD exercised
the first option to extend the performance period through December 31, 2014. The original contract
and the first option were awarded within the General Manager’s contract authority of $500,000.
Exercising the second option will increase the contract amount above the General Manager’s authority.
DISCUSSION
Over the first four years of this contract, FSC has performed extensive financial modeling and analysis
for the FasTracks program. FSC provided the financial modeling in support of awarding the contracts to
complete the I-225 Rail Line and the North Metro Rail Line to 124th Avenue. FSC also supported the
delivery of the 2011, 2012, and 2014 Annual Program Evaluations, SB208 submittals to DRCOG in
2011 and 2012, Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendments in 2012 and 2013, and the 2014
Baseline Report approved by the Board at the July meeting. FSC also supported the annual financial
plan updates required by the terms of the TIFIA loan for the Eagle project. Through all of these projects,
FSC has provided RTD with high-quality, timely work product. FSC staff has been proactive and
responsive to RTD questions and concerns, and has helped RTD respond to comments from DRCOG,
TIFIA, and corridor stakeholders.
FSC also has played a significant role in RTD debt issuances and refundings over the same time period.
FSC brought forward the three debt refundings that were executed in early 2013 to provide the capacity
to extend the North Metro Rail Line to 72 nd Avenue, and structured the COP issuance that allowed RTD
to extend the line to 124th Avenue. FSC also acted as financial advisor for the two sales tax bond
refundings in 2013, and structured the COPs issued by RTD in 2013 to give RTD the lowest cost of
capital through combining a refunding with a new issuance to fund buses and other capital equipment.
Under new rules imposed by the Securities Exchange Commission in 2014 and as required by the 2010
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, municipalities that wish to have open and
productive conversations with investment banks must now retain a Municipal Advisor who is a qualified
financial professional such as an investment banker or financial consultant who counsels municipalities

Packet Pg. 8

2.11.C

on financial transactions such as bond offerings. The Municipal Advisor must be registered with the
SEC and must have a fiduciary responsibility to the municipality. The FSC professionals that work with
RTD are registered Municipal Advisors with the SEC. This allows RTD to legally continue to work with a
variety investment banks to find creative and innovative methods to efficiently finance projects.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for the 2015 contract amount of $120,000 is included in the FasTracks financial plan for 2015,
and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to
authorize the second option year of the contract with First Southwest for Financial Advisory
Services, which will extend the performance period through December 31, 2015 and increase the
total contract amount from $480,000 to $600,000. Funding for the 2015 option is included in
the FasTracks financial plan, and will be included in the 2015 expense budget for FasTracks.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, issue a new Request for Proposals for financial
advisory services. This is not recommended because First Southwest has performed its work
well and has provided value to RTD in excess of its contract amount.
3. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, use in-house staff to perform all necessary
financial modeling and debt services. This is not recommended because of the new SEC
Municipal Advisor rule and would hinder RTD’s ability to communicate with investment banks and
to continue to find creative and innovative ways to efficiently finance projects.
