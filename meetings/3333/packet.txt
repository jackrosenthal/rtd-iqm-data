BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Monthly Government Relations Report – May 2022

Committee Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2022 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and
federal elected officials. To achieve these goals, RTD must be proactive in educating and informing the
District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable Government Relations highlights at the federal, state and local levels since
the last Communications and Government Relations Committee meeting held on April 21, 2022. This
report was prepared on May 9, 2022 and will be updated verbally as needed during the Board Meeting
scheduled for Tuesday, May 24, 2022.
Federal
At the federal level, Congress is at the beginning stages of the Fiscal Year 2023 (FY23) appropriations
process. Currently, there appears to be little agreement on top-line figures for defense and non-defense
spending, which means that committees do not have an allocated amount of funding for FY23 to begin
to craft their individual appropriations bills. Until an agreement is made on top-line funding figures, the
chances of an omnibus agreement will continue to grow, leading up to the end of the fiscal year on
September 30, 2022.

Packet Pg. 17

15.A

The U.S. Department of Transportation continues to actively implement the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act through various guidance documents and the administration of discretionary grant
programs, with the bus and bus facilities competitive grant program being the most recently instituted
program. RTD has engaged with Federal Transit Administration leaders regarding priority items that have
federal interaction, such as the return of the credit risk premium associated with the Railroad
Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan for the Denver Union Station project and the Colfax Bus
Rapid Transit partnership with the City and County of Denver.
State
At the state level, RTD staff, in coordination with the agency’s state lobbyist, worked closely with
members of the General Assembly through the adjournment sine die on May 11, 2022.
With regards to the two bills on which the Board of Directors have taken support positions, both bills
were approved by the legislature and will go to the Governor for consideration:
• HB22-1026, which creates a tax credit for employers who offer transit passes
• SB22-180, which establishes a grant program for transit providers to offer zero-fare transit for a
30-day period
Additionally, staff is working with the Colorado Energy Office to coordinate efforts regarding a potential
zero-fare August on RTD’s services pending the Board’s consideration of the program and, subsequently,
the successful submittal of the agency’s grant application.
Local
RTD staff is currently working with the Metro Mayors Caucus staff to develop and explore opportunities
to further engage with the region’s mayors, wherein RTD leaders would be able to share information
more regularly. RTD staff acknowledges the diligence and collaboration of Metro Mayors Caucus staff in
facilitating potential future engagements.
Lastly, staff has made contact with the Colorado County Clerks Association to arrange a meeting with
the region’s county clerks to further discuss the agency’s potential offering of zero-fare transit on
general election days, as contemplated by the Board. Staff will keep the Board apprised, as a future
discussion is scheduled.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
2022 Board Travel Expense Reinstatement

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt Resolution No. _____, Series of 2022, concerning the reinstatement
in FY2022 of funding to be used for reimbursement for out-of-District travel-related expenses in the
amount of $3,000 for each Director other than the Board Chair and $3,750 for the Board Chair.
REPRESENTATIVE
Vince Buzek, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Directors are eligible for reimbursement from the agency for reasonable local and travel expenses
incurred that are necessary for the transaction of official RTD business. Historically, except as described
herein, each Director other than the Board Chair has been allocated $4,000 for local expenses and
$6,000 for travel, and the Board Chair has been allocated $4,500 for local expenses and $7,500 for
travel.
In 2009, 2011, 2020, and 2021, the Board adopted resolutions reducing the Directors’ reimbursement
limits for local and travel expenses as economic conditions required reductions in overall agency
spending.
As economic recovery from COVID-19 impacts continues, public health-related restrictions such as mask
mandates continue to be eased, and in-person transit-related conferences are once again scheduled,
reinstating reimbursement for travel-related expenses would allow Directors to resume travel outside of
the District in the exercise of their duties.
In adopting this recommended action and the associated resolution, the Board seeks to meet the
Strategic Plan priority goal of Community Value.
DISCUSSION
For FY2022 only, in light of ongoing economic recovery and improving public health indicators, the
Board will reinstate partial-year funding for out-of-District travel expense reimbursement in the amount of
$3,000 for each Director other than the Board Chair, and $3,750 for the Board Chair.

Packet Pg. 20

16.A

The amount traditionally allocated by the Board Office to defray the cost of registration fees incurred in
relation to Directors’ attendance of out-of-District transit-related conferences remains eliminated in
FY2022.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Adoption of the recommended action and associated resolution would result in a transfer of $45,750
from the General Fund to the Directors’ Travel Expense accounts. This amount represents a 100.55%
increase in the budget allocation for the Board’s overall FY2022 local and travel-related expenses.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
MyRide Stored Value Discount Title VI Fare Equity Analysis

Committee Meeting Date:
May 10, 2022
Board Meeting Date:
May 24, 2022

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the Title VI Fare Equity Analysis report for the MyRide Smart Card
Stored Value Discount elimination. This ensures compliance with federal laws, regulations and guidelines
related to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Carl Green Jr., Transit Equity Manager
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an
equity analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people
of color and low-income populations.
Pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are defined and illustrated as follows:
Disparate Impact Analysis
A disparate impact analysis is a review of the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by
minority persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall
not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is
defined as all persons who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, nonHispanic.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis
A disproportionate burden analysis is defined as an examination of the difference in the adverse
effects absorbed by low-income persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of
multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall
ridership. A low-income population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of
the Department of Health and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. The agency will then
analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate
burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial
legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the
proposed change.

Packet Pg. 23

16.B

Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD must analyze any available information generated
from customer surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment
media subject to the fare change.
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute
change as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden
Threshold, a determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that
are disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are
also used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-lowincome populations.
An average fare analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare changes on the
average fare paid per boarding. The average fare analysis determines whether the changes
disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority or nonlow-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.
MyRide Stored Value Card System
RTD introduced its current MyRide stored-value smart card system (SV system) in 2013. Customers
using a MyRide card receive a $0.20 discount when purchasing a full-fare three-hour pass. Customers
using a Discount MyRide card issued to seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders
receive a $0.10 discount when purchasing fare for a half-fare three-hour pass.
At this time, the SV system is nearing the end of its serviceable life, and the agency will replace it with
account-based ticketing (ABT) system while retaining customers’ option to use newly issued smart cards
compatible with the existing smartphone app.
Existing MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new ABT system.
Due to this system incompatibility, customers will be required to take action to transfer any stored value
currently held via MyRide cards either:
•
•

To an ABT system account accessible via smartphone app or
To an ABT-compatible smart card if they do not intend to use a smartphone app to show proof of
valid fare

DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the Strategic Plan priority of Customer
Excellence in establishing a streamlined process for the new ABT system with a central focus on the
customer experience.
As a result of the implementation of the ABT system along with the practice of fare capping, the
discontinuation of the SV system, and the need for customers to take action to move from the older
generation system to the newer one, staff recommends the elimination of the existing MyRide SV
discounts of $0.20 and $0.10 given to customers purchasing full-fare and discounted three-hour passes,
respectively.

16.B

To make this process as smooth and timely as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue
the sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June 2022, ahead of the installation of
the new validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards
incompatible.
Summary of Findings:
• Disparate Impact Analysis – the analysis found that minority customers are expected to
experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than non-minority customers and an even
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all customers as a whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a Disparate
Impact.
•

Disproportionate Burden Analysis – the analysis found that low-income customers are expected
to experience a slightly smaller average fare increase than higher income customers and even a
smaller increase compared to all customers. This suggests the potential impacts of the fare
change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all customers as whole. Therefore, the
proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount does not present a
Disproportionate Burden.

Conclusions:
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the MyRide Stored Value Discount Title VI Fare Equity Analysis will not result in any
direct or foreseeable agency financial impacts.

Executive Summary: MyRide Stored Value Discount Changes
In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B, RTD conducts an equity
analysis any time fare changes are proposed to ensure that changes do not unfairly impact people of color
and low-income populations. The proposal to eliminate the discounts on MyRide Smart Card Stored Value
(Full-fare and Discount MyRide card) calls for such an analysis prior to the board taking action.

Methodology
RTD’s Title VI Program outlines the agency’s Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies, as
well as the way in which RTD conducts fare equity analyses. In the case of the proposed fare product
discount elimination, the analysis aimed to answer one main question: does eliminating the MyRide
Stored Value (SV) $0.20/$0.10 discount disproportionately impact minority and low-income customers?
To answer this question, staff utilized data from the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey to identify
any potential disparities in the proposed fare change.

Findings – 2019 Survey Data
All MyRide full-fare and discount customer populations are expected to see an increase in the average
fare. However, the proposed fare changes are expected to have a lesser impact on minority and lowincome customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and higher income customers. In no cases do
the changes in average fare reach or exceed RTD’s Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden
thresholds.
Disparate Impact Analysis (Minority Customers)
The analysis found that minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than non-minority customers and an even smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by non-minority and all
customers as a whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disparate Impact.
Disproportionate Burden Analysis (Low-income Customers)
The analysis found that low-income customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller average fare
increase than higher income customers and even a smaller increase compared to all customers. This
suggests the potential impacts of the fare change are more likely to be borne by higher income and all
customers as whole. Therefore, the proposal to eliminate the full-fare and discount MyRide SV discount
does not present a Disproportionate Burden.

Considerations – MyRide Card Sales
A review of the MyRide card sales reports further suggests minimal impacts due to the overall low demand
for this fare product. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021.

Introduction
Background
RTD is proposing the elimination of the MyRide Smart Card Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount. RTD
introduced its current card-based smart card system in 2013. Initially, this system was only used for
institutional passes for employers, neighborhoods, and colleges. RTD introduced the first method of
electronic fare collection for use by individual customers in 2016, the MyRide stored value smart card. On
initial implementation, customers could purchase and reload MyRide cards at RTD’s sales outlets.
Additional sales channels (two major grocery store chains and online accounts) were added in late 2016
and in 2017.
Dating back to the 2016 fare structure, a per-trip discount ($0.20 per full fare 3-hour trip; $0.10 per halffare 3-hour trip) as well as free transfers were included to incentivize the use of electronic fare collection.
However, due to delays in implementation, RTD continued to offer free transfer on all 3-hour tickets and
continued to offer paper 10-ride ticket books with a similar per-trip discount. These policies were
continued using the current fare structure, which was implemented in 2019. However, the 2019 fare
structure does not include a per-trip MyRide price incentive for the two new discounts that were created
then, a separate youth discount and an income-based fare discount through RTD’s then-new LiVE
program1. The $0.20/$0.10 discount per 3-hour trip only applies to trips with full-fare MyRide cards and
half-fare “Discount MyRide” cards for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and Medicare card holders.
In late 2017, RTD added a new method of electronic fare collection, mobile ticketing, which was very well
received and now accounts for 19.4% of RTD’s fare revenue according to the February 2022 report. In
contrast, MyRide never fully took off due to inconveniences caused by technical limitations, especially
the fact that funds loaded online cannot be used for travel until the next day or later. At this time, RTD’s
current card-based system is end-of-life. RTD will replace it by adding account-based ticketing (ABT)
functionality and the option to use smart cards to the existing mobile platform. Customers will be able to
utilize the system through the RTD mobile app or physical smart cards. In addition to the fact that
decommissioning the old system is a technical necessity, the new system offers several customer
advantages. The new system includes real-time reflection of account balance, reloading, and fare
payments, as well as the option for fare capping (“best fare”). Fare capping provides flexibility for
customers to take advantage of the pricing and convenience of RTD’s day and monthly passes without
having to decide on a particular fare product in advance and without having to pay the full amount in
advance.
The current MyRide cards and current MyRide stored value are not compatible with the new system. RTD
will have to convert the current stored value to stored value in the new system, but due to the
incompatibility, this process will require some manual work and customers will have to take some action.
In order to make this process as seamless as possible for customers, RTD is proposing to discontinue the
sale and reload of MyRide cards and MyRide stored value in June, ahead of the installation of the new
validators that starts at the end of July 2022, which will render the current MyRide cards unusable.

Title VI and Environmental Justice
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) functional mission to provide
public transit services within the Denver area. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the
benefits and adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or lowincome status. This principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
Executive Order 12898 pertaining to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin
in programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United
States shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied
the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial
assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall
make achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately
high and adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on
minority populations and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial
assistance with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this
circular, the FTA requires RTD to evaluate, prior to implementation, any and all fare changes to determine
whether those changes will have a disproportionately negative impact on minority or low-income
populations.
This equity analysis report has been prepared to document the proposed fare change and to identify
potential impacts to the communities RTD serves.

RTD’s Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Disparate Impact Policy and a
Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating fare change proposals for equity and compliance with Title VI. These policies and their
applicable thresholds are listed below:
1. Disparate Impact Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority persons as
a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than
or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. “Minority” is defined as all persons
who identify as being part of racial/ethnic groups besides white, non-Hispanic.
2. Disproportionate Burden Analysis: the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by low-income
persons as a result of any fare price change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be
greater than or less than 5% of impacts absorbed by the overall ridership. A low-income
population is a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the Department of Health
and Human Services Poverty Guidelines.

If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider
modifying the proposal to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential adverse effects. RTD will then analyze
the modification and make sure it removed the potential disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If
a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can demonstrate a substantial legitimate
justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to proceed with the proposed change.

Proposed Fare Change
Description of Changes
The fare change proposes to eliminate the discount on MyRide Stored Value transactions. Currently, Full
Fare MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.20 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass fare,
while Discount MyRide Stored Value transactions receive a $0.10 discount over the applicable 3-Hour Pass
fare. Youth and LiVE program customers receive no discount when using MyRide Stored Value. The
$0.20/$0.10 discount is fixed across all Service Types (Local, Regional, Airport). The decisions upon which
not to integrate MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount in the account-based ticketing fare system are
shown in Table 1.
Table 1: Considerations for Removing MyRide Store Value $0.20/$0.10 discount
Consideration

Detailed Explanation

Customer Experience

The current MyRide Stored Value product is a single-trip product. Fare is deducted from
the stored value balance each time a customer taps their card on a bus or rail platform
reader for the first boarding of a trip and when transferring to a higher-priced service level.
(Note that no fare is deducted for taps (transfers) at the same service level within 3 hours
of the first tap.) As a result, the customer cannot purchase daily or monthly passes (period
passes) on the MyRide card, affording potential savings. Additionally, single trips
purchased on a MyRide card do not accumulate to period passes, leading some customers
to pay more than if they had purchased a day or monthly pass.

Technology

Eliminating the MyRide Stored Value discount allows for a seamless transition from the
current card-based to the new Account-Based Ticketing system by simplifying fare
calculations. Moreover, RTD’s fare structure with multiple service types and fare levels
requires creating and maintaining a more complex algorithm to calculate and track fares.

Customer Service

Issuing product exchanges is cumbersome because of the inconsistent pricing between
other fare products (paper and mobile tickets) and the MyRide single trip. In addition, the
lack of a one-to-one exchange between products results in customer confusion and
additional manual work for Customer Care staff.
Fare Capping is an electronic fare collection system feature that calculates and charges
single trips and automatically accumulates single trips into period passes. Fare Capping
increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to purchase period passes in
smaller increments. As a result, customers have peace of mind that they are paying the
best fare available.

Methodology
For proposed changes that would increase or decrease the fares on the entire system, on certain transit
modes, or by fare payment type or fare media, RTD shall analyze any available information generated

from customers surveys. Customer survey analysis indicates whether minority and/or low-income
customers are disproportionately more likely to use the mode of service, payment type, or payment media
subject to the fare change.
The typical measure of Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden involves a comparison between the
proportion of persons in the protected class (i.e., minority or low-income populations) who are adversely
affected by the service or fare change and the proportion of persons not in the protected class (i.e., nonminority or non-low-income) who are adversely affected.3
Based on the Federal Guidance and the RTD’s Title VI Policies, RTD shall—
(i) Determine the number and percent of users of each fare media being changed;
(ii) Review fares before the change and after the change;
(iii) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between minority users and overall
users; and
(iv) Compare the differences for each particular fare media between low-income users and
overall users.4
A fare equity analysis compares the existing fare to proposed changes and calculates the absolute change
as well as the percent change. Using the Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden Threshold, a
determination will be made as to whether the fare change will result in adverse effects that are
disproportionately borne by the minority or low-income populations, respectively. The thresholds are also
used to assess whether the proposed changes disproportionately benefit non-minority or non-low-income
populations.
Within this report, an Average Fare Analysis is undertaken to assess the effects of the proposed fare
changes on the average fare paid per boarding. The Average Fare Analysis determines whether the
changes disproportionately adversely impact minority or low-income customers or whether non-minority
or non-low-income customers disproportionately benefit from the changes.

Average Fare Analysis
The Average Fare Analysis for the elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount was undertaken using
data from calendar year 2019, and therefore does not reflect the changes in ridership resulting from the
ongoing COVID pandemic. Calendar year 2019 ridership and revenue data formed the basis for the analysis
as it aligns with the 2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey (2019 CSS). The 2019 CSS comports with the
FTA data requirements5 for conducting fare equity analyses (i.e., customer fare payment and demographic
information). The only changes considered in the Average Fare Analysis are those associated with the
changes in the average fare per boarding due to pricing changes; the Average Fare Analysis does not
assume any ridership changes due to application of fare elasticities.

Data Sources
Systemwide ridership and fare revenue data for 2019 used in the Average Fare Analysis was retrieved
from the National Transit Database (NTD). Only ridership and fare revenue for fixed route services was
considered; Access-a-Ride and other Demand Response services ridership and revenue was excluded.
MyRide Stored Value transactions for calendar 2019 were retrieved from RTD’s Business Intelligence
platform. Within the data warehouse, transactions are delineated by Customer Category (e.g., Full Fare,
Discount, Youth, LiVE) and Service Type (Local, Regional, Airport). With some additional analysis, MyRide
Stored Value boardings could be classified as first boardings, free transfers and upcharges. With this level
of delineation, MyRide Stored Value fare revenue could be calculated.
For customer demographic data, the analysis relied on the 2019 CSS, the most recent comprehensive, onboard customer survey undertaken by RTD that provides information on customer demographics and fare
payment. The 2019 CSS was undertaken by BBC Research, a contractor hired by RTD, whose research
surveyors conducted 3,811 surveys.

Customer Satisfaction Survey Assumptions
The 2019 CSS, while being the most recent and comprehensive on-board survey undertaken by RTD, does
have some limitations. Low response rates for MyRide Stored Value customers on certain Service Types
and by certain Rider Categories created some challenges. The Average Fare Analysis attempts to address
the limitations of the data by aggregating together the demographics for some MyRide Stored Value
customers.
The following demographic assumptions were used in the Average Fare Analysis:
●
●

Demographics for Regional MyRide Stored Value were aggregated with the demographics for
Airport MyRide Stored Value, due to too few survey responses.
Demographics for Seniors (65+) and Individuals with Disabilities were aggregated together, due
to both groups paying the same fare rates and experiencing identical pricing changes with the
proposed elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount.

Racial/Ethnicity Assumptions
For purposes of the Fare Equity Analysis, minority populations are those who have not identified
themselves as “Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin” on the 2019 CSS. The analysis did not include
those who refused to respond to the racial/ethnicity question. The racial/ethnicity categories in the survey
include: African American/Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, Caucasian/White - not of Hispanic origin,
Hispanic/Latino, Native American/Indian, and Other (please specify).

Income Assumptions
For purposes of the Disproportionate Burden Policy, RTD defines low-income populations as those whose
household income is at or below 150% of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Poverty Guidelines. To align with the 2019 CSS, the 2019 HHS Poverty Guidelines were used to determine
which populations would be considered low-income.

Table 2 provides the 2019 U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines and the corresponding RTD low-income definitions
by household size. Because the 2019 CSS asked both household income and household size, the Fare
Equity Analysis was able to use household size and income to categorize each individual survey
respondent accurately using U.S. HHS Poverty Guidelines. Table 3 presents the income categories used in
the 2019 CSS. Because the 2019 CSS income categories are presented as ranges, all respondents within
the income ranges that corresponded to the 150% HHS Poverty Guidelines for income and household size
were identified as low-income. This may overstate the low-income population somewhat, but represents
the most inclusive low-income definition. The analysis did not include those survey respondents who
refused to respond to either of the household income and household size questions, as they could not be
properly categorized.

Average Fare Analysis Findings
The Average Fare Analysis uncovered no Title VI equity concerns using RTD’s Board adopted Title VI
Policies. While elimination of the MyRide Stored Value discount would result in a fare increase for some
populations, the systemwide change resulted in a 0.14% increase in the average fare. While all customer
populations are expected to see an increase in the average fare, the proposed fare changes are expected
to have a lesser impact on minority and low-income customers, and a greater impact on non-minority and

higher income customers. In no cases do the changes in average fare reach or exceed the RTD’s Disparate
Impact or Disproportionate Burden thresholds. As such, no mitigations are recommended to proceed with
the implementation of the proposed fare changes based on the Average Fare Analysis.
The Average Fare Analysis provides an overview of the proposed fare changes. Appendix A provides the
detailed tables that provide the average fare change by minority and low-income status and by specific
fare payment method. The tables include the absolute and percentage change between existing and
proposed fares, and the proportion of minority and low-income customers that would be affected by each
fare change.
Table 4 provides the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for minority and non-minority
customers to all customers. For minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.434 to
$1.436, a 0.09% increase. For non-minority customers, the average fare would increase from $1.444 to
$1.446, a 0.16% increase. For all customers, the average fare would increase from $1.441 to $1.443, a
0.14% increase. The percentage point difference between the percentage change for minority customers
and non-minority customers is -0.08%, indicating that while both groups would experience an increase in
their average fare, minority customers are expected to experience a slightly smaller increase than nonminority customers as a result of the proposed fare change. Additionally, the difference between Minority
and All Customers is even smaller at -0.05%. Applying this difference in average fare changes to RTD’s
Disparate Impact threshold, the fare change would not represent a Disparate Impact on minority
customers.

Table 5 presents the systemwide analysis comparing the average fare for low-income customers to nonlow-income customers. For low-income customers, the average fare would increase from $1.431 to

Fare Change Equity Analysis Conclusions
The proposed fare changes required a fare equity analysis to identify any potential disparate impacts on
minority customers and/or disproportionate burden on low-income customers. The technical analysis
using survey data found:
•
•

No potential disparate impact on minority customers associated with the MyRide Stored Value
discount elimination
No potential disproportionate burden on low-income customers associated with the MyRide
Stored Value discount elimination

The result of this equity analysis concludes that minority and low-income customers will not be limited or
denied the benefits of the proposed fare changes.

MyRide Stored Value Card Sales Considerations
The overall demand for MyRide Stored Value by RTD’s ridership have been extremely low and suggests
minimal impacts. In fact, the MyRide Stored Value accounts for 1.1% of total fare revenue in 2021 and
1.5% of total fare revenue in 2020. Furthermore, MyRide Stored Value $0.20/$0.10 discount sales have
dropped 80% and 56% (respectively) from January 2020 to December 2021 as shown in Figure 1.

2022 RTD MyRide Customer Survey
Supplemental to the fare equity analysis, a targeted survey was launched on March 23, 2022 to collect
feedback from customers of the considered changes to the MyRide program. The survey was utilized to
inform the equity analysis and to evaluate how the potential changes would affect existing customers.
The survey was sent via email and social media channels to 19,180 MyRide and LiVE customers and a total
of 2,490 responses were received indicating a 13% response rate. See Appendix B for the 2022 RTD
MyRide Customer Survey instrument.
Demographic Characteristics and Smartphone/Internet Access
•
•
•

Approximately 46 percent of participants were men, 47% were female, and 1% Non-Binary;
Approximately 25 percent of participants were non‐Hispanic whites; and
Approximately 20 percent of participants were low-income6;

Table 6 captures the response rates obtained from the survey questions that are relevant to the
assessment. Specifically, the survey suggests there is a high level of satisfaction with the MyRide discount
for 3-hour trips and the MyRide program. Additionally, over half of respondents are unlikely to use the
alternatives (e.g., 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass) to the Full-Fare or Discount Fare MyRide card.
Participants were asked how frequently they ride RTD services and a majority (63%) are defined as
infrequent7 customers. This suggests that MyRide customers are not frequent enough to warrant the
purchase of 10-Ride Ticket Books or Monthly Pass. The most popular alternative was to purchase the 3hour or DayPass mobile ticket at 61 percent. Nearly all participants reported having a smartphone (96%),
a data plan with their cell phone provider (92%) and have access to wifi (95%). This suggests that the
alternative to purchase mobile tickets is a viable option and accessible for existing MyRide customers.
In conclusion, the survey results indicate there is a high satisfaction with the MyRide program and the
associated discounts for 3-hour trips. Although there is an unlikelihood with customers utilizing

alternatives, there are current options available or will be available as noted in the forthcoming Mitigation
Measures section. Additionally, customers who use the current MyRide stored value card will have the
option to switch to a new card on the new ABT fare collection system, which allows for fare capping. As
previously noted in Table 1, fare capping increases period pass affordability by allowing customers to
purchase period passes in smaller increments. As a result, customers will pay the best fare available.

Mitigation Measures and Public Outreach
Mitigation Measures
The findings of this analysis do not prompt RTD to consider possible measures to avoid, minimize, and/or
mitigate adverse impacts on minority or low-income customers. Albeit there were no adverse impacts
presented, the following provides an overview of the already-planned or implemented measures for the
MyRide transition:
•

•

Introduce mobile 10-ride ticket packs on the Masabi mobile ticketing platform with the same
pricing as the paper 10-ride ticket books or 10 trips with the current MyRide cards. This way
customers who use MyRide primarily for the $0.20/$0.10 discount and do not ride enough to
benefit from fare capping do not have to “go back to” paper if they want the same price. Note
that this price advantage only applies to full fare and Discount (senior/disability) fare, there is no
additional discount for using MyRide or 10-ride ticket books/packs for Youth and LiVE fares.
Introduction of mobile stored value on the Masabi platform as a payment method. Initially, mobile
stored value can be used as a payment method to buy mobile tickets. Once ABT is implemented,
customers will be able to use it for tap-and-ride as well.

•

Introduction of the “vendor portal” on the Masabi platform, which allows cash-paying customers
(or customers with credit/debit cards who prefer to purchase in-person) to buy mobile tickets or
mobile stored value at the RTD sales outlets.
Transition: “True up” the fund balance on the current full fare and Discount fare (senior/disability)
MyRide cards when creating the new Masabi stored value during transition, so customers can
take the number of trips that they expected when they loaded/re-loaded their current MyRide
card. For example, a full-fare MyRide card balance of $2.80 will translate into a $3 Masabi account
balance (i.e., old balance equates to new balance). Note that this does not apply to Youth and
LiVE MyRide cards since there is no additional “MyRide discount” for those.
New retail network targeting convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores for cash-paying
customers (or anyone who prefers to purchase in-person) after the initial implementation of ABT.
Paper LiVE 10-ride ticket books are now available for purchase by individuals, through all channels
where paper 10-ride ticket books are available

Public Outreach
Although there were no disparate impacts or disproportionate burdens identified in the Title VI equity
analysis, RTD has established a transition and conversion strategy which will inform current MyRide
customers of the program’s discontinuation, how they can transfer any existing MyRide balances for
future use on RTD, and the alternative fare products, discounts and tools that are available to them
moving forward. A mix of targeted outreach, in-system and on-vehicle assets, digital and social media,
community outreach and Public Relations will inform and educate not only MyRide customers, but all RTD
customers, employees, stakeholders, and the public, of the features and capabilities of the ABT system
and how their journey on RTD will be adapted and improved as a result of its implementation.

RTD transit improvements along the CO 119 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project within Board approved
budgets for the CO 119 BRT Project.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Henry J. Stopplecamp, Assistant General Manager, Capital Programs
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The CO 119 BRT project has been developed by RTD, in close collaboration with project stakeholders
since 2013, to provide cost-effective mobility improvements in the northwest area of the District. The
project includes bus queue bypass lanes along CO 119, BRT stations, Park-n-Rides, enhanced bus stops
within Boulder and Longmont and a commuter bikeway.
The overall project is governed by an executive oversight committee comprised of:
• Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) Region 4 Director
• Federal Highway Administration Division Administrator
• Boulder and Longmont mayors
• A Boulder County commissioner
• RTD General Manager and CEO
RTD’s 2022 Budget includes $5 million for the project, and the 2022 Mid Term Financial Plan (MTFP)
identifies $28 million in future years. Therefore, RTD’s contribution to the project is currently capped at
$33 million. With support from RTD, other agencies are actively applying for grants to facilitate
advancement of this project.
DISCUSSION
The CO 119 BRT project implementation is expected to require several contracts and IGAs over the
duration of the project. Some of these will be:
• IGAs with CDOT related to the project design and construction along the trunk segment of
CO 119
• IGAs related to RTD’s contribution to CO 52 queue bypass lanes

Proposed Policy Updates
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter IV-4, a copy of Board meeting minutes or a resolution demonstrating
the Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of the major service change policy, disparate impact
policy, and disproportionate burden policy is required. As identified in Attachments A and B, the
following are the proposed updates to the service disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies.
Additionally, staff is requesting an additional assessment of access to key public service destinations
(e.g., education, food, social and human service centers, and health care) as part of the service equity
analysis.
Service Disparate Impact Policy
1. To determine the system-wide effects of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted
non-minority population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10%
greater than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of
changes will be considered disparate.
2. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted
non-minority population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% less
than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will
be considered disparate.
Service Disproportionate Burden Policy
1. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's
impacted higher income population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at
least 10% greater than the percentage of the higher income population impacted, then the overall
impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden.
2. To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the
percentage of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's
impacted higher income population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at
least 10% less than the percentage of the higher income population impacted, then the overall
impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden.
2021 Service Performance Monitoring Report
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter IV-4, results of the monitoring program of service standards and
policies and any action taken, including documentation (e.g., a resolution, copy of meeting minutes, or
similar documentation) to verify the Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of the monitoring
results is required. Staff analysis shows that overall, there was no significant difference in average
performance between service provided to RTD’s minority and low-income customers and the service
provided to RTD’s non-minority and higher income customers. However, there are certain aspects that
were flagged as areas for improvement: 1) Revenue Hours of Service for minority light rail lines, and 2)
Revenue Hours of Service for low-income commuter rail lines. Additionally, RTD is unable to examine
vehicle assignments consistently or accurately at this time. The agency will explore other options to
report this measure later in Calendar Year 2022, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be
completed. The full results of the 2021 Service Performance Monitoring are demonstrated in Attachment
C.

16.D

2022 Language Access Plan
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B, Chapter III-7, agencies are required to develop a Language Assistance Plan
for providing language assistance to persons with limited English proficiency (LEP), based on U.S.
Department of Transportation LEP Guidance. As demonstrated in Attachment D, RTD’s updated
Language Assistance Plan (LAP) will guide the agency’s language assistance measures from 2022 to
2025. After an extensive review of the 2019 LAP, RTD’s LEP inter-division workgroup will implement a
two-tiered approach to retain and expand upon past language assistance measures to better meet the
needs of people with limited English proficiency.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The adoption of the 2022 Title VI Program Update will not result in any direct or foreseeable financial
impacts.

2022 Title VI Program Update
Executive Summary
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD’s) functional mission to provide public
transit service within the Denver region. An equitable mass transit system distributes the benefits and adverse
effects of transit service fairly without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This principle
is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order (EO) 12898 pertaining
to environmental justice (EJ).
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs
receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall, on the
ground of race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued EO 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make achieving
environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse
human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies and activities on minority populations and lowincome populations.”
The intent of Title VI is to remove barriers and conditions that prevent minority and low-income persons as well
as persons with limited English proficiency (LEP) from equal access to public goods and services. In effect, Title
VI promotes fairness and equity in federally assisted programs and activities. Title VI is rooted in the
Constitutional guarantee that all human beings are entitled to equal protection of the law, and specifically
addresses involvement of impacted persons in the decision-making process.
There are many forms of unlawful discrimination based on race, color or national origin that can limit the
opportunity of underrepresented communities to gain equal access to services and programs. In operating a
federally assisted program,1 a recipient cannot, on the basis of race, color or national origin, either directly or
through contractual means cannot do the following:
•

Deny program services, aids or benefits;

•

Provide a different service, aid or benefit, or provide them in a manner different than they are provided
to others;

•

Omit participation and access by LEP persons; or

•

Segregate or separately treat individuals in any matter related to the receipt of any service, aid or benefit.

The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA’s) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice (EJ). In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (USDOT’s)
Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI program to their FTA regional civil rights officer once every three
years or as otherwise directed by FTA.
1

The Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 amended each of the affected statutes by adding a section defining the word "program" to make clear that
discrimination is prohibited throughout an entire agency if any part of the agency receives federal financial assistance.

2022 Title VI Program Update

The General Manager and Chief Executive Officer has overall responsibility for carrying out the agency’s
commitment to the Title VI Program. RTD’s Civil Rights Director and Transit Equity Manager are chiefly
responsible for administering and monitoring Title VI requirements, but it is the duty of every employee and
contractor of the agency to ensure compliance with nondiscrimination and to further civil rights protections.
Thus, the RTD Board of Directors must approve the agency’s Title VI Program prior to its submittal to FTA.

Definitions
The following terms and definitions are from FTA Circular 4702.1B unless otherwise noted.
Direct Recipient – An entity that receives funding directly from the FTA. For purposes of Title VI, a direct
recipient is distinguished from a primary recipient in that a direct recipient does not extend financial assistance
to subrecipients, whereas a primary recipient does.
Discrimination – Any action or inaction, whether intentional or unintentional, in any program or activity of a
federal aid recipient, subrecipient or contractor that results in disparate treatment or disparate impact and/or
perpetuates the effects of prior discrimination based on race, color or national origin.
Disparate Impact – A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects members of a group
identified by race, color or national origin, where the recipient’s policy or practice lacks a substantial legitimate
justification and where there exists one or more alternatives that would serve the same legitimate objectives
but with less disproportionate effect on the basis of race, color or national origin.
Disparate Treatment – Actions that result in circumstances where similarly situated persons are intentionally
treated differently (i.e., less favorably) than others because of their race, color or national origin.
Disproportionate Burden – A neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects low-income populations
more than non-low-income populations. A finding of disproportionate burden requires the recipient to evaluate
alternatives and mitigate burdens where practicable.
Environmental Justice – EO 12898, “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations
and Low-Income Populations,” was signed by President Clinton on February 11, 1994. After issuance of the EO,
the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) issued a DOT Order for implementing the EO on EJ. The DOT
Order (Order 5610.2(a), “Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income
Populations,” 77 FR 27534, May 10, 2012) describes the process that the Department and its modal
administrations (including FTA) will use to incorporate EJ principles into programs, policies and activities.
Fare Media – a form of payment for transit service (i.e. cash fare, monthly pass, etc...).

the complainant will have 10 days from the date of the letter to send requested information to the RTD
investigator assigned to the case.

RTD will generally complete an investigation within sixty (60) days from receipt of a completed complaint form.
Although RTD strives to promptly resolve complaints, this process will differ depending on the complexity of the
complaint, the individuals involved and other factors. Once the investigation has concluded, the complainant will
receive a final response letter to the complaint.
If a complainant disagrees with RTD’s determination, they may request reconsideration by submitting a request
in writing to RTD’s Transit Equity Manager within seven (7) days after the date of RTD’s letter, stating with
specificity the basis for the reconsideration. The Transit Equity Manager will notify the complainant of their
decision either to accept or reject the request for reconsideration within ten (10) days. In cases where
reconsideration is granted, the Transit Equity Manager will issue a determination letter to the complainant upon
completion of the reconsideration review.
Title VI Investigations, Complaints, and Lawsuits
Federal recipients are required to directly accept, log, and investigate complaints of discrimination. Further,
recipients are required to notify the public of their right to complaint and the procedures for processing their
complaint. RTD has seen an increase in the frequency of complaints in the last three years.

To address the increase in complaints, RTD is implementing a Transit Equity Nondiscrimination training program.
The goal of the program is to provide customer facing employees with the cultural competency and awareness
necessary to enhance the customer experience for all.
Public Participation Plan
RTD has an established comprehensive public involvement process to ensure minority, low-income, and LEP
populations are engaged through public outreach and involvement activities. RTD’s Public Participation Plan
(PPP) in Attachment E was originally submitted to the FTA on May 2019 as part of the response to the FTA’s
Title VI Program Review and has been updated as part of this submittal. The Public Participation Plan also
describes RTD’s approach to achieving diversity on its non-elected advisory committee(s). RTD’s Transit Equity
Office serves as a resource to other RTD divisions to integrate these populations into RTD’s public involvement
activities.
In proposing service or fare changes, RTD uses a variety of methods to communicate and solicit feedback from
the community and targeted populations. RTD also engages in extensive community outreach in conjunction
with large-scale projects to ensure that affected residences and businesses are informed about the impacts and
benefits of the project and are provided an opportunity for input in planning and implementation. On routes
where there are a significant number of LEP customers or households, RTD staff translates materials to ensure
that those community members can participate. Special attention is paid to the identification of any transitreliant persons potentially affected by a route or service change.
Consistent with the requirements of Title VI, RTD staff use geographic information systems (GIS) mapping
software to create maps that identify affected low-income, minority and LEP communities.

Community Engagement for 2022 Title VI Program Update

Transit Equity staff researched disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies from 16 transit agencies
and consulted with over 25 Title VI staff from FTA Regions VII, VIII, and X.
•

•

•

Citizens Advisory Committee (CAC): RTD staff consulted with CAC throughout the Program Update
process. At its February 16, 2022 meeting, CAC reviewed and discussed the proposed updates to the
Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies. The committee also participated in the Transit
Equity Survey to give input on the Title VI Program Update and the revised Language Access Plan.
Transit Equity Survey: RTD also sent a questionnaire to staff at 36 community-based organizations as
well as leveraged multicultural partners to distribute the surveys (both English and Spanish). The
questionnaire asked about Title VI Program awareness, observations of changes to service or fares that
have had a significant impact on clients served, thoughts on what else should be considered when making
service changes and examples of evaluating policies for potential disproportionate impacts to low-income
persons and/or persons of color. RTD received a total of 210 responses to the questionnaire.
Dedicated Email Blast: Proposed Disparate Impact and Disproportionate Burden policies were then posted
on rtd-denver.com along with the full draft of the Title VI Program Update for public comment. How this
outreach informed RTD’s Disparate Impact, and Disproportionate Burden policies and thresholds is
described in Part II: Title VI Equity Analysis Policies.

Language Access Plan
RTD is committed to full compliance with Title VI and Executive Order 13166 to provide meaningful access to
programs, services, and benefits for persons with limited English proficiency, or LEP. In 2022, RTD updated its
Language Access Plan and developed a 2022-2025 Implementation Schedule after an extensive review of the
LEP populations in the RTD service area and their needs. Staff will use the recommended two-tiered approach
to meet the needs of LEP populations: Tier One retains successful programs and activities designed to meet the
language needs of LEP populations, and Tier Two identifies new areas of focus to further the agency’s goal of
providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs and services. This plan will guide RTD in how
to best serve LEP populations and is provided in Attachment F.
Subrecipient Monitoring
RTD’s subrecipients of federal financial assistance must also comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
To meet its enforcement responsibilities under Title VI, RTD has implemented a subrecipient monitoring process.
The RTD Transit Equity Office will ensure that the following actions are taken to ensure that RTD and its
subrecipients comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and FTA Circular 4702.1B:
1. Each year subrecipients must provide RTD with a signed FTA Civil Rights Assurance (Subrecipient Title
VI Policy Statement) that all records and other information required under FTA Circular 4702.1B have
been or will be compiled, as appropriate, and maintained.

16.D.b

2022 Title VI Program Update

In general, subrecipients should have a public participation process that offers early and continuous opportunities
for the public to be involved in the identification of social, economic and environmental impacts of proposed
transportation decisions. Efforts to involve minority and low-income people in public involvement activities can
include both comprehensive measures, such as placing public notices at all stations and in all vehicles, and
measures targeted to overcome linguistic, institutional, cultural, economic, historical or other barriers that may
prevent minority and low-income populations from effectively participating in a subrecipient’s decision-making.
Subrecipients must file documentation of their PPP with RTD.
Each subrecipient further agrees to comply with and assure compliance by its third-party subcontractors at any
tier under each grant, with all requirements of the FTA Title VI Program pursuant to FTA Circular 4702.1B, 49
CFR 21.5(b)(2), 49 CFR 21 .5(b)(7), and 49 CFR Part 21, Appendix C.
Subrecipient Title VI Program Review
As a designated recipient of FTA funds, RTD receives, administers, and allocates funds to subrecipients and is
responsible for documenting compliance with Title VI. RTD’s responsibilities include monitoring subrecipient
compliance with Title VI, collecting and reviewing Title VI documents (including subrecipient Title VI data to
FTA) and assisting subrecipients.
RTD developed the Subrecipient Title VI Compliance Guide (Attachment G) to help subrecipients understand
the federal requirements. The guide outlines programmatic and fiscal responsibilities of various roles to ensure
that subrecipients are complying with federal requirements and are using federal funds appropriately. Project
managers, who are ultimately responsible for the achievement of subrecipient outcomes, are involved in every
step of the process by ensuring that appropriate agreements are in place. Said agreements contain the required
federal, state, and local language; and performance measures and all compliance requirements are met.
Project Manager(s), Transit Equity Manager, Transit Equity Specialist and/or the Grants Administrator provide
ongoing assistance to subrecipients through communications, trainings (when requested) and access to subject
matter experts within RTD for information and data.
Subrecipients are made aware of the Title VI Program requirements prior to acceptance of grant funds. RTD
reviews all subrecipient Title VI Programs on a triennial basis and receives and reviews annual reports submitted
by November 1. RTD also monitors Title VI compliance with entities who receive local funding from RTD. Prior
to entering into funding agreements, partner entities are made aware of Title VI compliance requirements.
Service Performance Monitoring and Transit Service Policies and Standards
Transit Service Policies and Standards FTA Circular 4702.1b Chapter VI requires fixed-route service providers of
urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more to establish service standards and monitor their service
to ensure service is provided accordingly. Service standards guide fixed-route service providers toward objective
decision-making in the provision of service. The FTA further expects transit agencies to monitor their services to

lawsuits and Civil Rights Complaint summary alleging discrimination on the basis of race, color or national
origin.
3. Each subrecipient must post its Title VI Policy Statement in prominent, conspicuous, and accessible
locations throughout its facilities.

can be found in Attachment H and the Transit Service Policies and Standards can be found in Attachment I.
Facility Siting and Construction

Title 49 CFR Section 21.9(b)(3) states, in determining the site or location of facilities, a recipient or applicant
may not make selections with the purpose or effect of excluding persons from, denying them the benefits of, or
subjecting them to discrimination under any program to which this regulation applies, on the grounds of race,
color or national origin; or with the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing the accomplishment
of the objectives of the Act or this part.
Title 49 CFR part 21, Appendix C, Section (3)(iv) provides, the location of projects requiring land acquisition and
the displacement of persons from their residences and businesses may not be determined on the basis of race,
color or national origin.
According to the FTA Circular 4702.1B to comply with the regulations when constructing storage facilities,
maintenance facilities or operations centers.
1. Complete a Title VI equity analysis during the planning stage regarding where a project is located or
sited to ensure the location is selected without regard to race, color, or national origin. Recipients shall
engage in outreach to persons potentially impacted by the siting of facilities. The Title VI equity analysis
must compare the equity impacts of various siting alternatives, and the analysis must occur before the
selection of the preferred site.
2. When evaluating locations of facilities, recipients should give attention to other facilities with similar
impacts in the area to determine if any cumulative adverse impacts might result. Analysis should be done
at the U.S. Census tract or block group where appropriate to ensure that proper perspective is given to
localized impacts.
3. If the recipient determines that the location of the project will result in a Disparate Impact on the basis
of race, color, or national origin, the recipient may only locate the project in that location if there is a
substantial legitimate justification for locating the project there, and where there are no alternative
locations that would have a less Disparate Impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin. The
recipient must show how both tests are met; it is important to understand that in order to make this
showing, the recipient must consider and analyze alternatives to determine whether those alternatives
would have less of a Disparate Impact on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and then implement
the least discriminatory alternative.

Since the last Title VI Program submission in 2019, RTD has not selected a site for one facility meeting the
applicable definitions under Title VI. RTD’s process for conducting equity analyses related to facility siting and
construction follows the guidance provided in the Circular/Title 49 CFR and included below.

16.D.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Part II: Title VI Equity Analysis Policies
Per FTA Circular 4702.1B Chapter IV.7, RTD must establish a Major Service Change Policy, a Disparate Impact
Policy and a Disproportionate Burden Policy. Collectively, these policies provide foundational requirements for
evaluating service change proposals for equity.

Major Service Change
A major service change is defined as a 25% addition or reduction in the service hours of any route that would
remain in effect for twelve (12) or more months. All major service changes will be subject to an equity analysis
that includes an analysis of adverse effects. A Title VI Service Equity Analysis will be completed for all major
service changes and will be presented to the RTD Board of Directors for its awareness, consideration and will be
included in the subsequent RTD Title VI Program report with a record of action taken by the Board.
Adverse Effect is defined as a geographical or temporal reduction in service that includes, but is not limited to
eliminating a route, shortening a route by eliminating segments, rerouting an existing route, and increasing
headways. RTD shall consider the degree of adverse effects and analyze those effects when planning major
service changes.
Service Disparate Impact Policy
A major service change should not adversely affect a minority population 10% more than non-minority
populations; this level of impact is considered a disparate impact. Given a potential disparate impact, RTD will
evaluate whether there is an alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable impact.
Otherwise, RTD will take measures to minimize or mitigate the adverse impact of the proposed action.
To determine the effects of a major service reduction to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
minority population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted non-minority population. If the percentage
of the minority population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage of the non-minority population
impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the system-wide effects of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted non-minority
population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage
of the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the effects of a major service increase to a single line, the percentage of RTD's impacted minority
population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted non-minority population. If the percentage of the
minority population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of the non-minority population impacted,
then the impact of changes will be considered disparate.
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted minority population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted non-minority
population. If the percentage of the minority population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of
the non-minority population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered disparate.

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

In the development of the equity policies, RTD sought public feedback on the disparity and disproportionate
burden thresholds through a series of public meetings and surveys. These policies and their applicable thresholds
are listed below:

16.D.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Service Disproportionate Burden Policy

To determine the effects of a major service reduction to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted higher income population. If the
percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage of the higher
income population impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service reductions on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted higher income
population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% greater than the percentage
of the higher income population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered a
disproportionate burden
To determine the effects of a major service increase to a single line/route, the percentage of RTD's impacted
low-income population is compared to the percentage of RTD's impacted higher income population. If the
percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage of the higher income
population impacted, then the impact of changes will be considered a disproportionate burden
To determine the system-wide impacts of major service increases on more than one line/route, the percentage
of RTD's impacted low-income population is compared to the percentage of the RTD's impacted higher income
population. If the percentage of the low-income population impacted is at least 10% less than the percentage
of the higher income population impacted, then the overall impact of changes will be considered a
disproportionate burden.
Upon determination of a disparate impact or disproportionate burden, RTD will do one of the following:
a) Alter the service proposal to avoid, minimize or mitigate potential disparate impacts or disproportionate
burdens, or;
b) Provide a substantial legitimate justification for keeping the proposal as-is and show that there are no
alternatives that would have a less disparate impact on minority customers but would still accomplish
the project or program goals.
Additional Access Considerations
To complement the quantitative disparate impact and disproportionate burden analyses above, RTD may include
an assessment of access to key public service destinations (employment, education, food, social and human
service centers, and health care) for minority and low-income populations.

rtd-denver.com

Packet Pg. 84

Attachment: 2022 Title VI Program Update (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

A major service change should not adversely affect a low-income population 10% more than non-low-income
populations; this level of impact is considered a disproportionate burden. Given a potential disparate impact,
RTD will evaluate whether there is an alternative that would serve the same objectives and with a more equitable
impact. Otherwise, RTD will take measures to minimize or mitigate the adverse impact of the proposed action.
Low-income population is defined by RTD as a group of households who are at or below 150 percent of the
Department of HHS Poverty Guidelines.

16.D.b

2022 Title VI Program Update
Public Participation and Board Approval

Between 2021 and 2022, RTD sent a questionnaire to staff at 36 organizations participating in the agency’s lowincome fare program for low-income transit customers and the Non-Profit Pass Program. The questionnaire
asked about Title VI program awareness, observations of changes to service or fares that have had a significant
impact on clients served, thoughts on what else should be considered when making service changes and
examples of evaluating policies for potential disproportionate impacts to low-income persons and/or persons of
color.
After reviewing survey responses, RTD decided to include access considerations (employment, education, food
or health care) when performing an equity analysis. Moreover, participants supported the former populationbased approach (i.e., looking at the low-income and minority population living by transit lines proposed for
changes was a good way to measure potential impacts) as well as the inclusion of customer surveys to the
extent possible.
The process to include system-wide analysis for the disparate impact and disproportionate burden policies for
service changes started with researching policies from 16 comparable transit agencies and consulting with over
25 Title VI staff from FTA Regions VII, VIII and X. RTD staff consulted with the CAC (February 16, 2022) as well
as community-based organizations (e.g., Denver Streets Partnerships, Growing Home, and CREA Results) and
received full support on these proposed changes.
Fare Disparate Impact or Disproportionate Burden Policy
Per the policy, the difference in the adverse effects absorbed by minority and low-income persons as a result of
any fare change or the average of multiple fare changes shall not be greater than or less than 5% of impacts
absorbed by the overall ridership. Further, if proposed changes require the use of or the discontinuance of fare
media, the equity analysis should consider access to fare media, vending machines, and other add-value
mechanisms (e.g., online, retail network), or other changes associated with the fare media’s use.
If a proposed fare change results in a disparate impact or a disproportionate burden, RTD will consider modifying
the proposed fare change. RTD will then analyze the modification and make sure it removed the potential
disparate impact or disproportionate burden. If a less discriminatory option cannot be identified and RTD can
demonstrate a substantial legitimate justification for the proposed fare change, the FTA may allow RTD to
proceed with the proposed change.
Major Service Change and Fare Change Equity Analysis
RTD considers possible equity impacts in developing potential service and fare changes and evaluates proposals
for major service changes and any fare changes for potential adverse effects, disparate impacts, and/or
disproportionate burdens.
Since the time of the last Title VI Program submittal, RTD has implemented several improvements to service
and changes to fares. The three reports noted below cover the equity analyses of all major service changes and
all fare changes implemented since May 2019, and are provided as Attachments J–M, along with corresponding
documentation of the RTD Board’s consideration, awareness, and approval of each.

Feedback on this Program and the policies therein generally did not differ between how RTD should treat analysis
of disparities based on race (disparate impact policy) and income (disproportionate burden policy). Thus, the
two policies remain equivalent.

RTD uses demographic data to assess equity in distribution of services, facilities, and amenities in relation to
minority, low-income and LEP populations. Such data informs RTD in the early stages of service, facilities and
programs planning and enables RTD to monitor ongoing service performance, analyze the effects of policies and
programs on these populations and take appropriate measures to avoid or mitigate potential disparities. RTD
develops GIS maps and comparative charts to perform this analysis, relying on both ridership and population
data within the service area.
The demographic data shown in this report is from the following sources:
•
•

2015-2019 American Community Survey (ACS)
2019 RTD Customer Satisfaction Survey

Current Service and Service Area
The maps shown in Figures V-1 to V-3 display the distribution of minority, low-income and LEP populations in
relation to services throughout the RTD service area.
Service Area with Minority Population in Figure V-1 depicts the RTD network in relation to minority population
by U.S. Census block group. Areas are shaded corresponding to block groups, which had a minority population
greater than or equal to the average for the RTD District (35.6%) as of the 2015-2019 ACS. This is an increase
from 34% indicated in the 2013-2018 ACS.
Service and Service Area with Low-Income Population in Figure V-2 depicts the RTD network in relation to lowincome population by U.S. Census block group. Low-income is defined as earning equal to or less than 150% of
the HSS federal poverty level. Areas are shaded corresponding to block groups, which had low-income
populations greater than or equal to the average for the RTD District (15.5%) as of the 2015-2019 ACS. There
are high concentrations of low-income households found throughout the service area.
LEP Population Distribution in Figure V-3 depicts the RTD network in relation to LEP population by U.S. Census
tract, as language information is not available at a smaller geographic scale. Areas are shaded corresponding to
all LEP population percentage by census tracts using the 2015-2019 ACS.

Ridership Characteristics and Demographics (Trip Based)

•
•
•
•
•
•

Approximately 50 percent of participants were men.
More than 60 percent of participants were non‐Hispanic white people (62%).
More than one‐half of participants were 45 years old or older (53%).
More than one‐third of participants reported residing in Denver county (37%).
Approximately 30 percent of participants were low-income individuals.
Nearly one‐third of passengers reported not having a car available to them (30%).

An analysis of ACS data and Customer Satisfaction Survey results reveals minority and low-income ridership are
predominately located within the densely populated urban communities of the RTD’s service area. Since the
2019 Title VI Program Update, the minority population has increased from 34% to 35.6% and low-income
population has decreased from 19% to 15.5% as noted in the ACS.
Facilities and Demographics Assessment
Three maps (Figures V-4, V-5 and V-6) are provided to illustrate determination of Title VI program compliance
with respect to recent, in-progress and planned major transit facilities. These respective figures highlight transit
facilities that:
1. Were recently6 replaced, improved, or;
2. Have improvements that are in progress, or;
3. Are where improvements are scheduled (planned projects and projects identified in planning documents
for an update in the next five years).
Figure V-7 shows the location of existing facilities. Figure V-8 Existing Facilities with Minority Population shows
the location of existing facilities in relation to Census block groups above the service district average for minority
populations (35.6%). Figure V-9 Existing Facilities with Low-Income Population shows the location of existing
facilities in relation to U.S. Census block groups above the service district average for low-income populations
(15.5%). Facilities are depicted by type: administrative, operations/maintenance, park and ride, and transit
centers.

Title VI Service Monitoring Report
Equity is a core principle of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) functional mission to provide public
transit services within the Denver region. An equitable mass transit system fairly distributes the benefits and
adverse effects of transit service without regard for race, color, national origin, or low-income status. This
principle is detailed and reinforced by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 12898 pertaining
to environmental justice.
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in
programs receiving federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title VI states, “No person in the United States shall,
on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or
be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, which states that each federal agency “shall make
achieving environmental justice part of its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and
adverse human health or environmental effects of its programs, policies, and activities on minority populations
and low-income populations.”
The Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) Circular 4702.1B provides its recipients of FTA financial assistance
with instructions for achieving compliance with Title VI and Environmental Justice. In this circular, the FTA
requires that RTD document measures taken to comply with DOT’s Title VI regulations by submitting a Title VI
Program to the FTA every three years.
Service Standards and Transit Monitoring Overview
Part of RTD’s compliance with FTA Circular 4702.1B Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for Federal Transit
Administration Recipients (Title VI Circular) is ongoing performance monitoring across all service modes (bus,
light rail, and commuter rail). The Title VI Circular does not require monitoring for demand response service.
Aligned with RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan, staff will conduct an annual review of resource and service
distribution. The objective is to ensure there is an equitable distribution across RTD’s system. The analysis in
this report compared minority and/or low-income access to that of non-minority and/or higher income access
across six service performance metrics for date compiled during calendar year 2021:
1. Revenue hours: RTD evaluates the amount and distribution of revenue hours of service provided.
The hours while in service include trip start to finish.
2. On-time performance: RTD defines “on-time” as no more than one minute early or five minutes
late, measured at time points.
3. Vehicle loads: RTD evaluates whether local, regional, SkyRide, Bus Rapid Transit, light and
commuter rail vehicles are overcrowded by comparing the load/seat factor for each vehicle type
and time period (peak and midday). RTD used automated passenger counter data to calculate
compliance with the maximum load standard. The maximum load factor is the ratio of the total
number of passengers on a trip to the total number of vehicle seats on each individual trip. For
each route, the count of the trips that exceeded the load factor are divided by the total number
of sampled trips to determine the percentage of trips that exceeded the load factor. RTD requires
that Vehicle Load standards be met 60% of the time.

Title VI Service Monitoring Report

5. Stop amenities: RTD analyzes the distribution of stop amenities in the RTD system (shelters,
seating, lighting, waste receptacles, etc.) in order to identify any potential disparities.
6. Vehicle assignment: The FTA expects that the average age of vehicles on minority and/or lowincome lines/routes should be no more than the average age of vehicles on non-minority and/or
higher income lines/routes.

Title VI Service Performance Measure Rating Scale Rubric
The target for RTD’s 2021-2026 Strategic Plan objective is within 10% or better. This range will guide RTD in
establishing a baseline to set targets for subsequent years. Above the 10% threshold but within 20% would
result in a “marginal” score. A marginal score would be flagged as a caution and area for improvement. Any
composite measure that exceeds 20% would indicate “adverse impact” and would result in a system-wide
disparate impact1 /disproportionate burden2 finding per the Federal Transit Administration. RTD will work to
improve service and access on an on-going basis to ensure RTD’s equity targets are achieved and for compliance
with RTD’s Board adopted Title VI Program.

Attachment: Attachment H 2021 Service Performance Monitoring Report (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

4. Service availability: RTD considers persons residing within one-half mile of bus stops and/or rail
stations as having service available. Service availability is expressed as number and percentage
of District-wide population and is determined by vehicle mode.

A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects members of a group identified by race, color, or national
origin.

A facially neutral policy or practice that disproportionately affects low-income populations more than non-low-income
populations.

Title VI Service Monitoring Report
Exhibit E: Vehicle Assignment Justification

Attachment: Attachment H 2021 Service Performance Monitoring Report (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

At RTD, vehicle assignments are put together in blocks that typically consist of operations on
multiple routes (typically referred to as interlining or through lining). Putting work together in
blocks is operationally more efficient and takes less resources, but in many cases makes it
impossible to keep buses on a single route. Because of the way blocks are put together it is
possible to have a combination of contractors and RTD operators providing services on what we
constitute as a route. In other cases, a block could be composed of several different routes that
connect at common locations such as transfer centers. Add in limitations of the technology and
other factors it is difficult to assign a specific bus to operate on a specific route. As a result, RTD
is unable to examine vehicle assignments consistently or accurately at this time. RTD will explore
other options to report this measure later this year, allowing for this portion of the analysis to be
completed.
For light and commuter rail there are no specific alignment for a certain model or year. RTD
assigns the number of vehicles per train and is based solely on ridership.

12 Months (Block Group Level Data), USDOT National Address Database (NAD)
To adjust for the fact that some census block groups are only partially within the District, the fraction of each block group's population within the transit district was calculated by using the percentage of address points within
the district and each block group. This address fraction was the factor used to proportion Census counts resulting in demographics within buffers for each service and PnR. Address points come from the USDOT National
Address Database.
* All Minorities include Black (non-Hispanic), Hispanic, Asian (non-Hispanic), Native American (non-Hispanic), Hawaiian Native and Pacific Islander (non-Hispanic), and Other (Including Mixed Race, non-Hispanic).
** Population totals for the RTD district vary between statistics for race and income/poverty in part due to the fact that the Census is a full count and the ACS is an extrapolation based on a sample, and in part because the
ACS total excludes those whom poverty status is not determined.

2022 Language Access Plan

Limited English Proficiency or Limited English Proficient (LEP): People with limited English proficiency
(LEP) are persons whose primary language is not English and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak or
understand English.
Meaningful access: Language assistance that results in accurate, timely and effective communication at no
cost to the LEP person. For LEP persons, meaningful access denotes access that is not unreasonably restricted,
delayed or inferior as compared to access to programs or activities provided to English proficient persons.
Vital Document: Paper or electronic material that is critical for accessing RTD’s services, programs and
activities or contains information about procedures and processes required by law. Classification of a document
as “vital” depends upon the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and the
consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not provided accurately or in a timely manner.
Effective communication: Sufficient communication to provide the LEP person with meaningful access to the
services that otherwise are available to the public.
Reasonable steps: Steps taken, or language assistance services provided, to ensure effective communication
with people limited in English (e.g., interpretation services).
Recipient: Any state, political subdivision of any state, or instrumentality of any state; public or private agency,
institution, organization, or other entity; or any individual, in any state, to whom federal financial assistance is
extended, directly or through another recipient.
Safe harbor: The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor
regarding the translation of written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each
eligible LEP language group has written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor
Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is
less) the population to be served.

Language Access Plan Purpose
The purpose of the Regional Transportation District’s (RTD) Language Access Plan (LAP) is to document and
guide the actions that RTD has taken – and will take – to ensure meaningful access to RTD transit programs,
services and activities by people with limited English proficiency (LEP) in accordance with Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166.

2022 Language Access Plan

In accordance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Executive Order 13166, the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) is committed to ensuring its diverse community of residents, customers and visitors
can effectively participate in or benefit from its transit services and programs regardless of race, color or national
origin. Importantly, this means that RTD is also responsible for taking reasonable steps to provide customers of
limited English proficiency (LEP) with meaningful access to our services, facilities and programs.1 In some
circumstances, failure to ensure that people with LEP can meaningfully access federally assisted programs or
activities may constitute national origin discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. RTD, as a
recipient of federal financial assistance, has an obligation to reduce language barriers that inhibit meaningful
access by LEP persons to the agency’s services. Consequently, RTD is committed to providing language
assistance not only to comply with the requirements of Title VI, Executive Order 13166 and United States
Department of Transportation (USDOT) LEP Implementing Guidance but also to uphold its own principles of
equitably providing safe, reliable transportation to the community.
This document includes a Four Factor Analysis, as established by USDOT LEP Implementing Guidance, that
assesses the language assistance needs of LEP persons in RTD’s service area. The analysis found that, according
to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 227,262 of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area (close to
7% of the RTD service area population) speak English “less than very well.” Further, approximately 378,376
persons, or 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born; and 646,021 persons, over
19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other than English at home. Sixty-eight percent of
people with limited English proficiency are Spanish speakers, followed by Vietnamese (4.4%) and Chinese
(4.2%). Supplemented with data from the Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) as well as other sources including
(but not limited to) Colorado state agencies, the analysis reveals 21 languages that qualify as safe harbor
languages. The focus of RTD’s language assistance measures will thus be on these languages.
Following the Four Factor Analysis, this document establishes RTD’s updated Language Access Plan (LAP) to
guide language assistance measures from 2022 to 2025. After an extensive review of the 2019 LAP, RTD’s LEP
inter-division comprised of Administration, Communications, Operations, Planning and Security recommended a
two-tiered approach to retain and expand upon past language assistance measures to better meet the needs of
people with limited English proficiency. The tiers are as follows:
•

Tier One: Successful Activities to Continue. Tier One will retain existing programs and activities
designed to meet the language needs of regional LEP populations, such as:
o Telephone interpreters in virtually any language;
o Multilingual printed materials and multilingual information on RTD’s website; and
o Continuing development of partnerships with community organizations that serve LEP
populations.

Attachment: Attachment F 2022 Language Access Plan (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

Executive Summary

1 Those with LEP are defined by the United States Government as persons whose primary language is not English and who have a

limited ability to read, write, speak or understand English.

Tier Two: Activities to Deepen our Focus. Tier Two identifies new areas to further the agency’s goal
of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs and services. These activities focus
on four primary areas:
1. Updating and monitoring the LAP: how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates the LAP.
This area of focus provides guidance for monitoring and compliance of the LAP, program research,
program administration and primary as well as secondary research to obtain feedback from LEP
populations.
2. Language assistance: how RTD provides language assistance services by language.
This area of focus relates to providing free language assistance for outreach documents and inperson services. It also guides the evaluation of which documents are vital for translation and the
format(s) that most effectively communicate the messages contained in those documents. Lastly,
this area guides how RTD will provide information through customer information channels as well
as conduct culturally responsive outreach.
3. Providing notice of language assistance: how RTD administers notice to LEP persons
about the availability of language assistance. This area of focus provides guidance for
providing notice of language assistance on outreach documents, on the system and providing
notice of the Title VI complaint process.
4. Training programs for personnel: how RTD trains employees to provide timely and
reasonable language assistance to LEP populations. This area of focus provides guidance
for the development of curriculum and the incorporation of LAP information into the employee
environment in order to prepare all front line and other relevant staff to effectively engage and
respond to LEP customers.
In pursuing this two-tiered approach to language access, RTD seeks to better mitigate language barriers that
could prevent LEP customers from accessing the agency’s transit programs and services. It is RTD’s intent that
this approach will allow the agency to more equitably serve the Denver metropolitan region’s diverse
communities, in turn enabling more customers the freedom to get where they want to go.

Introduction
As the Denver metropolitan region’s public transportation provider, the Regional Transportation District (RTD) is
committed to its residents, customers and visitors regardless of race, color or national origin. Importantly, this
means RTD is responsible for making reasonable accommodations and removing barriers to accessing those
services for individuals in protected classes – which include people with limited English proficiency (LEP). For
LEP persons, language can act as a barrier to accessing the benefits of RTD’s services, complying with
responsibilities such as payment or safety measures, or understanding other information regarding RTD’s
activities. A commitment to providing language assistance for those with LEP is thus not only required of RTD in
order to comply with federal regulations, but it is also intrinsic to the transit agency’s mission, vision and values

to provide accessible public transportation to all.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Federal Executive Order 13166 and the Department of Transportation's (USDOT)
LEP Guidance together require that agencies which receive federal funding, including RTD, must make
reasonable accommodations for LEP persons. At the core of these requirements is Title VI of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d et seq., which provides that “no person in the United States shall, on the ground of
race, color or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” While Title VI itself does not
explicitly include language as a protected class, the 1974 Supreme Court case Lau v. Nichols, 414 U.S. 563
interpreted Title VI regulations to hold that Title VI prohibits conduct that has a disproportionate effect on LEP
persons, as such conduct would constitute national origin discrimination.
Later, on August 11, 2000, former President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13166, “Improving Access to
Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency,” which requires recipients of federal financial assistance to
take reasonable steps to ensure meaningful access to the benefits, services, information and other important
portions of their programs and activities for LEP persons. On December 14, 2005, the U.S. Department of
Transportation published guidance for its recipients to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory
requirements.
To further assist transit agencies, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) published the most current Circular
4702.1B, “Title VI Requirements and Guidelines for FTA Recipients” on October 1, 2012. Chapter III Part 9 of
this Circular directs FTA recipients (including RTD) and sub-recipients to:
1. Conduct a Four Factor Analysis;
2. Develop a Language Access Plan (LAP); and
3. Provide appropriate language assistance.
In fulfilling these criteria, transit agencies such as RTD must ensure they are striving to mitigate language
barriers to their programs and services. This report documents RTD's Four Factor Analysis and LAP describing
how RTD will continue to provide meaningful access to its transit services to people with LEP.
RTD’s Commitment to Equity: Progress Made in Language Access

Attachment: Attachment F 2022 Language Access Plan (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

Legal Basis for Language Assistance Requirements

RTD’s mission is to make lives better through connections, and its vision is to be “the trusted leader in mobility,
delivering excellence and value to customers and community.” RTD recognizes the role that public transit plays
in achieving mobility for all people, in turn improving their connections to employment opportunities, recreational
activities, health care, housing, social programs and services, and more. For example, as part of its Reimagine
RTD project launched in 2019, RTD’s values are increasingly embracing concepts of transit equity, with an eye
towards providing meaningful access to high-quality public transportation services for a broad and progressively
more diverse community. Improving the accessibility of RTD’s activities, programs and services via language

access is one way to reduce mobility barriers for people with limited English proficiency, in turn making local
public transit more equitable for all.

As concrete evidence to RTD’s commitment to equity and language access, the agency launched its Systemwide
Fare Study and Equity Analysis in spring 2022. The study aims to examine RTD’s fares and explore changes to
its fare structure to make its services more equitable, simple and affordable. The agency is conducting the study
in response to customer feedback that RTD’s fares are expensive and complex – complexity that is made worse
when customers may not speak English proficiently. Working towards the desired goals of improved equity and
simplicity will include making RTD’s services more accessible to LEP persons; further, the study itself was
designed to be as supportive of language access as possible. For instance, RTD did the following:
•

Created the study survey in English, Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese (the top four languages in RTD’s
service area);

•

Provided instructions for all safe harbor language customers to translate the English webpage into their
preferred languages;

•

Provided language assistance to participate in the study at no cost;

•

Conducted a customer and community meeting in Spanish; and

•

Worked with 6 multicultural community-based organizations to host focus groups with their constituents.

Historically, RTD has made strides to ensure meaningful access to public transportation for LEP persons.
However, as the Systemwide Fare Study and Equity Analysis illustrates, the agency can do more to attract
customers who would otherwise be excluded from utilizing services because of language barriers and, ideally,
encourage customers to continue using the system after they are proficient in English or may have more
transportation options.
LAP Monitoring and Updating
USDOT guidance states that recipients should (where appropriate) have a process for determining whether new
documents, programs, services and activities need to be made accessible for LEP persons; RTD does so as part
of its three-year cycle to monitor Title VI compliance and an ongoing basis as changing service area
demographics and service changes warrant. As such, RTD continually monitors demographic information and
engages with community organizations serving LEP persons to remain in tune with those in need of language
assistance.

Study and Equity Analysis

With a burgeoning focus on equity, RTD sees much room to build upon its existing programs and activities
designed to serve LEP persons and is seeking to expand its historic approach to language access. Firstly, in
2021, RTD established a dedicated outreach program intended to further the implementation of language access
measures. This outreach program is housed in the Civil Rights Division and has a dedicated staff member, the
Transit Equity Specialist (LAP Coordinator), who is assigned to help develop the program, carry out the day-today tasks, coordinate across departments for agency-wide implementation and conduct outreach to LEP persons

and community-based organizations serving these populations. The program is overseen by the Transit Equity
Manager. Further, the Transit Equity Office in RTD’s Civil Rights Division assumed the responsibility to update
RTD’s LAP. Part of the update process included reconvening an inter-departmental workgroup to address federal
language access requirements for LEP populations, restore agency commitment to its language access program
and clarify staff roles and responsibilities. In March 2020, the Transit Equity Office selected staff members
throughout the agency in accordance with their position and asked them to participate in the update process.
Specifically, the workgroup aimed to:
1. Complete a needs assessment of LEP persons in the district. The Four Factor Analysis assessment
(see below) permitted Market Research and Transit Equity staff to identify high concentrations and
frequency of contact of LEP populations, to ascertain the nature as well as the importance of RTD services
and programs and to determine if there were language barriers limiting the access of LEP persons to
RTD services.
2. Develop the LAP, including its Guidelines Index and 2022-2025 Implementation Schedule.
This undertaking provides a framework for the provision of timely and reasonable language assistance
to those with limited English proficiency who access RTD’s services as well as a method to evaluate and
review the effectiveness of a LAP.
Staff members from the Transit Equity Office developed a work plan with designated tasks and timelines to help
the inter-departmental workgroup complete the LAP update in a timely manner. This process allowed for a
methodical, focused approach to the assessment; it also defined deliverables, assigned tasks and clarified roles
and responsibilities. The following Four Factor Analysis and updated LAP are products from that work.

Overview of the Four Factor Analysis
Per the USDOT LEP Guidance, transit providers must determine the language assistance needs of the LEP
persons they are likely to serve by utilizing a Four Factor Analysis. The assessment involves the following factors:
1.

The number or proportion of LEP persons eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by an RTD
program, activity or service;

2.

The frequency with which LEP persons interact with RTD programs, activities or services;

3.

The nature and importance of programs or services provided by RTD to the LEP population; and

4.

The resources available to RTD and overall cost to provide language assistance.

Attachment: Attachment F 2022 Language Access Plan (4647 : 2022 Title VI Program Update)

2022 Language Access Plan

RTD has conducted the Four Factor Analysis using a combination of market research resources which consists
of an evaluation of data from the U.S. Census Bureau, engagement with RTD staff, consultation with Colorado
state agencies, consultation with community organizations and direct interactions with people limited in English
proficiency. The results of this analysis will be used as the criteria for the development of language assistance
measures employed by RTD.

2022 Language Access Plan

The first step in conducting the Four Factor Analysis is to assess the number or proportion of people with LEP
who are eligible to be served or encountered by RTD. The U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey
(ACS) gives RTD a reliable baseline of the safe harbor languages2 within the RTD boundaries.3 According to the
ACS, of the 3.2 million people in the RTD service area, approximately 227,262, close to 7% of the RTD service
area population, speaks English “less than very well.”4 The following points identify other notable findings from
the assessment of the number and proportion of LEP persons in the RTD service area:
•

Approximately 378,376 persons, 11.6% percent of the RTD service area population, are foreign born.5

•

Approximately 646,021 persons, over 19% of the RTD service area population, speak a language other
than English at home.

•

North and Northeast Denver, East Lakewood and Northwest, North, and Northeast Aurora have the
highest concentrations of people with LEP, containing multiple census tracts with more than 2,000 LEP
persons.

American Community Survey (ACS)
The figures below display those LEP populations, by language, that meet the LEP safe harbor language threshold
(5% of the service area population or 1,000 people that are likely to be served by RTD, whichever is less). Spanish
is by far the most frequently spoken language at home other than English, accounting for more than 68% of
the LEP population. Excluding the grouped categories of “Other Asian/Pacific Island Languages” and “Other
Indo-European Languages,” the second- and third-most languages spoken at home are Vietnamese and Chinese
(comprising 4.4% and 4.2% of the LEP population, respectively).
Figure 3. Languages Spoken at Home by LEP Persons Age 5 and Older in RTD District from ACS

The Safe Harbor Provision outlines the circumstances that can provide agencies a safe harbor regarding the translation of
written materials for LEP populations. It stipulates that a grantee is compliant if each eligible LEP language group has
written translation of vital documents in accordance with the Four Factor Analysis. The LEP Safe Harbor Threshold for
language assistance at is 5% of or 1,000 persons in (whichever is less) the population to be served.

RTD estimated district boundaries using the American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates at the Census Tract
level. RTD analyzed all Census Tracts required to include all 8 counties RTD has services in: Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder,
Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson, and Weld Counties.

In addition to considering the ACS and PUMS estimates, RTD’s Factor 1 analysis examined the most recent data
on the Student Language Spoken at Home from the Colorado Department of Education (CDE) for the 2020-2021
school year, which includes students ranging from kindergarten to high school. It is assumed that if children are
identified as speaking a language other than English at home, then their parents or adult guardians are likely to
speak the same language. While this data set does not identify the number of people above the school age that
speak a language other than English, it can be a helpful complement to U.S. Census data.
Data were compiled from the following school districts serving students within the RTD district boundaries.8

WIC data corroborates PUMS findings that Amharic, Nepali, Somali and Swahili should also be paid attention in
language assistance measures. It also found that two other languages that had not appeared in other data sets
– specifically, Burmese and Tigrinya – are spoken at WIC Clinics. However, given their low prevalence in ACS
and PUMS findings, RTD has omitted them from consideration of the current list of safe harbor languages.

From Factor 1 of RTD’s Four Factor Analysis, RTD can draw crucial conclusions about which languages should
be prioritized in language assistance measures and where such measures are most needed geographically. First
and foremost, Factor 1 allows RTD to establish a list of 21 safe harbor languages to guide language assistance.
These languages are (in alphabetical order):
1. Amharic

12. Laotian

2. Arabic

13. Nepali (Nepalese)

3. Chinese (Simplified)

14. Russian

4. Farsi (Persian)

15. Somali

5. French (European)

16. Spanish (Mexico)

6. German

17. Swahili

18. Tagalog (Filipino)

8. Hmong

19. Telugu

9. Japanese

20. Thai

10. Khmer (Cambodian)

21. Vietnamese

11. Korean

These safe harbor languages can then be organized by tiers of relative need for translation or interpretation
services district-wide and reflect each language’s rank based on the average of all four data sources in Factor 1.

Ensuring that Spanish, Vietnamese and Chinese – as the most common languages spoken by people with limited
English proficiency – receive attention when it comes to translation of vital documents, interpretation and other
language efforts is especially important. While RTD has done some work to provide assistance for Spanish
speakers, and resources such as telephone interpreters give support in other languages (see Language
Assistance Measures Employed by RTD for more detail), much work remains to expand upon Spanish language
access as well as establishing a more solid foundation in other languages.

Data from Factor 1 also allow RTD to most strategically pursue language assistance measures based on the
spatial concentrations of LEP populations. Transit routes and other activities located near high concentrations
of LEP (specifically, North and Northeast Denver; East Lakewood; and Northwest, North and Northeast Aurora)
warrant the most attention to language access.

Following Factor 1, Factor 2 in the USDOT LEP Guidance requires RTD to assess, as accurately as possible, the
frequency with which the agency interacts with LEP persons from different language groups. The more frequent
the contact, the more likely enhanced language services will be needed. Consequently, the reasonable language
assistance measures that RTD takes to serve a rarely encountered LEP population (e.g., Ilocano) will be very
different than those taken for an LEP population that is encountered daily (e.g., Spanish).
To complete the Factor 2 assessment and understand the frequency of contact RTD has with people of limited
English proficiency, RTD conducted surveys with frontline employees who interact with customers. RTD also
collected the following data sources:
•

Frontline employee survey data

•

Customer satisfaction survey data

•

Telephone information center data

•

Access-a-Ride call data

•

Website visitation data

Frontline Employee Data
Since frontline staff are often the first contact LEP community members have with RTD, RTD sought to answer
the following questions (among others):
•

How often do frontline employees interact with LEP customers, and where do these interactions take
place?

•

What types of questions do LEP customers ask frontline employees?

•

Do frontline employees have difficulty communicating with people limited in English?

•

Are frontline employees aware of materials, services or tools that RTD uses to communicate with people
limited in English?

•

Are there additional materials, services or tools RTD can use to improve communications?

•

What can RTD do to better prepare frontline employees to assist LEP customers?

The survey closed on June 13, 2021 with 614 responses, including 141 responses to the online version and 473
responses to the paper version.
The survey found that almost all frontline employees interact with community members a few times per week
or more (96%), with 76% interacting with community members every day. While interactions with LEP
populations were less frequent than those proficient in English, 67% of frontline employees interacted with LEP
people a few times per week, with 1 in 4 (26%) reporting daily interaction with LEP people.

To help better communicate with LEP customers, frontline staff recommend that RTD provide more translated
materials (e.g., brochures, announcements, signage, cards with translations of common phrases, fare
information, and schedule information), a translation device, a direct phone line for translation services, and
language classes for the most frequently encountered languages.

Hiring more bilingual frontline employees could also prove useful.

RTD’s Telephone Information Center (TIC) is one of many ways RTD fulfills its commitment to providing quality
customer service to all its potential transit users. RTD’s TIC has 27 full-time Information Specialists answering
incoming calls from customers requesting route information, filing complaints and making suggestions and
comments for response by e-mail, telephone or mail.13
Presently, TIC experiences a limited demand for language assistance. TIC does accommodate LEP Spanish
speakers by staffing 11 full-time bilingual Information Specialists; however, the demand for language assistance
from Spanish speakers seems low, given the proportion of LEP Spanish speakers in the RTD service area. To
illustrate, in the period of April 2021 to March 2022 (the 12 months prior to drafting this LAP), the TIC received
565,500 calls, with only 18,610 (3.29%) of those calls requiring language assistance for Spanish speakers.

Access-a-Ride Call Data
RTD’s Access-a-Ride has 21 full-time reservationists answering incoming calls from customers requesting Accessa-Ride trips. Presently, the service has experienced limited demand for language assistance. The Access-a-Ride
Call Center, operated by First Transit, began utilizing phone interpretation services, May 2021. Since May 2021,
out of a total of 154,874 incoming calls, 135 (0.087%) requested Spanish interpretation. 4 (0.003%) calls were
for Mandarin and 3 (0.002%) were for Russian.
RTD Website Visitation Data
In 2021 we had a total of 32 million page views, 9.2 million sessions, and 3.6 million users on the RTD website
(www.RTD-denver.com).
RTD can track the default language of a visitor to the agency’s website, providing some indication of the amount
of default device or “in-browser” translation. For example, operating systems such as Apple support localized
translations in dozens of languages so that users can automatically display content in the language of their
choice on their device. Browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge also offer in-browser
translations, giving users the opportunity to translate information while surfing the web.
Below is a percentage breakdown of the top 10 languages used by our visitors from January 1, 2021 to December
31, 2021. Most website visitors view the RTD website in English (97.5% of the 3.6 million total users); visitors
who translate the website from English into their preferred language account for less than 2.5% of total visitors,
excluding crawlers (bots).

To further assist in website translation, RTD has historically offered the Google Translate widget. However,
Google deprecated the widget in 2019 and, consequently, will no longer update it. While RTD will continue to
offer the widget to website visitors in the short-term, it will eventually be removed as it becomes increasingly
outdated.
Summary
Factor 2 in the Four Factor Analysis helps ascertain in what mediums language assistance is most needed. Data
collected from the frontline employee survey, customer satisfaction survey, telephone information center,
Access-a-Ride telephone and the website especially show how important it is to improve language assistance in
locations where frontline staff are likely to have face-to-face interactions with people limited in English, such as
on transit vehicles or at a stop. Improving language accessibility for trip planning information, fares, schedules
or ticket purchases seems to be the most important, given that these are the types of questions frontline staff
report receiving the most from LEP persons. Further, staff largely note that it is difficult to communicate with
customers limited in English, suggesting that more translated announcements, signage, cards with common
words/phrases, brochures and schedules; a translation device; a direct phone line for translation services; and
language classes for the most frequently encountered languages would help them better serve LEP people. They
are also unfamiliar with the language assistance services RTD does offer, so bolstering staff training on these
services is also important.

It is unclear whether the low quantity of telephone requests and website visits in other languages is due to low
demand or other factors. For instance, people limited in English may not know the telephone lines or website
exist in the first place, they may not have ready access to a computer or (smart)phone or they may be hesitant
to use them given real and perceived language barriers. Expanding notice of available language assistance

Factor 3: Nature and Importance of RTD
Services, Programs and Activities
Factor 3 of USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis requires RTD to assess the nature and importance of programs,
activities or services provided by RTD to people with limited English proficiency. To complete Factor 3, RTD’s
LAP workgroup conducted surveys with LEP people who use RTD services. The workgroup sought to answer the
following research questions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

How frequently do LEP customers interact with RTD?
How do LEP customers receive RTD specific information and how do they prefer to receive information?
How useful are RTD’s language assistance services?
What is the importance of receiving RTD information in their native language?
How safe and secure do LEP customers feel?
Are LEP customers aware of RTD’s LiVE program?
How do LEP customers perceive RTD’s fare system?
What are LEP customers’ demographics?

RTD conducted a survey from September 7, 2021 through October 31, 2021 to answer the aforementioned
questions. Surveys were distributed to LEP persons in collaboration with numerous community-based
organizations. Due to lower-than-expected response rates, RTD created a social media campaign to target LEP
persons. RTD offered the survey in both a paper and online format, and it was translated into Amharic, Arabic,
Chinese, English, French, Korean, Nepalese, Persian, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese.
The survey closed on October 31, 2021 with 206 responses, including 101 responses to the online version and
105 responses to the paper version. During data collection efforts, RTD collected responses from many people
who do not classify as LEP. Their responses were analyzed for potential skews and were deemed too biased to
be included in the analysis. Over half (58%) of respondents speak Spanish as their native language, followed by
Vietnamese (7%), Chinese (6%) and Nepalese (5%). Almost all respondents either read, write or understand
English less than “very well” (87%, 90%, and 88%, respectively).
Concerning the frequency of their interactions with RTD services, the survey found that 1 in 4 survey respondents
use RTD daily, with 59% using transit once a week or more. Most respondents (70%) had used RTD prior to
the global COVID-19 pandemic. Half of respondents state they use RTD the same now as they did prior to the
pandemic; about a third of respondents state they ride RTD less now than they did prior to the pandemic.

Further, access to information has implications for feelings of security. Two in three respondents have felt their
security was at risk while using RTD services at some point, but not everyone reported knowing what to do in
case of an emergency. Most respondents (69%) know how to follow emergency exit instructions or call RTD

aware of RTD’s LiVE program. Further, 15% of survey respondents find that RTD’s fare structure is very difficult
(6%) or somewhat difficult (9%) to understand, and 44% are unfamiliar with RTD’s fare structure.

It is important to note that customers with LEP differed on the usefulness of RTD’s current language translation
services. Respondents were asked to rate how useful RTD’s language assistance services are on a scale of 1 to
5, with 5 being “very useful.” Less than half rated RTD Customer Care (49%), translations through the website

Summary
Though the survey used in RTD’s Factor 3 analysis only gathered input from a relatively small percent of RTD’s
LEP community, it is still illustrative of the nature and important of RTD’s various services and activities for
people with LEP. Firstly, it demonstrates the high, frequent usage of RTD’s services among the LEP population
surveyed, and thus reinforces the importance of pursuing reasonable language access measures. It also helps
demonstrate which materials, in which format and on what subjects RTD should offer language assistance. The
website is noted as a very important source of information for people with LEP. While Factor II found that little
translation of the website is performed, RTD recognizes that in-browser translations are not captured by the
Factor 2 data. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to at least offer instructions in various languages on how to
change one’s in-browser language on the RTD homepage. Signage at transit stops and in transit vehicles is also
an important source of information for people with LEP. Interestingly, while only 7% of survey respondents
showed that they get information from RTD via its social media platforms, 15% would prefer to receive
information from RTD via these channels. Examining the prevalence of language assistance on social media as
well as expanding advertising of RTD’s various social media networks could be a valuable endeavor to meet
community members’ preferences.

44%

It is important to note that 1 in 5 survey respondents do not receive information about RTD. Thus, in addition
to better advertising RTD’s social media platforms, RTD could also prioritize providing language access to expand
awareness of RTD’s various outlets for information, including its email listserv, service alerts, Transit Watch app
and beyond.
Finally, in providing language assistance, RTD should focus on the information that people with LEP need the
most. This survey indicates that topics of priority should be purchasing fares (and costs of fares), routes and

Factor 4: Available Resources and Costs of
Providing Language Assistance Services
The final factor in the USDOT’s Four Factor Analysis is to examine the overall cost and resources available to
RTD to provide language assistance. RTD’s LAP inter-departmental workgroup conducted this assessment.
As this Plan has mentioned, it is RTD’s intention to maintain current language assistance measures that have
proven successful while also expanding upon those efforts in the coming years. A good place to begin
understanding what our resources are (and could be) to support expanded language efforts is to analyze
expenditures for language assistance in recent years. This will provide us a baseline from which we can better
analyze costs and resources moving forward.
The analysis shows that RTD spent approximately $176,000 on language assistance measures including
telephone interpretation, literature translation, vehicle signage and more (see Figure 36).

navigation information, and service changes and alerts. Language-accessible safety information is also crucial to
the well-being of people limited in English proficiency, as many participants have felt their safety has been at
risk while using RTD but did not know what to do about it (e.g., by reporting an incident on the Transit Watch
app). All in all, this survey should be helpful in determining what information, its format, and its location are
considered vital for translation and should be targeted for other important language access measures.

* Not including staff labor
A more complete explanation of these language assistance measures can be found in the next section.
What is not accounted for in this approximate total is the staff costs incurred to provide language access. Various
staff from Communications, Bus and Rail Operations, Access-a-Ride, Planning, Service Planning and Transit
Equity are often involved in these efforts, as RTD strives to find creative ways to address the diverse customer
base it serves. Further, these numbers do not quantify the cost of staff regularly providing their language skills
to assist community members with LEP (for instance, 1 in 4 frontline RTD staff who regularly interact with people
limited in English proficiency speak a foreign language).
Summary
It is clear that RTD has an opportunity to determine what resources it needs and those that are available to the
agency as it expands its language access efforts. The agency is already on its way to doing so by establishing
an official language access outreach program, housed within the Transit Equity Office of the Civil Rights Division.
With the support of the Transit Equity Specialist (a dedicated LAP coordinator) and overseen by the Transit
Equity Manager, the outreach program will begin to establish the “people power” and formalize language access
work into dedicated staff time. In this manner, RTD will be better able to determine what resources the agency
requires and has available to it for expanded language access, not only including tangible resources such as
funding but also intangible ones like community partnerships.

Translation of Vital Documents
Agencies receiving federal funding are required to identify “vital documents” that must be translated to the
extent possible. Vital documents are defined as 1) any document critical for obtaining services and benefits,
and/or 2) any document required by law. In other words, whether or not a document (or the information it
solicits) is “vital” depends on the importance of the program, information, encounter or service involved, and
the consequence to the LEP person if the information in question is not accurate or timely disseminated. For
instance, applications for a bicycle safety course would not generally be considered vital, although summaries
of major service changes are vital documents. Other vital documents include but are not limited to:
•

Title VI public notice

•

Title VI complaint procedures

•

Bus and rail schedules

•

Summaries and notices of public hearings regarding proposed:
o

Transportation plans

o

Service impacting construction activities

RTD has consistently worked with community organizations and the LEP populations the serve to evaluate which
documents are “vital” to the meaningful access to RTD services and programs. However, with the 2022-2025
Language Access Plan update, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup now has clearly defined tiers (1,2 and 3)
to determine if documents are considered vital and to guide translation efforts. Find more information in 20222025 Language Access Plan Guidelines and Implementation Calendar.

2022-2025 Language Access Plan Guidelines
and Implementation Calendar
After a review of the 2021 Four Factor Analysis results, the LAP inter-departmental workgroup recommended a
two-tiered approach to meeting the needs of LEP populations in RTD’s service area. Tier One retains successful
programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of LEP populations. Tier Two outlines areas of
focus to expand upon the agency’s goal of providing LEP customers with meaningful access to RTD programs
and services.
Tier 1: LEP Activities
Tier One retains existing programs and activities designed to meet the language needs of
regional LEP populations, such as telephone interpreters in virtually any language, multi-lingual printed materials
and multi-lingual information on the RTD website or brochures, and continuing development of partnerships
with community organizations that serve people with limited English proficiency.
Specifically, the following activities will continue (as noted in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD
above):
•

Providing telephone interpreters via customer service at 303-299-6000 and via the Access-a-Ride Call
Center at 303-292-6560 to assist LEP customers

Area of Focus 1: Updating and Monitoring the LAP
rtd-denver.com

53
Packet Pg. 186

16.D.g

This area of focus shores up RTD’s LAP updating and monitoring process by developing the necessary systems
to more efficiently and effectively determine language assistance needs. In addition to ensuring compliance with
Title VI and DOT LEP Guidance, this area will see RTD building out processes (e.g., staff roles, community
evaluation tool and more) to guarantee that language assistance is available where needed, establishing and
solidifying relationships with organizations and community members to inform the LAP, creating a uniform file
management system for language assistance needs and translated documents, and otherwise formalizing a
strategic foundation for pursuing language access.
Area of Focus 2: Language Assistance
Where Area of Focus 1 focuses on how RTD monitors, evaluates and updates its language access program itself,
Area of Focus 2 dials in on the actual provision of language assistance. For instance, activities will include creating
a planning process for hosting an in-person interpreter at events, ensuring certain information like trip planning
or purchasing fares is language-accessible, providing interpretation for basic transit questions, creating updated
versions of How to Ride videos in identified languages and more.
Specifically, as mentioned in Language Assistance Measures Employed by RTD, RTD will be fortifying its
processes for translating vital documents. In identifying documents needed to provide meaningful access to RTD
services for LEP customers, RTD has defined three levels of vital documents. This will allow for prioritization of
materials translation as resources allow. In some cases, translation of vital documents may consist of only a
summary or key points. For other vital documents, providing notice of available language assistance can also
provide sufficient access.
The 3 tiers can be described as follows:
1. Tier 1 – Safety, Security and Civil Rights. Information categorized in Tier 1 is that which protects
customers’ physical safety and facilitates RTD customers to exercise their legal rights. Providing translation
or LEP-accessible versions of this type of information is the highest priority of all vital documents.
Information categorized as Tier 1 would be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following
information types identified in Factor 3: Safety and Security, and Rights Notices. Information about public
hearings and public involvement opportunities related to Fare Information, Service Changes and Planning
Information are also classified as Tier 1 vital documents. Customer surveys related to Tier 1 will be
considered Tier 1 documents.
2. Tier 2 – Information Critical to Access RTD’s Services. Tier 2 includes information that helps LEP
customers to understand RTD services to facilitate ease of use and to understand RTD programs to facilitate
participation. These types of information are critical for LEP-access because they provide more details about
specific benefits available or details of RTD services or programs. Information categorized as Tier 2 would
be found within (but would not be all-inclusive of) the following information types identified in Factor 3:
basic customer information, fare payment information, program applications, maps, service changes, service
alerts, and destination information. Customer surveys related to Tier 2 will be considered Tier 2 documents.

2022 Language Access Plan
RTD will also consistently work with community organizations and the LEP populations the serve to evaluate
which documents are “vital” to the meaningful access to RTD services and programs.

Area of Focus 3 is predominantly about how RTD communicates to people limited in English about their options
to receive language assistance, as advertising the availability of language assistance services will be key to
ensuring people with limited English proficiency are able to meaningfully access RTD services. RTD will strategize
how to best notify LEP communities of available language assistance by strategically posting signage at all major
passenger transfer stations, RTD’s administrative offices and other RTD properties with high volumes of
pedestrian traffic. The agency is also considering how to make a dedicated “brand” or cohesive theme around
the language assistance services it offers to make them more identifiable and uniform. Furthermore, RTD will
utilize its website and the relationships developed with community organizations that predominantly serve people
limited in English to better market available language assistance services.
Area of Focus 4: Training Programs for Personnel
LEP DOT Guidance states that RTD employees should know their obligations to provide meaningful access to
information and services for LEP persons, and all employees in public contact positions should be properly
trained. In 2022-2025, and in accordance with Guideline 4, RTD intends to fortify staff training to ensure that:
•

Staff know about LEP policies, procedures and resources; and

•

Public-facing staff are trained to work effectively with in-person and telephone interpreters.

As noted in the Four Factor Analysis, RTD mainly encounters LEP persons by way of its local bus service. In
2022, RTD’s Transit Equity Office will launch “Serving Limited English Proficiency Customers” training courses to
educate and provide general skills to all frontline staff for interacting with LEP customers.
It’s reasonable to anticipate that more complex interaction with people limited in English will occur with telephone
information specialists, receptionists, sales outlets associates, transit security and other frontline staff. These
frontline employees will have more detailed procedures and sophisticated tools for managing interactions with
LEP persons to include, but not limited to:
•

Third-party telephone or video remote interpreters

•

“Basic Spanish for Transit” employee books

•

RTD LEP handout guide

•

RTD looks forward to implementing the 2022-2025 Language Access Plan by first producing the strategic and
procedural foundation for expanding language access (Area of Focus 1) as well as immediately working to
increase awareness of the language assistance measures the agency already provides (Area of Focus 3).
Fortunately, the agency has already created a solid base from which to pursue this plan by establishing its LAP
outreach program, hiring on the Transit Equity Specialist to coordinate LAP-related work, finalizing the
Implementation Calendar and Guidelines Index as included above, and more. An immediate next step will be to
write the charters that guide each of RTD’s language assistance activities in their purpose, practice,
responsibility, approach and procedure. From there, RTD looks forward to taking real action on improving
language access across the agency’s public transportation system, in turn making local transit more accessible
and equitable for residents, customers and visitors alike.
