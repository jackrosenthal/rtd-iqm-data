#### 1. Approval of NewPush Contract for Hosting Services

It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract for “Infrastructure as a Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending Machine Systems in a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The NewPush, LLC (NewPush) (Contract Number 17DH041) for an amount not to exceed $4,000,000.  The contract is for two base years with three one-year options to extend the contract.

GENERAL MANAGER’S GOALS

Core Goal #3:  Strong Financial Management

Task Goal #3:  Asset Management/State of Good Repair

Motion:               Director Deadwyler made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 17, 2018 Board Meeting.

Director Archuleta seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, pointed out that the contract would not exceed $4,000,000 for 5 years and would be for two base years with three one-year options to extend. Ms. McKillop stated that RTD had conducted an open procurement for an offsite hosting contractor and that the criteria for selection and the members of the evaluation team were included in the packet. She explained that three firms had submitted proposals Arisant, Dataman, and NewPush, and that the members of the evaluation team unanimously selected NewPush as the successful proposer. Ms. McKillop explained that the funding provided for $612,036/year in hosting costs and included $187,964/year in contingency that would be used to expand the amount of traffic and hosting capabilities and to possibly add monitoring services. She added that RTD did not have the resources to support the system in-house and continuously meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) standards, which would put the Smart Card system and RTD at additional risk. Ms. McKillop stated that, if the contingency funds were not used, they would be returned to the unrestricted fund balance.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked what the selected company would bring to RTD to secure the data of our customers.

Ms. McKillop explained that the company had the most solid security protection plan, was PCI certified and they offered monitoring services.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she did not know if the PCI standard would protect RTD customers from a security breach.

Ms. McKillop stated that PCI was the merchant card industry standard to protect customer data as it pertained to credit card and other client data.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated that she was not convinced that standard compliance was enough to protect RTD customers, and would vote no until she had additional information regarding NewPush’s qualifications.

Chair Tisdale clarified that the contract amount of $612,036/year in hosting costs plus $187,964/year in contingency funding equaled a $800,000/year. He stated that the contractor should bring a higher level of service than RTD could provide if RTD supported the system in-house.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD conducted an analysis that determined that it was much more cost effective to have the hosting vendor provide all of the hardware, upgrades to hardware, and equipment replacement. She added that through the vendor RTD would always have the most up to date and state of the art equipment.

Director Menten asked for a list of references that NewPush represented.

Ms. McKillop stated she would provide the NewPush references included in the proposal.

Committee Vice Chair Menten declared the motion PASSED.

#### 1. RTD Sales and Use Tax Forecast Update

Doug MacLeod, Controller, introduced Robert McNown and Richard Wobbekind from the University of Colorado Boulder Leeds School of Business to present the RTD Sales and Use Tax forecast. He stated that RTD used the forecast for the Mid-Term Plan, the Long Range Plan, and the Annual Budget.

•        Comparison with Colorado Legislative Council and Office of State Planning and Budgeting which was similar to the RTD forecast.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why Utah was growing at a faster rate than Colorado.

Mr. Wobbekind explained that Utah had very strong financial and technology sector, a low cost of living, and a well-educated work force.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked for an explanation on how aging people in the community have affected the economy when there was so much growth in Colorado.

Mr. Wobbekind explained that there were far fewer people that could migrate in the U.S. He stated that the demographics of the country keep people from moving because they don’t have to move to find a job.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if ethnicity was considered in the unemployment rate.

Mr. McNown explained that with the current situation that had driven Colorado’s unemployment rate down, there was not enough prime age workers available.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked why ethnicity was not considered when analyzing unemployment rates.

Mr. Wobbekind explained that the information was available at the national level.

Director Williams asked how RTD’s 2016-2024 Revenue correlated to the projected cost of living increase and how would RTD adjust to the cost of living impacting ridership.

Mr. McNown stated that the project was to forecast sales tax revenue and not ridership.

Director Anderson asked if the forecast had factored in any future volatility or was the forecast straight sales tax.

Mr. McNown explained that the forecast would not be correct and that there would be changes that would influence the forecast.

Director Lubow stated that she was particularly interested in cash flow projections and asked if the changes from the past years that would forecast RTD with a significant cash flow increase.

Mr. McNown stated that there were not major revisions in the forecast and were similar to the forecast from six months ago.

Director Walker asked if a median annual pay was forecasted.

Mr. Wobbekind stated that the median annual income could be done by industry but the state did not provide that data and the median piece could not be forecasted by itself.

Director Sisk stated that Boulder announced a $4 million shortfall in taxes collected and asked if RTD should be concerned with a shortfall occurring in the district.

Mr. Wobbekind explained that Boulder was atypical and was suffering from competition and the redistribution of taxes to neighboring cities. He added that there had been a dramatic movement away from goods and people were buying more services that did not have a tax.

Director Solano asked how the new tariffs against China might affect RTD.

Mr. McNown explained that was not specifically included in the model but the tariff that was implemented tended to be slow in acting. He added that if the tariff was implemented tomorrow it would take more than six months to show impact.

Mr. Wobbekind stated the Moody’s forecast would be taking those changes into effect.

Chair Tisdale said that he appreciated the detail that was provided in the report. He added that RTD had to develop a budget that used the research provided.

Director Menten stated that ridership was not factored in and shared an article that described empty buses and packed freeways. She added that she would send the article.

Mr. McNown stated that he would be very interested in the article.

Ms. McKillop explained that the sales tax forecasting project did not include ridership and that RTD did that forecasting internally.

Director Menten stated that she mentioned the article to point out the possible changes ahead in RTD’s future.

#### 2. Wells Fargo Banking Contract Update

Ms. McKillop stated that a few months ago the RTD banking relationship with Wells Fargo was discussed and the Board requested an update regarding the contract. Ms. McKillop introduced Brenden Morgan, Manager of Debt and Investments, to explain the contract.

Mr. Morgan stated that the information included in the Board packet was to provide background information about the RTD and Wells Fargo banking relationship, the current status of the contract, and the potential paths forward. He added that the Board was aware that Wells Fargo had been involved in a scandal resulting in the assessment of major fines. Mr. Morgan explained that RTD worked with the commercial side of the bank and had not been directly impacted by the scandals. He stated that Wells Fargo had been RTD’s commercial bank since 2004 and had performed the following services:

•              The operation and servicing of six distinct bank accounts

•              Controlled disbursement services

•              Automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfer services

•              Cash vault services

•              Electronic stop-payment services

•              Lockbox processing

•              Reporting services

•              Discounted Employee banking services

•              Processing payments for the MyRide smart card web portal

•              Acting as the merchant bank for TVMs, RTD sales outlets, and credit card payments through accounting

•              Performing ACH draws related to quarterly, semi-annual, and annual Ecopass customers (a high volume and tedious process to set-up)

•              Allowing vendors to make payments through monthly wires/ACH payments

•              Monthly EZPay ACH draw for pass-by-mail customers

•              Lockbox accounts for direct deposits

•              Electronic deposit process which RTD sales stations are equipped with as well

Mr. Morgan stated that the current RTD/Wells Fargo Contract would expire on September 30, 2018, and RTD had an option for a 6-month extension. He added that RTD would need to decide whether to proceed with its own competitive procurement process, or coordinate with other governments and participate in their procurement process. Mr. Morgan explained that in the past RTD had piggybacked on State of Colorado’s Request For Proposal (RFP) process in order to benefit from the larger organizations ability to obtain lower pricing. He explained that, if RTD decided not to piggyback on the State RFP, the path forward would include beginning the RTD competitive procurement process that would take a minimum of six months and that it was possible that the pricing obtained could be less attractive than what may be available through working collaboratively with other local governments. Mr. Morgan explained that, if the District were to change commercial banks, either through a collaborative RFP or a stand-alone RFP, an extended period of system modifications and implementation would be required along with the maintenance of parallel processes for some period of time prior to a “go live” with the new financial institution. He added that this implementation and transition would necessitate an increase in staff and substantial costs that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.

Director Anderson expressed that she really appreciated the presentation and that it brought into perspective what a bank needed to provide to RTD. She added that it appeared as though RTD got a great deal for the services that Well Fargo provided.

Director Folska, Ph.D., stated she was interested in trying all avenues in order to acquire the best banking for RTD, but was more interested in the cost of shifting banks.

Director Lubow asked how much it would cost RTD to switch commercial banks.

Ms. McKillop stated that because RTD had piggybacked on the state and had not done its own RFP so there was not enough data to make a price comparison. She stated that there was an opportunity of cost savings by pooling with the State. And explained that regardless of how RTD choose to issue the RFP there was a possibility that the agency might not change banks. She added that this was unlike a normal change in vendors and stated that it would be time consuming and costly to pursue both paths and pointed out that it was not an easy process to switch banks.

Director Lubow stated that she found what happened with Wells Fargo shocking and added that she did not believe that Wells Fargo could have contained the issue in one area of the bank. Director Lubow asked if there were investigative reports about banks to assist RTD in making the decision.

Ms. McKillop stated RTD would take a banks reputation and performance into consideration when moving forward with the RFP process.

Director Williams asked Ms. McKillop what she would like to do for the RFP process.

Ms. McKillop explained that the contract was up and that she was leaning towards piggybacking on the State RFP, but RTD would need an extension of the current contract regardless of which way was decided.

Director Catlin echoed Director Folska’s and Lubow’s concerns about what it would cost to pursue any kind of change.

Ms. McKillop explained that she would analyze the cost difference and provide that information. She stated that either way RTD would have to eat the cost of a transition because the contract was up.

Director Catlin stated that she was somewhat skeptical of statewide initiatives and asked if RTD would take a back seat to the state RFP.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would receive the same benefits and rates as the state.

Director Sisk stated that RTD employees currently receive banking benefits from Wells Fargo and therefore RTD was affected by the scandals. He expressed concern that RTD was dependent and deeply involved with Wells Fargo and that the agency could not end the banking contract.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would be going to an RFP regardless even if the decision was to piggyback on the state.

Director Walker stated that there would be times that the agency would have to change a bank and that many banks have had nefarious actions. He added that he trusted Ms. McKillop’s decision.

Director Solano agreed with Director Sisk that RTD should not become complacent and the RFP was a good thing.

Chair Tisdale stated that it would be appropriate and the most beneficial to remain with Wells Fargo for the six month extension and to piggyback on the State RFP. He added that RTD would not have to follow the state decision but could find the best deal for the agency. Chair Tisdale stated that the Board and agency owes it to the constituents to find the best deal.

Director Hoy asked, if RTD pooled with the state, whether RTD could decide not to use the chosen bank if RTD did not like the procurement.

Ms. McKillop explained that RTD would not have to use the state procured bank.

Director Folska, Ph.D., asked if the bank had to be an American bank and if RTD could have its own bank.

Ms. McKillop stated that the statute required that the district bank must be a state regulated financial institution and must be federally regulated and insured. She added that it could be in the district or outside of the district.

Director Menten stated that she had a fondness for credit unions because she felt they treated customers better, and she disliked huge state or national banks. She added that she would like to go to a new financial institution.

Director Williams asked if RTD had a credit union, or if it could be one.

Ms. McKillop stated that she did not believe setting up a credit union would be in RTD’s best interest or promote RTD core values.

Director Hoy stated that credit unions behave like banks and that there may be a local credit union that could meet RTD banking needs.

Ms. McKillop stated that the RFP would be open to any bank that could meet the criteria.

Director Anderson called point of order, stating that the discussion had become off topic.
