RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a contract
for “Infrastructure as a Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending Machine Systems in
a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The NewPush, LLC (NewPush) (Contract Number
17DH041) for an amount not to exceed $4,000,000. The contract is for two base years with three oneyear options to extend the contract.
GENERAL MANAGER’S GOALS
Core Goal #3: Strong Financial Management
Task Goal #3: Asset Management/State of Good Repair
BACKGROUND
The Smart Media Technology (SMT), Ticket Vending Machine (TVM) and website are all hosted at an
offsite facility to provide additional Information Technology (IT) security to these systems for RTD.
Doing so requires a considerable set of IT infrastructure to be deployed and operational. These systems
require a highly complex Data Center with special attention to security, high-availability,
communications, continuation of operations / disaster recovery, etc.
More specifically the hosting, systems and subsystems must:
1. Meet and maintain Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standards.
2. Provide protected high network security standards because of stored customer information.
3. Provide high availability and 24/7 support because if the system were to be down, it would be a
major inconvenience for riders and there would likely be a loss of revenue.
4. Provide regular system backups
RTD currently contracts for these hosting services and has for the past three (3) years. RTD currently
pays approximately $340,000/ year for these services. The $340,000/ year is lower than the new
proposed contract amount because RTD purchased the hardware ($341,798) when we went to a hosted
environment. That hardware has reached its useful life and will be surplused. It has been determined
that it is much more cost effective to have the hosting vendor provide all of the hardware, upgrades to
hardware, and replacement, thus the increased annual cost for this contract.
DISCUSSION
RTD conducted an open procurement for an offsite hosting contractor. Four firms submitted proposals.
One of these proposals was rejected as non-responsive. The responsive proposers were: Arisant,
Dataman, and NewPush. The criteria used to evaluate the proposals were:

There were four members of the evaluation team representing, procurement, IT system administration,
electronic fare operations, ITS systems administration, and an IT enterprise architect. The four members
of the evaluation team unanimously selected NewPush as the successful proposer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract authority shall not exceed $4,000,000 for 5 years. This funding provides for $612,036/
year in hosting costs plus $187,964/ year in contingency funding. Funding for 2018 is included in the
2018 Budget with future year funding planned in the Mid-Term Financial Plan.
ALTERNATIVES
1. It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute all documents necessary to award a
contract for “Infrastructure as a Service to Host Smart Media Technology and Ticket Vending
Machine Systems in a Payment Card Industry Secure Environment” with The NewPush, LLC
(NewPush) (Contract Number 17DH041) for an amount not to exceed $4,000,000. The
contract is for two base years with three one-year options to extend the contract.
2. Migrate the system back to RTD and provide security and support for the system in-house. RTD
does not have the resources to adequately support the system 24/7 and continuously meet PCI
standards. This would put the Smart Card system and RTD at additional risk.

Forecast Uncertainty and Revisions
• Previous slides show steady, moderate growth as U.S. and Colorado
economies recover from recession
• Colorado economy stronger than national average, both in long run
and in recent recovery
• Looking ahead, forecasters encounter uncertainty
— Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, growing federal debt, Federal Reserve
policy (interest rates and unwinding of the balance sheet), renegotiation
of NAFTA, other trade policies, etc.
— Frequent revisions of forecasts to reflect new information
• In March 2018, the BRD switched to the Moody’s Analytics baseline scenario
from the previous consensus forecasts scenario.

Wells Fargo Banking Contract Update

Board Meeting Date: April 10, 2018
Information

BACKGROUND
Wells Fargo has been RTD’s commercial bank since 2004. The original contract was awarded in June
2004 pursuant to competitive procurement practices. The initial contract term was for five years with
three years of options. In 2012, Wells Fargo won a competitive procurement process through the State
of Colorado and offered the same favorable terms to RTD. Therefore it was determined to be in the best
interest of RTD to award its commercial banking contract to Wells Fargo to continue reliable service and
for cost savings. The current RTD/Wells Fargo Contract expires September 30, 2018 and RTD has an
option for a six month extension.
The services provided under the Wells Fargo contract are abundant and include:









The operation and servicing of six distinct bank accounts
Controlled disbursement services
Automated clearing house (ACH) and wire transfer services
Cash vault services
Electronic stop-payment services
Lockbox processing
Reporting services
Discounted Employee banking services

The District has received outstanding service from Wells Fargo through the term of the commercial
banking contracts. Further, Wells Fargo has been proactive in suggesting account modifications aimed at
protecting the District against fraud, streamlining its banking processes and further reducing its bankingrelated costs.
Over the term of these contracts, the District has modified its processes and information technology
systems in order to keep pace with the advancement of technology, a general increase in electronic
forms of commerce and significant advancements in the processing of financial transactions. Integration
between RTD’s systems and those of its commercial bank are crucial to the efficient processing of
vendor payments, the management of accounts receivable, payroll processing and funds transfer. RTD’s
integration with its banking institution is well-developed, tested and trusted.
Wells Fargo has worked with RTD to customize several daily operating processes, some of which are
under separate contracts, which are performed for RTD such as:



Processing payments for the MyRide smart card web portal
Acting as the merchant bank for TVMs, RTD sales outlets, and credit card payments through
accounting

Packet Pg. 33

1.C.2







Performing ACH draws related to quarterly, semi-annual, and annual Ecopass customers (a high
volume and tedious process to set-up)
Allowing vendors to make payments through monthly wires/ACH payments
Monthly EZPay ACH draw for pass-by-mail customers
Lockbox accounts for direct deposits
Electronic deposit process which RTD sales stations are equipped with as well

The commercial banking services used by RTD are voluminous. In addition to commercial banking
services, Wells Fargo provides merchant services related to the processing of credit and debit cards used
by RTD customers (as mentioned above) and investment banking services related to RTD’s capital
financing activities.
Wells Fargo has been embroiled in a scandal over the creation of new retail customer accounts without
customer authorization. In 2016, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by federal regulators as a result of
this practice. Since these practices were exposed, Wells Fargo has taken many steps to change the
internal culture that resulted in these retail banking practices and are confident that such practices will
not occur again.
The attached one page document titled “The Road to Rebuilding Trust” was provided by Wells Fargo in
an attempt to highlight the various steps they have taken in response to this scandal.
The second attached one page document titled “Wells Fargo in your Community” highlights the Wells
Fargo jobs created and charitable giving in Denver as of December 31, 2016.
RTD also conducts business with multiple other banks for other non-commercial banking processes such
as custody accounts where investments are held (UMB Bank), trustee services related to RTD capital
financing (UMB Bank, Bank of New York and US Bank), escrow services (Zions Bank) and Capital Leases
(JP Morgan Chase Bank). RTD has 12 additional banks in its investment bank pool, which are used for
debt financing and refunding. Wells Fargo is also in our investment banking pool.
DISCUSSION
The current RTD/Wells Fargo Contract expires September 30, 2018 and RTD has an option for a 6
month extension. Given this timeline, RTD will need to decide whether to proceed with its own
competitive procurement process or coordinate with other governments and participate in their
procurement process.
The State of Colorado expects to extend their Wells Fargo contract into 2019 and then issue a Request
for Proposals (RFP) for commercial banking services. The State also expects that their RFP will allow for
local governments to piggyback on their RFP and contract terms. RTD participated in a similar structure
for the 2012 contract. The benefit of participating in the Sate process is that they are a much larger
organization than RTD and will likely be able to obtain lower pricing than RTD can on its own. If RTD
does not approve of the end result of the process, the option for RTD to perform its own competitive
procurement process would still be an option.
If RTD decides to not piggyback on the State RFP, the path forward would include beginning the RTD
competitive procurement process which will likely take a minimum of six months. It is possible that
pricing obtained through this process could be less attractive than what may be available through
working collaboratively with other local governments.
Were the District to change commercial banks either through a collaborative RFP or a stand-alone RTD

1.C.2

RFP, an extended period of system modifications and implementation would be required along with the
maintenance of parallel processes for some period of time prior to a “go live” with a substitute financial
institution. This implementation and transition would necessitate an increase in staff and substantial
costs that would not be expected to be recovered through competition.

DISCUSSION

Smart Media Technology
The Smart Card Program is an Electronic Fare Collection and Payment System designed to increase fare
payment convenience for our customers, reduce and optimize fare collection costs for the agency and
reduce fraud associated with paper based fare media. The contract was signed with Xerox Transport
Solutions, Inc. (now Conduent) in mid-2010. A smart card is a plastic card onto which customers load
and reload RTD fare products. There are currently 4 products; EcoPass, CollegePass, Neighborhood
EcoPass and MyRide Stored Value available on the smart card.
All bus and rail validator installations are complete. Additional validators will be installed as new buses
and rail stations are commissioned into service.
The Smart Card Program launched to EcoPass, CollegePass and Neighborhood EcoPass customers on
January 1, 2013. There are approximately 327,000 active cards in circulation. During the month of
March 2018, 1.6M taps were recorded.
Starting the morning of January 4, 2016, MyRide Stored Value cards were dispersed to the public pilot
program participants at the RTD retail outlets. On Wednesday May 17, 2017, the MyRide web portal
went live to the pilot participants and on May 24, 2017, the MyRide web portal was launched to the
public. As of March 2018, about 22,000 cards were issued, of which 16,100 (73%) were full fare
cards and 5,900 (27%) were discounted cards. The average stored value loaded (initial purchases and
reloads) was $40.32, with a total value loaded of approximately $2,720,000. There were more than
800,000 trips taken using these MyRide cards, with a fare payment value of $2,130,000. Of these
trips: 77% were local, 20% regional and 3% airport.
Additional value can be loaded onto the card online, at RTD sales outlets and at retail outlets (Safeway
and King Soopers). As of June 1, 2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 47
Safeway retail stores. Since launch, Safeway has processed $8,200 in cash value loads. As of July 1,
2017, customers can load cash value onto MyRide cards at 86 King Soopers retail stores. Since launch,
King Soopers has processed $29,900 in cash value reloads.
On February 23, 2018, the MyRide program was expanded by offering customers the option to pick up a
new MyRide card and load cash value at Safeway locations. Since go-live, Safeway has loaded 38 new
MyRide cards, totaling $1,175 in sales. There are active discussions to expand the program at King
Soopers locations.
