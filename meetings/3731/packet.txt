BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
General Manager and CEO Total Compensation Analysis,
360 Tool, and Final Performance Assessment

August 8, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
Charlene Polege, Chief People Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
At the January 30, 2024 Board meeting, the Board adopted the 7th Amendment to the General Manager
and CEO’s (GM/CEO) term contract. The 7th Amendment requires the Board to “retain an external
consultant to conduct a total compensation study (“Total Compensation Study”) and take appropriate
action consistent with the Compensation Philosophy adopted by the Board on September 26, 2023, no
later than October 31, 2024. Such Board action shall include review of the Total Compensation Study
findings and recommendations, review of the applicability of the Compensation Philosophy principles,
consideration of any information provided by Ms. Johnson, and consultation with Ms. Johnson prior to
the Board taking any action. Such review and action does not require the Board to adopt any Adjusted
Base Salary or other compensation increase.”
During the January 30, 2024 Board meeting, the Board also approved the 2024 General Manager and
CEO Performance Assessment Framework. The approved framework was developed in conversations
between past Chair Lynn Guissinger, current Chair Erik Davidson, the Performance Committee, the
Executive Committee, Chief People Officer (CPO) Charlene Polege, and GM/CEO Debra Johnson.
Throughout those conversations a consensus was reached to retain an external consultant to work with
the GM/CEO and the Performance Committee to develop and conduct a 360° Assessment of the
GM/CEO position as well as assist the Board in the development and execution of its final performance
assessment of the GM/CEO.
On March 26, 2024, the Board approved a summary scope of work for a total Compensation Study and
360° Assessment instrument consulting services solicitation and authorized the GM/CEO to enter into a
contract for such services. The Board Office subsequently worked with CPO Polege and RTD’s
Contracting and Procurement Division to solicit, via a request for quotes, qualified firms to conduct any
or all of the Total Compensation Study, 360° Assessment tool creation and deployment, as well as the
final GM/CEO performance assessment. On July 9, 2024, RTD entered into an agreement with RKL
Virtual Management (RKL) to both conduct the Total Compensation Analysis as well as develop and
conduct the 360° Assessment and assist the Board with the final performance assessment of the
GM/CEO.

1.C.1

The RKL Team attended and presented at the Performance Committee’s meeting on July 22, 2024. That
team has since met with several members of the Performance Committee and continues to liaise with
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager of the Board Office, as project manager, and CPO Polege, as RTD’s
subject matter expert. RKL will provide an update on their projects and receive additional input from the
Committee.
DISCUSSION
RKL will provide progress updates on the projects as well as check-in on the timeline for the projects.
With respect to the Total Compensation Study, RKL anticipates providing an update on the
compensation survey’s distribution and initial feedback.
With respect to the 360° assessment tool and final performance assessment, RKL intends to provide an
updated project timeline, reiterate their project plan and recommendation, as well as discuss the
approach to identifying participants.
This discussion aligns with all four strategic priorities (Customer Excellence, Community Value,
Employee Ownership, and Financial Success) as the GM/CEO’s performance is directly tied to the
agency’s success in fulfilling its strategic priorities.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from this discussion.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Agency Key Performance Indicators

August 8, 2024

REPRESENTATIVES
Peggy Catlin, Performance Committee Chair
Lynn Guissinger, Performance Committee Vice Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board established the Performance Committee and defined its role, in part, as being responsible for
“monitoring metrics as to the agency’s performance related to the Strategic Plan success outcomes.”
The Board approved the current Strategic Plan on August 10, 2021. The current Strategic Plan runs
through 2026 and was developed in concert between the Board, General Manager and CEO (GM and
CEO), and members of the executive leadership team.
The Board approved Strategic Priorities and their associated Success Outcomes are as follows:
Strategic Priority

Success Outcome

Community Value: RTD strives to be a strong Establish baseline for Community Value Index and
community partner, providing value to our Increase by 5%
customers as well as to the broader Denver Metro
region.
Customer Excellence: RTD strives to consistently Establish Baseline for Customer Net Promoter
deliver high-quality customer service
Score and Increase by 5%
Employee Ownership: RTD seeks to attract and Establish Baseline for Employee Net Promoter
retain a highly skilled and engaged workforce
Score and Increase by 5%
Financial Success: RTD takes very seriously the 50% of outcome is that RTD spends less money
management of all financial resources
than it receives; 50% of outcome is that the
community believes that it sees value in RTD’s
spending
The Performance Committee is also “responsible for the performance management of the General
Manager and CEO.” On January 30, 2024, the Board adopted the 2024 General Manager and CEO

Packet Pg. 20

1.C.2

Performance Assessment Framework. The approved framework indicates that the GM and CEO would
have a long-term performance assessment “based on Board-adopted Strategic Plan Success Outcomes
and Performance Metrics.” Further, it was acknowledged with the approval of the Performance
Assessment Framework: “Because the Board, in collaboration with the GM and CEO will be considering
adjustments to the current agency long-term goals in 2024, the GM and CEO will not be eligible to
receive any one-time incentive payments for calendar year 2024.”
As such, the Committee Chair and Committee Vice Chair now wish to engage in an initial discussion
with the GM and CEO and members of the Performance Committee on agency Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) which will drive agency performance towards achieving the Success Outcomes of the
Strategic Plan, as well provide foundational options for assessing the GM and CEO’s long-term
performance.
DISCUSSION
The Performance Committee and GM and CEO are asked to consider the following suggested KPIs.
Likewise, the group is asked to provide input on additional KPIs they want the Board to consider
including. Once agreed upon, the KPIs will be presented to the Performance Committee regularly as well
as updated monthly on RTD’s Performance Dashboard. Further, the Committee Chair and Committee
Vice Chair will work each year with staff, in the development of the Committee’s work plan, to identify
a regular cadence of presenting these KPIs to the committee for deeper analysis. Subsequently and
separately, the Performance Committee will work with the GM and CEO to propose, for approval by the
full board, targets for certain KPIs based on the recommendations of management. Additionally, the
Board will work with staff to honor RTD’s commitments made to the Legislative Audit Committee in
RTD’s responses to the Office of the State Auditor’s Fiscal Governance Performance Audit
recommendations published on August 5, 2024. Those commitments include:
• “Developing and implementing a process to track and report measures of cost efficiency as
required by Section 32-9-119.7(3), C.R.S,” and
• “Working with the [Board] to develop and implement a process to compare meaningful measures
of cost efficiency against RTD’s past performance and against the performance of peer
agencies,” to which RTD committed to selecting “up to five similarly situated agencies with
comparable operating characteristics, transit modes, geographic service areas, and funding
sources,” and that
• “RTD will consider including within its 2025 Legislative Program a recommendation to the
Legislative Audit Committee to amend the current statutory definition of operating costs to align
with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).”
Also, subsequently and separately, the Performance Committee will work with the GM and CEO to
propose to the full Board a framework of certain KPIs to measure the GM and CEO’s long-term
performance. The overarching goal is to establish KPIs which provide the Board and public with
sufficient context to assess the agency’s performance.

Packet Pg. 21

1.C.2

Proposed KPIs in support of Financial Success
• Operating expenses per unlinked passenger trip
• Capital expense per unlinked passenger trip
• Cost per revenue hour
• Budget variability
• RTD credit rating and any improvement or decline in the rating
Proposed KPIs in support of Community Value
• Preventable accidents per 100,000 miles by mode (bus, commuter rail, light rail, paratransit)
compared to data from the three most recent prior years
• Partnership program funding by year and project
• Security related incidents per 100,000 miles by mode (bus, commuter rail, light rail, paratransit)
compared to data from the three most recent prior years
• The percent of service provided as relative to
o Most recent Comprehensive Operational Analysis (currently, the System Optimization Plan)
• Annual report showing ridership and per rider subsidy by route
Proposed KPIs in support of Customer Excellence
• On-time performance by mode (bus, commuter rail, FlexRide, light rail, paratransit)
• Vehicle revenue service miles by mode (bus, commuter rail, FlexRide, light rail, paratransit)
• Monthly ridership by mode (bus, commuter rail, FlexRide, light rail, paratransit) with month-overmonth and year-over-year data
• Annual rider ship by mode (bus, commuter rail, FlexRide, light rail, paratransit) with month-overmonth and year-over-year data
Proposed KPIs in support of Employee Ownership
• Employee retention measured annually on a rolling basis
• Unplanned Operator absenteeism by mode (bus, commuter rail, light rail) compared to data from
the three most recent prior years
• Vacancy rate of service delivery positions including bus, commuter rail, light rail, and
maintenance of way compared to data from the three most recent prior years
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact to this discussion. However, as the Board may move to adopt KPIs in
consultation with the GM and CEO, there will conceivably be impacts to resource allocation in the annual
budget and five-year financial plan as necessitated in the pursuit of improving RTD’s performance
relative to the selected KPIs.
