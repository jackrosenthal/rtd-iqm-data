Purpose of the Plan
Define strategies to get more transit patrons biking
to and parking at RTD facilities, because:
•

Demand for Bike-on-Bus and Bike-on-Rail is
growing, little opportunity for capacity increase

•

Over 50% of RTD customers live or work
within 3 miles of their transit stop

•

Satisfaction ratings and lease rates for bike
lockers are low

•

Census indicates nearly 3% of Denver
residents commute by bike (doubled since
2005)

Packet Pg. 35

Attachment: NAMS Update Presentation 05.13.14-accessible (1936 : NAMS Update)

1.B.2.a

• The following NAMS prioritized list of
improvements reflects the general consensus
of the Policy Advisory Committee (PAC) on
April 18, 2014.
• An overarching theme serves as a basis from
which consensus on the priorities is
grounded:
– The Northwest area remains committed to
Northwest Rail, as envisioned in FasTracks.
Given the projected timing of Northwest Rail’s
implementation, Northwest stakeholders want to
see mobility benefits sooner.

Packet Pg. 36

Attachment: NAMS Update Presentation 05.13.14-accessible (1936 : NAMS Update)

General Principles

1.B.2.a

General Principles (continued)
• Projects on this prioritized list should not be
considered absolutely sequential:

– Nothing should preclude the pursuit or
acceleration of any of these priorities should
viable opportunities or partners become available.
– More than one priority can be pursued
simultaneously.
– RTD should be proactive, aggressive and
creative in monitoring these projects for any
significant developments that help a project move
forward (e.g. public or P3 funding opportunities,
BNSF plans).

North Metro Extension
• North Metro Rail Extension (SH 7 to
Longmont)
– Estimated cost combined with projected low
ridership yields annual cost per boarding
almost 6x higher than Northwest Rail.
– It is recommended by the Study Team and
accepted by the NAMS PAC not to proceed
with any action on this corridor at this time.
Corridor should be re-evaluated in the future
if population densities or other conditions
change.

RTD and FasTracks
Overview
RTD oversees a 47-mile rail transit system that services 46
stations on five corridors including:
• The 5.3-mile Central Corridor and 1.8-mile Central
Platte Valley (CPV) Spur in central Denver
• The 8.7-mile Southwest Line to Englewood, Sheridan,
and Littleton
• The 19.2-mile Southeast Line to Lone Tree and Aurora
• The 12.1-mile West Line to Lakewood and Golden
The FasTracks program, approved by district voters in a
2004 ballot initiative will:
• add 122 miles of rail service
• 18 miles of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
• approximately 60 new stations along six new corridors
• extend three existing light rail lines

Grand Opening / image courtesy RTD

Construction cranes dominated the skyline in
2013, as the result of an apartment boom in
the metro area. Development in 2013 centered
on the hub of the FasTracks program: Denver
Union Station which is scheduled to open in
spring 2014. Significant development has also
occurred around other existing and future
stations as construction of FasTracks corridors
continues at a rapid pace.
2013 marked a productive year for FasTracks.
The W Line was the first line to open in April,
successfully shuttling passengers between
Denver Union Station and the Jefferson County
Government Center. RTD also entered into
a contract with Regional Rail Partners to
construct the North Metro Rail Line to 124th
Avenue Station in Thornton by 2018.
The US 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) line will
launch in 2016 with a dedicated lane for
buses, new park-n-ride facilities, and stations.
The East Line, Gold Line, and Northwest
Commuter Rail Line to Westminster are on
schedule to open in 2016. The I-225 Light Rail
Line connecting the East Line to the Southeast
Line through Aurora will also open in 2016.
Construction of revitalized Denver Union
Station, the nexus of the entire transit system,
is wrapping up for a May 2014 opening.

RTD and TOD
Transit-oriented development is typically
higher density and incorporates a mixture
of different uses that generate transit ridership. Multiple TODs contribute to creating
transit-oriented communities where people
can live, work, reduce transportation costs,
and improve overall health through increased
muli-modal activity. RTD plays a proactive role
in facilitating transit-supportive development
around transit station and strives to realize
the following goals:
• Promote multi-sector, cross-jurisdictional
partnerships
• Encourage sustainable development that
supports the transit system
• Ensure a hierarchy of multi-modal access
• Protect and enhance RTD’s transit assets
RTD achieves these goals by developing transit
stations that are accessible to multi-modal commuters; establishing partnerships with public or
private sector developers, and by supporting
local jurisdictions in developing TOD station
area plans. RTD’s TOD group conducts research
to support transit-oriented development, shares
information with both the public and private
sector, and provides planning assistance in order
to help local jurisdictions connect transit service to economic and community development.
Currently RTD is working with local jurisdictions on both planning and development projects. The following table highlights the Station
Area Master Plans scheduled and underway.

2013 was an active year for the RTD TOD Pilot
Program. RTD along with D4 Urban have continued working on the the development partnership
at Alameda Station, which will break ground in
2014 and ultimately provide 275 residential units
and updated transit amenities. Also in 2013,
RTD, the City of Arvada, and the Arvada Urban
Renewal Authority chose Trammell Crow to develop a nine acre site adjacent to the future Olde
Town Arvada Station along the Gold Line. This
partnership is now working to design a parking garage that will address commuter parking,
business parking, and allow for more developable
space to be dedicated to TOD. Groundbreaking
on the parking structure is also expected in 2014.
Depot Square at Boulder Transit Village broke
ground in August of 2013. The Boulder Transit
Village development is above an underground
RTD bus facility that anchors one end of the
US 36 BRT line. This project will rehabilitate
the historic Boulder Train Depot and create a
mixed-use development that includes a hotel
and 71 permanently affordable apartment units.

The Denver Union Station neighborhood will be a world class
transit-oriented community at the heart of Downtown Denver.
The region’s investment in the station is on track to catalyze
millions of square feet of new development.

Denver Union Station is on schedule to open May 9th, 2014. The redevelopment project
includes a $500 million investment in transit infrastructure, redevelopment of the
Historic Union Station Building, and substantial private transit-oriented development
adjacent to the station.
The new 22-bay bus concourse will replace
the existing Market Street Station in 2014, and
commuter rail will arrive with the East Line,
Gold Line, and Northwest Rail in 2016. Beginning in 2014, Amtrak service will return and
Union Station will serve as one terminus of the
Free Metro Ride that provides an additional
downtown link with Civic Center Station along
18th and 19th Streets.
The Denver Union Station project was originally laid out in the 2004 Denver Union Station
Master Plan. A supplement to the original plan
was adopted in 2008 and included more concrete plans for redevelopment. The Denver
Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA), City
and County of Denver, CDOT, and RTD have
actively collaborated on the planning, design
and construction of the project.
Station Area Planning
In addition to the Denver Union Station
Master Plan, the immediate station has been
zoned Transit-Mixed Use by the City of Denver, allowing for a wide variety of residential,
commercial, and civic uses.

Recommendation for Contract Award to
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture for the FasTracks
Construction Management Support Consultant
Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based
on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction
Management Support Consulting work for FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are
contained in the RTD FasTracks capital budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
BACKGROUND
Since the start of FasTracks, RTD has utilized the expertise of various management support consultants
to provide specialized program management expertise, fill short term staffing needs, and augment the
RTD FasTracks staff. Most of these multi-year contracts, like RTD’s current Program Support
Consultant, will reach the end of their contract terms in 2017. However, with the start of the North
Metro corridor project and the potential for future projects, RTD’s program support needs will extend
beyond 2017. Therefore, RTD decided to pursue a new consulting contract to provide ongoing support
for North Metro and future projects.
In February 2014, RTD advertised a Request for Proposals (RFP) for Construction Management Support
Consulting Services for the FasTracks program, with an initial focus on the North Metro project. This
contract term would extend for six years, negotiated annually, with four (4) one-year options. On March
12, 2014, four excellent, written proposals were received, listed here in alphabetical order:





Kleinfelder
LS Gallegos and Associates, Inc.
RockSol/CH2M HILL
Triunity-Hill Joint Venture

A five-member evaluation team was formed to review these proposals and select the best qualified
team, based on the following evaluation criteria from the RFP:
A. Understanding of Project Objectives............................................25%
B. Technical and Management Approach .........................................30%
C. Capabilities and Experience ........................................................30%
D. DBE/SBE Approach, WIN Program Approach, and Creative
Strategies to Ensure Diversity and Inclusion .................................15%
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 94

2.C.1

After reviewing and scoring the proposals individually, the five-member evaluation team met and scored
the written proposals as a team. While there were differences in ranking the third and fourth proposals,
the reviewers had consistently ranked the top two proposals, with unanimous consent on the
recommended proposer. Additionally, both the individual and consensus scores provided enough of a
gap that a best-qualified choice was evident.
During the consensus review meeting, the proposal evaluation team discussed strengths and
weaknesses of each proposal, compared scoring, and developed a consensus score and ranking for each
firm. The Triunity-Hill JV scored the highest ranking within the criteria and was the consensus selection.
Triunity is a locally based DBE company.
The Triunity-Hill JV, which includes a certified DBE as 51% managing partner, has committed to meeting
RTD’s initial DBE Goal of 27% for this Contract, and has set their own goal of 34%. Additionally,
Triunity-Hill JV has committed to meeting or exceeding RTD’s 10% WIN Program Goal.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funds for the contract award are included in the FasTracks budget for each project that the firm will be
assigned.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the recommended action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to award a contract to the Triunity-Hill
Joint Venture, the most qualified firm based on the application of the evaluation criteria, in the
amount not to exceed $15,150,000 for Construction Management Support Consulting work for
FasTracks for the years 2014-2020. Funds for the award are contained in the RTD FasTracks capital
budget for each project to which they will be assigned.
2. Reject all submittals and re-solicit for new proposals. This is not recommended as the evaluation
criteria was in accordance with the Brooks Act requiring a qualifications based selection. Triunity-Hill
JV’s proposal was fully responsive to the selection criteria. Also, the evaluation team was
unanimous in its recommended selection of Triunity-Hill JV; a significant endorsement of this
proposal.
3. Reject all submittals and reconsider the current program management approach. This is not
recommended as RTD doesn’t currently have sufficient staff available to manage the North Metro
project, and does not desire an increase in RTD staffing headcount at this late point in the program.

Board Meeting Date: May 13, 2014

Subject:

Approval of the
Evaluation (APE)

2014

Annual

Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the Board of Directors approve the 2014
Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a comprehensive financial blueprint for all
FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned through the year 2019.
BACKGROUND
RTD has been conducting an Annual Program Evaluation since 2007. Given the challenges of managing
a multi-billion dollar capital program, it is desirable to perform a complete analysis of the cost of the
program. The APE captures all project expenses to date and all planned expenses through the year
2019 on a project-by-project basis. It essentially provides a baseline capital budget for board-approved
projects currently underway or planned in the near future.
Since so many of the FasTracks projects are now in construction, the major effort has shifted from
developing accurate estimates of costs to one of managing the projects within the Board-approved
budgets for those projects. The staff provides the Board with regular updates on the FasTracks projects
throughout the year.
On April 1, staff provided an update on the 2014 APE to the FasTracks Monitoring Committee with the
intention of bringing it to the Board at a later date for approval. That presentation is attached. There
have been no changes to the project information since that presentation.
DISCUSSION
The project-by-project cost along with the amount spent through 2013 is shown in the attached
presentation. The total FasTracks budget through 2019 is approximately $5.3 billion, and approximately
$3 billion of this total was spent through the end of 2013.
Since most of our projects are complete or under construction and are being managed within the Boardapproved budgets, the changes to this APE are relatively small. The changes primarily reflect updates to
the project scope and accounting as shown on the attached presentation. A summary of these changes
for the 2014 APE capital budget is:


Incorporation of the US36 BRT scope as approved by the Board in September 2013; with the
exception of the Broomfield parking structure and the north/west-bound Church Ranch platform
which will be completed after 2019;



I-225 storage tracks approved by the Board in April 2014;



Incorporation into the capital budget of the additional (4) Eagle vehicles approved by the Board in
December 2013;

Packet Pg. 96

2.C.2



Purchase of BNSF right-of-way, west of Ward Road on the Gold Line approved by the Board in
2010.

This APE is a key input to the overall, long-term financial plan that is part of the Senate Bill (SB) 208
Baseline Report that is scheduled to be reviewed by the RTD Board and submitted to DRCOG in the
summer of 2014. The SB 208 and related Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) amendment will include a
comprehensive financial plan that includes all costs and revenues for both base system and FasTracks
through the year 2040.
Future implementation of projects not included in the current APE, must identify the necessary changes
to the financial plan and be submitted to the Board for approval before they could proceed. Therefore,
the APE is a dynamic tool, which is updated as projects move towards completion and any changes
approved by the Board are incorporated.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The acceleration of the US 36 BRT project scope through 2018 totals $17.45 million. Of this total,
$1.25 million would be funded through a FASTER grant received in 2014, and the balance of $16.2
million would be funded through the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).
The remaining
changes would be funded within the cash flow of the financial plan adopted by the Board of Directors in
November 2013.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee the
Board of Directors approve the 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE). The APE provides a
comprehensive financial blueprint for all FasTracks capital projects completed, underway or planned
through the year 2019.
2. Do not approve the 2014 APE. This is not recommended as FasTracks would not have an updated,
capital budget to manage the program through the year 2019.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 7, 2014

From:

Scott Reed, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 7, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 13, 2014

Subject:

State Legislative Liaison Services Contract

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the
General Manager to enter into an agreement for state legislative liaison services with
Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year option (June 30, 2014 through
June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of $112,000, pursuant to the Contract
Award agreement.
BACKGROUND
Contract 13-DX-001 for State Legislative Liaison Services was signed with Brandeberry~McKenna
Public Affairs, effective June 30, 2013, and contained a provision for four (4) additional one-year option
periods. This board action would exercise the option for Year 1 of the option years. Of extreme
importance, the lobbyists are in daily contact with state legislators regarding bills that RTD seeks to have
passed, as well as regarding bills that would be harmful to RTD.
DISCUSSION
The state lobbying team provides guidance and direction for the RTD Board of Directors and staff in
their relationships with the General Assembly members. Constant monitoring of the activities within
the General Assembly and the Executive Office of the state of Colorado is required, and RTD’s
interests must be conveyed to appropriate legislators, including testifying before certain committees.
Advice and assistance in drafting legislation are also provided by the lobbying team. When RTD has
had legislation before the General Assembly, Brandeberry~McKenna has done an excellent job of
making certain that these bills pass and become part of the Colorado statutes.
As part of the services, frequent contact is made with RTD staff and board members regarding various
bills in the legislature; written summary reports are issued on a weekly basis during the legislative
session; and status reports are given at the Government Relations Committee meetings while the
General Assembly is in session and as deemed necessary thereafter.
The Brandeberry~McKenna team also takes the initiative to educate state legislators on RTD issues and
projects so that these legislators understand mass transit and RTD’s mission.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Approve the Recommended Action. It is recommended by RTD’s Government Relations Committee
that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to enter into an agreement for state
legislative liaison services with Brandeberry~McKenna Public Affairs (BMPA) to exercise a one-year
option (June 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015) to extend Contract No. 13-DX-001, at a cost of
$112,000, pursuant to the Contract Award agreement.
2. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not accept the recommendation by the
Government Relations Committee that authorizes the General Manager to enter into a contract to
execute the state legislative liaison services one-year option agreement. A new Request for

Packet Pg. 151

3.B.1

Proposals could be sent to interested parties, interviews conducted, and a different state lobbying
firm could possibly be selected by the Government Relations Committee and retained. This action
is not recommended because it is the consensus of the Government Relations Committee to
recommend to the Board the selection of the Brandeberry~McKenna team.
3. Do not approve the Recommended Action. Do not retain the services of a state legislative liaison
firm. This action is not recommended because it would put RTD in the position of facing
contentious and potentially harmful legislative issues with no direct legislative liaison services. It
was determined by the Government Relations Committee that the Brandeberry~McKenna team
has been very effective in pursuing the RTD state legislative agenda and will continue to
represent RTD’s interests very well in the future. This team is very familiar with RTD’s issues
and policies.
