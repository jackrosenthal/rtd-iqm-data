#### 1. Citizens Advisory Committee Update

#### 1. Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage Tracks

It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project.  The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by the overall FasTracks program.  The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail system.

Motion:              Director Rivera-Malpiede made to motion to move this item to the full Board at the April 15, 2014 Board meeting.

Director Folska seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Austin Jenkins, Assistant General Manager of Light Rail, and Rick Clarke, Assistant General Manager of Capital Programs, reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the April 1, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Agenda Packet.

General Manager Washington stressed that if RTD does not build the storage track the cost to RTD will actually be higher in the long run.  He stated that this action is another preemptive action that staff is recommending similar to what RTD has done on other corridors that will save the District millions of dollars.

Director Folska stated that she will be voting yes and is in full support of the recommendation.  She wondered if this action was already part of the 2014 approved budget or if it would need to be included in the amended budget.  General Manager Washington stated that it would be part of the 2014 Amended FasTracks Budget.

Director Folska asked if RTD owned the land and how large the facility would be.  She also asked for confirmation that maintenance cannot be done at this location.  Rick Clarke stated that there was no land acquisition needed as part of the recommendation.  Chuck Culig, I-225 Project Manager, explained that this will not be an actual facility but additional track for storage; there will be a small building that the operators will use to check-in with their supervisors prior to their shifts.  Austin Jenkins noted that all maintenance of the light rail vehicles will still happen at RTD’s Elati and Mariposa facilities.  He said that the trains will be cycled for normal maintenance.

Director Bagley commented that as we build the additional extensions in the future the issue of all trains going to Elati will only be exacerbated so he is very supportive of this recommendation.

Director Tobiassen shared that he is very supportive of this action.  He said that it really makes sense with the path that trains will take from Lincoln Station to the end of the I-225 Line.  He feels there is really no need for all of the light rail drivers to go to Elati and that this makes perfect sense from an operational perspective.

Director Lubow stated that she will be voting no on this action.  She explained that she is not voting no because she thinks it is an unwise recommendation but really due to a larger issue this raises.  She reminded the Board that she lives in an area that is supposed to be served by the Northwest Rail Line which there is not funding for.  She expressed concerns about spending FasTracks money in such a piecemeal way when the Board does not have the whole picture of what is left.  Director Lubow stressed that her voting no on this recommendation was not because she did not think it was wise to build, she is just very concerned that RTD is getting to the bottom of the barrel for any funding for FasTracks.  She requested staff prepare a more detailed picture of what is left.  Director Lubow also asked for more detailed information as to what is happening with the FasTracks Internal Savings Account (FISA).

Committee Chair Hoy noted that the Annual Program Evaluation (APE) process will answer many of Director Lubow’s questions.  He stated that it is an intense financial analysis of FasTracks going forward.

Chair Sisk said that he too shared some of Director Lubow’s concerns but also has to look at this from an economic position.  He stated that he can see the cost savings and would like to stipulate that the cost savings goes back into the FasTracks budget.  Bill Van Meter, Assistant General Manager of Planning, commented that the savings will accrue to both FasTracks and Base budgets; the I-225 operations costs are from the FasTracks budget so those savings will remain in FasTracks.  He noted that there will be some ancillary savings to Base Systems.

General Manager Washington stated that staff would make sure to show how the savings tracks back to the FasTracks budget.  He noted that if this action was not approved that will lead to less money for the unfunded corridors.

Director Solano recognized Director Lubow’s point where a proactive solution could create a reactive problem somewhere else; he said he also sees Chair Sisk’s point about saving money.  Director Solano expressed concern that this action might take away funding from the North Metro Line.  He stated that he was going to vote no until he was able to discuss the recommendation further with staff.

Director Menten acknowledged that due to the change in Gold Line technology from light rail to commuter rail it was determined that RTD did not need a new maintenance and storage facility and could expand the Elati maintenance facility.  She asked how much the expansion cost versus constructing a new facility.  Rick Clarke stated that the expansion cost between $20 and $25 million while the approved brand new maintenance facility would have cost over $100 million.  He said in retrospect staff should have identified the need for additional storage but was focused on maintenance capacity and at that time I-225 was an unfunded corridor.

Director Menten pointed out that a reason for taking this action now was a need to hurry because we have a contractor working on the I-225 Rail Line that we could use.  Director Menten believes that this project would need to be sent to bid.  She expressed concern that it could appear there was some favoritism given to the contract RTD was already working with.  Rick Clarke stated that the need to hurry comes from needing to complete this before the I-225 Line is complete; if we were to try to build the storage at that time the cost would increase astronomically.  He explained that RTD has a team of independent estimators that would first determine a cost for the project.  RTD would then use that estimate to negotiate with Kiewit to come to a mutually agreed upon amount.  He stated that if nothing could be agreed upon staff would recommend that the project go out for bid.  General Manager Washington commented that this is really a standard procurement practice that if a contractor is already working a change order is negotiated with that contractor.

Director Menten stated that she would be voting no tonight to ensure there could be further discussion about this item at the Board meeting.

Director Walker feels this is more of a maintenance issue than a corridor issue.  This action protects the integrity of the entire rail system.  He stated that this is something he has also run into in other situations where it costs money up front but will create a savings in the long run.  He shared that he worked for an agency that was really focused on expansion of capacity.  Director Walker reiterated that this action was about maintenance.  He said that the other agency he worked for now does not have the money to do anything whether it is maintenance or expansion because they kept investing in expanding.

Committee Chair Hoy said that he agrees with some of the comments on both sides; however, the overwhelming thing the Board is faced with is the question of if this recommendation makes economic sense.  He stated that if he was the owner of RTD he would spend the money on the storage tracks.  He thinks approving this is a prudent decision.

Committee Chair Hoy declared the motion PASSED.

##### a. Storage tracks

#### 1. 2014 Annual Program Evaluation (APE) Status Update

Committee Chair Hoy reiterated that this will be a very complicated process that will conclude in July; this presentation is just setting the groundwork for future updates and decisions.

Rick Clarke and Bill Van Meter reviewed a Power Point presentation with the Board that is available in the April 1, 2014 FasTracks Monitoring Committee Meeting Agenda Packet.  Rick Clarke highlighted that staff was not presenting the Board with any overruns in the APE.  He also noted that this was just an update and the Board was not being asked to vote on anything at this time.

General Manager Washington stated that no one wants to complete FasTracks more than staff does.  He noted that the current leadership team took over when RTD had nothing under construction but now look at the Eagle P3 project that came in $300 million under budget.  General Manager Washington noted that there is an undercurrent of suspicion that staff is not doing everything than can which is very frustrating when they are working hard to successfully manage our projects while trying to find innovative ways to do as much as they can.

Committee Chair Hoy noted that there are currently six projects under construction, half of which will be done by 2016.

Director Folska commented that bicycle storage was not listed as an essential amenity as part of Phase II of the US36 BRT project.  She thinks that this is clearly important to commuters based on all the feedback RTD and the Board has heard.  She is encouraging and urging that staff look at including bicycle storage as an essential amenity.  Rick Clarke stated that bicycle storage is considered a betterment so it is outside the scope of the project.  He explained that the reason staff has been able to keep the project in budget is by maintaining the scope.  Director Folska reiterated that she hopes staff would consider this an essential part of the scope of the entire multi-modal system.

Director Tobiassen asked if SB 208 would get a third party audit or review before going to DRCOG.  Bill Van Meter said that the FasTracks Citizens Advisory Committee first reviews the documentation to make recommendations.  He shared that DRCOG often hires a third party financial consultant paid for by RTD to review the financial plan; however, he stated that this is not something DRCOG has determined if they will do yet.

Director Lubow asked if tax from marijuana sales could impact the APE and funding for FasTracks.  She also wondered how much RTD was projected to receive from the taxes.  Marla Lien noted that RTD just gets our regular sales tax percentage of the sale of marijuana; RTD does not share in the additional excise tax, licensing fees, etc.  Committee Chair Hoy shared that in January RTD received just under $100K from the marijuana sales tax.  He commented that the number could be attributed to opening day excitement but if the figures hold it will be around $1.2 million annual.  Doug MacLeod, Manager of Financial Reporting, pointed out that RTD was already collecting sales tax on medical marijuana; the figure referenced by Committee Chair Hoy was for retail marijuana and was actually $99K for January.  General Manager Washington stated that all the sales tax received from marijuana sales would go into the FasTracks kitty so RTD could continue to build as much as we can, as fast as we can until FasTracks is complete.

Chair Sisk encouraged staff to think about Director Folska’s point that we need to find a way to look at bicycle storage.  He believes that as a multi-modal agency we can find innovative ways to encourage bicycle storage facilities and challenged staff to do so.

##### a. 2014 APE Update 040114 v3

### E. Other Matters

Director Walker asked and encouraged the other Directors to be vigilant in reviewing the information presented to them over the next couple months.  He noted that on April 8, 2014 there would be a discussion about the Strategic Budget Plan, an amended budget would be presented shortly, and the APE needs to be finalized.  He said there will be a lot of numbers presented to the Directors so he hopes everyone can block out some time to really review the information.

### G. Adjourn

Committee Chair Hoy adjourned the meeting at 8:58 p.m.
