Approval of Funding for Light Rail Storage
Tracks

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors approve funding
for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks
are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by the overall FasTracks program. The storage
tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail system.
BACKGROUND
The District’s original plans for FasTracks expansion included the addition of a new light rail vehicle
(LRV) maintenance and storage facility. As the scope of the FasTracks Plan was refined, the decision
was made to expand the existing Elati LRV maintenance facility instead of adding a new facility to save
costs. All LRV maintenance and mid-day and overnight storage is currently performed at the Elati and
Mariposa maintenance facilities. This setup was able to successfully support the opening of the West
Rail Line without negatively impacting the operations of the current system. However, the planning for
and opening of the West Rail Line made it evident that this system is not expected to be able to support
the I-225 Rail Line without impacts to the reliability of current light rail operations.
The I-225 Rail Line is located much farther from the existing maintenance facilities so it is difficult to
support mid-day and overnight storage of the entire I-225 LRV fleet without causing disruptions to the
existing service. The light rail system will not be able to support all pull-outs from Elati and Mariposa
with the addition of the I-225 trains. This would require the signal system to constantly operate over
capacity (yellow signals) which reduces system reliability. In addition, the overnight maintenance
window would be severely impacted making it nearly impossible to do maintenance work on the line
during that period.
DISCUSSION
Rail Operations has identified additional train storage capacity as a critical element in being able to
maintain reliable service on the existing system and future corridors. Rail Operations, Planning and
Capital Programs staff worked together to develop a solution that would solve the operations needs
without major budget or schedule implications to the I-225 project and entire FasTracks program.
This solution is to add the following infrastructure to the I-225 Rail Line: 1. Additional storage tracks at
the Peoria Station with capacity to store 18 LRVs on the tail tracks and 2. One layover track adjacent to
the 13th Avenue Station that will allow for emergency storage of LRVs. The infrastructure improvements
at the Peoria Station will also include a small building to be used for train operator reporting and storage
of equipment used for interior LRV cleaning.
The Peoria tail track storage coupled with the small building will allow for up to 18 LRVs for the I-225
Rail Line to start and end their day on the corridor and relieve the stress that would have been put on
the existing system by requiring all trains to pull in and out of Elati and Mariposa every day. No major
maintenance or exterior cleaning will be performed at Peoria as this can all be handled at Elati. Train

schedules will need to be written so that the LRVs stored at Peoria constantly rotate so all LRVs can be
serviced at Elati on a regular basis.
This is a necessary project to support light rail asset management and state of good repair. Without
these storage tracks, RTD will incur significant operations costs. The signal system would likely require
upgrades to support the number of trains that would need to deadhead from Elati to the Southeast and I225 corridors. In addition, there would be ongoing costs associated with increased mileage on the LRVs
and overhead contact system (OCS). Special accommodations would also be necessary for overnight
maintenance along the line which would require the added cost of providing service with bus bridges due
to the limited maintenance windows.
It is important that this item be funded now as performing this work while the I-225 Rail Line is still
under construction will be significantly less expensive and less disruptive to ongoing service than waiting
until the line is complete. In addition, many of the components of this work such as special track work
(switches and crossovers), signal equipment and power facilities are long lead items that require early
action in order to complete this work by opening day of the I-225 Rail Line.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The $12 million capital cost to construct the light rail storage tracks will be funded from the overall
FasTracks program because these improvements are necessary to support the entire light rail system. It
is anticipated that the payback period for the $12 million capital expenditure will be 7-10 years through
potential reductions in ongoing operating and maintenance costs.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors approve funding for the construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the
I-225 Rail Line project. The storage tracks are estimated to cost $12 million which will be funded by
the overall FasTracks program. The storage tracks are needed to add reliability to the entire light rail
system.
2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Do not approve the action to approve funding for the
construction of light rail storage tracks as part of the I-225 Rail Line project. This will have negative
implications for light rail system reliability and increased operating costs. This is not recommended.

LRT Storage Tracks
• All Light Rail Vehicle (LRV) maintenance and midday and over night storage is performed at Elati
and Mariposa
• A new LRV maintenance facility was originally
part of FasTracks, but was eliminated to save
cost (Elati was expanded instead)
• The additional LRT lines in FasTracks (West and
I-225) are putting additional pressure on our core
system

Benefits of Storage Track Expansion
• Minimize deadhead movements to/from Elati
• Reduces congestion on the core sections of the
LRT system
• Allows for longer maintenance windows on the
line
• Gives more flexibility to change consist size,
recover from delays, short turns, etc.
• Provides systemwide benefits
• State of good repair benefits
