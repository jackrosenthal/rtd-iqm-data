BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
To:

Phillip A. Washington, General Manager

Date: May 15, 2014

From:

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

GM

Date:

May 14, 2014

Board Meeting Date: May 20, 2014

Subject:

Approval of August 2014 Service Change

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Services Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the August 2014 Service Change package as revised and summarized in Attachment A and,
further, to authorize the General Manager or his designee to execute contract amendments as necessary
for private operators whose service is impacted by these changes.
DISCUSSION
To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance,
sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different
classes of service have different expectations of performance. We will adjust services in response to
changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. As part of an overall
effort to maintain our light rail system in a state of good repair, we are proposing changes to the late
night service on light rail, which will create a wider maintenance window for repairs to infrastructure.
The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:
 Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;
 The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;
 The availability of alternative services to affected riders;
 Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to
enhance service when possible;
 Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or
national origin; also disparate impacts on low income and minority populations; and
 Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
SUMMARY OF PUBLIC HEARINGS
Six public hearings were held between May 7 th and May 14th in Evergreen, Aurora, Commerce City
Denver and Boulder. Comments from these meetings and the service change website are summarized in
Attachment B of this report.
CHANGES TO INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS
Staff receives input during the public comment process and continues to conduct additional analysis
after the initial service recommendations are communicated to the Board of Directors. Depending on the
outcome of the public comment process and continued analysis, staff may or may not propose
modifications to these initial recommendations. The following represent substantive changes proposed to
the service changes initially communicated to the Board of Directors for implementation as part of the
August 2014 service change. Also included in these changes are items changed by amendment of the

1.B.1.a

Route 6 – East 6th Avenue/North Pecos
This proposal adds a 5:19am eastbound trip from Wewatta/16th to Centrepoint & Sable,
which will provide earlier reverse peak service into the city of Aurora. A running time
analysis will also be conducted to improve on-time performance. Cost estimated to be
approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 8 – North Broadway/Huron
It is proposed to realign trips after 6:30 p.m. and all day weekends and holiday service to
operate into Civic Center Station. Southbound buses would enter from Broadway,
northbound buses would travel via West Colfax and 15th Street. An additional trip in the
PM peak, leaving southbound at around 5:26pm, from Wagon Road Park-n-Ride is also
proposed to cover a current service gap in the schedule. Saturday running time
adjustments are also needed. Cost estimated to be approximately $10,300 annualized.
Route 9 – West 10th Avenue

reliability. Cost is estimated to be $103,300 annualized.
Route DASH – Boulder/ Lafayette via Louisville
The city of Boulder is installing a traffic signal at South Boulder Road and Manhattan Circle
which will allow us to move the layover/recovery for Route Dash short-turn trips back to
this location. It is therefore proposed to change the current layover from Table Mesa PnR
back to Manhattan Circle, for the DASH short-turn trips. It is also proposed to separate
interlines on Sundays, which will require an additional bus to improve recovery time on the
service. Weekday peak running time adjustments are also proposed. Cost is estimated to

Nine Mile at 7:13 and terminating at I-25 & Broadway at 7:35 with connections to the
7:38 0Ltd and other routes. This will help relieve overcrowding on the 7:04 and 7:19
northbound trips, which are each experiencing Weekday average passenger loads of over
420 and thus nearing Service Standards. This trip would run Mondays-Thursdays, in
conjunction with the new fourth day of service. Anticipated cost is estimated to be
$70,800 annualized.
W-Line – it is proposed to discontinue four of the most unproductive round-trips of the
Weekday: Eastbound trips from Federal Center Station at 6:01 AM, 3:00 PM, 3:15 PM,
and 6:45 PM and Westbound trips from Union Station at 5:40 AM, 2:25 PM, 2:55 PM,
and 6:25 PM. This proposed change effects 355 passengers that will need to take a WLine 7.5 minutes earlier or later. Cost savings are estimated to be -$276,853 annualized.

C/E/F-Line – It is proposed to continue the peak C and E Line service through the midday,
with each line alternating every 30 minutes. The F-Line would also run through the
midday with 30-minute service. This would create a combined 15-minute headway on the
Southeast Corridor between Belleview Station and Lincoln Station.
This proposal
increases connections to and from the W-Line at Auraria West Station and provides more
service to the Auraria at Colfax Station for students at the campus and helps alleviate the
pullin and pullout issues at the end of the morning peak period and before the afternoon
peak period. This operation requires 10 trains instead of the current 6 during the midday.
Anticipated cost is estimated to be $590,000 annualized.

Weeknight (Sunnday-Thursday) Service
D/E/H/W-Line – To provide longer windows for maintenance-of-way it is proposed to
adjust late night and early morning service. Late night service is proposed for changes
Sunday through Thursday nights. This change continues the span of service Sunday
through Thursday nights through 1:00 AM and reduces the frequency from 30 minutes to
60 minutes after 11:00 PM. This proposal will impact approximately 442 passengers on
Sundays and 358 passengers on Mondays-Thursdays.

(from Lincoln Station).
W-Line - It is proposed to discontinue the 11:32 PM and 12:32 AM westbound W-Line
trips (from Union Station) in addition to the 12:30 AM and 1:15 AM eastbound W-Line
trips (from Jefferson County Government Center - Golden Station).
Total hours saved: 18.58 daily, 4,738.75 annual. Anticipated savings of approximately
$695,000 annualized.

Additional 15-minute Service
D/E/H-Line – It is proposed It is proposed to extend the current 15-minute headways
ending at approximately 9:30 PM from downtown Denver another hour to approximately
10:00 PM. This will already have been implemented for the W-Line in May 2014.

1.B.1.a

C/D-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in both directions
between Mineral Station and I-25 & Broadway and also reschedule the bus connections at
Mineral Station to the Routes 77, 401, 402L, and 403 to improve transfers and make the
service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
H-Line – it is proposed to make minor adjustments in running times in the southbound
direction between Dayton Station and Nine Mile Station and also reschedule the bus
connections at Nine Mile Station to the Route 35, 121, 130, 131, 133, 135, and 139 to
improve transfers and make the service more reliable. No changes in hours proposed.
W-Line – it is proposed to adjust running times on the W-Line based on modifications in
regards to the quiet zone crossings. It is anticipated that up to one minute will be saved in
both directions, which will also help with the layover/recovery time at Jefferson County
Government Center Station. This adjustment will save an all-day train on Weekdays and
Saturdays/Sundays.
Total anticipated cost savings is estimated to be -$1,157,000 annualized.

School trippers added/adjusted:
D-Line (train 14), H-Line (train 57). Both are proposed to operate on Monday-Thursday
only, utilizing the new fourth class of service schedule.
Special Services
BroncosRide
It is proposed that RTD discontinue the following RTD BroncosRide Routes for the 2014
season: Federal Center Station BroncosRide and Market Street Station. Alternative for
the Federal Center Station will be the West Line Light Rail. With the closing of Market
Street Station, the Market Street Shuttle would be discontinued. Alternative service will
also be the West Line Light Rail (W-line), Southeast Light Rail (E-Line), operating out of
Union Station.
Due to bus constraints associated with week night games, it is also proposed that RTD
discontinue service to the Alameda & Havana PnR and East High School for weeknight
games only. Currently these two locations do not have preseason service. This proposal
will extend to any regular season weeknight games only. Alameda & Havana alternatives
will include BroncosRide out of South High School or any station along the Southeast Light
Rail Line. East High School alternative will be the Route 15Ltd which is being extended to
the Decatur-Federal Station. Approximately 150 customers will be effected each game.
Savings: Annual Savings -$6,100.

Bruce Abel, Assistant General Manager

Board Meeting Date: May 20, 2014

Subject:

Longmont fare Buy Up Program

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Operations and Customer Service Committee that the RTD Board of Directors
authorize the General Manager, or his designee, to enter into a contract with Boulder County to allow the
County to buy up fares on all four of the Longmont local fixed route services, herein referenced as “The 300
series.” Specifically the 300 series are routes 323, 324, 326 and 327 and complementary Access-a-Ride
services for an initial period of 6 months with options to extend the buy-up period up to two years.
BACKGROUND
Boulder County, in cooperation with the City of Longmont, has requested that they be allowed to “buy up”
all fares on the 300 series routes in Longmont. Boulder County and the City of Longmont feel that one of
the major reasons that ridership has declined in Longmont over the years is due to high fares. The objective
of this action is to build ridership and prevent future service reductions by the RTD.
DISCUSSION
Boulder County has agreed to reimburse the RTD up to $286,000 on an annual basis (staff estimate is
$210,000 for fixed-route plus approximately $10,000 for ADA annually) for fares on the 300 series routes
and any additional dollars for Access-a-Ride trips that fall within the ADA service area boundaries of the 300
series routes. This dollar amount was established based on 300 series fare revenue from 2012. Originally,
this program request was for a two year period. However, the FTA felt that this would constitute a fare
change and therefore required a fare equity analysis. The program was scaled back to a 6 month
promotional period that would run from July-December 2014. This promotional period is in line with FTA
policy and will not require a fare equity analysis. This request is for a 6 month period but would be extended
an additional 18 months if Boulder County can receive FTA approval. During the dates specified above, there
will be no fare for any passenger boarding any 300 series route. All passengers will be allowed unlimited
boardings on all 300 Series routes, in both directions, throughout the day and throughout the promotional
period. Ridership is currently about 600 boardings per day from previous highs of over 800 boardings per
day. All RTD rules, regulations, and codes of conduct will be the same as if passengers were paying fares.
Transit operators, other RTD staff and members of law enforcement will continue to have the discretion to
refuse boarding to any passenger they deem will compromise the safety of others. Transfers will be issued
to any passengers requesting a transfer. This program will not include the Call-n-Ride or regional routes
operating within Longmont. The purpose of the program is to focus on fixed route local ridership. The Calln-Ride ridership should not be affected by this program. The County has also agreed that RTD will not be
responsible for any additional operational costs required to stay within RTD service standards should ridership
increases generate a need for additional service; any new cost will be borne by Boulder County. The local
agencies, specifically Boulder County and City of Longmont, will perform the majority of the marketing and
publicity for this program with the approval of RTD Marketing. RTD will promote this program at appropriate
locations on the RTD website. Boulder County, City of Longmont and RTD will hold quarterly meetings to
discuss any issues that need to be addressed with the Buy Up program. Boulder County will take the lead
organizing and hosting these meetings.

CCDC Settlement Baseline Complaint Report

One of the requirements of the CCDC Settlement Agreement is for RTD to “provide CCDC with an Initial
Report. The purpose of the Initial Report will be to determine a data baseline and to assess, in both data
and other subjective evidence available, the effect of the policy and training as required by [the]
Agreement.”
An additional requirement of the Agreement is to provide the Initial Report to the RTD Board of
Directors.
Accordingly, attached to this memo is a copy of the Initial Report. This report provides information on
(1) each incident in which a bus operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button, and (2) each
incident in which a passenger complained that an operator violated the Policy.
The data contained in the Initial Report covers the period from the Effective Date of the Policy (March
22, 2014) through April 30, 2014.

Analysis of CCDC Agreement Securement Area Issues Data

As you are aware, RTD and the Colorado Cross Disability Association (CCDC) entered into
a joint Settlement Agreement in an effort to resolve issues related to availability of the
securement area on board RTD buses for passengers who use mobility aids. One of the
requirements of the Settlement Agreement was for RTD to adopt a policy to ensure
individuals who use mobility aids, including wheelchairs, have equal access to its buses
and to the securement area. The key components of this policy are as follows:






Large items cannot block the aisle of the bus
Large items must be collapsed prior to boarding, and passengers must use the seats
behind the securement area for themselves and their items
If large items cannot be collapsed and stored behind the securement area, those
passengers will not be able to board the bus
Large items must be readily moveable and stowed behind the securement area
Passengers with mobility aids, such as wheelchairs, will be given priority boarding
at bus stops

Starting with the effective date of the policy (March 22, 2014), RTD has been tracking 1)
each incident in which a bus operator presses the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button on board
the bus and 2) each incident in which a passenger complains that an operator has violated
the policy. The data for RTD and the private contractors combined resulted in 161 total
incidents reported for the period. Investigation into each of these incidents showed
several that were duplicates, i.e., the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button
multiple times thinking he/she would get a quicker response from Dispatch. There were
also several incidents that did not result in a passenger using a mobility aid getting passed
up. In these cases the operator pressed the “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button in error. After
subtracting these incidents from the total number of incidents, the data showed 101
actual incidents either involving a passenger pass up or a complaint about the policy that
was called in to the Telephone Information Center (TIC). Over half of the actual passenger

Customer Service Report (reported to TIC)
 Passenger w/stroller claimed she was disabled
 Video evidence did not support complaint
 Passenger claimed back brace was a mobility aid
 Passenger w/large bags refused to move
 Operator allowed 3 passengers in wheelchairs on bus
 Passenger w/walker asked to move out of aisle

One additional statistic that was tracked was the number of times an operator pressed the
lower priority “Request To Talk” (RTT) button in order to contact Dispatch regarding a
passenger pass up instead of the high priority “ADA PAX PASS-UP” button. During the
reporting period of 3/22/14 through 4/30/14, operators used the RTT button 14 times.
The routes generating the highest number of “ADA PAX PASS-UP” incidents were as
follows (includes both actual pass up incidents and those identified as “not a pass up
incident”):
Route 16 – 22 incidents
Route 15L – 20 incidents
Route 15 – 15 incidents
Route 0 – 8 incidents
On average, RTD carries approximately 345,000- 350,000 passengers per day. The
average number of operator-related complaints received per month for both RTD and the
private contractors for 2013 was 1,860. 2014 ridership and complaint numbers were not
available at the time of this report.
