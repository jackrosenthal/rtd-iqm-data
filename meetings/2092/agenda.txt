UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

Contract Award to Aconex for Construction Management Software as a Service
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the RTD Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager, or designee, to execute all documents
necessary to award a three-year contract in the amount of $560,000, with four
one-year options in the amount of $600,000 for a total of $1,160,000 to
Aconex for Construction Management Software as a Service. Funding for this
contract in 2010 is included in the 2010 Adopted Budget, and future year
funding will be appropriated on an annual basis.

B.

IT Contingency Work Order Contract Fourth and Final Year Option
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the
Board of Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents
necessary to award Booz Allen Hamilton (Booz Allen) the fourth and final-option
year to a current contract for IT Technical and Management Support Services
(15DK004). This contract was originally awarded in 2006 to Booz Allen through
the competitive bid process. The contract allowed for an initial-year plus four (4)
one-year options to renew based on positive performance by the vendor.
Execution of the third-option year extended the period of performance but did into

increase the contract not-to-exceed limit of $1,000,000. The initial one-year
contract was not-to-exceed $250,000. With increased needs for Booz Allen
Services, IT requested the final-option year be exercised and the annual not-toexceed was increased by $500,000 to a contract amount of $1,500,000. The
final-option year is to begin on September 15, 2010 and remain in effect for one
year until September 14, 2011 and increases the contract amount to
$1,500,000.
