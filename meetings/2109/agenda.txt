GENERAL MANAGER’S REPORT

UNANIMOUS CONSENT
A.

U.S. 36 Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) Grant
Contingent Commitment
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of
Directors offer fiscal support for the U.S. 36 application for “Transportation
Investment Generating Economic Recovery” (TIGER) funds. Through preparation
of the U.S. 36 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the U.S. 36 communities,
in concert with RTD and the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT),
have been planning improvements to the U.S. 36 Corridor for the last six years.
The planning efforts have culminated in the recommendation of multi-modal
improvements ready for implementation. It is recommended that RTD offer
support for the application by pledging $30 million for transit-related
improvements, beginning in 2010, contingent upon the receipt of at least $30
million in TIGER grant funds for the U.S. 36 project and a corresponding match
commitment from CDOT. Committing these matching funds will strengthen the
application and better position this project to maximize the opportunity for federal
funding. Funding for the $30 million is included in the FasTracks Financial Plan in
the U.S. 36 BRT - Phase 2 project.

B.

January 2010 Service Changes
It is recommended by the Operations/Customer Services Committee that the
Board of Directors approve moving the proposed January 10, 2010 Service
Changes (Attachment A) on to public review and comment.

C.

2010-2015 Transit Development Program (TDP)
It is recommended by the Financial Administration Committee that the RTD
Board of Directors adopt the 2010-2015 Transit Development Program (TDP).

D.

Adoption of 2010 Performance Measures
It is recommended by the Financial Administration Committee that the Board
of Directors adopt the 2010 Performance Measures for Goals 1-7.

E.

Kacey Fine Furniture Easement at 11305 W. 6th Avenue, Lakewood, CO
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute
all documents necessary to grant a permanent parking easement underneath a
proposed LRT bridge extension to the owners of the adjacent Kacey Fine
Furniture property at 11305 W. 6th Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado.

F.

Recommendation for Amendment of Contract for Outside Legal Counsel – PPP
Concession Agreement
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that a contract
amendment in the amount of $1.325 million be added to the contract with the
firms of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) and Kaplan Kirsch &
Rockwell LLP (KKR) to assist in all steps necessary to procure a concessionaire
and draft a concession agreement for construction of the Gold Line and East
Corridor commuter rail lines through a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The total
contract not to exceed amount will be increased to $4.325 million. Funding for
this contract in 2009 is included in the 2009 Amended Budget for the PPP
project. Funding for 2010 and 2011 is included in future years for the FasTracks
financial plan.

G.

Budget Transfer for Central Corridor Signal Software Modifications
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $2.1 million from the Central Corridor
Enhancements capital budget to the FasTracks expense budget to cover an IGA
with the City and County of Denver for signal systems enhancements to allow
increased frequency of LRT operations, which cannot be classified as a capital
expenditure by RTD. Funding for this project is included in the 2009 Amended
Budget for the FasTracks Central Corridor Enhancements capital project.

H.

XI.

Budget Transfer for Station Area Master Plans (STAMPS)
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the transfer of $813,280 from the FasTracks Contingency
Reserve to the FasTracks expense budget to provide funding for Station Area
Master Planning, Next Steps Planning and Corridor-Wide Planning. Funding for
these projects is provided through federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality
(CMAQ) grants and local jurisdictions.

RECOMMENDED ACTION
I.

IT Contingency Work Order Contract Final One-Year Option
It is recommended by the Financial Administration Committee that the Board of
Directors authorize the General Manager to execute all documents necessary to
award a contract amendment to initiate the fourth and final one-year option with
Ciber as well as incrementally increasing the total contract upset limit an
additional $475,000 to extend the contract for IT Technical and Management
Support Services (15DK008). This contract was originally awarded in 2005 to
Ciber through the competitive bid process totally separate from the ERP effort.
The contract allowed for an initial year plus four one-year options to renew based
on positive performance by the vendor. Through negotiations, Ciber has agreed
to reduce their billing rate 9% for the remainder of the current option year
through the term of the final option year ending April 25, 2011.

M.

Issuance of Eagle Project Request for Proposals (RFP), Increase Stipend
Agreement, Negotiation of Compensation Agreements
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of
Directors:
(a) directs staff to issue the Eagle Project Request for Proposals (RFP) on September
30, 2009 to allow the East Corridor, Gold Line and Northwest Rail Electrified
Segment to be jointly procured and delivered under a single concession
agreement so that all corridors will open for passenger service in 2016 in
accordance with the FasTracks program
(b) approves an increase in the amount of the stipend agreement from $1,750,000
to $2,500,000 per team to provide bidder teams an increased incentive to remain
in the Eagle P3 procurement process which, in turn, will provide a more
competitive process that will maximize the value to RTD

in

Director’s

LOCAL

(c) authorizes the transfer of $2,250,000 from the FasTracks Contingency Reserve
to the PPP project in the FasTracks capital budget to pay for the increase in the
stipend amount. This would advance funding included in the FasTracks financial
plan in 2010 for PPP preparation.
(d) authorizes the General Manager to negotiate and enter into a compensation
agreement with the three pre-qualified teams invited to respond to the Eagle
Project RFP (the Proposers) in an amount not to exceed $20,000,000 to be
payable in the event that RTD elects not, or is unable, to execute and implement
a concession agreement with the selected proposer through no fault of the
selected proposer. Payment only will be made to the team that is selected by the
Board for a contract award, and not to the unsuccessful teams. As a condition of
this compensation RTD would receive all of the design work, including
calculations, analyses and other supporting work that the selected team
completed as part of the proposal process. Additional funding of $17.5 million
for the compensation agreement, which equals the difference between the
stipend amount and the compensation agreement amount for the selected
proposer, is included in the FasTracks financial plan for the Eagle project corridors
in 2010, and will be budgeted at that time.
