### A. Committee Background

Committee Chair Francone thanked everyone for attending and let the committee know we would be speaking to the process and setting up some ground rules as well as reviewing materials.  Barbara has prepared for us a notebook of all materials that will be used throughout this process.  Included in your packet were the 4 approved policies used in the process of determining and evaluating the position of General Manager.  These four policies were created as a result of the 2010 Legislative Audit.  At that time it was mandated a committee be set up for the purpose of GM oversight and performance evaluation.

### B. Approved Policies

Goal Setting Policy, Performance Evaluation Policy, Benchmarking Policy, Approved Compensation Philosophy

As committee members we are tasked with the following 2 items:  Following through on the 2016 Performance Evaluation process of General Manager Genova and Goal Setting and Performance Evaluation preparation for 2017.

Committee Chair Francone spoke to the approved policies that were in the packet as the guidelines utilized in the process of evaluating the General Manager. The goal setting is tied to the results of the Board/Senior Leadership retreat we attended in March.  GM Genova will be speaking to those 4 priorities at the Study Session scheduled for April 26th of this month.  GM Genova made the correction that there were 3 priorities and not 4.  Committee Chair Francone thanked him for the correction.  Committee Vice-Chair Bagley clarified that the Study Session was an informational session in reviewing the GM Tactical Plan and the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee was charged to do an in depth review of the tactical goals to determine how and where the tactical goals are placed as part of the overall evaluation process.  Once the details of the core and task goals are determined, the committee will bring the recommendations to the full Board.  Committee Vice-Chair Bagley asked if there was mutual understanding of the process.  Director Anderson said this is the way it has been completed in the past.

GM Genova said the Tactical Plan as presented provides the basis for developing the task goals in the evaluation.  Committee Vice-Chair Bagley reiterated the core goals fall out of the job description while the tactical fall out of the 2016 retreat for the 2017 performance evaluation.  Committee Chair Francone reminded everyone that the presentation is given in the broadest of terms and this committee will work with and massage all of the elements to get them into the framework of the evaluation.  Committee Vice-Chair Bagley pointed out the importance of the policies in place and the need for the committee to fully understand their content.  Committee Chair Francone agreed that all policies are important to understand but particularly the Compensation Philosophy which Committee Vice-Chair Bagley said has caused some differences in the past.  Committee Chair Francone reminded the committee that these policies are the foundation of what the committee does and is the basis of how we move forward in the evaluation.  She asked if all the committee members were in agreement with the process as outlined and the policies that are currently in place.  Not hearing any comments she would called for a motion.

Committee Vice-Chair Bagley moved that the present methodology and policies be continued through the 3rd quarter of 2016 in the evaluation process and into 2017.  Director Anderson seconded and the motion was passed unanimously.

## III. Proposed 2016-2017 General Manager Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline

Committee Chair Francone reviewed the Goal Setting and Evaluation Timeline with special emphasis on critical dates with the committee.  Committee Vice-Chair Bagley commented that two key dates are as follows: on or before July 12th the committee would formalize the goal setting process with GM Genova and move the action forward for full approval of the Board on July 19th.  Committee Chair Francone went over the critical dates for the 2016 evaluation.  November 1st the GM will provide to the committee his self-assessment for 2016 performance evaluation and on November 15th the committee discusses the possibility of a discretionary payout.  On November 22nd the GM Oversight and Performance Management Committee invites the full Board to discuss the evaluation and payout recommendation.  Final recommendations are made on December 6th moving the recommendation to the full Board on December 20th. Committee Chair Francone asked if there are any questions.

Director Walker spoke to the tight timeframe in the fall and suggested the committee may need additional meeting dates as the process does not allow extended turnaround times in the decision making period.  Committee Chair Francone asked GM Genova if he had any additional comments.  He responded he is ready to move forward with 2017 Tactical Plan for the Study Session on Tuesday, April 26th and understands the 2016 process as well.

Committee Chair Francone asked if there were any questions or was the committee in agreement.  Director Anderson reiterated that the core goals fall out of the job description and the tactical goals are determined by this committee.

Director Menten thought the core goals need to be updated for 2017 as in the example they are outdated and asked the committee to go to the manual section 7 to review the goals.  Director Anderson spoke to the process of the General Manager giving us the current elements that fall into each category under the core goals.  The General Manager and the committee will determine through the tactical plan which elements will be placed under each static core goals as the elements in advancing those goals.  Director Menten said she thought what she was hearing was that the core goals are touchable and can be changed for 2017 based on the specifics presented by the General Manager.  Committee Chair Francone said we were probably premature in looking at this since GM Genova will be presenting the Tactical Plan on April 26th and we would revisit the core goals at a later date.  Director Walker said as he understands the process that specific elements of the core goals change over time.

The motion was made by Committee Vice-Chair Bagley to leave the core goals for 2017 as is and was seconded by Director Anderson and passed unanimously.

## IV. Review Performance Evaluation

Director Walker asked if any committee members would be proposing changes to the committee much like Director Menten did last year.  He feels if so, the sooner the better in all fairness to GM Genova since he may choose different paths depending on how his goals are structured within the evaluation process.  Director Menten said she would like to propose some changes which is why she questioned the turnaround time in July in making that decision.  Director Walker explained on the timeline the vertical arrow to the right of the milestones indicated there would be meetings scheduled for this committee starting in May until July in which those decisions will be made prior to taking the formal goals to the Board on the 19th of July.  Director Anderson explained that July is the deadline and it is critical as the decision has a direct impact on approval of the budget and we all should be cognoscente of the timeline.  Director Walker suggested additional meeting be scheduled if we thought we needed more time to make the appropriate decisions.

## V. Bi-Annual Board of Directors Surveys

Committee Chair Francone discussed the process of the online Survey Monkey survey that is sent out to the Board on a bi-annual basis.  It was determined in the past that quarterly was to frequent and we were not getting valuable data.  In 2014 the survey was sent in April and October, but being slightly behind this year as a result of the General Manager Executive Search, we will prepare and send the survey in June and October.  Director Anderson mentioned it will be valuable information to have in finalizing the 2016 GM evaluation.
