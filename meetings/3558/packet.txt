2023 General Manager and CEO Performance Review
Planning

April 12, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Erik Davidson, Performance Committee Chair
BACKGROUND
During the February 15, 2023, Performance Committee meeting, committee members reached a
consensus that the processes for evaluating both the performance of the General Manager and Chief
Executive Officer (GM/CEO) and the performance of the agency itself could be improved.
The committee members agreed to review the following materials prior to the April 12, 2023, meeting of
the Performance Committee:
• The Strategic Plan adopted by the RTD Board of Directors on August 10, 2021 (Strategic Plan);
• The GM/CEO Employment Agreement entered into on September 29, 2020, and most recently
amended in the Fourth Amendment on October 26, 2022 (GM/CEO Agreement); and
• The Compensation Study Report completed by Gallagher Benefit Services, Inc. dated November
18, 2022 (“Compensation Analysis”).
Performance Committee members agreed to explore possible strategies and opportunities to enhance the
processes for evaluating both the performance of RTD and the performance of the GM/CEO.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this discussion item is for the Performance Committee in consultation with GM/CEO to:
• Discuss committee member takeaways from reviewing the Strategic Plan, GM/CEO Agreement,
and Compensation Analysis;
• Discuss and identify opportunities for improving the analysis of agency and GM/CEO
performance; and
• Identify necessary tasks and questions to address for pursuing performance analysis
improvements, including future meeting topics.
