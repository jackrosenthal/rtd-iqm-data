#### 1. Federal Liaison Services

It is recommended by the Government Relations Committee that the RTD Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to enter into an agreement for Federal Liaison Services with Squire Patton Boggs LLP for a one-year option at a cost of $270,000 (January 1 through December 31, 2018).  This action represents the fourth year of a five-year contract. Funding for this contract is included in the annual budget.

Motion:               Director Sisk made the motion to move this item to the full Board at the November 28, 2017 Board Meeting.

Director Williams seconded the motion.

Discussion:              Sherry Ellebracht, Government Relations Officer, provided the background on the Squire Patton Boggs (SBP) contract and stated that having the team in Washington D.C. allows them to constantly stay in touch with legislatures and other federal agencies that RTD deals with on a regular basis.  She noted that just this week, SPB sent a letter to Elaine Chao the Secretary of Transportation in regards to RTD’s application for the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant.  She added that Mike Dino and his SPB colleagues continue to keep RTD in the forefront of the congressional delegation and they are extremely important and valuable to RTD.

Director Folska commended SPB and stated that RTD needed the support in Washington D.C.

Director Walker supported the recommendation because SPB has supported RTD in keeping the legislative delegations in the loop.

Director Menten stated she would be a no vote

Committee Vice Chair Tisdale stated RTD could not achieve the same results without this team.

Committee Vice Chair Tisdale declared the motion PASSED.

#### 2. State Update - Brandeberry McKenna

Jennifer Brandeberry, Brandeberry McKenna (BBMK), followed up on the written report adding that the firm continued to schedule and coordinate meetings on behalf of the District with key legislators on a variety of subjects. She added that the firm provided an update on the G-Line and FasTracks to the following officials:

- Director of the Public Utilities Commission, Doug Dean

- Governor’s Director of Legislative Affairs, Kurt Morrison

- House Majority Leader KC Becker

- State Representative Paul Rosenthal

Ms. Brandeberry highlighted the following firm activities:

- Future meetings are scheduled with Representative Lebsock, Kraft Tharp, Gray, Garnett, Winter, Bridges, Covarrubias and Senator Martinez Humenik.

- During the September meeting of the Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) a bill draft was requested to implement a low-income transit fare reductions pilot program.

- BBMK continues to meet on behalf of RTD with the lobbyists and lawyers for Scientific and Cultural Facilities District (SCFD) and the Special Districts Association on potential legislative options to address the drafting error in SB267.

- RTD will be presenting to the TLRC on November 2nd at 10:15am and encouraged Board members to attend.

- BBMK organized a briefing on Public Private Partnerships to legislators and members of the Denver Metro Chamber Public Affairs Council. The briefing highlighted successful projects such as FasTracks and Denver Union Station.

Director Broom requested additional information on the marijuana tax marijuana tax issue and how the tax could be reinstated or reset up to a certain percentage.

Ms. Brandeberry stated that the firm could provide the legal analysis and the current status of that issue.

Director Folska commended BBMK for all of their work.

##### a. November Board Update

#### 3. Federal Update - Squire Patton Boggs

Mike Dino, SBP, followed up on the written report and said that his firm had assisted in receiving four delegate signatures from the Colorado House of Representatives (Buck, Coffman, DeGette, and Perlmutter) for RTD’s TIGER grant application.  He explained that the proposal was for $12.85 million which would fund the replacement of the light rail track and switches in the Denver central business district that was in need of heavy repair as it was the most utilized part of the light rail system.  Mr. Dino added that the new administration had released its tax legislation package and there were two elements which were surprising: they want to eliminate private activity bonds which funds a lot of public financing and they want to also eliminate public refinancing bonds which are used to secure lower interest rates.  He noted that this is currently in the House and is being argued in the Ways and Means Committee but the Senate is also working on their version and they tend to be more supportive of local and state activities.  He added that this package would also remove the deductibility of state and local taxes, which would not impact Colorado as much as the higher tax states.  He stated that the firm continues to press the issue for RTD’s refund of the $29 million credit risk premium associated with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) loan for Union Station and will continue to do so until it is refunded.  He further added that the 2018 appropriation budget may be extended past December 5, 2017 that may impact the full funding grant for the Eagle project.
