Subject:

Board Commitment to FasTracks Completion
and Peak Service Plan

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Chair of the Board of Directors, Doug Tisdale, by the Chair of the
Planning/Capital Programs, & FasTracks Committee, Judy Lubow, and by Directors Buzek, Guissinger,
Lewis, and Whitmore that the Board of Directors approve the attached Resolution No. _____, Series of
2019, Regarding RTD Board Commitment for Finishing FasTracks and Supporting the Peak Service Plan
for Northwest Rail, as presented to the Planning/Capital Programs & FasTracks Committee.
This recommendation is consistent with the General Manager’s 2019 Goals as follows:
 Core Goal #2 – Strong & Ethical Leadership;
 Core Goal #3 – Strong Financial Management;
 Core Goal #5 – Effective Communications & Community Outreach;
 Task Goal #3 – Ensure Fiscal Sustainability; and
 Task Goal #4 – Address Future Transportation Needs and Methods.
BACKGROUND
In 2004, the voters of the Regional Transportation District approved the FasTracks ballot initiative to
create a comprehensive rail and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its suburbs, with an
expected completion date of 2017 for the entire project. For a number of substantial reasons, some of
which are noted in the resolution, project completion did not occur in 2017. It is expected that by 2020,
approximately 70% of the project’s mileage will be completed. This will leave several sections of the
project not yet funded nor finished.
DISCUSSION
The proposed resolution is appropriate and beneficial because it has been 15 years since the passage of
the FasTracks initiative, several corridors remain unfunded and unfinished, and the voters and taxpayers
deserve assurance that the project is not being forgotten. The resolution will express the Board’s
acknowledgement of RTD’s legal responsibility to complete the unfinished FasTracks corridors and its
intention to do so in as expeditious a manner as possible.
Addressing the financial challenges facing RTD in completing this task, the resolution expresses the
Board’s directives to staff to investigate reasonable cost saving measures and to propose funding
mechanisms to construct and operate the unfinished FasTracks corridors, with a report of steps taken to
appropriately move forward to be provided within two months. Further addressing financial challenges,
the resolution also dictates that staff explore, fund, and facilitate construction and operation of a cost
saving measure for the unfinished Northwest Rail that is presently being evaluated by staff and
stakeholders – the Peak Service Plan. A report outlining proposed steps to appropriately move forward
with this Plan will also be required and submitted within two months.

RESOLUTION NO. __________, SERIES OF 2019
REGARDING RTD BOARD
COMMITMENT FOR FINISHING FASTRACKS
AND SUPPORTING THE PEAK SERVICE PLAN FOR
NORTHWEST RAIL
WHEREAS, the citizens of the Regional Transportation District
(“RTD”) passed a ballot initiative in 2004 to tax themselves to create a
comprehensive train and bus rapid transit project connecting Denver and its
suburbs (“FasTracks Program”), with an intended completion date of 2017
for the full project; and
WHEREAS, the full FasTracks Program was not completed in 2017,
with the current expectation being that approximately 70% of the project
mileage will be completed by 2020; and
WHEREAS, several corridors and extensions included in the
FasTracks Program have not been completed by the date of this Resolution,
nor have funds for their completion been identified or committed, namely, the
Northwest and the North Metro corridors, and the Central and the Southwest
Extensions (collectively, the “Unfinished Corridors”); and
WHEREAS, it remains the uncompromising intention of the RTD
Board to comply fully with and to fulfill the obligations created in the
FasTracks Program passed by the District voters in 2004 in as expeditious a
manner as possible; and
WHEREAS, the RTD Board has always acknowledged that these
FasTracks obligations are the expressed will of the electorate and that RTD is
required to comply therewith, which acknowledgement was previously
expressed, inter alia, in RTD Board Resolution No. 004, Series of 2011
(“Concerning a 2011 FasTracks Election”); and
WHEREAS, a variety of factors created substantial changes and
challenges and increased capital costs in the FasTracks Program following the
2004 voter approval of said Program, which factors included, inter alia, (a)
the requirement that new technology, including Positive Train Control and
new signal systems and commuter rail cars, be employed; (b) the decision that

all but one of the trains be electric-powered rather than diesel-powered; (c)
additional EIS and local government drainage and traffic requirements; (d) an
increase in right-of-way acquisition costs; (e) significantly increased costs for
construction materials; and (f) the great recession of 2008-2009; and
WHEREAS, while acknowledging the financial challenges, RTD will
not abdicate its responsibility to complete the Unfinished Corridors as
expeditiously as possible in a commercially reasonable manner, and to that
end, the RTD Board expresses its unqualified commitment to and promotion
of fiscally responsible actions intended to facilitate and effectuate the
construction of all the Unfinished Corridors; and
WHEREAS, in regard to one of the unfinished Corridors, staff from
jurisdictions along the Northwest Rail Corridor and from RTD have been
investigating the construction and operation of an interim commuter startup
service (the “Peak Service Plan or “Plan”) along the unfinished portion of
the Northwest Corridor as a means of providing service to the Corridor in the
quickest manner possible; and
WHEREAS, the Peak Service Plan would provide rush hour service to
the presently unfinished portion of the Northwest Corridor, including three
trains from Longmont to Denver (and stations in between) in the morning
rush hour period, and three trains going from Denver to Longmont (and
stations in between) in the evening rush hour.
NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
1. The RTD Board expresses its continued commitment to the
completion of all the Unfinished Corridors, directing RTD staff to investigate
and research all reasonable cost-saving measures for construction and
operation of the Unfinished Corridors and creative funding mechanisms for
the same as expeditiously as reasonably possible, with a report to the Board
within two months following adoption of this Resolution outlining proposed
steps to appropriately move forward on these Unfinished Corridors.
2. In regard to the Unfinished Corridors, the RTD Board acknowledges
and appreciates the value and potential of phased approaches and partnerships
such as the Peak Service Plan to bring interim service to the remaining

pricing information from Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad as
expeditiously as possible, with a report to the Board within two months
following adoption of this Resolution outlining proposed steps appropriately
moving forward on the Plan.
3. The RTD Board instructs the General Manager and CEO, through
staff, to communicate and publicize this Resolution to all stakeholders,
interested parties, the media and the public in general by appropriate means.

Local Government Relations Update

Below is our update for April 2019:
1. Metro Mayors Caucus (MMC) – The next full Caucus meeting is Wednesday, April 3
from 7:30-10 AM at the Denver Metro Chamber of Commerce, 1445 Market St. The
agenda includes updates on what is happening at the legislature, the efforts of the
Regional Air Quality Council, and the latest on the efforts being undertaken by the
MMC’s Transportation and Housing Committees. There also will be updates on local
ballot issues that could have wider implications for the region.
2. Denver Municipal Elections – Denver will hold its municipal election for mayor and all
13 city council districts on May 7. There are six candidates for mayor, three candidates
for Clerk & Recorder and 71 candidates for city council (district and at-large). Council
members Kevin Flynn, Jolon Clark and Paul Kashmann are unopposed and will be
returning to council. Also, on the ballot is Initiative 300, the Right to Survive, which
would allow individuals to engage in activities, such as resting and sheltering oneself in a
non-obstructive manner, in outdoor public places.
3. Colorado Municipal League (CML) Conference – The CML Summer conference is
June 18-21 in Breckenridge. I believe this conference provides a valuable opportunity for
RTD Board Members to interact with local elected officials in a more casual setting. If
you will be attending part or all of the conference, I am happy to help schedule one-onone meeting with elected officials and staff during the week. CRL will be hosting a
dinner on Tuesday, June 18 from 6:30-9 p.m. Please let me know if you and a guest
would like to attend.

2.C.2.a

2.C.2.b

This memo outlines potential impacts to City operations should Initiative 300 on the May 2019
municipal ballot become law. The proposed ordinance would grant broad rights for people to
shelter themselves from the elements in public spaces, including parks, sidewalks in front of
private businesses and homes, and the 16th Street Mall. The following ordinances are intended
to be superseded if the measure is adopted:
• Unauthorized Camping Ordinance
• Sit/Lie Ordinance
• Trespassing on public property
• Park curfew laws
• Health regulations
• Park permits
• Refusing to show identification
The measure also would potentially create new civil and criminal liability and legal causes of
action against private individuals, homeowners, businesses, city employees and city
government. This likely would create a chilling effect for police officers, park rangers, health
inspectors and others to enforce laws and may make them reluctant to assist those in need.
If the measure passes, it will be the first of its kind. While jurisdictions such as Rhode Island,
Puerto Rico, Illinois and Connecticut have passed Homeless Bills of Rights, this measure differs.
It explicitly overrides existing laws and makes it a crime for law enforcement agencies or other
entities to violate the rights established by the measure.
Parks & Recreation Impacts
•

Park curfews, which have been in existence in Denver for over a century, would no longer be
enforceable. Nor would ordinances that prohibit overnight camping or setting up of tents and
structures in parks.

•

Permitted events in parks often require a park to be cleared for set-up activities and to establish
limited access points for safety and crowd management. This ordinance could render it
impossible for a permitted event operator to manage the space for their event.

•

Closing areas of parks for turf, trees and landscaping to rest, restore and regenerate would be
prohibited.

•

There would be additional costs for maintaining and repairing parks, trails and open spaces
impacted by uncontrolled use.

•

The City’s mountain parks also would be impacted by the proposal.

Initiative 300 Potential Impacts

2.C.2.b

Human Services Impacts
•

The ordinance would make it unlawful to “harass” anyone exercising a right to shelter
themselves in public. The ordinance does not provide a clear definition of harassment, which
may lead social workers, co-responders, outreach staff, peer navigators and others to limit their
interactions with those needing services.

•

Similarly, the Police Department’s Homeless Outreach Team may curtail interactions with
individuals in need of services to avoid accusations of harassment.

•

The ordinance would grant significant privacy rights to personal belongings. DPD may not be
able to investigate the contents of potentially dangerous items left in the public right of way
without a warrant, such as an unattended tent or a backpack at the airport or a bus stop.

Public Health & Environment Impacts
•

Charitable food service operations – while well-intentioned – have the potential to impact the
public health and environment. The initiative could tie the city’s hands in addressing unsafe
food, litter, rodent infestations and other risks.

•

The ordinance may limit actions that can be taken to abate public and environmental health
nuisances in encampments on public or private property. This could include efforts to address
public health threats such as Hepatitis A, rodents, feces, urine, trash and discarded needles.

Public Works Impacts
•

The ordinance would enable individuals to set up tents in a non-obstructive manner on
sidewalks, alleys and streets, so long as the right-of-way is not completely “impassable.” This
may impede access for people with disabilities, with no means for the city to clear obstructions.

•

The ordinance would make it more difficult for city officials to remove individuals sheltering
themselves within public infrastructure assets such as bridges and storm-water drains.

•

The ordinance would make it difficult for Public Works staff and contractors to remove
abandoned or discarded trash from the right-of-way because of the initiative’s language
regarding rights to privacy of belongings.

•

Existing permit regulations that allow permitted encroachment and use of rights of way (e.g.
permits to allow for outside dining patio space at a restaurant) may be impacted and prevent
those with permits from managing that permitted space as they desire.

•

As with Parks, there will be new cost implications for maintaining and protecting city assets that
would be impacted by use other than as intended.

General Services Impacts
•

City staff would be limited in ability to close and protect outdoor public assets like the grounds
of the City and County Building under this ordinance. There are likely cost implications for
additional maintenance and repairs if assets are improperly used or overused.

Legal Conflicts
•
•
•

Attempts to create civil rights outside of the US Constitution
Attempts to trump any conflicting state laws (which can’t be preempted by city law)
Creates a confusing enforcement system in which the city could be both the plaintiff and the
defendant in civil suits.

BBMK continues to monitor and actively track a number of bills on behalf of RTD.
To review the full list of legislation that BBMK is tracking on behalf of the District click here:
https://www.statebillinfo.com/SBI/index.cfm?fuseaction=Public.Dossier&id=25636&pk=114
Last week the Joint Budget Committee closed out of the 2018-19 long bill. Highlights of the
budget include $185 million for full-day kindergarten, $30 million for transportation, $40 million
for legislative bills, and $3.9 million to increase provider rates for mental health providers. On
Monday the long bill (budget bill) was introduced in the Senate. The members of the Senate will
caucus on the long bill Tuesday, conduct Second Reading on Wednesday and Third Reading on
Thursday. The budget will then be taken up in the House of Representatives the week of April
1, 2019.
Highlights of legislative activity this week are as follows:
HB19-1073 Law Enforcement Information Sharing Grant Program sponsored by Rep.
Benavidez and Senator Fields. This bill creates the Law Enforcement, Public Safety, and
Criminal Justice Information Sharing Grant Program. The bill is in House Appropriations.
HB19-1199 Colorado Clean Pass Act sponsored by Rep. A Valdez and Senators Pettersen and
Winter. Beginning on July 1, 2022 the bill would require the high-performance transportation
enterprise (HPTE) to impose an express lane access fee in a specified amount annually at the
time of registration of any eligible plug-in electric motor vehicle that weights 19,500 pound or
less, that is certified as being qualified for a federal plug-in electric drive motor vehicle tax
credit. The bill is scheduled for action only on Monday April 1st in the House Finance
Committee.
HB19-1245 Affordable Housing Funding from Vendor fee Changes sponsored by Rep.
Weissman and Senator Gonzales. The bill proposes to fund affordable housing by increasing the
vendor fee. The bill only alters the State vendor fee allowance and currently has no fiscal impact
to the District. The bill is scheduled in House Finance on April 1st at 1:30pm in the Old State
Library.

To:

SB19-085 Equal Pay for Equal Work Act sponsored by Senators Danielson and Pettersen and
Reps. Buckner and Gonzales-Gutierrez. The bill would modify existing sex-based wage
discrimination law and create new provisions regarding transparency in wages in promotion.
The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee with several amendments to address some of the
stakeholders’ concerns. There were seven amendments adopted:
• Adding consideration of shift differential to the definition of substantially similar work
• Including several additional justifications for wage differential, including geographic
location, education, training, and travel to the extent that are reasonably related to the
work in question
• Eliminating a reposting requirement that would have mandated that if an employer is
unable to fill a position at the posted wage rate, it would have to re-publish the job
opening at a new rate before hiring for the position
• Striking a provision that would have presumed bad faith on the part of an employer who
did not appropriately maintain employment records and clarified that liquidated damages
will not be awarded for good faith violations of the law
• Limiting back pay to three years
• Delaying the effective date of the Act until January 1, 2021
SB19-085 is waiting to be scheduled in the Senate Appropriations Committee.
SB19-012 Use of Mobile Electronic Devices While Driving sponsored by Senator Court. The
bill makes using a mobile electronic device while driving a class 2 misdemeanor and creates a
class 1 misdemeanor traffic offense for any subsequent offense. This bill was amended in the
Senate Transportation and Energy Committee to address concerns with the penalties and
redefinition of texting while driving. Amendment 10 (a strike below amendment) allows
individuals to use their phone in an emergency, to activate or deactivate handsfree settings (one
hand only), or if the vehicle is at rest. The first penalty was changed to a Class A traffic
violation. The first infraction is now $50 and increases for each occurrence. The fine amount
may be decreased at the judge’s discretion. Texting remains a higher offense. No seizure of
mobile devices is authorized. BBMK was successful in getting an amendment on to protect RTD
transit related communications. The bill was introduced in the House and assigned to the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
SB19-188 FAMLI Family Medical Leave Insurance Program sponsored by Senators Winter
and Williams and Reps. Gray and Duran. The bill creates the family and medical leave
insurance program and the Division of Family and Medical Leave Insurance in the Department
of Labor and Employment to provide partial wage replacement benefits to an eligible individual
who takes leave from work for certain reasons outlined in the bill. Each employee and employer
in the state will pay one-half of the cost of the premium as specified in the bill. The premium is
based on a percentage of the employee’s yearly wages. The premiums are deposited into the
family and medical leave insurance fund and the family and medical leave benefits are paid to
eligible individuals from the fund. The Division is established as an enterprise, and premiums
paid into the fund are not considered state revenues for the purpose of the taxpayer’s bill of
rights (TABOR). The bill was amended in the Senate Business Labor and Technology

Committee and the bill passed with eight amendments. The amendments included a discount
on the contribution obligation for public entities & smallest employers; cap on contribution
requirement; enforcement of worker complaints against employer to be investigated by the
Division prior to the filing of a private right of action and allowing workers to collect benefits
while appealing an adverse determination of benefits. The bill was heard in the Senate
Finance Committee this week and after seven hours of testimony the bill was laid over for
action only. SB19-188 will not be heard next week as the Senate will be debating the Long
Bill.
The Speaker introduced two-debrucing measures this week, HB19-1257 Voter Approval to
Retain Revenue for Education and Transportation and HB19-1258 Allocate Voter approved
Revenue for Education and Transportation. Rep. McCluskie, Senator Priola and Senator Court
are the co-sponsors of the bill. These two bills have been calendared in the House State Affairs
Committee on March 31st at 1:30 pm in LSB-A.
The PUC Sunset bill was heard in the Senate Transportation and Energy Committee last week.
The bill was initially rescheduled for committee actin this week but due to the long bill debate it
will likely be heard in April.

Federal Update for April 2, 2019, Meeting of Communications & Government
Relations Committee

RTD Board Members, CEO, and Senior Staff Advocate for Agency Priorities in Washington
Several members of RTD’s Board of Directors and senior staff traveled to Washington, D.C. for the
annual American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Legislative Conference. During their
visit, Board members and senior staff had a very successful three days of meetings with FTA Acting
Administrator Jane Williams, RTD’s Congressional delegation staff, and authorizing and
appropriations committee staff to discuss RTD’s priorities. These priorities included the return of
RTD’s CRP on the Denver Union Station RRIF loan and a modification of the BRT definition to
include projects with shared-use lanes.
Federal Transit Administration
RTD’s Board members, CEO Dave Genova, and staff met with FTA Acting Administrator Jane
Williams to discuss updates on the A and G lines, as well as the Southeast Extension grand opening
and the successful transit oriented development surrounding the Denver Union Station project. Also
discussed was RTD’s Autonomous Vehicle bus route and FlexRide. Acting Administrator Williams
was impressed with the FlexRide program, and asked for additional information. She referred to the
Denver Union Station project as one of the great successes of the RRIF loan program.
Colorado Congressional Delegation
Board members and CEO Dave Genova met with staffers from the offices of Senators Bennet and
Gardner and Representatives Buck, Neguse, DeGette, Perlmutter, and Crow. The meetings focused
on project updates, as well as requests for help with the return of RTD’s RRIF CRP and a
modification of the BRT definition. The staffers were all interested in helping RTD with both of
these requests, and several offices asked for an appropriations request regarding the RRIF CRP.
SPB is working with RTD to develop appropriations requests for the delegation.

Federal Update

2.C.4.a

RTD’s Board members, CEO, and staff also met with transportation authorizing and appropriations
committee staff in the House and Senate to provide project updates and advocate for the return of
RTD’s RRIF CRP and a modification of the BRT definition in the CIG program. House
appropriations staff appear willing to assist with our efforts to secure a RRIF fix, and Senate
appropriations staff explained the high hurdles to securing legislation to expedite the return of any
RRIF CRP. When briefed on our proposed change to the BRT definition, House Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee staff noted that congestion pricing has lost favor with Chairman
DeFazio, and explained that equity concerns with managed lanes may prove a barrier to advancing
RTD’s proposed BRT change.
Senate Banking Roundtable
RTD CEO Dave Genova spoke at a roundtable hosted by Senate Banking Committee
transportation staff. Along with CEOs from LA Metro, the Chicago Transit Authority, and other
large or legacy transit systems, Dave presented on RTD’s major projects and new initiatives and
requested the Committee’s help and support on our RRIF CRP issue. Generally, the CEOs all
agreed that increasing Federal funding is crucial to the advancement of public transportation, not
only to further expand service but to maintain existing infrastructure in a state of good repair.
Squire Patton Boggs Legislative Briefing
RTD’s Board members, CEO, and staff met with the SPB team and former House Transportation
and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster to discuss the current Federal transportation
landscape. Chairman Shuster advocated for an increase in the gas tax as a short-term solution to the
HTF’s chronic revenue shortfall, with a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) program eventually becoming
the primary source of Federal funding. Chairman Shuster provided additional insights into the
possibility of a large-scale infrastructure package passing during this Congress.
Electric Bus/Clean Transportation Meeting
RTD’s Board members, CEO, and staff met with Dan Raudebaugh (Center for Transportation and
the Environment), Erik Bigelow (Center for Transportation and the Environment), and Lisa Jerram
(APTA) to discuss zero and low emission transit technologies and Federal funding opportunities.
Relatedly, on March 18, FTA announced the availability of FY 2019 Low or No Emission
Competitive funding. These grants allow states and local governmental authorities to purchase or
lease zero or low-emission transit buses and related infrastructure and facilities. For FY 2019, $85
million dollars is available, and applications are due May 14. Dan Raudebauch explained that transit
agencies that partnered with CTE on grant applications for electric buses were 4 to 5 times more
likely to receive grant awards than agencies that did not work with CTE.
Eno Center for Transportation Meeting
RTD’s Board members, CEO, and staff met with senior staff from the Eno Center for
Transportation and former U.S. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to discuss new mobility
opportunities. Topics discussed included the possibility of an upcoming infrastructure bill,
autonomous vehicles, alternative fuels, BRT, and the RRIF CRP issue.
