1.B.1.a

Sampling Methodology
Sampling: a standard practice used to draw conclusions about a broader
population
•

Customer Excellence Survey – understand satisfaction/perception for
the entire customer base through responses from a smaller subset of
customers

•

Community Value Survey - understand overall community perception
through feedback from a segment of the total population

Packet Pg. 16

Attachment: RTD Strategic Priority Survey Process_20210824 (4562 : Customer Excellence/NPS Baseline

1.B.1.a

Sampling Methodology
Customer Excellence Survey – Fixed Route/Rail
•

Sample based on 6-8 weeks’ ridership data*

•

Determine number of customers needed to reflect the target population
with a 95% confidence level

•

Surveys proportioned by time-of-day, day-of-week and route to ensure a
representative sample

•

Use of a 3rd party survey team: surveyors intercept participants on buses
and trains
- Every 4th customer intercepted
- Eliminates potential bias; true representation of customer base

*Ridership proportions calculated for fixed route and rail lines separately

any responses that may be incomplete or unacceptable

• Straight lining (e.g., always selecting the first response)
• Creating a pattern with responses
• Unrealistic completion times
• Gibberish in open text questions
• Creating fake answers
• Inconsistently answering consistency check questions
• Selecting all checkboxes
• Selecting only a single checkbox
