Authorization

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Financial Administration and Audit Committee that the Board of Directors
approve the attached Bank Account Signature Authorization Agreement (the “Agreement”).
BACKGROUND:
Wells Fargo, as the District’s commercial bank, requires prompt notification of all modifications in the
authorized signatories on the District’s various bank accounts. In order to reflect any changes in District
personnel and the election of new Board officers, the Agreement is updated at least annually and
periodically as otherwise required.
DISCUSSION:
The attached recommended Agreement has been modified from the previously approved Agreement to
reflect the newly elected Board officers and the temporary replacement of the vacant Chief Financial
Officer position with the Controller. The Controller’s signature authority will be replaced with the Chief
Financial Officer upon the position being filled and Board approval for Agreement modification will be
requested at that time.
ALTERNATIVES:
1.

Adopt the attached Agreement. This is the recommended action.

2.

Modify the attached Agreement.

3.

Do not adopt the attached Agreement. This is not the recommended action because it could
delay the authorization of payment approvals to meet the District’s obligations.

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
This recommended Board action poses no financial impact to the District.

Selection of Location for Posting of Board
Notice

RECOMMENDED ACTION
The RTD Board of Directors designates the entry way of the RTD administrative office at 1600 Blake
Street as its official location for posting of notices of all public meetings in 2015 as required by C.R.S.
24-6-402(2)(c). In addition, to the maximum extent feasible, notices of public meetings will be posted
on RTD’s website.
BACKGROUND
Section 32-9-116 of the RTD Act requires all meetings of the Board to be held within the district and
open to the public. No business of the Board shall be transacted except at a regular or special meeting
at which a quorum consisting of at least a majority of the total membership of the Board is present.
C.R.S. 24-6-402(2)(c) of the Colorado Open Meetings Law provides definition of what constitutes an
open meeting and the process for notification. Article IV, section 5b of the Board Bylaws states notices
of all meetings shall be posted at least twenty-four hours in the public place designated annually by the
Board for the posting of notices prior to the holding of a meeting in the public place.
The purpose of this Board action is to designate the official posting site for notices of all public meetings
in 2015.

Station Naming Plan for U.S. 36 Bus Rapid
Transit

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that the Board of Directors accept and
approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station Naming Plan, codifying final name and
nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

BACKGROUND
This action meets the 2015 RTD General Manager goals of Advancing/Completing FasTracks and
Improving Service Delivery. In advance of the opening of the U.S. 36 BRT, staff recommends the
following modifications to the existing naming and nomenclature of the corridor stops, consistent with
the RTD Board Station Naming Policy (attached). Establishing the names will allow the project team to
move forward with the sign fabrication and installation to coincide with the completion of the station
work in fall 2015. There are two components to this staff recommendation: first, to change the
nomenclature for the boarding areas and second, a change to the names for two stop locations in the
corridor. The U.S. 36 BRT Station Naming Plan was discussed with the U.S. 36 stakeholder group on
November 25, 2014, and there was general consensus and support from the stakeholders for the
recommendations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename BRT stops “stations”
Staff recommends referring to the BRT passenger boarding areas “stations” to remain consistent with
RTD practice on other rapid transit lines, which happen to currently be rail technology.
Station names are recognized destinations for RTD patrons. This enables travelers to easily identify
station locations and destinations, and to efficiently complete trips. RTD’s standard naming protocol
defines the name of a station, Park-n-Ride (PnR) or transfer center based on its geographic location.
Along U.S. 36, these names have historically been based either on the nearest major road such as
Church Ranch Boulevard, Flatiron Crossing Drive/96th Street, McCaslin Boulevard and Table Mesa Drive,
or on locations such as Broomfield and Westminster Center. These names have been used on plans, fact
sheets and the RTD web site.
In the past year, the stations along the U.S. 36 highway have had “U.S. 36” added to their names: U.S.
36•Westminster Center, U.S. 36•Church Ranch, U.S. 36•Broomfield, U.S. 36•Flatiron and U.S.
36•McCaslin.

Packet Pg. 12

2.B.1

Staff is recommending name changes for two of the U.S. 36 stations.
Staff Recommendation: Rename Table Mesa Station to U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station
Staff recommends renaming the Table Mesa Station to the U.S. 36•Table Mesa Station for both clarity
and consistency with the standard naming protocols. There are several PnR’s along Table Mesa. The one
associated with the U.S. 36 BRT should be denoted as such by following the same naming convention
as the other BRT stations in the corridor by having U.S. 36 as part of the name.
Staff Recommendation: Rename U.S. 36•Westminster to U.S. 36•Sheridan Station
Staff recommends renaming the U.S. 36•Westminster Center Station to the U.S. 36•Sheridan Station.
When stations and transit centers have the same or similar names it can be confusing. For instance, the
new station for the Northwest Rail Line is under construction and will be called the Westminster Station.
Having a Westminster Station and a Westminster Center Station will lead to additional confusion. By
renaming the Westminster Center Station as the “U.S. 36•Sheridan” Station, it will be named based on
its geographical location. It is easily recognizable and makes sense to the customer.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD has already established a project budget in the FasTracks program to place new signage at the
stations for the implementation of the new BRT service. Any changes to the station naming will be
incorporated into this effort. It is expected that these all of the recommended changes can be done
within the established budget.
ALTERNATIVES
1. Accept the Recommended Action. It is recommended by the FasTracks Monitoring Committee that
the Board of Directors accept and approve the proposed U.S. 36 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Station
Naming Plan, codifying final name and nomenclature changes for the U.S. 36 BRT Line as follows:
a.
b.
c.
d.

Boarding locations shall be referred to as “stations” for U.S. 36 BRT.
The current U.S. 36•Westminster Center station shall be renamed to US 36•Sheridan station.
The current Table Mesa station shall be renamed to U.S. 36•Table Mesa station.
All other station names shall remain the same as existing (U.S. 36•Church Ranch; U.S.
36•Broomfield; U.S. 36•Flatiron; and U.S. 36•McCaslin)

2. Do not accept the Recommended Action. Instead, leave the names as is. This is not recommended as
the Table Mesa station name would not be consistent with the other BRT station names in the
corridor. Also, it would not address the issue of multiple stations in Westminster. Additionally, if the
passenger boarding areas are continued to be called “stops,” it would not be consistent with the RTD
practice of calling passenger boarding areas “stations” for RTD’s rapid transit lines.

Subject:

Sale of 1,384 Square Feet of RTD Property at
Yale Station

RECOMMENDED ACTION
It is recommended by the Planning and Development Committee that the Board of Directors authorize
the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents necessary to sell
approximately 1,384 square feet of real property located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of
Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing, LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
BACKGROUND:
This action meets the 2015 General Manager goal of Fiscal Sustainability. The property was acquired in
December 2003 as part of the T-REX project and consisted of 46,255 square feet of vacant land at
5281 E. Yale Circle and a two level 12,600 square foot office building located on 16,614 square feet.
An eminent domain process resulting in a Certificate of Ascertainment and Report of Commissioners
issued after a three day Commission Hearing to determine value of the property acquired from Walter A.
Koebel in RTD v. Walter A. Koelbel, et al Case No. 01-CV-2025, District Court, City and County of
Denver resulted in RTD’s ownership of the property. The vacant land was determined to have a value of
$18.00 per square foot. The property was used for the development of the Yale Station and associated
park-n-Ride.
In 2011, Koelbel and Company, Mile High Development and the Urban Land Conservancy with support
from RTD developed a Transit-Oriented Master Plan for the Yale Station area including parcels of land
owned by each of the aforementioned parties.
DISCUSSION:
The Urban Land Conservancy and Yale Station Workforce Housing LLC, a joint venture of Koelbel and
Company and Mile High Development desire to acquire approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
from RTD to support their development of the Yale Station Family Apartments consisting of 66
affordable, income-restricted housing units in a four story multi-family building. Yale Station Family
Apartments will be constructed immediately west of the existing Yale Station park and ride on land
purchased from the Urban Land Conservancy through the Denver TOD Fund. Yale Station Family
Apartments will reserve 3 three-bedroom units, 18 two-bedroom units, and 45 one-bedroom units for
families earning 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of the area median income (AMI).
RTD’s sale of this small piece of undeveloped property supports the development and demonstrates
RTD’s support and cooperation in the development of transit oriented development and affordable
housing. In addition to receipt of revenue from the sale of the property, RTD has the benefit of
increased ridership at this location.
The property was appraised by Barrett D. Johnson, MAI, SRA and Brad A. Weiman, MAI, FRICS of
Integra Realty Resources in Denver in November of 2014. The property appraised at $18.79 per square
foot.

Packet Pg. 25

3.B.1

FINANCIAL IMPACT:
RTD will receive purchase price at closing, however, the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) between
RTD and CDOT related to acquisition of property required for the T-REX Project provided that the cost of
acquiring property would be shared on a 50/50 basis and the disposition of any property would be
shared on the same basis.
ALTERNATIVES:
1. Accept the recommended action.
It is recommended by the Planning and Development
Committee that the Board of Directors authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate
and execute all documents necessary to sell approximately 1,384 square feet of real property
located generally at Yale Circle, City and County of Denver to Yale Station Workforce Housing,
LLC for $26,000.00 or $18.79 per square foot.
2. Do not authorize the General Manager or his designee to negotiate and execute all documents
necessary to sell 1,384 square feet of real property.

Weekly Update

The 2015 Legislative Session will begin on January 7th. This session will start with several new
legislators and a change in balance of power in the Senate.
Brandeberry McKenna in preparation for the legislative session has met with the Senate and
House Transportation Chairs, Leadership and new members to continue to educate them on
issues of importance to RTD. Once the session begins we will reach out to Board Members to
schedule key meetings with leadership and new members to continue to build relationships
within the House and the Senate.
On the legislative front there is bi-partisan support from the House and Senate Transportation
Chairs for keeping whole the SB09-228 funding for transportation. Although the projections for
this revenue have decreased both Chairs have pledged to keep whole the portion that is pledged
for Transportation. Several issues will be revisited again this session: a P3 bill from Rep. Kraft
Tharp and Senator Matt Jones, Construction Defect Legislation by Senator Ulibarri and Rep.
Singer and seven bills related to workforce development. As soon as drafts of these bills become
available BBMK will share them with the Board.
We look forward to working with the Board and as always if you need anything from us please
contact Jenifer (303-638-4420) or Julie (303-898-8494).
