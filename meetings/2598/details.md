RECOMMENDED ACTION

No action required, for information only. The following service change proposal will be taken to the public for review and comment.

DISCUSSION

To meet the diverse travel needs of the citizens of the District and maintain a high-performance, sustainable transit system, RTD has developed a networked family of services for which the different classes of service have different expectations of performance.  We will continue adjusting services in response to changes in ridership and operational performance of the transit system as a whole. It is also our responsibility to identify services that are underperforming and recommend modifications, curtailment or cancellation of service as warranted. The proposals herein include a mix of service improvements, adjustments and reductions. A notable modification to Light Rail operations in the Central and Southwest Corridors is proposed in the creation of L Line service plan. Additionally, bus stop consolidation efforts aimed at optimizing bus stop spacing, thereby improving operational speed and reliability are proposed for Routes 40, 105 and services along the Broadway/Lincoln Corridor. Based upon current and past ridership performance a number of services will have minor service reductions.  The Route 46 - South Dahlia will see the largest reduction in early morning and late evening periods.  We will monitor customer response to the implementation of these service changes and propose adjustments and service alternatives as appropriate in future service change recommendations.

The guiding principles for proposed service changes continue to be:

- Service performance evaluation based on the RTD Service Standards;

- The effects on the overall integrity of the transit network and on transit dependent markets;

- The availability of alternative services to affected riders;

- Cost-effective distribution throughout the District and Family of Services and the ability to enhance service when possible;

- Title VI of the Civil Rights Act: benefits and services are provided without regard to race, color or national origin; also disparate effects on low income and minority populations; and

- Response to changes in the communities where services are provided
