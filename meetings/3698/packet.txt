BACKGROUND
RTD leverages the services of professional lobbyists to advocate on behalf of the agency and to stay
apprised of events unfolding at all levels of government.
RTD’s current federal lobbying services contract with Squire Patton Boggs, LLP, was executed on
December 19, 2019, for an initial term of three years. An amendment to the contract in December 2022
added two option years, which were subsequently executed. The current contract will conclude on
December 31, 2024.
DISCUSSION
In seeking to obtain the services of a qualified federal lobbying services consultancy, RTD strives to
meet the Strategic Priorities of Community Value and Financial Success.
Procuring the services of a federal lobbying consultancy will serve to accomplish several tasks related to
RTD’s annual Legislative and Government Relations Program and other tasks to advance the interests of
the agency at the federal level. Staff seeks to issue a competitive solicitation in order to secure a
contract for federal lobbying services to commence no later than January 1, 2025.
A summary of the work to be performed is as follows:
SCOPE OF WORK SUMMARY
The selected consultant will:
• Monitor and report on activities within the congressional and the executive branch offices that are
of concern/interest to RTD during regularly scheduled calls and meetings throughout the year

Communication with Staff and Clerical Matters

Regarding

September 19, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt amendments to the Board Operating Guidelines regarding
communication with staff and additional substantive and copy edits.

REPRESENTATIVES
Erik Davidson, Chair
Peggy Catlin, First-Vice Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
To ensure a healthy working relationship founded on effective communication, the Board developed the
Operating Guidelines to inform its working relationships between Directors and staff. Likewise, in
consultation with senior staff, the Board Office has developed the agency response system to track
Director inquiries and ensure those inquiries receive appropriate and timely follow-up.
The Board has acted on several occasions via resolution to provide additional guidance to Directors on
expectations for their communication with staff and requests of staff for information. These previous
actions have set expectations for Directors to communicate respectfully with staff and set limits on the
amount of time staff should spend on a given Director's request. Those resolutions are attached to this
Recommended Action: 1986 Resolution 2—Board Reports, 1996 Resolution 24—Board and Public
Requests, and 1999 Resolution 5—Regarding Verbal Abuse.
During the June 20, 2024, Executive Committee meeting, Directors provided feedback to Chair
Davidson and First-Vice Chair Catlin on the themes, concepts, and guidelines they wish to see included
in a new section of the Board’s Operating Guidelines regarding communication with staff. Chair
Davidson then drafted and received feedback from First-Vice Chair Catlin, the General Manager and CEO
(GM/CEO), and the Board Office on proposed amendments to the Board Operating Guidelines. The
Executive Committee members then discussed the proposed amendments during the July 25, 2024,
committee meeting.

Packet Pg. 7

1.3.B

DISCUSSION
Staff is presenting this item as a Recommended Action for the Committee’s and Board’s consideration
during the September 2024 meeting cycle.
The proposed amendments to the Operating Guidelines create a new section in the Board’s Operating
Guidelines, “Regarding Communication with Staff.” This section establishes the principles and values
Directors should adhere to when communicating with staff and provides guidelines around the process
Directors should follow to address their RTD-related inquiries. The amendments also propose some
additional clerical changes.
The amendments seek to incorporate RTD's organizational values of Passion, Respect, Diversity,
Trustworthiness, Collaboration, and Ownership as principles and values the Board expects Directors to
uphold in their interactions with staff.
The amendments further clarify expectations for Directors to work with the GM/CEO, the Board Office,
and the General Counsel within the existing agency response system to seek answers to inquiries.
Additionally, the proposed amendments call for the Executive Committee to review data from the agency
response system semiannually to understand better and raise awareness around the volume and nature
of requests made by Directors to staff.
Ultimately, these amendments will further clarify the Board’s expectations of Directors and assist the
Board and individual Directors in maintaining a healthy and functional working relationship with
management and staff.
This discussion aligns with Community Value and Employee Ownership as the ability of the Board to
effectively seek information and productively interact with staff impacts the value RTD provides to the
community and the capacity for employees to take ownership of their work product.
In addition, this recommended action calls for additional substantive and copy edits, which can be
reviewed in the attached redlined version.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact arising from the Board amending its Operating Guidelines.

RTD BOARD OPERATING GUIDELINES
LAST UPDATED: SEPTMEBER 24, 2024
BOARD COMMITMENT
Our Board is committed to public transit and the strategic goals of the Regional Transportation
District. In meeting this commitment, we appreciate that the Board adds the greatest value when
it focuses on and helps clarify policy issues and plans, including the policies that underpin capital
and operating budgets. In setting policies and plans, the Board must understand the vision and
mission of RTD and its immediate and future priority objectives for coming years as well as the
long-term strategic plan. The Board appreciates that it must position RTD to be able to respond
flexibly, effectively, and transparently to unique factors as they present, including the current
organizational shift in focus from capital development to operations and maintenance with the
exception of identifying suitable solutions to finish the remaining FasTracks projects, challenges
in optimizing service levels in order to meet customer demands, and the introduction of evolving
transit technologies, in order better to serve our constituents in new and varying ways. As elected
officials, we each represent different districts with differing needs, and we have a responsibility
to each of our constituents and to the overall well-being of the agency as a whole. We also
recognize that this Board, by statute, has both policy-setting and executive functions it must
perform.
BOARD VALUES
We value the collective Board wisdom that is gained through considered deliberations. Thus, we
value openness in our discussions, diversity of perspectives, and civility in our conversations. We
also place a premium on deliberations that are both efficient and effective. Recognizing that
issues will vary in their complexity, we value timely decision-making.
STEPS TO ENHANCE BOARD EFFECTIVENESS

BOARD CHAIR REQUESTED AGENDA ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Support of Ballot Measure 6A and Delegation of Director
Tisdale to Vote on 6A on RTD’s Behalf

September 19, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

Added to Committee Agenda by the Chair pursuant to RTD Board Bylaws Article VI., Section 1(b).
Requires formal motion and second at Committee meeting.
MOTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt a position of support on City and County of Denver Ballot Question
6A, and for the Board to designate Director Douglas Tisdale to cast RTD’s vote on 6A.
REPRESENTATIVES
Erik Davidson, Board Chair
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
A Downtown Development Authority is a statutory tool that allows municipalities to collect a portion of
the incremental property and sales taxes generated within the central business district. Those funds can
be invested to support the development and redevelopment of those districts. The Denver Downtown
Development Authority (DDDA) was created by Denver City Council in 2008 to issue tax increment
financing (TIF) bonds to aid in the redevelopment of Denver Union Station and the adjacent property.
Ultimately the DDDA helped deliver over $400 million in improvement projects including significant
financing contributions to the historic preservation of Union Station as well as the construction of rail
tracks, platforms, and the bus facility at Union Station.
The Denver City Council via Council Bill 24-1016 has referred Ballot Question 6A to the qualified
electors of the DDDA. If approved by the voters, without raising taxes, the City and County of Denver
would be authorized to increase its debt by $570 million with a total repayment cost of not more than
$847 million, for use by and on behalf of the DDDA. The funds would be used to make public
improvements per the DDDA’s Development Plan. The DDDA’s draft Amended Development Plan is
included in this packet.
As a property owner in the DDDA, RTD is a qualified elector. If the Board wishes to take a position on
Ballow Question 6A, it must designate a person to vote on RTD’s behalf.
DISCUSSION

Packet Pg. 21

1.3.C

The DDDA’s initial round of investments into the redevelopment of downtown Denver served as a
catalyst for RTD and Union Station. Further, The DDDA’s draft Amended Development Plan identifies
five categories for potential future investment, including Connectivity and Mobility. This represents an
opportunity for additional investments to be made into the transit infrastructure of downtown Denver via
the DDDA. The DDDA’s Board, which has included an RTD Director since at least 2016, would serve in
an advisory capacity to the implementation of the Amended Development Plan. Given the above, Chair
Davidson recommends the Board adopt a support position on Ballot Question 6A.
Chair Davidson further recommends that Director Douglas Tisdale, who currently serves as the Chair of
the DDDA, be designated by the Board to vote on RTD’s behalf in the forthcoming DDDA election.
Director Tisdale was appointed by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock and confirmed by the Denver City
Council to serve on the Board of Directors of the DDDA on behalf of RTD from 2018 to 2022 and was
reappointed in 2022 by Mayor Hancock. to serve a term through 2026. Director Tisdale will no longer be
eligible for membership on the DDDA Board when his RTD Director term ends in 2024. This would then
create a vacancy that Mayor Johnston would appoint to fill with the confirmation of City Council.
This action aligns with the strategic pillars of Community Value as expanding the DDDA’s bonding
authority will create additional value for community members traveling via RTD to and from Denver’s
central business district.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Ballot Question 6A does not increase property taxes. Further, as a governmental entity, RTD does not
pay property taxes. As such, there is no financial impact to supporting this measure or designating
Director Tisdale to vote on behalf of RTD.

1. INTRODUCTION
A. Overview
The City and County of Denver (City), in coordination with the Board (Board) of the Denver Downtown
Development Authority (DDDA), recently launched a process to preserve and expand the DDDA and to
amend the DDDA’s Plan of Development for Denver Union Station, adopted on December 22, 2008
(Original Plan). A Downtown Development Authority (DDA) is a body corporate and political subdivision
of the State of Colorado that is organized pursuant to state statute (speciﬁcally, Sections 31-25-801, et
seq., C.R.S., as amended (DDA Statute)), and the DDA Statute allows municipalities, like the City, to
collect on behalf of the DDA a portion of the incremental property and sales taxes generated within the
City’s central business district in a special fund of the City to be used in accordance with the DDA
Statute. Those funds can then be invested within the boundaries of the plan of development area to
support catalytic investments that help spur economic growth and revitalization in the heart of the City
in conformance with the DDA Statute.
This Amended Plan of Development (Amended Plan) provides the legal background, a summary of the
planning process, details on the expanded DDDA and project selection process, and a high-level
overview of projects and improvements that can be considered for funding using certain tax increment
financing (TIF, as further defined below) generated within the DDDA boundaries. This Amended Plan is
intended to amend and restate the Original Plan, and to supplement and expand upon the development
projects described in the Original Plan.

B. About DDAs
DDAs are quasi-governmental corporate bodies and political subdivisions of the State of Colorado that
can provide both organizational focus and ﬁnancing to support downtown improvements. DDAs facilitate
cooperative and coordinated eﬀorts between among businesses, residents, property owners, and local
government to redevelop or rehabilitate downtown areas in accordance with the DDA Statute. DDAs are
intended to halt or prevent blight or the deterioration of property values or structures within a
municipality’s central business district, and to assist with the development or redevelopment of such
areas in conformance with the DDA Statute. There are more than 20 DDAs across Colorado, including in
Downtown Denver.
In accordance with the DDA Statute, a DDA is created by the governing body of a municipality and
managed by a board appointed by the municipality. It is funded primarily through Tax Increment
Financing (TIF) revenue generated by increases in sales and property tax revenues generated within the
DDA boundaries above a base sales and property tax level that has been set in accordance with the DDA
Statute. TIF funds are then reinvested into eligible projects located within the DDA boundaries. DDAs do
not increase tax rates, but rather capture a portion of tax revenue to ﬁnance eligible projects located
within its boundaries.
Pursuant to DDA Statute, once a DDA is formed and continuing through its 30-year initial term, it shall
be governed by a 5- to 11-member board appointed by the governing body of the municipality. If the
DDA is extended past its 30-year initial term, it shall be governed by a 9- to 13-member board in
accordance with the DDA Statute. Members shall hold office until a successor has been qualified and

municipality) shall expire 4-years from the date of appointment. Members (other than members of the
municipality’s governing body that serve on the DDA board) must reside, be a business lessee, or own
real property within the DDA.

C. History of the Denver Downtown Development Authority
In 2008, the DDDA was created by the City and County of Denver, pursuant to Ordinance No. 400, Series
2008 (as may be amended from time to time, the Creation Ordinance) and the DDA Statute. Concurrent
to its creation, City Council also approved the Original Plan for the DDDA pursuant to Ordinance No. 723,
Series of 2008. The Original Plan was primarily focused upon the use of the TIF revenues generated within
the plan of development area to help redevelop the historic Denver Union Station site.
The City, along with its project partners including the Regional Transportation District, the DUS
Metropolitan District Nos. 1-3, and the Denver Union Station Project Authority, used the TIF revenues
generated within the plan of development area in accordance with the Original Plan to help deliver over
$400 million in public transportation projects related to the redevelopment of Denver Union Station.
This strategic public investment complemented and strengthened private investment at Denver Union
Station to better serve local and regional residents, attract new visitors and businesses, and stimulate
private investment – all while advancing the goals detailed in the Original Plan and required pursuant to
the DDA Statute.
Public assets funded through the DDDA for the redevelopment of Denver Union Station in accordance
with the Original Plan included, without limitation:
•
•
•
•
•

Historic station preservation
Rail tracks, platforms, and canopies
Regional bus facility
Public gathering spaces
Public street, utilities, and parking

The current DDDA is governed by a 5-member board (Board) appointed by the mayor and confirmed by
Denver City Council (City Council). The then-current City Council President serves as a member of the
Board throughout their appointment as City Council President. The DDA Statute allows for the Board to
be comprised of up to 11 members for the duration of its initial 30-year term through 2038. The intent
will be to ensure that the Board composition is in alignment with the expanded scope of this Amended
Plan. As member terms end and opportunities to expand the Board arise, the City will seek to appoint
members that reflect and represent the diversity of owners, residents and business lessees within the
boundaries of the DDDA, and to provide supplemental subject matter expertise in areas such as
development, long-range planning, design, economics, business, tourism, activation, livability and
resident experience, municipal governance, finance, and more. A cooperation agreement between the
DDDA and the City, as may be amended or restated from time to time, further describes the partnership
and functions of DDDA activities between the City and the DDDA.
With the successful redevelopment of the Denver Union Station area completed, this Amended Plan is
intended to broaden the scope of contemplated development projects authorized under the Original
Plan beyond the redevelopment of Denver Union Station. As discussed below, there is a need by the City

to take corrective measures to halt or prevent the deterioration of property values or structures within
the boundaries of the DDDA or to halt or prevent the growth of blighted areas therein, or any
combination thereof. This Amended Plan will aﬀord maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound
needs and plan of the City as a whole, for the development or redevelopment of area within the
boundaries of the DDDA, as they currently exist or may be expanded in the future, by the DDDA, the City,
and by private enterprise.

D. About the Plan of Development
In accordance with the DDA Statute, the use of TIF revenues is guided by an adopted plan of
development. The Original Plan speciﬁcally targeted the redevelopment of Denver Union Station, which
has been completed (although the TIF revenues continue to be pledged for the repayment of those
related obligations). In order to include additional projects and activities for which the TIF revenues
may be obligated beyond the redevelopment of Denver Union Station, the DDA Statute requires the
adoption of this Amended Plan. Similar to the Original Plan, this Amended Plan must be approved by
the Board and City Council, with review and recommendation by the Denver Planning Board. The City
Council must also hold a public hearing on its consideration of this Amended Plan as prescribed in the
DDA Statue.
A strong overarching tie between this Amended Plan and other adopted city-wide and area-specific
downtown plans is desired. This Amended Plan provides categories for projects and improvements that
can be funded by the TIF revenues in conformance with the DDA Statute. It does not identify speciﬁc
projects or investments, but rather identiﬁes categories to guide public investment and establishes a
process by which proposed projects may be considered for eligibility under this Amended Plan.
While Denver Union Station and its adjacent property may still be eligible for future projects described in
this Amended Plan, there are now a broader range of potential projects that may assist in overcoming
the economic challenges aﬀecting the City’s central business district. The City’s “central business
district,” commonly referred to as “downtown” throughout this Amended Plan, comprises the area
generally bounded by Speer Boulevard, Colfax Avenue, Grant Street, 20th Street, and the Consolidated
Main Line railway line. A map illustrating this downtown boundary is provided in Section 5.

2. BACKGROUND ANALYSIS
A. Planning Process
An extensive planning process was conducted to prepare this Amended Plan, undertaken by the City
with support from a consultant team led by Progressive Urban Management Associates (P.U.M.A.).
A project website presented the rationale, schedule, upcoming events, how to stay involved, as well as
documents, presentations, and FAQs. Regular e-newsletters were distributed to those who signed up
throughout the DDDA planning process. A community online survey in May and June 2024 yielded
responses from 1,700 community members. A series of Q&A roundtables and community meetings were
attended by over 350 participants.
Additionally, the consideration of the Amended Plan overlaps with the City’s update to the Downtown
Area Plan. While this Amended Plan and the updated Downtown Area Plan are separate and
independent from one another, the processes for consideration of both were coordinated. The updated
Downtown Area Plan, if approved by City Council, will consider ﬁndings and project categories derived
from this Amended Plan, and this Amended Plan will continue to use the updated Downtown Area Plan
as a guiding document.
To inform this Amended Plan, background analysis was initially conducted which included a review of
past City plans and the community online survey. Summaries and conclusions from this work are
presented below.

B. Past Plans Overview & Themes

• Economic Study for Downtown Denver (2024) – see following chapter for more details
• Auraria Campus Framework Plan (underway)
• Cherry Creek and Speer Boulevard Vision and Reconﬁguration Feasibility Study (underway)
Citywide Plans
• Comprehensive Plan 2040 (2019)
• Blueprint Denver (2019)
• Game Plan for a Healthy City (2019)
• Refocusing Vision Zero (2022)
• Equity in Denver Report (2022/2023)
While the scope and objectives of these planning eﬀorts vary widely, several prevailing key themes were
identiﬁed. These include:
1. Public Realm and Urban Environment: The quality of the public realm and the urban
environment is a recurring theme for downtown Denver, as the City’s central business district.
Plans highlight the need for more green space, tree canopy, and welcoming public spaces.
Revamping parks, activating gathering areas, and “greening” the urban environment are
common recommendations.
2. Mixed-Use Development and Ground ﬂoor Activation: There is a focus on promoting mixed-use
development and activating ground ﬂoor spaces within downtown Denver, as the City’s central
business district. Plans suggest ﬁlling vacant storefronts with unique retail, culturally diverse
oﬀerings, and non-retail uses. The goal is to create a vibrant and economically thriving
downtown.
3. Mobility and Transportation: Mobility and transportation are key considerations in the planning
eﬀorts. Plans aim to develop safe, high-quality, and multimodal transportation options that
prioritize walking, rolling, biking, and transit within downtown. Improving street design,
enhancing pedestrian experiences, and creating a robust and safe multimodal network are
common recommendations.
4. Connectivity and Integration: Many of the past planning eﬀorts emphasize the importance of
enhancing connections between downtown Denver and surrounding neighborhoods. This
includes improving pedestrian and bicycle facilities, creating safe and inviting gateways, and
strengthening connections.
5. Equity and Inclusivity: Many plans emphasize the importance of equity, inclusivity, and
accessibility. They aim to provide a diverse range of aﬀordable housing options, ensure access to
basic services and amenities for all residents, and promote a healthy and active community. It is
expected that future plans will continue this focus on equitable outcomes and equity will
remains a fundamental city value that is used during DDDA funding decisions.
For additional information including individual summaries of all past planning eﬀorts noted above, see
the Past Plans Overview, attached to this Amended Plan as Exhibit A.

C. A Closer Look: Downtown Denver Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy
While a separate planning eﬀort, the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy was conducted immediately prior
to the consideration of this Amended Plan and included broad community outreach on topics similar to
this Amended Plan’s engagement strategy. Stakeholder outreach included a variety of focus groups and
an online survey that received approximately 900 responses.

1.3.C.c

The purpose of the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy, led by the Downtown Denver Partnership (DDP) and
the City’s Oﬃce of Denver Economic Development and Opportunity (DEDO) and published in January
2024, was to further an eﬀort to deﬁne, assess, and ultimately help reposition the City’s distinct
downtown sub-districts. In addition to community outreach, the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy
examined existing conditions in each of the City’s downtown sub-areas, including ground ﬂoor conditions
and real estate trends, visitor activity, demographics and residential growth, employment activity, and
physical and infrastructure assets and barriers.
Highlights of the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy included:
•

•
•

•

The quality of the public realm was identiﬁed as critically important to Downtown’s success. In
the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy’s online survey, “more green space, tree canopy, and
welcoming public spaces” was chosen as most important for improving downtown by a
signiﬁcant margin.
Similarly, in focus groups, revamping parks and green spaces was identiﬁed as potentially
catalytic in improving overall vitality of downtown.
Filling vacant storefronts was a priority. Of downtown’s 1,200 ground ﬂoor spaces, 21% were
inactive (as of the study’s data collection in fall 2023). Various eﬀorts were suggested by
community members, such as ﬁlling ground ﬂoor spaces with unique retail, more culturallydiverse oﬀerings, and non-retail uses (daycare, pop-up exhibits, etc.).
Many stakeholders also noted that neighborhood-serving retail, services, and residential
amenities were key market opportunities for residents in downtown and adjacent
neighborhoods. Family-friendly uses (like childcare) were important considerations to meet the
needs of a growing population and potentially serve as an incentive for downtown employees to
return to the oﬃce more frequently.

D. Community Survey Results
To gather broad input from the community on priorities for downtown Denver, an online survey was
developed and distributed through various City and DDP communication channels. The survey was open
to anyone interested to respond. It ran in May and June 2024, and collected 1,700 responses. Key
ﬁndings are provided below, while a complete survey summary is attached to this Amended Plan as
Exhibit B.
The majority of respondents (53%) identiﬁed their relationship to downtown Denver as City residents
living outside of downtown Denver, while 14% identiﬁed as downtown Denver residents (owner) and 8%
as downtown Denver residents (renter). 37% of respondents reported being downtown Denver
employees, 32% downtown Denver visitors, and 14% living in the region but outside of the City. Of
respondents not living in downtown Denver, 44% said they come to downtown Denver at least 3 days a
week, and 38% at least several times per month.
When asked to rate various existing elements of downtown Denver, art and cultural venues scored
highest, and was the only element with a majority of respondents rating as good/very good.
Alternatively, respondents rated housing options as the worst element in downtown Denver, followed by
outdoor gathering spaces, trees and landscaping, mix of land uses, and the built environment – all of
which were rated good/very good by fewer than 20% of respondents.

1.3.C.c

A majority of the survey was focused on the downtown Denver of the future. To do so, various categories
of projects that are representative of investments typically made by other DDAs in Colorado were rated
by participants. When asked to rate the level of importance for downtown Denver’s future, all 15
categories were rated favorably and were rated as very/somewhat important by at least 60% of
respondents. At the top of the list, the following categories all were rated as “very important” by more
than 50% of participants:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Streetscape enhancements to improve the pedestrian experience
Adaptive reuse of existing buildings
Enhanced multimodal connectivity
Increased green infrastructure and landscaping
Improvements to existing parks, plazas, playgrounds, and other outdoor gathering spaces
Creation of new parks, plazas, playgrounds, and other outdoor gathering spaces
Groundﬂoor/retail space improvements

When respondents had to choose one category that was MOST important for downtown Denver in the
next ﬁve years, adaptive reuse of existing buildings received the most support by a signiﬁcant margin.
Enhancing multimodal connectivity and investments that bring more housing options also received
strong support.

E. Economic Study Findings
A preliminary step to the preparation of this Amended Plan was the completion of an Economic Study for
downtown Denver (Economic Study). The Economic Study, completed in March 2024 by StreetSense,
documents existing conditions in the central business district that comprise or are anticipated to
eventually comprise the DDDA’s boundaries. The study specifically sought to identify whether there
were findings of blight in conformance with the DDA Statute. The Economic Study Area focused
speciﬁcally on Upper Downtown – bound by Colfax Avenue, Speer Avenue, Lawrence Street, 20th Street,
and Sherman Street.
The Economic Study found that the area within the current boundaries and future proposed boundaries
of the DDDA meets the majority of blight criteria defined by the DDA Statute as: “an area within the
central business district which, by reason of the presence of a substantial number of deteriorated or
deteriorating structures, predominance of defective or inadequate street layout, faulty lot layout in
relation to size, adequacy, accessibility, or usefulness, unsanitary or unsafe conditions, deterioration of
site or other improvements, unusual topography, defective or unusual conditions of title rendering the
title nonmarketable, or the existence of conditions which endanger life or property by fire and other
causes, or any combination of such factors, substantially impairs or arrests the sound growth of the
central business district, retards the provision of housing accommodations, or constitutes an economic
or social liability and is a menace to the public health, safety, morals, or welfare in its present condition
and use.”
The presence of conditions that constitute blight under the DDA Statute and other key takeaways are identiﬁed
in the Economic Study.

1.3.C.c

✓ Presence of substantial number of deteriorated or deteriorating structures
• The study area is contending with historically elevated vacancy rates and many large blocks
of space available for lease. Although pre-COVID oﬃce conditions were healthy, since 2020
the study area has seen nearly 4 million square feet of negative absorption.
• Given trends in remote and hybrid work, most oﬃce tenants are reducing footprints and
seeking higher quality spaces, rendering large old oﬃce towers even more challenging to
lease. Combined with poor performance since 2020, the study area will continue to face a
growing number of deteriorating and/or functionally obsolete structures without
intervention.
• With drastic reductions in valuations and climbing vacancies, property owners are forgoing
necessary maintenance and investments in the buildings. These deferred investments put
structures at increased risk of deteriorating.
✓ Unsanitary or unsafe conditions
• Assaults, public drug use and bio-hazards create signiﬁcant unsanitary and unsafe conditions
that are concentrated in clusters along 16th Street.
✓ Deterioration of site or other improvements
• High incidence of graﬃti spread throughout the study area suggests an on-going
deterioration of sites and improvements.
• The study area lacks adequate site improvements that might otherwise catalyze the
provision of housing.
• The decline in reliability, frequency and safety of the public transit system throughout
downtown reﬂects a deterioration of improvements, in this case transit accessibility, that
impair the sound growth and provision of housing accommodations within the study area.
✓ Predominance of defective or inadequate street layout
• It being diﬃcult to cross streets is a defective or inadequate street layout condition found to
the east and south, which create physical barriers to accessibility.
• As automobile usage grew, defective or inadequate street layout became a barrier to safe
pedestrian connectivity and created challenges of accessibility, with limited pedestrian
crossings impeded by fast-moving vehicles.
✓ Unusual topography
• Unusual topography with respect to an elevation change between the study area and North
Capitol Hill creates further barriers to connectivity.
✓ Faulty lot layout in relation to size, adequacy, accessibility, or usefulness
• Faulty lot layouts were created by the conﬂuence of two competing street grids, particularly
along Broadway.
There is additional analysis and key takeaways that conﬁrm and detail each of the above, which can be
found in the full Economic Study report, attached to this Amended Plan as Exhibit C.

Additional ﬁndings from the Economic Study are also described in the following Downtown Challenges &
Conclusions section.

F. Public Realm Evaluation
To supplement the Economic Study and to conﬁrm similar conditions throughout the central business
district, a public realm evaluation was conducted by the City’s consultant team, completed in June 2024.
This evaluation focused on conditions of public spaces and right-of-way throughout downtown Denver.
The evaluation found that the issues described in the Economic Study are also found throughout
downtown, given its consistent lot layout, street grid, and right-of-way conditions. The above blight
conditions are applicable throughout the central business district.
A memo providing more detail on the Public Realm Evaluation is included as Exhibit D to this Amended
Plan.

3. DOWNTOWN CHALLENGES &
CONCLUSIONS
There are ﬁve key challenges that the City’s central business district is facing now and into the future.
These were informed and distilled from the various background analyses and outreach noted above.

A. Key Challenges
Downtown Denver’s post-pandemic economic recovery is lagging behind other parts of the City.
By various metrics, the City’s downtown area (encompassing the City’s “central business district,” as
provided for pursuant to Section 31-25-802(3), C.R.S.), continues to be challenged in adapting to the
post-COVID-19 era. Overall oﬃce vacancy is historically high and continues to climb – at 27% in Q1 2024,
up from 11% in early 2020. This drop in occupancy is compounded by downtown’s sluggish rates of
return-to-oﬃce for downtown employees. Overall return-to-work has stagnated at roughly 63% relative
to pre-pandemic levels.
The lack of employee foot traﬃc continues to hurt the storefront economy. A recent inventory shows
that downtown Denver has nearly 1,200 ground ﬂoor spaces. Of these, 21% are inactive (i.e., vacant,
permanently or temporarily closed). Overall, downtown lost 145 businesses from 2018 to 2022, a 26%
decline. The hardest-hit have been food/beverage and neighborhood-serving businesses.
The impact is not limited to retail and oﬃce spaces. The elevated vacancies in the study area have a
deteriorating eﬀect on the visitor experience and overall retail environment. Of all of downtown’s major
retail, academic, sports, and cultural oﬀerings (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters), only Ball Arena
has met or exceeded its pre-pandemic visitation, thanks at least in part to two professional sports
championships over the past three years. Downtown’s visitation recovery lags that of other areas in the
region. Overall visitation in Upper Downtown and LoDo has declined 30% and 26%, respectively, since
2019.
Lastly, the lack of a full recovery impacts sales and property tax generation for the City’s key economic
engine. Property value increases have slowed signiﬁcantly during the last four years, compared to the
prior four-year stretch leading up to the pandemic. Overall sales tax revenue in the expanded DDDA area
remains approximately 25% below pre-pandemic levels (comparing 2018 to 2023, accounting for
inﬂation and tax rate changes). Furthermore, after initial recovery during the second half of 2020
through ﬁrst half of 2021, sales tax revenue in downtown has stagnated over the last two and a half
years (since Q3 2021).
A more detailed tax revenue evaluation is attached to this Amended Plan as Exhibit E.
Upper Downtown has been the hardest hit and slowest to recover.
Nowhere has the pandemic-impact been so pronounced as in Upper Downtown, encompassing the area
roughly from Lawrence Street to Lincoln Avenue. This part of downtown has the highest concentration of
commercial real estate in the region. But since the pandemic, the commercial oﬃce vacancy rate in
Upper Downtown has more than doubled from 13% in 2019 to 31% in Q2 2024, the highest of

1.3.C.c

downtown’s sub-areas. Return-to-work also is lowest in this part of downtown, with rates hovering around
50%.
This impact is acutely felt at the ground ﬂoor level, where there are 13 diﬀerent blocks that have at least
three vacant or inactive storefronts (85 inactive spaces total). It is also trickling down to the housing
market – no new housing has come online in Upper Downtown since 2020. Furthermore, since 2020,
absorption has dropped into the negative most years – an unusual trend – meaning more people are
moving out than moving into the area.
In Upper Downtown, 30 properties were identiﬁed as being distressed or deteriorating (deﬁned as
properties that are marketing over 40% of their rentable building area for lease). From a sales tax
perspective, Upper Downtown has been slowest to recover, 38% below 2018 levels, compared to LoDo
which is down 14% from 2018 (when adjusted for inﬂation and tax rate changes).
Downtown’s lack of land use mix is hindering its recovery.
Other comparable urban environments negatively aﬀected by the COVID-19 pandemic that have been
fastest to recover have been the most mixed-use in nature. Meanwhile, downtown Denver has one of
the densest concentrations of commercial oﬃce space in the region. There is roughly 40 million square
feet of oﬃce inventory in the expanded DDDA study area. As noted above, in Upper Downtown alone, 30
properties, making up 9.4 million square feet of built oﬃce assets, were identiﬁed as "distressed."
An oﬃce-dominant environment is reliant upon oﬃce workers that have not fully returned to the daily
oﬃce environment. With daytime oﬃce attendance diminished, and residential base limited, day and
overnight visitors have increasingly become downtown’s most powerful market driver. While this has
fueled recovery in certain areas, such as the hotel and food and beverage markets, there is a cap on
overall resiliency and sustainability of the downtown market as a whole.
Diversiﬁcation of property mix and customer bases will be a driver of full recovery for downtown Denver
just as it is in other downtown markets nationally.
The public realm is as important as ever – and needs broad improvement.
When the public realm, or pedestrian experience, is underwhelming, this becomes exacerbated when
foot traﬃc and vibrancy are reduced. There are indications that both factors are in play in downtown
Denver.
As noted in the themes from past downtown planning eﬀorts, the quality of the public realm is a
recurring theme, with plans highlighting the need for more green space, improved tree canopy, and
more welcoming public spaces. As the Economic Study also points out, downtown Denver is cut oﬀ from
surrounding neighborhoods by major auto thoroughfares or transit barriers on all sides that create
physical barriers to accessibility and connectivity. Again, Upper Downtown in particular stands out – an
oﬃce tower-dominant district, with fewer public, outdoor gathering spaces.
The two community surveys discussed earlier – the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy and DDDA Expansion
surveys – both highlight this challenge. In the Groundﬂoor Activation Strategy survey, when asked to
choose the most important programs, services, and amenities for improving downtown, the top choice
among respondents, by a signiﬁcant margin, was more green space, tree canopy, and welcoming public
spaces. In the DDDA Expansion Survey, respondents were more likely to rate the quality of outdoor

gathering spaces, landscaping, and sidewalk conditions as “poor” or “very poor” than “good” or “very
good.” In the same survey, streetscape enhancements were deemed “very important” by 68% of
respondents – the highest percentage amongst all potential improvements.
Without intervention and bold action, market erosion of downtown is likely to continue.
Trends and market expectations indicate that the post-pandemic disruption could continue to negatively
aﬀect downtown if bold action isn’t taken. There are two key pieces to this projection. One, the ﬂexible
work environment is likely permanent and adaptation from the oﬃce sector is a slower, lagging process
that has not experienced bottom yet. And two, downtown is competing more than it ever has with the
broader region in terms of oﬃce competition and customer base.
Given trends in remote and hybrid work, most oﬃce tenants are reducing footprints and seeking higher
quality spaces, rendering large older oﬃce towers even more challenging to lease. Combined with poor
performance since 2020, downtown will continue to face a growing number of deteriorating and/or
functionally obsolete structures without intervention. Indeed, commercial vacancy in the expanded
DDDA study area has been steadily on the rise each year since 2019.
In turn, property value increases have stalled in downtown. Furthermore, given that property
assessments are a lagging metric, much of the pandemic impact is likely yet to be realized and further
value erosion could be reasonably expected over the next four-year term. The DDDA is statutorily
intended to be used as a tool to help halt or prevent the deterioration of such property or property
values.
At the same time, as noted above, downtown is now competing in a more competitive regional market.
New oﬃce and mixed-use markets continue to emerge. These markets are attracting local and regional
customers, as well as coveted tenants, presenting further challenges to downtown.
In downtown, 16th Street (albeit impacted by construction which exacerbates foot traffic decreases),
Denver Pavilions, and Denver Union Station have experienced the most substantial and persistent
declines in activity between 2019 and 2023, creating a cyclical impact on retail vacancies. Further,
downtown has diﬃculty leveraging the momentum of residential growth in adjacent neighborhoods,
due to the aforementioned barriers that disrupt connectivity.

B. The Need for Downtown Investment
Strategic investment in downtown Denver creates long-term economic growth and increases the tax
base to support vital services citywide.
Downtown Denver (as deﬁned by the proposed expanded DDDA area) is 0.86 square miles, constituting
less than 1% of the City/County land mass, but plays an oversized role in the City’s overall economic,
civic, and cultural oﬀerings. As noted in the Economic Study, downtown is critical to the city on multiple
fronts:

4. CATEGORIES FOR INVESTMENT
The foundational goal of this Amended Plan is to:
Build a vibrant downtown Denver through strategic
and catalytic investments that promote economic
growth and revitalization.
To accomplish this goal and address the challenges noted above, ﬁve categories for investment have
been identiﬁed that will guide the selection of projects that will be considered for DDDA support and
funding. Projects will be required to ﬁt into one or more of the categories below. This is true for both
public realm investments and private development projects providing public beneﬁt seeking DDDA
support. Accomplishing this goal will further: 1) promote the health, safety, prosperity, security and
general welfare of the inhabitants of the DDDA and of the people of the State of Colorado; 2) halt or
prevent the deterioration of property values or structures within the downtown area, halt or prevent the
growth of blighted areas within the downtown area, and will assist the City in the development or
redevelopment of the downtown area and in the overall planning to restore or provide for the
continuance of the health thereof; and 3) will be of special beneﬁt to the property within the boundaries
of the DDDA, whether now or in the future. Under all circumstances, the projects contemplated under
this Amended Plan shall be otherwise authorized to be undertaken in accordance with the DDA Statute.
The following details the ﬁve Investment Categories. Within each Category, project examples are also
provided.
These examples are purely illustrative and not in any way limiting for DDDA investments.

A. New Development & Adaptive Reuse
Why this is important: Transforming underutilized, under-performing properties, lots, and structures
into vibrant, functional spaces will contribute to a more mixed-use downtown Denver and rejuvenate
properties that have outlived their original purpose.
New development and ﬁnding new uses for existing structures has multiple, wide-ranging beneﬁts. It
helps enhance downtown’s cultural fabric and distinct character. Development and redevelopment
deliver an economic impact – bringing new jobs, residents, and visitors to downtown, and in return,
spurring additional private and nonproﬁt investment. Together, new buildings and adaptive reuse of
existing buildings throughout the expanded DDDA will result in a more balanced land use mix and a
more economically resilient neighborhood.
Illustrative Examples:
•
•

Adaptive reuse of oﬃce building to residential, hotel, education, and/or other uses
Development that supports a variety of housing types (e.g., workforce, mixed-income, social
housing options) and other non-residential uses

B. Livability, Economic Opportunity & Jobs
Why this is important: Downtown is an economic engine for the City and region. DDDA investments will
bring new economic opportunity and jobs to downtown Denver by investing in initiatives that support
new development, attract and retain employers, create workforce development opportunities, and
revitalize the ground-ﬂoor economy.
DDDA investments that strengthen the economic foundation of downtown Denver by creating jobs and
economic opportunity are crucial for fostering a more diversiﬁed and resilient local economy. This will
also stimulate further economic development and investment from the private and nonproﬁt sectors.
Projects can create economic opportunity and jobs directly or indirectly, and at varied scales. This ranges
from major new development on vacant parcels to capital investments that make downtown Denver a
more appealing neighborhood in which to work.
Illustrative Examples:
•
•
•

New development on vacant and underutilized land
Ground-ﬂoor and retail attraction and improvements
Amenities to retain and attract jobs and residents (e.g., childcare facilities, oﬃce building
amenity areas)

C. Parks & Public Space
Why this is important: DDDA investments are available to enhance parks and public space amenities in
downtown Denver, essential for fostering community engagement, health, and well-being, while creating
a neighborhood in which people want to live, work, and visit. Quality public spaces serve as vital
gathering spaces for social interaction, community events, and cultural expression, promoting a sense of
belonging for all residents. Accessible and well-designed parks support environmental sustainability and
contribute to both physical and mental health.
Moreover, parks and public spaces have signiﬁcant economic and quality-of-life beneﬁts. They boost
adjacent property values, attract private investment, and strengthen the local economy by drawing
visitors and tourists. There is room for improvement in this area for downtown Denver, as noted in prior
sections of this Amended Plan – a theme of past surveys and planning eﬀorts. Overall, investments in
downtown parks and public space are crucial for creating a vibrant, healthy, and beautiful neighborhood,
and establishing a foundation for further economic growth.
Illustrative Examples:
•
•
•

Improvements to existing parks, plazas, playgrounds, and other outdoor gathering spaces
Creation of new parks, plazas, playgrounds, and outdoor gathering spaces
Increased green infrastructure and landscaping (e.g., sidewalk planters, tree canopy, pervious
surfaces)

D. Arts, Culture & Activation
Why this is important: As discussed in the prior Amended Plan section, downtown Denver is a hub for
community gathering, helping to shape Denver’s identity and cultural fabric. The DDDA will be available
for enhancing this asset, supporting the enrichment of arts and culture in downtown Denver by
supporting projects that celebrate the City’s diversity, foster community pride, and stimulate economic
revitalization.
A vibrant arts and culture scene attracts Citywide residents, tourists, boosts local businesses, and creates
jobs in key downtown employment sectors. Cultural amenities enrich the urban experience, making
downtown a more attractive place to live, work, and visit. Furthermore, arts and cultural investments
provide valuable educational opportunities, fostering lifelong learning and youth engagement. By
investing in arts and culture, downtown Denver will position itself as a neighborhood where innovation
and creativity thrive.
Illustrative Examples:
•
•
•

Art and cultural venues and facilities (e.g., museums, theaters, outdoor performance venues)
Creating new spaces for artistic and creative professionals to live, work, and perform
Public art installations

E. Connectivity & Mobility
Why this is important: The work of the DDDA to-date in redeveloping Denver Union Station
demonstrates the economic impact of mobility infrastructure investments. Not only is this a
transportation hub for the city for residents, workers, and visitors, but has stimulated tremendous
economic development in and surrounding the station.
An expanded scope of DDDA-eligible projects presents an opportunity to invest in connectivity and
mobility enhancements that are essential for creating an accessible, eﬃcient, and sustainable downtown
Denver. Investments into connectivity and mobility can be catalysts for further economic growth and
revitalization of downtown Denver. They also include wide reaching beneﬁts like improved accessibility
and inclusivity throughout downtown Denver. Lastly, these investments should aim to enhance quality of
life and the pedestrian experience in downtown Denver.
Illustrative Examples:
•
•

Streetscape enhancements and pedestrian amenities to improve the pedestrian experience (e.g.,
wider sidewalks, lighting, furnishings, tree canopy, wayﬁnding signage, resting benches)
Create additional mobility options (e.g., on- and oﬀ-street parking management, micro-mobility,
biking infrastructure, enhanced transit)

5. AMENDED DDDA BOUNDARIES
A. Eligibility Requirements to Petition for Inclusion into the DDDA
Pursuant to Section 31-25-807(3)(a)(II), Colorado Revised Statutes (“C.R.S.”), tax increment shall be used
for ﬁnancing or reﬁnancing a development project within the boundaries of the plan of development
area. The “plan of development area” means an area in the central business district which the Board and
the City Council designate as appropriate for a “development project” (see C.R.S. §§ 31-25-802(3.5) and
(6.8)). The “plan of development area” may differ from the legal boundaries of the DDDA, and it is
anticipated that property included within the legal boundaries of the DDDA may become eligible for
development projects as a part of the plan of development area in accordance with this Amended Plan.
Section 31-25- 822, C.R.S. sets forth the actions and requirements for inclusion of additional property
into the DDDA: “Proceedings for inclusion shall be initiated by petition to the [Board] signed by the
owner or owners in fee of each parcel of land adjacent to the existing [DDDA] sought to be included.”
Therefore, to be eligible for inclusion into the DDDA: 1) the fee owner(s) of the subject property must
execute and submit a petition to the Board; and 2) the subject property must be adjacent to the thencurrent existing boundaries of the DDDA.
The current legal boundary of the DDDA, as described and illustrated in Exhibit A of the Original Plan,
consists of Denver Union Station and Other Parcels and Market Street Station. To provide the
opportunity for non-adjacent downtown properties located within the study area of this Amended Plan
to satisfy the adjacency requirement described above, the City will submit a petition for inclusion of a
portion of its fee-owned right-of-way in accordance with the DDA Statute. Such petition shall be
considered by the Board and, if approved, submitted to City Council for its separate consideration. The
City-owned right-of-way legal description and map proposed for inclusion is described and illustrated
below.

B. Legal Description of Property and Map
Parcels of land lying in Sections 33 and 34, Township 3 south, Range 68 west of the 6th Principal
Meridian, City and County of Denver, State of Colorado, described as follows:
Those portions of the of the streets, avenues, and lanes conveyed to the City of Denver by deed
recorded June 8, 1867, at book 14 page 120, Arapahoe County, Colorado Territory, as shown on the
Fredrick J. Ebert plat titled “Part of the City of Denver” dated June 29, 1865, depicting the Congressional
Grant approved May 28, 1864, and lying west of N. Broadway, north of W. Colfax Ave., northeast of N.
Speer Blvd., southeast of Wewatta St., south of the north line of the aforementioned sections 33 and 34,
and southwest of the northeast line of 20th St.
Together with all the streets dedicated to the City of Denver in H. C. Brown’s Addition to Denver

6. INCLUSION & PROJECT SELECTION
PROCESS
There are two separate, general steps that properties must take to ultimately receive DDDA funding
support. First is petitioning for inclusion into the DDDA boundaries. Second is applying for funding for
speciﬁc projects.

A. Petition for Inclusion into the DDDA
If the City-owned right-of-way is included into the DDDA, other property owners who own a fee simple
interest in properties located adjacent to the then-current boundaries of the DDDA would become
eligible to petition for inclusion into the DDDA. Provided that the statutory requirements for inclusion
described in C.R.S. § 31-25-822 are satisﬁed, such other properties may be either privately or publicly
owned.
Pursuant to C.R.S. § 31-25-822, all petitions for inclusion, including right-of-way, submitted to the Board
must be signed by the fee owner(s), and “shall include evidence satisfactory to the [Board] concerning
title to the property and an accurate legal description thereof.” Additional guidelines, criteria, and
requirements for forms of evidence, timelines, and procedures may be determined by the Board and City
Council, respectively. If the Board approves a petition for inclusion, it shall submit the same to City
Council for its consideration. If City Council approves the petition for inclusion, it shall, by amendment to
the DDDA’s Creation Ordinance, redescribe the boundaries of the DDDA to include the additional
property as described in the petition. From the eﬀective date of that Creation Ordinance amendment,
the additional property shall be included within the DDDA’s boundaries, and this Amended Plan shall be
deemed to be automatically amended to include such property and such property shall become subject
to those certain statutory requirements, all without any further action needed from either the Board or
City Council.
It is important to note that the inclusion of property into the DDDA is not a guarantee that such property
will be eligible for any projects described under this Amended Plan or receive any TIF revenues
generated within the plan of development area.

B. Project Selection General Parameters
The City’s Manager of Finance and Executive Director of Denver Economic Development and
Opportunity will use a project evaluation and selection process that follow these general parameters:
•
•

•

The City will develop Tax Increment Investment Policy and Program Requirements, including a
criteria and an evaluation process by which projects will be considered for investment.
An application for funding will be developed by the City that can be used by eligible properties
for projects that ﬁt the guidelines in this Amended Plan. Project applications will be considered
on a case-by-case basis and evaluated by the City’s Manager of Finance and Executive Director of
Denver Economic Development and Opportunity, or their respective designees, based upon the
ability of the project to further the goals of this Amended Plan. The DDDA Board will serve in an
advisory capacity for implementation of this Amended Plan.
Investment funding of TIF for proposed non-City projects may include, but is not limited to, grant
reimbursements, annual payment schedules based upon individual property generation of tax

increment, and/or bond proceeds for certain projects after completion.
•

Non-City project proposers may be required to present their development project scope,
conceptual designs/elevations, budget/ﬁnancial pro forma, timeline/schedule, evidence of
eligible activities, and other related or required documents to the City staﬀ for consideration.

•

Equity is a fundamental value in the City’s adopted plans. A commitment to equity is critical
to creating a vibrant, inclusive downtown Denver where residents, employees, and visitors
have access to opportunities to improve the quality of their life. As DDDA funding decisions
are made across a portfolio of projects, equity will be a guiding value.
All projects described or authorized herein in accordance with this Amended Plan shall be
implemented in conformance with the provisions and requirements of the DDA Statute, as well
as any rules, procedures, or contractual requirements of the City and the DDDA, and the
Creation Ordinance of the DDDA.
Periodic reports will be generated to provide updates on projects supported with DDDA funds,
their status, and impacts achieved. Reports will be available on the DDDA website.

7. CONCLUSION
As described in this Amended Plan, there is a need to take corrective measures in order to halt or
prevent deterioration of property values or structures within the current or future boundaries of the
DDDA, which shall comprise the DDDA’s plan of development area in accordance with Section 31-25802(6.8), C.R.S., or halt or prevent the growth of blighted areas therein, or any combination thereof. This
Amended Plan shall aﬀord maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs and plans of the City
as a whole, for the development or redevelopment of the DDA’s plan of development area by the DDDA,
the City, and by private enterprise.
In accordance with the Original Plan and Section 31-25-807(3)(a), C.R.S., and as restated in this
Amended Plan, taxes, if any, levied after the eﬀective date of the approval of the Original Plan by the
City Council upon taxable property within the boundaries of the plan of development area, as amended,
each year and municipal sales taxes collected within said area by or for the beneﬁt of any public body
shall be divided for a period not to exceed thirty years or a longer period as provided for in Sections 3125-807(3)(a)(IV) and (V), C.R.S., after the eﬀective date of approval by City Council of the Original Plan.
The TIF revenues generated in accordance with Section 31-25-807(3) on property taxes and sales taxes
shall be allocated to and, when collected, paid into a special fund of the City for the payment of
principal of, the interest on, and premiums due in connection with the bonds of, loans or advances to, or
indebtedness incurred by, whether funded, refunded, assumed, or otherwise, the City for ﬁnancing or
reﬁnancing, in whole or in part, one or more development projects within the boundaries of the plan of
development area, as amended from time to time.
In accordance with Section 5 of the Creation Ordinance of the DDDA, Board approval of this Amended
Plan shall provide approval of the Board for the Manager of Finance of the City to be authorized to
spend, in accordance with this Amended Plan and in all current and subsequent years, whatever amount
is collected from any revenue sources allowable pursuant to Sections 31-25-807(3), 31-25-816, and 3125-808, C.R.S, or otherwise by law to be imposed or collected by the Board or by the City.
The use of DDDA funds is guided by a duly adopted plan of development approved in accordance with
the DDA Statute. With the successful redevelopment of the Denver Union Station area completed, this
Amended Plan is intended to broaden the scope of contemplated development projects authorized
under the Original Plan beyond the redevelopment of Denver Union Station. While Denver Union
Station and its adjacent property may still be eligible for future projects described in this Amended Plan,
there are now a broader range of potential projects that may assist in overcoming the economic
challenges aﬀecting downtown Denver.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Monthly Government Relations Report – September 2024

September 19, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Michael Davies, Government Relations Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
Pursuant to the Board-adopted 2024 Legislative Program, the agency developed a Legislative Program
that serves as a guiding document for staff to pursue goals related to legislative and policy matters. A
Legislative Program serves as a living document that can be adjusted throughout a legislative session to
provide an avenue for Board-adopted policy positions to be communicated and pursued by agency staff.
In line with the agency’s mission and vision established in the Strategic Plan, the development and
inclusion of the goals and actions contained in the Legislative Program are designed to make lives better
through connections.
It is important that RTD serve as a trusted partner to the region’s local, state, and federal elected
officials. To achieve these goals, Board members and staff must be proactive in educating and informing
the District’s elected officials of the challenges and opportunities available to advance shared goals.
In furtherance of the program, the agency’s Government Relations Officer coordinates and develops
strategic communications to advance the agency’s legislative priorities and serve as a point of contact
for elected officials in the Denver metro region.
DISCUSSION
Included herein are notable government relations highlights at the federal, state, and local levels since
the last Executive Committee meeting held on Thursday, July 25, 2024. This report was prepared on
September 4, 2024, and will be updated verbally as needed during the Executive Committee meeting
scheduled for Thursday, September 19, 2024.
Federal
The primary focus at the federal level has been on work related to the federal fiscal year 2025 (FFY25)
appropriations process. With little time left for Congressional business before the end of the federal fiscal
year, it is likely that a Continuing Resolution will be required to fund transportation programs after
September 30, 2024.

1.5.1

As indicated in a press release published on August 7, 2024, RTD, the City and County of Denver, and
City of Aurora received notice of an allocation of funding by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for
the East Colfax Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project through the FTA’s Capital Investment Grant Program.
The notice indicated that an additional $23 million was added on top of previous federal fiscal year
allocations, which raised the total amount allocated to the project to $150 million. This amount is the
maximum allowed under federal law for the grant program expected to fund the BRT project and
represents the largest discretionary grant award anywhere in the State of Colorado out of the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. RTD, as the federally designated grant recipient, will continue to
work with FTA over the next few months to finalize the grant agreement.
State
RTD regularly participates in the Colorado General Assembly’s interim process. The Board Chair and
General Manager and CEO are scheduled to present RTD’s statutorily required update to the
Transportation Legislation Review Committee (TLRC) on September 25, 2024. Staff will ensure Directors
are made aware of exact timing for that presentation should they wish to attend or listen online.
As part of the work performed by the TLRC, six bills are selected by the committee for drafting by
legislative staff. According to legislative staff, bill drafts requested on behalf of the committee are
expected to be released by September 6, 2024. RTD staff will be reviewing these bills and will keep the
Board updated on bills that relate to RTD and transit matters.
Local
At the local level, staff continues to actively arrange engagement opportunities with local municipal
partners. August 22, 2024, staff attended a meeting of the North Area Transportation Association
(NATA) and provided an agency update to attendees and on .

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Director Orientation, Onboarding, and Continuing
Education Policy

September 19, 2024

REPRESENTATIVES
Michael Guzman, Secretary
Troy Whitmore, Director, District K
Jack Kroll, Executive Manager, Board Office
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Board of Directors supports the education and development of Directors. This belief is reflected in
the Board’s Bylaws, Governance Manual, and Expense and Reimbursement Policy, which each reference
concepts related to Directors’ continuous training, development, and education. While the concepts of
education, training, and development of Directors are touched upon in the above documents, there is no
single unifying Board policy on training expectations for new or continuing Directors. The lack of a
unifying policy was identified by the Office of the State Auditor (OSA) in its Fiscal Governance
Performance Audit of RTD released on August 5, 2024. In the audit report, OSA recommended that the
Board develop a policy to ensure timely onboarding for incoming Directors-elect and ongoing training for
all Directors. In its response to OSA, the agency agreed to implement such a policy by December 2024.
This recommendation aligned with the work the Board had begun during the June 20, 2024, Executive
Committee meeting, wherein the committee provided consensus support for the Chair to ask two
Directors to partner with the Board Office to develop a policy related to Director orientation, onboarding,
and continuing education. Subsequently, Chair Erik Davidson asked Secretary Michael Guzman and
Director Troy Whitmore to work with the Board Office to develop such a policy.
To develop the draft policy, the group collaborating on the project has met and sought feedback from
relevant resources. Staff from the Board Office have met with Secretary Guzman and Director Whitmore
three times and collaborated further via email. The draft policy was also shared with the General
Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) for her input and feedback. The Board Office consulted transit industry
peers via the American Public Transportation Association’s (APTA) “APTA Connect” idea exchange
portal for further input and reviewed notes from a session on new board member onboarding held during
the July 2024 APTA Transit Board Administrators Seminar. Additionally, Secretary Guzman leaned
heavily on research he had conducted across the national transit landscape for a presentation on board
member orientation, onboarding, and training at the Latinos in Transit annual Leadership Summit in
Oregon in early September 2024.

Packet Pg. 57

1.5.2

DISCUSSION
The draft policy now comes before the Executive Committee for input and feedback. It details
information on the following: expectations of Directors, orientation objectives, onboarding objectives,
training topics, training methods, training resources, tours of RTD property, training schedule, staff
responsibilities, board responsibilities, and feedback and evaluation processes.
While feedback and input are requested on the draft, the group working on this policy could benefit most
from input on the timing of trainings and the topics to be covered in those trainings.
Once the Executive Committee discusses the draft policy, the Board Office will email the full Board of
Directors for further input, solicit additional input and feedback from the GM/CEO and staff, and work
with Secretary Guzman and Director Whitmore to bring forward a policy for recommended action at the
Executive Committee’s October 2024 meeting.
This discussion aligns with the strategic priority of Community Value as Director training and
development leads to more effective representation.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The discussion surrounding the development a policy for Director orientation, onboarding, and continuing
education has no specific financial impact.

DIRECTOR ORIENTATION, ONBOARDING,
AND CONTINUING EDUCATION POLICY
ADOPTED: TBD
I.

PURPOSE

To set forth guidelines for the orientation, onboarding, and continuing education (collectively called "training")
of Directors to ensure they receive and nurture a common understanding of the agency's critical elements to
make informed policy and governance decisions.
II.

SCOPE

This policy applies to all members of the Board of Directors.
III. EXPECTATIONS OF DIRECTORS
Directors are not just expected; they must each individually take the initiative and responsibility for their own
respective training. Their active participation is integral to the agency’s governance and oversight. This includes
attending all training, being punctual, prepared, and actively engaged.
Training calendars will be circulated in advance to facilitate Directors meeting their obligation to attend and
actively participate in training sessions.
Per the Board’s Expense and Reimbursement Policy, all Directors have access to and are strongly encouraged to
use funds to travel to and attend conferences focused on continuing education for transit board members. New
Directors are particularly encouraged to attend the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) Transit
Board Member and Administrator (TBM/TBA) Seminar and the APTA Legislative Conference in the first two years
of their term, as these events provide crucial insights into governance best practices and valuable transit industry
networking opportunities.
The Board recognizes that Directors are elected and, as such, may come to the Board with varying levels of skill
and knowledge. The Board will actively work to identify opportunities for its collective knowledge and talent to
grow, identify Directors willing and able to develop relevant skills and expertise on behalf of the Board and invest
in their subsequent development.
IV. ORIENTATION
The following activities and sessions will help orient new Directors to RTD and their roles on the Board.
Welcome by General Manager and Chief Executive Officer (GM/CEO): Shortly after their election, each
new Director will have the opportunity to meet one-on-one with the GM/CEO. These meetings are intended to
help develop a positive working relationship and provide a broad orientation to RTD, ensuring that new Directors
are well-prepared for their roles.
Introduction to RTD by Leadership Team: The GM/CEO Executive Office will coordinate a cohesive crossmatrix departmental overview introduction of members of the Leadership Team. This introduction will highlight

their respective expertise, departmental responsibilities, and overall integration as part of the agency, instilling
confidence in the new Directors about the agency they are governing.
Meet and Greet by Current Chair and Directors: Directors should mentor incoming Directors and help them
develop their knowledge of RTD by scheduling in-formal meetings to share their backgrounds, perspectives,
board culture, boardroom dynamics, and governance skills.
Independent Study of RTD Website: New Directors are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with
the RTD website, a comprehensive resource that includes trip planning webpages related to fares, schedules,
NextRide, Trip Planner, service alerts, parking, RTD’s transit services (bus, light rail, commuter rail, paratransit,
[i.e., ADA complementary service branded Access-a-Ride and supplemental and premium paratransit service
branded, Access-on-Demand], micro-transit, [branded FlexRide], and RTD’s Partnership Program), service
changes, and customer care.
V.

ONBOARDING OBJECTIVES

Onboarding will focus on helping new Directors understand their roles and responsibilities as Board Members
and provide them with a baseline understanding of the agency.

report the results to the Executive Committee. Directors are encouraged to complete training
assessments promptly following training sessions.
2.) Each October, the Board Office will conduct a board assessment to identify areas where the Board may
collectively lack expertise and subjects the Directors are interested in learning more about. Further, this
assessment will ask Directors to examine the Board’s performance in meeting its policy and governance
objectives during the prior year.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next Steps

September 11, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
Stuart Summers, Chief Communications and Engagement Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
15 minutes
BACKGROUND
On Tuesday, February 27, 2024, General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) Debra A. Johnson commissioned
a peer review of RTD’s paratransit service delivery, to be conducted by transit industry subject-matter
experts. The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) convened a peer review panel that
included a geographical representation of panelists from across the country. During the course of the
months-long thorough review, the panelists leveraged their expertise and professional experience to
assess both RTD’s Access-a-Ride (AaR) service, the agency’s complementary Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) paratransit service, and RTD’s Access-on-Demand (AoD) premium supplemental paratransit
service. A copy of the APTA Paratransit Peer Review Final Report and Next steps were distributed to the
Board of Directors on August 21, 2024, by GM/CEO Johnson.
The overarching goal of the peer review was to help the agency better understand strengths and
opportunities, with respect to both ADA complementary paratransit and premium supplemental ondemand service, and to note potential improvements that support long-term sustainability. The panel
conducted a review of RTD’s paratransit operations to identify (1) best practices employed by similar
transit agencies, including for demand-response programs; (2) model program parameters, including
responsible cost controls and sound customer-facing processes; and (3) software, hardware, or other
tools to ensure optimal service performance and program cost-effectiveness.
DISCUSSION
Staff will provide a high-level briefing regarding the APTA Peer review final report and outline the
agency’s next steps. A more in-depth presentation will be provided to the full Board of Directors during
the Board Meeting scheduled for September 24, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact associated with this discussion item.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
29th and Welton Property Disposition Time Extension

September 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to extend the outside closing date to December 31, 2024 for the negotiation
and execution of all documents necessary for the disposition of the real property located at 2907-2915
Welton Street, Denver, Colorado (the Property), including execution of any deeds, covenants, and other
property conveyance documents.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Chessy Brady, Manager, Transit-Oriented Development
PRESENTATION LENGTH
10 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD acquired the property located at the corner of 29th Street and Welton Street (Property) for
$148,000 in 1993 to replace the on-street parking for local businesses that was lost during the
construction of the Central Corridor. The Property is currently a vacant parking lot used for neighborhood
retail parking and is not managed as part of RTD’s parking management system.
In 2010, the Board of Directors adopted the Strategic Plan for Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) to
create a more focused policy that guides RTD’s role in encouraging the creation of mixed-income
communities near transit. Pursuant to that policy direction, RTD selected the Welton Corridor as one of
four pilot program sites because of a combination of favorable market conditions for redevelopment and
the City and County of Denver’s (CCD) commitment to revitalization of the Welton Corridor, a
commitment that currently continues.
In 2013, the Five Points Business District published its Vision Plan Implementation and Revitalization
Strategy, which called for removal of vacant parking lots along the corridor, including activation of the
Property. The plan emphasized the need to retain housing affordability along the Welton Corridor.
Beginning in 2014, staff and representatives from the Denver Department of Economic Development and
Opportunity began discussions around how to partner to implement the community vision established in
the Five Points Business District plan as part of the TOD Pilot Program implementation. CCD determined
that attainable for-sale housing was the preferred strategy for the site.
In December 2016, the Board of Directors approved an option agreement for CCD or its assignee to
purchase the Property at fair market value, for the development of mixed-income housing. The exercise

Packet Pg. 80

2.17.A

of the option was contingent on the mutual selection of a development partner. A developer was
selected in December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss
the developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing.
In February 2021, the Board of Directors approved a resolution of commitment to promote affordable
housing as detailed in the agency’s Equitable TOD (eTOD) Policy. In August 2021, the Board of Directors
authorized the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) or her designee to dispose of the Property according
to the terms below:
1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.
DISCUSSION
In 2022, RTD selected Shanahan Development, LLC, to purchase the property from the agency and
construct 62 affordable condominiums, which will immediately be sold to Elevation Community Land
Trust (ECLT). ECLT will then manage the sale of the units to homebuyers earning up to 80% of Area
Media Income. As the landowner, ECLT will ensure all future sales meet requirements that both maintain
the affordability of the condos and permit the original buyers to build equity. CCD has approved the Site
Development Plan for the project and is ready to issue building permits as soon as Shanahan closes on
the purchase of the Property.
Of the terms of the property disposition authorized by the Board of Directors in 2021, terms 1, 3, and 5,
listed above, have been adhered to and/or accomplished. Term 2 is nearly complete; in June 2024,
Denver City Council allocated $5 million to the project, and the State’s Department of Local Affairs is
contributing more than $8 million. The financing package will be complete on September 23, 2024,
when Denver City Council is expected to authorize the Denver Urban Renewal Authority to contribute
$2.2 million to the project. However, the Board of Directors’ authorization expires on September 26,
2024, pursuant to Term 4. Since the closing on the sale of the Property is currently planned for late
September or early October 2024, shortly after Board authorization expires, additional flexibility is
needed to accomplish the closing.
This action would extend the GM/CEO’s existing authority to dispose of the Property to the selected
developer once the above conditions are met, allowing for the flexibility required to ensure the closing
can happen.

Packet Pg. 81

2.17.A

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, the agency will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive $1.5 million
from the selected developer.

RTD and CCD have outlined a competitive process to solicit developers to build a mixed-income
condominium project with affordable units on the Property. RTD would lead the Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) process and CCD would participate in the developer selection panel and provide gap
financing for the project. A letter from Denver Mayor Michael Hancock expressing CCD’s commitment to
this project is attached to the Board packet. It describes CCD’s willingness to contribute substantial gap
financing to support an appropriate development on the Property.

To aid in the successful completion of the developer selection, RTD must establish certainty for potential
bidders that the property will be available at previously agreed upon terms. Therefore, staff has
requested authority to dispose of the Property according to the terms below.
DISCUSSION
This action would give authority to dispose of the Property to the selected developer conditioned upon
meeting the following requirements:

pr
o

ve
d

on

1. RTD will successfully procure a development partner to build a mixed-income condominium
project with affordable units.
2. The selected developer will secure the financing necessary to complete the project.
3. The final lease or purchase price for the Property will be based on a fair market value appraisal of
the Property with a potential for reductions in purchase price or rent in exchange for affordable
housing development or other benefits to the agency pursuant to the eTOD Policy.
4. Lease signing or closing will occur a maximum of two years from the date of developer selection,
with the ability to grant two 90-day extensions if necessary to complete the transaction.
5. RTD will grant property rights to the development partner via a ground lease rather than a sale
unless a ground lease structure is financially infeasible; or if a sale structure substantially
increases the quantity, depth, or length of the term of affordability; or a sale structure is
financially beneficial to RTD, as determined by RTD.

Ap

If a selected developer fails to complete the transaction, RTD would remain the property owner and any
subsequent decisions about the Property would be subject to Board approval. RTD staff will keep the
Board apprised of the developer selection process and project implementation.

FINANCIAL IMPACT
RTD currently spends approximately $10,500 per year maintaining the property. If the property is
disposed of, RTD will no longer have this maintenance obligation and will receive the amount determined
by a fair market value appraisal of the Property.

was contingent on the mutual selection of a development partner. A developer was selected in
December 2017 but could not secure adequate financing, prompting RTD and CCD to dismiss the
developer and the project in January 2020 prior to closing. Later in 2020, the Board affirmed its
preference to ground-lease, rather than sell, this property for redevelopment. The Property was appraised
in January 2020 at $2.4 million. In 2021, the Board approved a resolution committed to promoting
affordable housing as detailed in the agency’s eTOD Policy.

Board of Directors
Regional Transportation District

Denver, CO 80202
To the RTD Board of Directors:
This letter is to express the City and County of Denver’s strong and enthusiastic support for the
proposal before you to approve the disposition of RTD-owned property at 2907-2915 Welton
Street for the development of mixed-income housing.
Since the fall of 2014, Denver’s Office of Economic Development (OED) and now the office of
Housing Stability (HOST) has been working closely with the RTD Transit-Oriented
Development team to plan for the development of mixed-income for-sale housing on this
site. We look forward to continuing to collaborate on this joint effort to provide critical
affordable homeownership opportunities in the Five Pointsneighborhood.
As part of HOST’s mission, we invest federal and local funds in the development and
preservation of a variety of income-qualified housing throughout the city. Each year, HOST
invests millions of dollars of gap financing in non-profit and private-sector-led development
projects that add to the city’s stock of affordable housing.
Housing costs in the Denver region are rising out of reach for even moderate-income residents,
with an estimated 100,000 households in Denver County alone paying more than 30% of their
income for housing costs. We recognize the need to invest in affordable housing options not
only to provide shelter for our region’s most vulnerable residents, but also to support the
economic mobility of Denver’s low- and moderate-income families as they become ready to
move into homeownership. To achieve this goal, HOST invests in affordable housing units
ranging from supportive housing for the lowest-income residents to for-sale units for
households earning up to the median income.

Attachment: 2021-08-24 29th and Welton Property Disposition (4983 : 29th and Welton Property D

Due partly to construction defects restrictions, very few for-sale units have been built in Denver
over the last several years, limiting the entry-level housing options available to lower- and
moderate-income homebuyers. The city is eager to continue to collaborate with RTD and a
mutually selected developer to pilot on this site a new model for mixed-income condominium
construction at this location. We are prepared to contribute substantial gap financing to an
appropriate development on this site to support this effort.
We look forward to the opportunity to continue to deepen and strengthen our relationship
with RTD as a key partner in innovative development throughout Denver.
Respectfully,

Michael B. Hancock

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF)

September 10, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to adopt the 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF).
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
Todd Nikkel, Senior Manager, Budget
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
The 2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast (FYFF) is the financial forecast used as the basis for the
development of the 2025 Proposed Budget and provides guidance for future year financial planning. The
FYFF was formerly the six-year Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP).
The development of the FYFF seeks to balance planned expenditures with anticipated available funding
sources in alignment with RTD’s Strategic Plan. The FYFF is prepared on an annual basis or can be
produced more frequently if material changes in assumptions and inputs occur. The previous financial
forecast, the 2024-2029 MTFP, was approved by the Board during the Board Meeting held on Tuesday,
October 24, 2023.
The 2025-2029 FYFF is prepared using currently available information to assist in planning and
modification of the Fiscal Policy, if necessary, within projected financial constraints.
The FYFF is a forecast or projection of financial results and is not an appropriation of funds and is nonbinding.
DISCUSSION
Staff presented a discussion item during the Finance and Planning Committee meeting held on July 23,
2024, related to the 2025-2029 FYFF. The discussion item described the purpose of, and assumptions
being used for, the 2025-2029 FYFF, as well as the financial planning process refinements that are
being implemented in a phased approach. The phased approach will occur from 2024-2027 and will
consist of:
• Generation 1:
o A careful evaluation to ensure that the right monies are used at the right time and for the
right needs

Packet Pg. 94

2.17.B

Continued improvement of the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan inventory and asset
maturity information
o An internal communication campaign and improved transparency through the Performance
Dashboard
Generation 2:
o Process and control improvements and the expansion of the decision framework
o Reliance on enhanced business case justification
o Implementation of decision gates
o Continuous improvement regarding data quality and development of staff’s planning
competencies
Generation 3:
o Consideration of implementation of decision support technology tools for the combined
prioritization evaluation of projects and resources
o Consistent measurement of project outcomes
o

•

•

The 2025-2029 FYFF has been prepared using currently available information and does not include
assumptions regarding future potential changes such as passage of the TABOR ballot question or new
grant funding from the collection of oil and gas production fees authorized by Senate Bill 24-230. The
FYFF will only include funding source and use projections that have reasonable certainty to occur in
accordance with RTD’s Board-approved Fiscal Policy.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The 2025-2029 FYFF projects continued adherence to Fiscal Policy requirements and maintenance of
adequate reserves to continue to cash fund expenditures while providing the necessary funding to
support the Comprehensive Operational Analysis while meeting TAM needs.

2025-2029 Five-year Financial Forecast

Each year, or more often, if necessary, the Regional Transportation District prepares a multi-year financial forecast
for planning purposes. In previous years, a six-year Mid-term Financial Plan (MTFP) was produced. In 2024, RTD
implemented a new financial planning horizon of five years that will be referred to as the Five-year Financial Forecast
(FYFF).
The 2025-2029 FYFF represents the expected revenues, expenditures and financial position anticipated for the fiscal
years January 1 through December 31. The RTD Board of Directors is requested to approve the annual FYFF, however,
it is a forecasting and planning tool and not an appropriation of funding. The forecasted revenues and expenditures
from the FYFF are then used as the basis for the scope of the annual proposed budget.
Forecasted revenues and expenditures are developed in the FYFF using the most current information available at the
time of report preparation. As such, forecasted amounts will change over time. If assumptions change materially,
staff will revise the FYFF for presentation to the Board, as necessary.
The expenditures set forth herein align with RTD’s Strategic Plan Priorities and are developed in support of executing
the Comprehensive Operational Analysis (COA). In order to maintain fiscal sustainability, financial forecasts must
consider balancing with expenditures not exceeding revenues over the long term. Financial Success also must
consider maintaining adequate fund balances, adhering to the Board-approved Fiscal Policy and being good stewards
of taxpayer funds.
The development of the 2025-2029 FYFF was a cross-departmental collaborative effort; hence the proposed 20252029 FYFF for the Board’s consideration is a collective staff recommendation, centered on a One RTD approach.

Fare revenue is projected to continue to account for approximately 5% of revenue. Modest annual
ridership increases of 2% will contribute to fare revenue increases and the impact of Zero Fare for Youth
is included in each year.
Sales and use tax projections provided in March 2024 by the University of Colorado Leeds School of
Business are included. Prior forecasts assumed a 1.4% annual growth cap for the Base System as an
assumption for the impact of TABOR revenue growth limits. This prior assumption has been replaced
with a more thorough and complete TABOR revenue calculation which assumes TABOR refunds of $2.4
million in 2027 and $3.7 million in 2029. It is important to note that this assumption does not assume
an economic slowdown and is more optimistic than the experience of other TABOR impacted
governments that are routinely subject to TABOR refunds of 7-10% of applicable revenues.
Operating expense inflation increases have been incorporated at an average annual rate of 5.1% over
the five-year period. Inflation assumptions are applied at differing rates by category such as wages,

benefits and materials while also applying known contractual increases such as with contracted services.
The basis for operating expenditure forecasts is the System Optimization Plan (SOP), which is the
Agency’s COA.
Asset management expenditures are included that maintain assets in a state of good repair using
information from the Transit Asset Management (TAM) Plan. It should be noted that the TAM is not fully
populated or mature from an asset condition assessment standpoint and staff continues to improve the
information continued therein. Further, the TAM Plan includes occasional large outlays for asset
replacements such as revenue vehicle purchases, some of which are planned to occur beyond the FYFF
planning horizon. The Fiscal Policy includes the intention of RTD to continue to cash fund purchases,
however, it may be necessary to finance some large purchases in the future with Certificates of
Participation (COPs), a form of lease-purchase financing, to spread the costs over multiple years for
efficient cash flow purposes and maintenance of fund balances. It is also important to recognize that
RTD recently began to realize the financial impacts of large repairs and replacements as certain transit
system elements reached a 30-year age. This trend will continue as more of the transit system continues
to age and approaches useful life benchmarks.
Reserves are projected to continue to meet the Fiscal Policy requirements for the Operating and TABOR
reserves. Due to TAM repair and replacement activities, the Capital Replacement and Unrestricted
Reserves will diminish over the five-year period, as expected. The FasTracks Internal Savings Account
(FISA) is projected to continue to be funded according to the Fiscal Policy.

Revenue growth is primarily attributable to increases in tax collections and small ridership increases
driving fares. Revenue increases are tempered by a modest impact from assumed Taxpayer’s Bill of
Rights (TABOR) revenue growth limitations as well as decreasing investment income as interest rates are
expected to decrease. Grant revenue includes a pass-through grant in 2024 and then reduces and is
assumed to be flat due to no assumption of future new capital grant funding opportunities
Operating expense annual increases approximate 4% for inflationary and contractual increase
assumptions. Capital expenditures are in accordance with the TAM Plan while debt service will continue
to decrease with reductions in remaining obligations and the Fiscal Policy directive to target cash funding
of purchases
Capital expenditures are significantly higher in 2024 and 2027 due to the inclusion of funding for rail
reconstruction work and bus purchases, respectively
While net sources and uses project a deficit in each year, this line item includes funding contributions to
reserves to maintain Fiscal Policy requirements and continue with cash funding of TAM needs rather than
funding through more costly financing mechanisms
The Unrestricted Fund balance will decrease due to funding of the TAM Plan needs while the Capital
Replacement Fund increases to set aside funding for future year TAM needs with additional investments
for vehicle replacements and other asset renewals and repairs after 2029. A transfer to FasTracks of
$26.6 million will be necessary in 2029.

Revenue growth is primarily attributable to increases in tax collections and small ridership increases
driving fares. Fare revenue from the A Line is expected to continue drive overall RTD fares with a
relatively larger proportion attributable to FasTracks. TABOR revenue growth impacts are smaller than
the Base System due to TABOR exemption of the 0.4% tax through 2050. Decreasing investment income
is expected as interest rates are anticipated to decrease, and investible balances decrease
Operating expenses have increases in 2025 and 2029 due to variations in annual payments under the
commuter rail concessionaire agreement that were included for scheduled periodic repair and
maintenance activities. Debt service increases due to the intentional issuance of debt with repayment
occurring and growing then subsiding in relation to the Base System decrease in debt service as planned
due to consolidated cash flow needs and the ability of the Base System to be allowed to provide funding
to FasTracks, as approved by voters
Fund balances will decrease due to the net cash outflows primarily driven by FasTracks’ debt service
requirements. The unrestricted reserve is projected to be exhausted by the end of the forecast period
to avoid debt financing while the FISA is assumed to grow according to the 2013 FISA funding plan. This
FISA funding plan uses contributions to fund the temporary increases in the commuter rail concessionaire
agreement during 2025-2027 for scheduled periodic maintenance of the RTD owned assets operated and
maintained by the concessionaire. Because of these reserve funding structures, funding of $26.6m from
the Base system will be necessary in 2029.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Legal Services
Contract Amendment

September 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO or her designee to execute an
amendment to add $600,000 in additional funding to the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction legal
services contract for a total contract amount not to exceed $953,800.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Melanie J. Snyder, General Counsel
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
As part of the Near-term Downtown Rail Reconstruction Project, RTD is currently undertaking full-depth
reconstruction of downtown rail to improve safety and mobility, address deteriorating transit
infrastructure, and extend the design life of the agency’s key transportation assets.
The near-term work will occur in four phases. The first phase commenced in June 2024 and was
completed on August 29, 2024, with track reconstruction at five key intersections in the Downtown
Loop. Work on phases two through four will start in 2025. To accelerate the project schedule and
minimize impacts to customers and the community, the majority of phases two through four will be
completed using a progressive design-build project delivery approach. This project will support the
Strategic Priority of providing Community Value, and more specifically, the Strategic Initiative of Back of
Basics.
The progressive design-build reconstruction contract structure is the first of its kind in RTD’s history,
with the contractor managing design and construction. On December 5, 2023, RTD solicited a Request
for Proposals for external legal services from law firms with expertise advising transportation agencies
on procurement and contracting for progressive design-build projects. On April 15, 2024, RTD executed
a contract with Kaplan Kirsch with a term of one year and a not-to-exceed amount of $353,800.
DISCUSSION
As development of the project contract documents has progressed, RTD has ascertained that additional
funds for the external legal services contract will be necessary to support a project of this size and
complexity. Based on current status and the remaining tasks required to procure and contract for a
progressive design-build project, $600,000 of additional legal services capacity is needed to meet the
agency’s goal of awarding a contract in 2025.

Kaplan Kirsch has met all contractual requirements, and their performance has met expectations. No
changes to the contract’s scope of work are associated with this recommended action. If approved, RTD
will execute an amendment with Kaplan Kirsch to add $600,000 of additional funding to the Near-term
Downtown Rail Reconstruction legal services contract to increase the contract’s not-to-exceed amount
to $953,800.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
Funding for this contract amendment will be made available through the Near-term Downtown Rail
Reconstruction Project fund as included in the 2024 budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Approval of Budget Transfer for Wheel Truing Machine
Replacement

September 11, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
September 24, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to approve a budget transfer in the amount of $1,678,500 to the Light Rail
Operations division for the replacement of existing wheel truing equipment and to authorize the General
Manager and CEO to enter into a contract to procure the replacement equipment.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dave Jensen, Assistant General Manager, Rail Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
RTD conducts regular inspections of the metal wheels of light rail vehicles (LRVs) as part of the agency’s
routine vehicle maintenance activities. Over time LRV wheels incur wear, primarily due to friction with
the rail. Wheel truing is the process of ensuring that the wheels of the LRV fleet are kept within
guidelines established by the specific wheel’s manufacturer. Maintenance personnel utilize an electronic,
computerized wheel truing machine to accomplish this critical task, thereby maintaining assets in a state
of good repair, ensuring customer and employee safety, and avoiding service disruptions and LRV
downtime.
DISCUSSION
In adopting this recommended action, the agency demonstrates its commitment to the 2021-2026
Strategic Plan priorities of Community Value, Customer Excellence, and Financial Success as well as the
2023-24 Strategic Priority of Back to Basics.
The agency’s LRV wheel truing machine has reached the end of its serviceable life and is in need of
replacement. Funding in the amount of $1,875,000 for the wheel truing equipment replacement is
included in the 2024 budget. In preparing an updated internal cost estimate in advance of the solicitation
for the wheel truing equipment replacement, staff estimated a revised total cost for equipment
replacement in the amount of $3,553,500, leaving a delta of $1,678,500.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The funding for the replacement of wheel truing equipment in the amount of $1,678,500 will come from
unexpended dollars in the 2024 budget originally allocated for contracted operational needs. As such, no
additional appropriation is needed.
