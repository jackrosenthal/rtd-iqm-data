BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Internal Audit Update

November 6, 2023

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Doug MacLeod, Chief Financial Officer
PRESENTATION LENGTH
30 minutes
BACKGROUND
The Internal Audit Function Charter requires that:
•

•

The Chief Audit Executive (CAE) prepares and distributes written reports upon the conclusion of
each internal audit engagement at least quarterly. Internal audit results must also be
communicated to the Audit Committee at least quarterly
The Internal Audit Function is responsible for appropriate follow-up on engagement findings and
recommendations. All significant findings remain in an open issues file until cleared

On May 31, 2023, the Board approved the Proposed 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan, which
recommended audits to be undertaken through the end of 2024. Each proposed audit had been selected
in response to the results of the enterprise risk assessment.
DISCUSSION
Three audits have been completed under the 2023-2024 Internal Audit Plan as follows:
• Contracts and Procurement
• Employee Training Program Review
• Oracle Information Technology General Controls (ITGC)
The ITGC report contains redactions consistent with § 24-6-402(4)(d), C.R.S. (specialized details of
security arrangements), and § 24-72-204(2)(a)(VIII)(A), C.R.S., (specialized details of physical and cyber
assets of critical infrastructure, protective measures, emergency response plans or system operational
data of such assets that would be useful to a person in planning an attack on critical infrastructure). The
ITGC report will be discussed during the Audit Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, November 6,
2023; however, redacted sections will be discussed in Executive Session.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
There is no financial impact from this discussion item.

Oracle ITGC Internal Audit Report Executive Summary
Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP to serve as its Internal Audit provider to perform
internal audits and other consultative functions.

Out of eleven audit observations, five audit observations were rated as high priority
and six were rated with moderate priority. Based on this, an overall report rating of
“Unsatisfactory” was assigned due to the design or ineffectiveness of internal controls.

This Oracle Information Technology General Controls (ITGC) audit is a Board-approved FY 2023
Internal Audit Plan project.
RubinBrown LLP prepared the report for use by the Board of Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD
management. Recommendations for improvement are presented for management’s consideration,
and management is responsible for the effective implementation of corrective action plans.

The observations, recommendations, and RTD’s management responses to address
each are described in the Detailed Observation and Improvement Opportunities
section of this report. Management has committed to completing the agreed-upon
Action Plans by June 30, 2024.

1.B.1.a

Report Rating Definitions

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location,
process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. The design and
effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were isolated and/or minor, and
departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have certain
deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls which should be improved. Some departures from
leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or efficiency improvement or for improved
financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and the design or
effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures from leading practice may be
present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not corrected, the company can be exposed to loss
or financial misstatement.

Packet Pg. 13

Priority of Internal Audit Report Observations

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or
situations could occur which could have a significant adverse impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include
conditions dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts of interest, and control weaknesses. In
addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control,
and/or exposure of data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an exposure of confidentiality or
integrity.

High Priority

Moderate Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following conditions:
• Significant financial impact for location/site audited
• Prevalence of issues or exceptions
• Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or regulatory requirements
• Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
• Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
• Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor, may be considered a high priority
classification.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.
Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial
statement errors and losses, operational inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory non-compliance as
well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time period deemed reasonable by both Management and
Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to
improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity.
These recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next 12 months.

1.B.1.b

Report No. 2023-02 Contracts and Procurement Audit
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation 1
Observation Title:
Contract Identification and Tracking

Risk Rating:
Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
Contract tracking could be better maintained. There is no clear way to identify when RTD has established new contracts or
amendments. There is also no clear way to determine the following types of contracts: sole source, cooperative, and intergovernmental
agreements.

Cause:
The PO/Contract No. – Contract in the Summary of Monthly Activity and New Contracts repository does not have an easily searchable
or structured format for identifying the type of contract or when RTD initially established the contract and does not include the type of
contract.

Risks:
The inability to identify a contract’s status (e.g., active or expired), term, or whether it’s new or an amendment, as well as if it’s for a
sole source, cooperative, or intergovernmental agreement, can result in missed opportunities for vendor spend discounts, more time
required to respond to audits, and general inefficiencies/disorganization.

Recommendation:
Consider identifying or adding a tag key to identify the contract types.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
RTD is in the process of creating a central, cloud-based contract repository to replace the current system of contract storage in various
folders and subfolders on RTD’s server-based N:drive. Implementation of a centralized, searchable contract database will significantly
increase the efficiency of contract retrieval for various purposes. It will reduce response times for both informal requests for contract
information as well for responses to Colorado Open Records Act requests. As part of populating that contract database, RTD will create
tags to identify the type of contract to allow for sorting and retrieval of contracts by type. This repository will not include leases for real
property, Intergovernmental Agreements or other non-procurement contracts for the initial implementation.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Target Date:
This process will occur in stages. RTD will complete the creation of the repository by December 31, 2023 and will enter existing
contracts in phases starting the population of the repository with new contracts for goods and services.

Observation 2

Newspaper Advertising

Risk Rating:
Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
The Standards Manual states the requirement of the organization to formally place an advertisement in the newspaper. This process is
obsolete, and the solicitations are currently published on the OpenGov website, which reaches a broader audience.

Cause:
The Standards Manual is out-of-date.

Risks:
Having an inconsistent Standards Manual can cause confusion and lead to time consuming tasks that add little-to-no value.

Recommendation:
Consider removing the requirement for newspaper advertisements.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
RTD will research options regarding the possibility of eliminating the requirement to advertise its solicitations in local newspapers to
determine if its current methods of advertisement are sufficient to allow for the outdated, cumbersome and expensive process of
newspaper advertising. This will require the involvement of the RTD Legal Services Division and may or may not be permissible. If
allowed, RTD will need to update the requirement in the Procurement Standards Manual. Updates to the Procurement Standards
Manual requires RTD Board approval.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Target Date:
December 31, 2023 for research of permissibility of change [implementation through update of Procurement Standards Manual would
take much longer.

Observation 3

Procurement Signatures

Risk Rating:
Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
Contracts and signatures are performed through email and PDF. E-signature tools such as DocuSign can prove a more efficient and
secure alternative to contract signing for vendors and RTD.

Cause:
The Standards Manual is out-of-date.

Risks:
Having an inconsistent Standards Manual can cause confusion and lead to time consuming tasks that add little-to-no value.

Recommendation:
Continue working with Information Technology (IT) to implement DocuSign or another similar alternative to manual signatures.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
This is an improvement that the Contracting and Procurement division supports, but the funds and resources for such a change would
need to be included and approved in the RTD Budget and project prioritization list.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Target Date:
June 30, 2024 for research into digital signature options to present to the agency for consideration.

Observation 4
Risk Rating:

Procurement Education

Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
There is no central knowledge resource for personnel to learn about the procurement process to understand when it starts and how
perform a purchase request properly. Establishing a procurement process training module that personnel can refer to may lead to all
personnel expediting the procurement process.

Cause:
Lack of procurement knowledge resources.

Risks:
Not having sufficiently trained resources can result in policy and procedure violation which could result in control deficiencies.

Recommendation:
Continue working with Human Resources (HR) on establishing the "Procurement 101" module on Workday Learning Management
System (WLMS) that personnel can refer to and learn about the procurement process.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
Contracting and Procurement is actively working with RTD’s HR Department staff members to develop agency-wide trainings on basic
procurement requirements and processes. Implementation is dependent upon coordination with and availability of HR staff to assist
with the development and distribution of any trainings.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Target Date:
June 30, 2024 for publication and implementation of agency-wide Procurement 101 training.

Observation 5

Standards Manual Revision

Risk Rating:
Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
The current Procurement Standards Manual is complex and challenging to follow. Other successful agencies have 35-page procurement
standards manuals, while RTD has 587 pages. Updating the Procurement Standards Manual to be simpler and reference other
procurement procedures/processes may prove to be more efficient.

Cause:
The Standards Manual is out-of-date.

Risks:
Not having clear and succinct Procurement Standards Manual can result in confusion of proper policies and procedures which could
result in control deficiencies.

Recommendation:
Consider updating the Procurement Standards Manual to be simpler and reference other procurement procedures/processes.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
Contracting and Procurement will undertake proposed revisions to simplify and streamline the Procurement Standards Manual. This will
take the involvement of the Legal Services Division, Finance and several other departments and any recommended changes will require
RTD Board approval. It is anticipated this major undertaking to take between 12 to 24 months to complete.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Observation 6

Solicitation Creation

Risk Rating:
Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
Currently, the Purchasing Agent must manually create the solicitation. It is a very manual process. Utilizing OpenGov to create the
solicitations will be more efficient for the purchasing agents.

Cause:
Procurement’s manual solicitation process is manual in nature.

Risks:
Having inconsistent processes can cause confusion and lead to time consuming tasks that add little-to-no value.

Recommendation:
Consider utilizing OpenGov to create the solicitations.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
Contracting and Procurement is currently implementing a solicitation and contract build solution to replace the current manual build
process.

Responsibility:
Dana Steele, Director of Contracting and Procurement

Target Date:
Launch of build process for major templates (RFP, IFB, RFQ) by December 31, 2023.

Report No. 2023-02 Contracts and Procurement Audit
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory noncompliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business
cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are
designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity. These
recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.

Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Background

Overall Summary/Highlights

In 2022, RTD contracted with RubinBrown LLP to serve as its
Internal Audit provider to perform internal audits and other
consultative functions.

The audit team rated one observation as High Priority, nine
observations as Moderate Priority, and one observation as
Low/Process Improvement. As a result, an overall report
rating of 'Needs Improvement' was assigned.

This Employee Training Program review is a Board-approved
FY 2023 Internal Audit Plan project.
RubinBrown LLP prepared the report for use by the Board of
Directors, Audit Committee, and RTD management.
Recommendations for improvement are presented for
management’s consideration, and management is responsible
for the effective implementation of corrective action plans.

Objective and Scope
The objectives of this review was to:
•

Determine whether policies and procedures for training
programs across the agency that have been established;

•

Determine whether an effective oversight over RTD’s
employee training programs has been established;

•

Determine whether training materials are documented,
approved and in sync with employee development and skill
requirements for meeting industry and regulatory
compliance with federal and Colorado State laws;

•

Determine whether a process is in place for evaluating
training tools for upskilling/reskilling employees as RTD’s
business changes;

•

Determine the adequacy of RTD’s training system structure
and procedures for assessing the training needs of RTD’s
workforce;

•

Determine the adequacy of RTD’s training program for
supervisors and managers across the agency;

•

Determine whether RTD’s employee training programs
include cross-training and succession planning programs;
and

•

1.B.1.c

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation 1
Observation Title:
Employee Training Program Policy and Procedures

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that there was no agency-wide employee training policy and procedures for learning and development programs
and activities including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Assessing employee development needs
Developing learning content
Training delivery
Identifying key performance indicators
Training records documentation
Trainers’ qualifications

Currently, the Human Resources Department has not formulated an annual training plan based on RTD's long-term and short-term
strategic training plans.

Cause:
RTD’s training and development activities are decentralized.

Risks:
Lack of an agency-wide employee training and development policy and procedures could result in risks including noncompliance with
regulatory training requirements and increased training expenses.
Lack of an annual training plan could affect RTD’s ability to achieve its strategic training plans.

Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing a formal agency-wide employee training and development framework that outlines the
goals, objectives, strategies for learning content, training delivery, and training effectiveness measurements, as well as the roles and
responsibilities of those involved in the training process to support RTD’s strategic training plans.
Management should also consider reviewing the agency-wide employee training and development policy and procedures on an annual
basis to ensure employees are receiving the necessary knowledge and skills to perform their jobs effectively and efficiently.
Management should also consider developing an annual training plan that outlines the training and development initiatives based on
addressing the employees’ gaps and performance deficiencies identified to ensure the agency’s employee training programs are aligned
with RTD’s strategic training goals and objectives for the year.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop an employee learning and development framework and procedures that govern
agency-wide employee training aligned with RTD’s strategic priorities.

Observation Title:
Employee Training Programs Oversight

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Currently, there is no centralized oversight of the employee training programs. Internal Audit noted that the employee training
programs for nine out of the 10 randomly selected employee training programs for testing are administered by the respective business
units.
Additionally, there is no collaboration among the business units to share training materials in areas that have similar training content.

Cause:
Historically, each RTD operating division has administered its own employee training program with no oversight from the Development
and Training Division.

Risks:
Failure to establish a proper oversight of the employee training and development programs could result in poorly managed employee
training and development programs.

Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing more central oversight for the agency-wide employee training and development programs to
ensure the employee training and development plans are aligned with RTD's overall strategic training goals and objectives.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Chief People Officer will review current organizational structure and create a new position in the Development and Training
Division with oversight responsibilities for agency-wide employee training programs.

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation Title:
Employee Training Structure

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Workday Learning Management System (WLMS) is used to support the delivery of employee training material that were either
developed in-house or procured from third-party training providers. There are no established guidelines for reviewing the learning
content for alignment with RTD's strategic training goals and objectives prior to populating them in WLMS.
Additionally, there is no formal process to review and approve the learning content in WLMS for accuracy and relevance of the training
materials and resources.
An analysis of the current learning content in WLMS disclosed the following:
•
•
•
•

Inactive learning courses of 38,939 represented 88% of the total learning content of 43,999 in WLMS.
Active learning courses of 2,416 with the last functionality updated in 2020 and 2021.
Learning courses in YouTube Videos, totaling 2014, are not currently useful to RTD employees.
Learning courses of 661 had contact personnel who are no longer RTD employees.

Cause:
RTD has not defined roles and responsibilities for the review and approval of the learning content in WMLS.

Risks:
Lack of a review and approval process for learning content of employee training programs increases the risk of ineffective training
outcomes.

Recommendation:
Management should consider implementing a formal review and approval of the learning content in WMLS for alignment with RTD's
strategic training plans.
Management should also consider establishing standards for the learning content of the agency’s employee training program to ensure
the training materials are accurate and relevant.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop procedures for Workday Learning trainings including security and administration
access, standards for learning content, alignment with RTD’s strategic plan, review and approval process, content revision and
retention, and employee training completion management.

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation Title:
Employee Development Needs

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted some employee training programs included refresher or re-certification courses to stay abreast with changes in
regulatory requirements and to reskill employees' knowledge and skill sets. However, Internal Audit noted that there is no agency-wide
formal process to assess employee development needs to reskill employees to stay up-to-date and to upskill employees to learn new
knowledge and skill sets prior to providing the trainings.
Out of the 10 employee training programs selected for testing, two employee training programs did not require a refresher course and
two employee training programs were provided to only new hires.

Cause:
RTD has not established a policy to assess employee development needs.

Risks:
Inadequate assessment in employee development needs could result in poor job performance.

Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing a process for analyzing employees' development needs in order to design and develop the
agency’s employee training programs for job-specific, general business and soft skills.
Management should also consider implementing a policy requiring employees to take refresher courses in areas such as safety,
substance abuse, and cybersecurity awareness to stay up-to-date with changes.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop a training assessment plan to measure employee knowledge and competencies.
Including pre- and post-assessments for individual trainings to measure learning retention, and implementation of new knowledge in
business units.
The Development and Learning Division will develop a learning and development framework for refresher courses, upskilling, and
reskilling.

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation Title:
Supervisory and Management Training Program

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The Colorado Office of the State Auditor report dated in December 2020 indicated the following issues with respect to RTD's
supervisory practices:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Operators do not consistently receive adequate or meaningful supervisory feedback on their performance.
Operators did not receive documentation on the feedback that has been provided.
Feedback is often provided to operators as part of the disciplinary process outlined in RTD's agreement with the Union and its
Employee Guidebook.
Supervisors do not consistently deliver feedback that seems supportive to operators.
Supervisory communication is sometimes curt, negative, and demoralizing because it typically relates to discipline.
Operators do not feel supported in their jobs due to supervisors' focus on discipline and a lack of supervisory communication
or poor communication.

Internal Audit noted that RTD had implemented corrective action plans to address the supervisory issue; however, they were paused
effective March 2020 due to the COVID social distancing requirements.
The audit findings in RTD's supervisory practices by the Colorado Office of the State Auditor were brought to the attention of the
Development and Training Manager during the employee training program review.

Cause:
RTD's corrective action plans to improve RTD's supervisory practices were stopped due to the COVID pandemic's social distancing
requirements.

Risks:
Lack of skills of a supervisor to provide performance feedback to employees and communicate effectively with employees affects the
morale and performance of employees, thereby increasing the risk of employee turnover.
Lack of performance reviews for represented employees.

Recommendation:
Management should implement the corrective action plans to improve supervisory practices with training that includes how to provide
effective performance feedback, recognize operators' achievements, and communicate in a productive and constructive manner.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division has developed an agency-wide manager and supervisor training which will start on October
30, 2023 through June 30, 2024. This training addresses the corrective action recommended in the Colorado Office of the State Auditor
2020 report.
The division will provide additional manager and supervisor training that will continue throughout 2024.

Observation Title:

Risk Rating:

Safety and Environmental Compliance Training

High Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted that over 500 safety courses were procured from SafetySkills, a third-party safety-training provider and populated
in WLMS. The review of the Safety and Environmental Compliance training disclosed the following:
•
•
•

Some safety-sensitive employee training programs including Bus Operator, Commuter Rail, and LRV Maintenance have
incorporated safety-related courses in their training materials. However, the Safety and Environmental Division has not
conducted an internal assessment of these safety-training programs.
A specialized safety training to mitigate technical hazards in areas including heavy equipment operations, high-voltage
electrical procedures, confined space entry, and respiratory protection have not been developed.
New employees are not required to take safety courses during the new hire orientation.

Cause:
RTD did not enforce the guidelines outlined in the Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan.

Risks:
Failure to implement adequate safety measurements could result in noncompliance with mandatory safety regulations and RTD's safety
standards.

Recommendation:
Management should consider:
•
•

•

Implementing procedures for the internal assessment of the safety training programs administered by the different RTD's
divisions to ensure safety trainings are integrated and aligned with RTD's safety strategic plans.
Developing a comprehensive safety training that includes safety measures in safety-sensitive areas to ensure compliance with
federal and state safety regulations.
Requiring safety training during the new hire orientation process to ensure the new hires are knowledgeable about RTD's
safety requirements prior to starting their jobs.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division, engaging relevant agency subject matter experts (SMEs), will develop a learning and
development framework that includes a safety and compliance training plan for all RTD employees, new hires, and contractors.

Observation Title:
Employee Training Records

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
The review of training records evidencing enrollment and completion of the 10 selected employee training programs disclosed the
following:
•
•
•
•

Training records were not documented for the Customer Care employee training programs.
Sixteen new hires out of the randomly selected sample of 25 new hires did not complete the substance abuse training as of
September 2023.
Thirteen new hires out of the randomly selected sample of 15 new hires in safety-sensitive positions did not complete the
safety training as of September 2023.
Out of the 10 electro mechanics and services workers for the LRV Maintenance training, six did not have evidence of the
instructor’s sign-off, and their completion of the 90-Day training was less than 90 days; four electro mechanics did not
complete all the sections of the 90-Day LRV Maintenance training and four service workers did not have training records.

Cause:
RTD does not have a policy or procedures for requiring the documentation and retention of training records.

Risks:
Failure to keep proper training records could result in noncompliance with state and federal regulatory requirements and the ability to
demonstrate employees’ training progress.

Recommendation:
Management should consider:
•

•
•

Establishing a monitoring process to ensure that employees complete the required employee trainings.
Documenting the enrollment and completion of the training courses and maintain the training records to meet regulatory
requirements as well as for internal management or quality review.
Implementing standards for the training records documentation to include the trainee’s name, the enrolment date, the
completion date, duration of the training, assessment scores, instructor's name, and instructor sign-off.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop a procedure for documenting and retaining of employee training records with build
it in annual audits.

Cross-Training and Succession Training Programs

Risk Rating:
Low/Process Improvement

Internal Audit Observation:
A cross-training and succession planning strategy has not been developed as of September 2023. RTD's Strategic Plan 2021-2026 has
specified that a cross-training and succession planning should be developed.

Cause:
RTD does not have a policy for cross-training and succession planning.

Risks:
Lack of cross-training and succession planning strategies could result in loss of business continuity.

Recommendation:
Management should consider developing a cross-training strategy to train employee’s multiple skills outside of their usual job
responsibilities to increase their ability to work in different roles or functions within the organization and thereby ensure minimum
disruption to RTD's operation when there is a vacancy.
Management should also consider developing a succession planning strategy to ensure RTD's long-term growth.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
Human Resources will assess the need for developing a training succession plan for employees. Succession planning protocols will be
embedded in the overall learning and development framework referenced in Observation #1.
The Development and Learning Division will develop a cross-training plan for employees.

Employee Training Tracking

Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
WLMS System is not consistently utilized to track the enrollment and completion dates of employee training programs. Internal Audit
noted the training content, enrollment, and completion of the following five employee training programs were not maintained in WLMS:
•
•
•
•
•

Bus Operator
Dispatcher
Field Supervisor
Customer Care
Technical

Cause:
RTD does not have a policy requiring all employee training programs to be tracked in WLMS.

Risks:
Lack of a consistent tracking mechanism for employee training programs could lead to inability to achieve the agency's training goals
and objectives.

Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing a policy requiring all training materials, enrollment, and completion dates are tracked in
WLMS to ensure accurate, reliable, and consistent training data.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop a procedure for making Workday the standard of record for tracking all employee
training enrollments and completions.

1.B.1.c

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Observation Title:
Training Effectiveness Measurements

Risk Rating:
Moderate Priority

Internal Audit Observation:
Internal Audit noted some employee training programs incorporated tests and quizzes to assess how well employees grasped the
material. However, the form of employee training assessment was limited to test, quizzes, and did not include other forms of
assessment such as employee feedback, pre-and post-training assessments, and key performance indicators to evaluate the
effectiveness of the employee training programs.

Cause:
RTD has not established a process for evaluating the effectiveness of employee training programs.

Risks:
Failure to evaluate training effectiveness could result in increased business costs and compliance issues.

Recommendation:
Management should consider establishing metrics for measuring evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of training by utilizing
methods such as employee feedback, pre-and post-training assessments, surveys, and key performance indicators to determine the
effectiveness of employee training programs.

Management Corrective Action Plan:
The Development and Learning Division will develop learning and development training metrics and key performance indicators aligned
with RTD’s strategic plan, competencies, and training requirements.

Responsibility:
Melissa McDowell, Manager, Development and Training Division

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Report ratings are utilized to communicate the aggregate compliance or risk observed for the in-scope location, process, or system.

Satisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are generally in compliance with applicable policies and procedures.
The design and effectiveness of internal controls appear to be adequate. Exceptions noted were
isolated and/or minor, and departures from leading practices are minimal (as applicable).

Needs Improvement

The in-scope areas of the project, although generally in compliance with policies and procedures, have
certain deficiencies with the design or effectiveness of internal controls, which should be improved.
Some departures from leading practices have been identified, creating opportunities for process or
efficiency improvement or for improved financial statement accuracy.

Unsatisfactory

The in-scope areas of the project are in substantial non-compliance with policies and procedures, and
the design or effectiveness of internal controls is not adequate. Multiple and/or significant departures
from leading practice may be present, creating operational inefficiency. If such deficiencies are not
corrected, the company can be exposed to loss or financial misstatement.

Appendix 2: Report Rating Definitions

1.B.1.c

Report No. 2023-03 Employee Training Program Review
Internal Audit Report
Issued: October 25, 2023

Risk/Impact: Observation that presents a high risk to the agency and/or is of high importance to business
success/achievement of goals. Conditions exist or situations could occur which could have a significant adverse
impact (i.e., financial, reputational, etc.) to the business. Significant audit observations may include conditions
dealing with irregularities, illegal acts, financial reporting errors, inefficiencies, waste, ineffectiveness, conflicts
of interest, and control weaknesses. In addition, an observation is considered High Priority if a finding creates
a large exposure that could result in a loss of system control, access, application control, and/or exposure of
data via the compromise of administrative accounts and/or other system functions. It could also create an
exposure of confidentiality or integrity.

High Priority

The relevant risks associated with the observation may be considered high due to one or more of the following
conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Significant financial impact for location/site audited
Prevalence of issues or exceptions
Circumvention of controls, Management wrong-doing and/or willful disregard of company policy or
regulatory requirements
Non-compliance with US/Local laws or regulations
Disruption to operations and/or significant reputational exposures
Unremediated previously identified control observations or a history of similar issues, although minor,
may be considered a high priority classification.

Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective action is required within three months, or other time period deemed
reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Moderate
Priority

Risk/Impact: The observation in the report relates to ineffective or insufficient controls to manage key
business risks. The risks associated could lead to financial statement errors and losses, operational
inefficiencies (including financial system and IT issues), or result in instances of policy and regulatory noncompliance as well as potential reputational damages, fines, and penalties.
Urgency of Action Plan: Corrective actions should be implemented within the next six months, or other time
period deemed reasonable by both Management and Internal Audit.

Low Priority /
Process
Improvement

Risk/Impact: Other findings identified during fieldwork that are isolated or minor control gaps for business
cycles not in-scope for the audit, observations to improve financial and/or operational efficiency, or are
designed to assist management in improving the operating capacity of the department and/or activity. These
recommendations do not impact the overall rating.
Urgency of Action Plan: While not necessarily a priority, corrective action should occur within the next
12 months.
