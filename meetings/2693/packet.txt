Overall Performance Comments
General comments and observations from the last period:
• Consistent message and delivery; focused on long-term goal of opening and expanding FasTracks program while creating ways to
attract and retain employees in challenging job market that is affecting various industrial sectors.
• Once again, PLEASE make reference to the prior CRITICAL SCORING NOTE above. To wit, the GM is meeting my very high
expectations.
• I believe Dave is a great communicator, and has done very well dealing with the difficult FasTracks problems with the A line and N
line.
• Obviously the elephant in the room is the University of Colorado A line- It is so important to continue to our efforts to get FRA and
PUC approval
• There continues to be a need to resolve the issues with the operation of the Eagle Project. It continues to be an issue of ridicule and
disappointment within my community. I am impatient with the seeming unresponsiveness that I perceive from he FRA and the CPUC
and wonder if staff should be doing more to resolve the issue.
• The factors that have delayed unconditional approval for operating and testing commuter rail will need continued focus for resolution
• Already Stated enough examples.
• I appreciate the directive that Mobility Choice must have open proceedings and full transparency. Updates regarding commuter rail
are good. Bus driver vacancies looking better.
• GM Genova continues to improve and lead this Agency through a difficult period.

Change in Performance Comments
Comments regarding change in performance ratings:
• There has been a great deal of progress on the Eagle project.
• GM has consistently proved he is very capable of handling various situations that threaten fulfillment of agency's goals and
mission.
• Dave's performance remains competent and strong.
• It is critically important that you understand the reasons for the score of "3" on this measure. I have been on the Board since
January of this year. During that time the GM has consistently demonstrated extremely high skills and abilities. In my experience
he started out very strong and has remained very strong. When someone is doing an excellent job, "3" is probably the best score
that person could receive. That is the case here, from my perspective.
• Dave has exhibited leadership and maintained a certain calm in dealing with many complex issues. He doesn't seem to get rattled
or irritated.
• New on Board. Nothing to compare with.
• RTD seems to be operating as usual with fairly good performance measures.
• I did not participate in the last review. I'm not able to determine if it improved or declined
• I did not evaluate the GM last time and so am not comfortable with indicating an improvement or not.
• "General Manager Genova failed to meet the goals of the G-Line opening as well as resolving the FRA issues and legal issues
surrounding DTP. Furthermore the delay of a year or more for the North Metro Line is completely unacceptable."
• Day to day operations are being covered. Hiring has improved with some ups and downs. A-Line is challenging. I think Dave is
more realistic in his presentations than the former GM.
• GM Genova continues to bring his "A" game to the table.

Other, specified.
• I wish finishing FasTracks was a goal with personal intensity.
• While District has some growing pains, it's remarkable how much is being accomplished. To build one project at a time might have been less disruptive, it would have risked taking advantage of
available grant programs that may not h[appen].
• Like to see strong push towards graduation with DBE/SBE firms. Even a time limit on being in the program. This may need board policy changes and I would favor that.

Other, specified:
• Because there is no comment box for this question on this form (Make note for future iterations of this survey!), I want to add that I think that the GM does a fine job on all these areas, but I place particular
emphasis on these and note that there is ALWAYS room for improvement on ALL of the measures noted above, and especially as to these critical functions.
• How many hours in the day does Dave have to devote to RTD? I feel Dave has done an exceptional job for RTD and has improved from what I felt was an outstanding performance last year
• 1. DBE/SBE needs to be revised to force graduation after certain time. 2. Concerned about too many projects in the works. Too many new plans in the works that will require money that isn't available.

Comments for Upcoming Period
General comments and direction for the upcoming period:
• Focus will be on employee retention and employee relations as CBA discussions ramp up; dealing with impacts of
SB-267; opening G Line and removing crossing guards along University of Colorado A Line.
• I would like more vision, if possible, imagining where the Agency will be going into the future, and helping it get
there. Also, Id like to see work creatively trying to get FasTracks finished sooner rather than later, in spite of the
financial troubles.
• As stated above, some areas are of particular importance for a GM/CEO. The most critical of these are
communication: with the public, with the Board, with the Senior Leadership Team, with staff, with represented
employees.
• SEE ABOVE, but looming is our labor negotiations, which will be difficult at best!!
• Needs to concentrate on upcoming labor contract.
• I would like to see some aggressiveness in opening the G Line this year. RTD is loosing face over this issue.
• I appreciate your leadership qualities, your approachability, and your patience. The 2nd half of the year looks to
be just as, if not more, challenging than the 1st.
• General Manager Genova needs to articulate a clear and well disclosed vision for the direction RTD needs to
accomplish our goals. The GM fails to inspire due to his lack of vision.
• Tighten our financial belt even more. Forecasts are requiring it.
• Continue to focus on the customer experience and improve ridership.
