### B. Review General Manager's Mid Year Assessment

Committee Chair Francone thanked the committee members for attending and for reviewing the packet.

Director Sisk asked whether the committee would meet with General Manager Genova the following week and how the information from this committee would be disseminated to him.

Barbara McManus, Executive Manager of the Board Office, said that the committee members would fill out the goals chart, which General Manager Genova and the remaining Directors would also receive.

Director Sisk stated that the meeting was open and that the information could be shared.

Chair Hoy said that the goals chart is a dynamic document. He said that the performance review is a process that takes a year.

Ms. McManus said that the committee’s review is an incremental measure of where the General Manager stands to date. She stated that the committee would have the opportunity the following week to meet with General Manager Genova and give him direction. She said that previously staff would submit updates quarterly but noted that Heather McKillop, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant General Manager of Finance and Administration, had been collecting responses monthly in an effort to keep everything current.

Committee Chair Francone started the review process with Core Goal #1.

Ms. McManus suggested that the committee read the goal and do a cursory review of the accomplishments required for the General Manager to have met or exceeded his performance goals, unless a Director specifically felt that he needed to improve on a particular area.

Director Anderson stated that the G Line was supposed to be in operation in 2016. She said she did not know whether that was the General Manager’s problem but commented that her community was upset. She said she felt they did not receive successful delivery of transit services but noted that the Federal Railroad Administration did not approve the line.

Director Deadwyler commented on the noise from the University of Colorado A Line. She said she did not know if that was the General Manager’s responsibility but stated the agency did not give the local constituents the quiet zones that they were promised.

Director Anderson said the quiet zones are the purview of the cities and not RTD. She said the cities have to apply for quiet zones and would not hold the General Manager accountable for that.

Director Broom said that the Board was properly notified of the reasons the G Line opening was falling behind. He said that he was confused as to why the line was so far behind. He attributed the delay to software problems with crossing gates on the University of Colorado A Line and said it was the contractor’s responsibility to fix the problems.

Chair Hoy mentioned that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) was meeting that day regarding the Eagle P3 Project. He said that the FRA had paralysis on making a decision on the operation of the University of Colorado A Line, because they have been doing things the same way since the 1800’s. He said there had been some internal problems with the FRA because of how hard RTD had pushed them.

Committee Chair Francone said that the agency was in the same spot last year because R Line had not yet opened.

Director Anderson said that the R Line was not scheduled to open until January.

Director Broom stated that, from the City of Aurora’s perspective, the opening went well.

Committee Chair Francone said that the members had discussed that certain lines were not opened on time. She said that the evaluation criteria did not include a specific criterion for the opening of a particular line.

Chair Hoy agreed and said that the goals were not that defined.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the committee would agree that, while some delays were based on issues with the University of Colorado A Line, there is a question of responsibility. She said that, at the end of the day, the person responsible is the General Manager.

Director Deadwyler said that the University of Colorado A Line gate crossings were not fixed and that she had been stuck at one several times.

Committee Chair Francone said that she receives a text from her nephew every time he sees a crossing at which the front gate lowers down but back gate does not.

Chair Hoy said the gates operate that way by design in order to allow drivers out of the crossing and that the gates’ operation depends on the timing of two trains coming from two separate directions.

Director Anderson said that the gates come down too soon, before drivers can see or hear the train.

Director Broom said that, from a practical standpoint, the crossings are not completed, which means that General Manager Genova cannot receive the highest score but rather scores somewhere in the middle.

Chair Hoy asked whether the goal would be achieved if the FRA said that the gates are running as well as possible.

Director Anderson said the goal would be achieved in that case.

Director Sisk said that the committee was jumping ahead and must consider the goals as they stand at that point. He said the committee was conducting a mid-year examination. He said that he did not hear from the committee members that the General Manager had exceeded expectations on that particular goal and that the General Manager is ultimately responsible for the operation of the line. He said that the Board should also take responsibility for setting standards that are too high and accepting staff proposals to open five lines within a year.

Committee Chair Francone said that the five line openings were an issue from the previous year.

Director Sisk said the agency is still dealing with that issue.

Ms. McManus suggested focusing on the “achieved” and “exceeded” goals as General Manager Genova presented them in his self-evaluation.

Committee Chair Francone said that, for goal #1, General Manager Genova has achieved at least 80% of Board-adopted performance standards.

Director Anderson stated that the Women’s March was a huge success and that the event was larger than a Broncos game. She said that no one complained to her saying that the agency did not meet their expectations.

Director Deadwyler stated that the Broncos Ride was a mess when buses did not show up. She said the expectation was that buses would arrive and bring passengers to the game, which did not happen.

Director Broom said that the transit system is built to meet its needs and that the agency cannot have resources that are not used 90% of the time.

Director Anderson noted that, on the night Director Deadwyler referred to, the agency also dealt with a Rockies game and rush-hour traffic.

Director Menten said that rider alerts were issued.

Director Sisk said that this occurred on September 9th, 2017.

Ms. McManus noted that the events took place after the General Manager had submitted his self-evaluation, which the committee received on August 23rd, 2017, and were not included in that document.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the agency was overpromising service.

Committee Chair Francone said that the delivery of service for special events is an “exceeds goal” criterion.

Director Menten noted that the agency receives attendance estimates for certain special events based on the number of people identified in the permit request. She asked whether the agency had a process to identify other events with high attendance and stated that, even with all the vehicles in the world, the agency does not have enough drivers.

Chair Hoy said that RTD was aware of the number of people requiring service that day.

Committee Chair Francone noted that the City and County of Denver coordinates with the police department on attendance estimates.

Director Deadwyler asked how long in advance the agency knew and whether the agency should alert customers if it is known that the system cannot handle the anticipated ridership.

Director Anderson said she heard such a warning on the radio.

Director Deadwyler said that there is an expectation that the buses will be there. She asked when the agency should warn the public.

Director Broom said that there would not be a public announcement that certain routes would be impacted and said that he could not see a way to get the notification to each impacted individual.

Director Deadwyler said the agency could have put out an alert stating that schedules had changed.

Committee Chair Francone noted that the agency does not have the resources to make other arrangements.

Director Deadwyler responded that she would make other arrangements if she were told in advance that Access-a-Ride service would not be available on certain dates.

Committee Chair Francone asked how the committee should go about completing the General Manager’s performance review chart.

Ms. McManus suggested that the committee could go over the each of the items listed on the chart from bottom to top and review General Manager’s answers on his self-evaluation.

Chair Hoy explained that his individual vote would be included in the consensus vote for a given goal.

Committee Chair Francone said that she felt General Manager Genova achieved over 85% of Board-approved performance, and the committee agreed. She asked whether the committee agreed that the General Manager “creates, collaborates, explains, and implements” local area service standards and “presents a plan to not reduce service standards”, and the committee agreed. She also asked about the requirement to monitor the performance of Denver Transit Partners, and the committee agreed he met this goal as well.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the committee felt the General Manager had exceeded 90% of performance measures.

Director Anderson said the General Manager himself claimed to have met 85% of performance measures. She said he has stated that he completed other accomplishments but had not met the 90% mark.

Chair Hoy agreed and noted that the General Manager may yet achieve other goals later in the year.

Committee Chair Francone noted that the General Manager’s review covered the period up to August and has the rest of the year to achieve his goals, and the committee concurred the General Manager had not achieved 90% of performance goals.

Regarding the goal of providing “outstanding and noteworthy service for all major RTD-supported special events…in addition to providing normally scheduled service”, Committee Chair Francone asked whether anyone felt the General Manager had not met that goal.

Chair Hoy said he felt the General Manager had not met that goal.

Director Sisk answered that he was ambivalent but did note the service the agency provided for the Women’s March in January, which he felt would put the General Manager over the top. He said he would be a yes.

Director Walker initially said he leaned toward a yes vote. He noted there had been some problems with normal service but could not say how big of an impact there had been. He said he would be a no on the goal.

Committee Chair Francone declared the committee’s consensus was that the General Manager achieved the goal but did not exceed expectations.

Director Anderson commented that the term “mission creep” came to mind. She suggested that the committee could focus more on the agency’s mission and not on providing extra service. She said the Board expected top performance on everything the agency does but noted the systemic problems of being able to hire enough people in an economy with a 2.4% unemployment rate.

Director Broom said that the hiring issue was a long-term problem.

Director Anderson said that hiring had not been that much of a problem until the previous two years.

Director Sisk said that he had a different impression, that special services affect individuals who are also RTD’s constituents and who may have used RTD’s services only once. He said that the committee need not pit constituents against one another and that the last thing he wanted was for RTD to be seen as anti-Broncos. He cautioned that the agency must be careful with its messaging. He said there are concerns over mission creep and over-promising and stated that the agency has an opportunity to do a better job announcing when services are projected to be over capacity.

Director Walker said that he struggled with the special services review criterion. He noted that every industry is having trouble filling positions. He said RTD does a good job of providing regular service but noted that dropped services were unusual until a couple of years ago. He said that, if this were unique to RTD, that would be one thing, but he did not want to hold the General Manager accountable to something beyond his control. He said the agency does a good job of communicating capacity problems.

Director Anderson noted that she has constituents who only use RTD’s services to go to Broncos games.

Director Deadwyler said her concern was that staff should do a better job making strategic plans in advance, rather than last-minute adjustments.

Committee Chair Francone continued on to Core Goal #2, regarding strong ethical leadership. She asked if anyone thought the General Manager needed improvement.

Director Deadwyler asked whether any new vision statement has been presented to the Board.

Chair Hoy said that the Board established its strategic goals and policies and that they remained the same from 2017 to 2018, because they were core to what RTD does.

Chair Hoy and Directors Broom and Anderson agreed that General Manager Genova achieved the goal, and Director Sisk suggested he had exceeded it.

Committee Chair Francone stated the committee agreed that he at least achieved the goal and read the “exceeds expectation” criteria.

Directors Broom and Sisk and Chair Hoy agreed that the General Manager’s achievements fit those criteria, and Director Walker noted his participation at the Rail~Volution conference that had just taken place in Denver.

Committee Chair Francone noted that, while it is a feather in the agency’s cap to receive national recognition, she questioned whether the agency is focused on the delivery of its services. She asked whether national recognition is an attribute the agency wants.

Director Broom noted that federal grantors watch for such recognition.

Director Sisk said that Committee Chair Francone’s point was well taken and cautioned not to forget the people the agency serves. He said the committee could incorporate local service into the next year’s goals.

Director Walker stated that one of the reasons the agency is so respected is that it does provide great service. He noted that an overall on-time performance rating of over 85% is something many other large transit agencies cannot claim.

Committee Chair Francone discussed Core Goal #3, regarding strong financial management, and said there was no question that the General Manager had achieved those goals.

Chair Hoy said the agency’s financial reporting and controls are the best he had ever seen.

Director Broom commented that someone, somewhere had not anticipated the loss of marijuana tax revenue.

Director Anderson stated that the agency’s lobbyists were asleep at the switch.

Chair Hoy said that may be true but stated that everybody had missed it.

Committee Chair Francone said that she had met privately with Brandeberry McKenna Public Affairs (BBMK) and rebuked them for missing the problem. She said that BBMK admitted that they had missed it but said that had everyone else had as well.

Director Deadwyler said she was glad that Committee Chair Francone had spoken to BBMK. She said she had heard that other people told legislators about the oversight but were ignored.

Director Sisk asked whether this changed the committee’s evaluation of Core Goal #3.

Chair Hoy said no and pointed out that he had recently signed refinancing documents that saved the agency $50 million.

Committee Chair Francone noted the agency’s aggressive pursuit of grants as well and asked whether everyone agreed that the General Manager had exceeded expectations on the goal, to which the committee agreed. She then moved to Core Goal #4, regarding equal opportunity employment, affirmative action, and small and disadvantaged businesses.

Director Anderson said she thought the General Manager had exceeded expectations.

Committee Chair Francone said that he had achieved the goal.

Director Anderson noted that the agency’s triennial review pushed the General Manager into “exceeds expectations”, because the review helps the agency to get grants.

Director Deadwyler said that she wished the goal regarding the utilization of disadvantaged businesses had been worded differently, stating instead that the General Manager “employs” such businesses rather than “considers” them in applicable purchasing decisions.

Chair Hoy relayed that he had spoken with a contractor who was very excited about the program.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether the committee felt the General Manager had achieved the goal, to which everyone agreed, and stated that she did not see anywhere in the goal where he did not exceed expectations.

Director Sisk said that the General Manager only needed to reach one “exceeds expectations” criterion.

Chair Hoy said that the head of the triennial review team called him personally to say that RTD is a great organization.

Committee Chair Francone said that, looking at other agencies, RTD is good at what it does and that General Manager Genova is honest about his assessment of the agency.

Director Deadwyler agreed that General Manager Genova was transparent when speaking about the agency’s finances at the Rail~Volution conference.

Director Sisk said he was not aware that the General Manager met the criterion that stated that the district had been lauded locally or nationally.

Committee Chair Francone proceeded to Core Goal #5, regarding community outreach. She said she wished the General Manager met with the Directors more on an individual basis but said it was probably her failing for not asking him to do so more. She stated that General Manager Genova has always been responsive to email and phone calls but said she would like it if he held more meetings in Jefferson County. She asked whether anyone disagreed that he had achieved his goals.

Chair Hoy stated that General Manager Genova may not meet enough in Jefferson County but holds meetings in the north all the time. He said that stakeholders have too many demands on the General Manager’s time, so he has to rely on team members to get things done.

Committee Chair Francone stated that General Manager Genova has said he would attend any meeting he is asked to.

Director Sisk said that the Directors should be careful of their individual demands on the General Manager. He said there is a matter of balancing and stated that the General Manager meets with Chair Hoy on a weekly basis. He said he has heard time and again that General Manager Genova does a great job visiting with employees.

Director Anderson said that General Manager Genova has responded to local requests and that she does not like to take up his time, because he has a lot on his plate. She noted that the Board can speak to the Chair if there are any problems.

Director Deadwyler said that General Manager Genova has been in his position for almost two years and has met with him only once, but she noted that he has always given her an immediate response by phone when necessary.

Chair Hoy said he thought that calls count.

Director Sisk asked whether the committee felt that the General Manager exceeded expectations on this goal, and the members agreed.

Committee Chair Francone moved on to Task Goal #1, regarding fiscal sustainability. She said that just because she did not like the budget that was presented does not mean that it was not balanced. She said that the General Manager had achieved his goal.

Director Anderson said that unbalanced budgets do not happen in Colorado in any agency.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether everyone felt the General Manager had achieved his goal, and the committee members agreed.

Director Deadwyler asked whether General Manager Genova has the final say on service changes and said she hoped he had looked at them thoroughly.

Ms. McManus said that nothing gets to the Board without the General Manager’s approval. She said that one item had slipped through, and it was a big one. She stated that the General Manager moves items forward for review by the Executive Committee.

Committee Chair Francone said that, by General Manager Genova’s own assessment, has not exceeded in this area.

Director Broom said that nothing is being done about the union pension plan and that it will haunt the district. He said that he does not believe the agency would earn enough money to operate additional light rail corridors after they are opened. He said that there are not enough sales taxes to operate the lines and that the agency will be forced to cut bus or rail service. He said that budgets can always be balanced by cutting them down.

Director Sisk questioned whether Director Broom’s concerns would fall under the next task goal.

Director Menten said that the district bears responsibility for the union pension plan but has no oversight. She said she had heard from union employees that they are not having an honest discussion about their financial situation. She said that union employees only pay 4% into their pension plans, compared to 14% for RTD employees.

Director Anderson said that it is the union’s plan and they have to step up.

Director Broom said the agency is not stepping up.

Director Anderson said that the union had to be convinced.

Director Deadwyler said that the union does not get it or pretends not to.

Director Broom said that it is not right when an employee works for 35 years and only receives 40% of what was promised.

Director Menten stated that there needs to be a response from the other side, so that the agency would have oversight over the union’s pension board.

Director Broom said that, in his time with municipal government, he faced the same issue with the fire and police pensions. He said that it is not in anyone’s interest not to fix those kinds of things. He noted that the stock market had 8 or 9 years of good returns and that bad times are probably ahead.

Director Deadwyler asked whether the Board should take a stand.

Director Anderson said she did not think so personally, because that is union business.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether it is appropriate to issue a guiding document or recommended action to issue a statement for individuals engaged in contract negotiations.

Director Broom said that the Board could give the General Manager or negotiators instructions to concentrate on talking to the union to fix the pension problems together. He said there should be some agreement that the parties would work with the district to deal with the problem.

Director Deadwyler said that the union wants more from RTD.

Director Broom said the union needs to come back to table.

Director Deadwyler said that things can go downhill during a five-year contract.

Director Broom asked how the union can renege if they agree to contribute more to pension plan.

Committee Chair Francone said that the union pension fell under Task Goal #2, concerning Workforce & Human Capital. She suggested that the union pension could be an item for the following year.

Director Broom said that Colorado’s Public Employees’ Retirement Association (PERA) is in the news all the time and said that RTD does not want to be in the news.

Committee Chair Francone asked whether General Manager Genova had achieved Task Goal #2. She said that the Board received an email from the union’s president about a missed meeting with the union and asked whether it was relevant.

Director Sisk said he did not think so and that it is inappropriate to contact the Board while he is negotiating with the General Manager.

Director Menten said that the email included a “Driver’s Bill of Rights”, which she saw as a warning shot. She asked who was on the negotiating team.

Ms. McManus said that she would send that information to the Board.

Director Deadwyler said the email stated the operators’ work-life balance is off.

Director Anderson said that operators are pushing up against the federal limits and said that unfortunately they can work a lot before they reach the limit.

Director Deadwyler commented that operators say they are being forced to work.

Committee Chair Francone said that, by the General Manager’s own self-assessment, he has achieved the goal but not exceeded. She asked whether anyone felt General Manager Genova had failed in any aspect of the goal, and the committee members answered that he had achieved his goal.

Director Sisk said that it is important to send General Manager Genova a message that the Board is concerned about this issue.

Committee Chair Francone said that the General Manager has not fulfilled the first item under the goal but noted that, because the review is a mid-year assessment, he has an opportunity to rectify his rating.

Director Sisk noted that the General Manager’s task his difficult because he cannot tell the Board what he is doing.

Director Walker said that he had informed the Board in the past. He suggested that going forward the Directors can include in the review that they have concerns about the union pension.

Committee Chair Francone said that, when she looks at the agency’s employment statistics, the ratio of salaried to represented staff is almost two-to-one, which she said seemed to be an imbalance. She asked why two staff members are needed to manage one driver or mechanic. She said she understands that it is difficult to train and recruit operators and mechanics but suggested that it is time to try something different. She said the General Manager has achieved but not exceeded this goal and moved on to the last goal, Task Goal #3, State of Good Repair. She said there was no doubt he had achieved his goal.

Director Deadwyler said she had an issue with the first criterion because of something she heard regarding bus customers who use mobility devices. She said that an RTD employee gave a presentation and stated that, in the event of an emergency, the customer would be evacuated from the bus, but there was no guarantee that the person’s mobility equipment would be evacuated.

Director Anderson said that bus operators should not be required to lift someone in the event of an emergency in which emergency responders are called. She said such a situation happened in Arvada.

Director Broom said asked whether a bus operator would be expected to help someone off if a bus were on fire.

Director Anderson said that operators do a great job of working with persons with disabilities.

Director Broom said that, on the mall shuttle or elsewhere, operators have to put the ramp down.

Director Deadwyler reiterated that the RTD employee who gave the presentation could not guarantee a person’s mobility equipment would be evacuated and said that people are looking for answers about how to evacuate.

Director Sisk said the Board could ask the person who gave presentation what was said. He said he has always thought of General Manager Genova of being safety first and had no question that he had achieved the goal.

Committee Chair Francone said that General Manager Genova stated in his self-assessment that RTD had been recognized as an industry leader in asset management and had initiated the International Standards Organization (ISO) process. She asked whether the committee agreed that he had at least achieved the goal.

Director Anderson agreed that the General Manager exceeded expectations because RTD is a leader in the industry in State of Good Repair issues, because the agency sets the standards, and because the General Manager has fostered a safety culture. She said that Director Deadwyler’s concern is important but had nothing to do with the goal.

Committee Chair Francone agreed.

Director Menten asked whether the Board received an update on the revised performance management program.

Ms. McManus said the information was presented the previous year and was implemented in January 2017.

Director Menten asked whether the Board received a household transportation study in a Board agenda.

Director Francone said that the study may have been put out by the Denver Regional Council of Governments.
