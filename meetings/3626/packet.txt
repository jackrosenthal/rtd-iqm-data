BOARD OF DIRECTORS REPORT
Committee Meeting Date:
Allied Universal Security Services Contract Third Option
Year

April 17, 2024
Board Meeting Date:
April 30, 2024

RECOMMENDED ACTION
For the Board of Directors to authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO), or her designee, to
execute the third and final option year of the existing security services contract with Allied Universal
Security Services (AUS), including amendments discussed below, for a total cost not to exceed
$21,012,715.
STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Dr. Joel Fitzgerald, Chief of Police and Emergency Management
PRESENTATION LENGTH
5 minutes
BACKGROUND
The current RTD security model consists of internal police officers, secondary employment police
officers from local jurisdictions, and contracted security officers to provide security for RTD customers,
facilities, and property.
On July 11, 2019, following a comprehensive procurement process, AUS was awarded a three-year
contract with three one-year options to provide system-wide security services. The initial contract term
expired June 30, 2022, and RTD executed the first option year term from July 1, 2022, to June 30,
2023. The second option year was executed from July 1, 2023, to June 30, 2024, following approval
by the Board on May 31, 2023. A third and final option year term would further extend the contract
from July 1, 2024, to June 30, 2025.
Some of the services AUS provides under the contract terms include but are not limited to:
•

•

•

Critical infrastructure security at RTD facilities, bus terminals and rail stations
o Security officers currently provide security at Denver Union Station, Civic Center,
Downtown Boulder Station, Blake Street administrative offices and other locations that
experience large groups of customers and employees to provide high visibility and
deterrence to criminal activity
Fare enforcement on rail and bus vehicles
o Security officers conduct daily fare checks and continuously engage in customer education
efforts targeting the importance of paying for public transportation, and issue citations and
warnings to those who are not in compliance with fare requirements
Patrol services at RTD facilities, rail platforms, bus shelters, and Park-n-Rides

Packet Pg. 3

1.D.1

Security officers are placed in strategic posts to reduce and deter criminal activities and
provide a customer service approach to assisting customers on directions
Enhanced security presence during large-scale events related to an increase in RTD customer
ridership
o Security officers provide assistance with crowd control and with guiding customers to and
from special events that people utilize public transportation to attend
Federally required commuter rail second crewmember duties and responsibilities
o Security officers perform security and fare enforcement functions as well as ensure a
second crewmember is available for commuter rail trains to provide consistent service,
federal safety compliance, and on-time performance
o

DISCUSSION
Staff recommends that the Board authorize the GM/CEO to execute the third and final option year with
AUS to continue providing system-wide security services. During the term of the contract, AUS has
fulfilled the contract requirements to a satisfactory level.
In addition to exercising the final option year, the below contract amendments are recommended.
•
•

•

•

Quarterly reduction of staffing hours beginning in Q2 of the contract option year, resulting in an
overall 31% reduction in contracted security services by June 30, 2025
Addition of security services at RTD facilities:
o East Metro Bus Division
o Elati Light Rail Facility
o Boulder Bus Division
o Platte Street Facility
Increased hourly wage rates for armed and unarmed security services
o Armed Security Services – Transit Security Officer:
Wage level: $27.46 (current rate: $23.87)
Hourly billing rate: $43.72 (current rate: $39.10)
o Unarmed Security Services – Transit Security Specialist:
Wage level: $23.21(current rate: $21.50)
Hourly billing rate: $34.19 (current rate: $31.67)
Establish a direct contact for all issues related to commuter rail security services

The above proposed amendments are anticipated to enhance overall contract performance and coverage
in the final year as RTD continues to shift its resource allocation to increase its internal police force and
decrease its reliance upon contracted security services. Hourly wage increases are supported by market
data and intended to improve recruitment and retention.
In adopting this recommended action, the agency seeks to meet the 2021-2026 Strategic Plan priorities
of Community Value and Customer Excellence. Specifically:
• The perceived value of RTD in terms of Community Value would be enhanced through:

Packet Pg. 4

1.D.1

o Recruitment and retention of contracted security personnel to support RTD Police
throughout the service area, yielding a greater sense of employee, customer, and overall
community security
• Increased Customer Excellence would be achieved through the continued ability of RTD Police
Department to deploy unarmed security guards on commuter rail services, thereby improving
system reliability and decreasing delays
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The financial impact associated with the adoption of the recommended action is $21,012,715, of which
$10,506,357 will be accounted for within the FY2024 Budget. The remaining funds require
incorporation into the FY2025 Budget.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
2023 Safety Performance Review

April 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVES
Dan McClain, Chief Safety Officer, Senior Manager, Safety and Environmental Compliance
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
At RTD, the safety of customers and employees is paramount; work is constantly underway to create a
safe transit environment. As the recipient of federal funds for transit operations, RTD is subject to
federal rules and regulations regarding system safety. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the
Federal Transit Administration (FTA) require transit agencies to develop safety management systems
describing their approach to safety and compliance with federal safety rules and regulations. The FRA
governs commuter rail and the FTA governs light rail. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration
(FMCSA) governs bus.
FRA
The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 directed the FRA to promulgate new safety regulations. Those
regulations are governed by the FRA’s Office of Railroad Safety. The Office of Railroad Safety has nine
Safety Management Teams throughout the country that serve as liaisons between the FRA and senior
leadership of railroad operators. RTD is assigned to Safety Management Team 7: Commuter West.
Additionally, the FRA requires agencies to have a System Safety Program Plan (SSPP) focused on
reducing railroad accidents, incidents, injuries, and fatalities.
The FRA regulations distinguish between reportable and recordable accidents or incidents. Reporting
requirements under the SSPP fall under three categories:
•
•

•

Highway rail grade crossing incident: Any impact between on-track equipment and highway user
at a highway rail-grade crossing
Train accident: Any collision, derailment, fire, explosion, act of God, or other event involving
operation of rail on-track equipment that results in reportable damages greater than the reporting
threshold, which is $11,500 for 2023
Casualties: Any death of a railroad employee or injury, occupational illness of a railroad employee
not associated with train accidents or highway rail grade incidents

Recordable events are memorialized at the agency level. They are defined as a train accident or incident
not meeting the reporting threshold or employee injury not involving lost time or medical treatment.

Packet Pg. 22

1.E.2

FTA
While the FTA retains the regulatory authority for bus and light rail, it has delegated its responsibilities as
the State Safety Oversight Agency to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). In that role, the
CPUC governs the agency’s required Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP). The PTASP
must include processes and procedures to implement Safety Management Systems (SMS). SMS is a
comprehensive, collaborative approach that brings together management and labor to control risk and to
detect and correct safety problems. The SMS is informed by safety performance goals set against
realistic, data-driven safety performance indictors and targets.
DISCUSSION
Regarding 2023 safety data:
On-the-Job Injuries (OJIs)
OJIs increased by 68% in 2023. This significant increase is due mostly to reported exposure to illicit
drug smoke. Of the 718 first reports of injury, 49.58% (356) were from exposure to illicit drug smoke.
This has increased the total cases per 100 employees to 30.04, up from 19.55 in 2022. Eighty-three
percent of the exposures to illicit drug smoke result in “record only” claims which means no medical cost
or lost time is paid from workers’ compensation. The next leading causes of OJIs are attributable to
slips, trips, falls and strains. Additionally, there was a 41% improvement in lost time days due to OJIs.
Starting in January 2021, the FTA required transit agencies to report assaults to the National Transit
Database (NTD) using a new definition of assault from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These assaults
are categorized by three areas: type of worker, type of assault, and location. During 2023, RTD
experienced 371 assaults.
Commuter Rail
During 2023, for the entirety of the commuter rail system, there were 25 reportable accidents and
incidents.
Commuter Rail Operations also tracks rule violations, station overruns, near misses, and trespasser
incidents. In 2023, commuter rail experienced 56 rule violations and station overruns, compared to 49
for 2022. Commuter Rail Operations experienced 94 near misses in 2023, compared with 57 in 2022.
In addition to complying with safety reporting requirements, the FRA also frequently conducts audits and
inspections to verify the safety of the commuter rail system. In 2023, RTD experienced 48 defects, and
three violations, an increase from 33 defects and zero violations in 2022.
Light Rail
During 2023, Light Rail Operations experienced 24 reportable events, down from 46 in 2022. Under
CPUC regulation, the agency must report within two hours events concerning:
•

A fatality at the scene; or where a person is confirmed dead within 30 days of the accident

Packet Pg. 23

1.E.2

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Serious injuries requiring immediate medical attention
Substantial property damage resulting from a collision involving a rail transit vehicle
An evacuation due to life safety reasons
A collision at a grade crossing resulting in a serious injury or fatality
Any derailment of a rail transit vehicle
A runaway train
A collision between a rail transit vehicle and a second rail transit vehicle, or a rail transit nonrevenue vehicle

Most reportable events are attributable to grade crossing collisions, which can occur anywhere on the
system where the rail and street intersect at the same grade. Most grade crossing collisions occur in the
downtown Denver loop in the Central Business District, throughout which trains operate in “street
running” fashion and the right-of-way is unprotected by gates. The agency continues to see improved
performance concerning red signal violations. In 2023, there were 25 such violations, as compared to
28 in 2022.
In June 2022, the CPUC issued a new 24-hour reporting requirement for nine types of hazards:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Activation failure, partial activation, or false activation of a highway-rail grade crossing warning
system
Broken rail causing impassable track
Broken messenger or contact wire, or overhead contact/catenary system wire
Train separation (train uncoupling) in revenue service
Incapacitated train operator in revenue service
Red signal violations
Vehicle door opening on wrong side, opening away from station platforms, or opening during train
movement
Near miss collision with employee, contractor, or other individual including trespassers on the rail
right-of-way
Any other hazard that meets a defined high risk or serious risk assessment code

For 2023, the agency reported 80 hazards, as compared to 54 in 2022.
Bus
Related to the metric of preventable accidents, in 2023 there were 749 bus accidents, of which 404
were preventable. For 2022, there were 638 accidents of which 319 were preventable. From 2021 to
2023, total accidents consistently increased year over year, from 487 in 2021, to 638 in 2022, to 749
in 2023. This signifies a growing challenge for buses to navigate routes, potentially exacerbated by
increasing traffic and infrastructural changes in the downtown area.
Public Transportation Agency Safety Plan (PTASP) Goals – 2023 Agency Performance
RTD’s 2023 safety performance against goals established in the PTASP is as follows:

Packet Pg. 24

1.E.2

•
•
•
•
•
•

Goal: 3% increase in system reliability
o 1.9% decrease
Goal: Preventable accident rate per 100,000 miles:
o 1.24, which is above the goal
Goal: 5% reduction of lost time days due to OJIs
o 41% improvement from same time period in 2022
Goal: 5% reduction of OJIs
o 68% increase
Goal: 5% reduction of slip and fall injuries
o 4% decrease
5% reduction of injuries from strains
o 8% increase

Managing Risk
The agency has adopted an Operational Risk Management (ORM) Framework to address safety issues.
The implementation of an ORM demonstrates a commitment to safety and unifies management systems
and other activities through a formal, continuous, data-driven, agency-wide approach to manage risk and
assure effectiveness of risk controls.
System Safety Plan
The System Safety Plan (SSP) is internally assessed each year to ensure that the agency has
implemented the plan elements and that these elements are providing the results intended. As a
component of the SSP, staff submitted fatigue risk management program to the FRA in July 2023 for
review and approval. Once approved, a three-year implementation window for this effort will begin to
toll.
Related to the SSP, RTD and Denver Transit Operators (DTO) conducted a joint emergency drill near
Denver International Airport in September 2023. RTD and DTO are coordinating a multi-agency response
along the N Line in late Q2 2024.
PTASP-related Activities
The 2024 PTASP was approved by the CPUC in September 2023.
Safety assurance activities conducted in 2023 include an event investigation train-the-trainer project.
Using existing training resources, RTD deployed a training course that equipped individuals from across
multiple divisions with the ability to provide event investigation training as part of the implementation of
RTD’s event investigation policy and procedures.
The FTA has issued several new notices of proposed rulemaking to support the requirements of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which may require action on RTD’s part. Working through the American
Public Transportation Association (APTA), RTD has provided public commentary on these proposed
rules.

Packet Pg. 25

1.E.2

Corrective Action Plans
As a result of safety events and findings from internal safety reviews and CPUC audits for the light rail
system, corrective action plans (CAPs) are developed and managed to closure. A significant number of
CAPs have been closed recently, and the agency is redoubling efforts to close out the balance of the
open CAPs.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSION ITEM
Committee Meeting Date:
Facilities and Fleet Transition Plan Update

April 17, 2024

STAFF REPRESENTATIVE
Fred Worthen, Assistant General Manager, Bus Operations
PRESENTATION LENGTH
20 minutes
BACKGROUND
Environmental Sustainability
The Board of Directors has collectively demonstrated a deep and abiding commitment to addressing
the climate impacts of the agency’s services, programs, and initiatives throughout the Denver metro
region, in terms of operating and administrative facilities as well as the existing fixed-route bus fleet.
First among RTD’s Board-adopted Strategic Plan Priorities is Community Value, which states: “RTD
strives to be a community partner, providing value to customers as well as to the broader Denver
metro region while sustaining planet Earth.”
In support of this priority, the agency is committed to supporting local, state, and national efforts to
mitigate to the extent feasible the impacts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including those
derived from operating and administrative facilities, as well as fixed-routes buses.
Current Bus Facilities
RTD currently owns and directly provides transit services from three bus division facilities across the
service area. The Platte, East Metro and Boulder facilities were designed in the late 1970s for a
diesel fleet and became operational in the early 1980s. Over the years these facilities have been
modified to accommodate diesel bus fleet replacements and upgraded to current building codes. All
three facilities meet RTD’s current transit service delivery requirements.
Current Diesel Bus Fleet
RTD’s current fixed-route bus fleet includes more than 1,000 clean-diesel vehicles, which are
operated by RTD directly and by contractors. Given the size of the current fleet; the typical useful
service life of diesel buses as well as federal minimum (12-year/500,000 mile) service-life
requirements; and the magnitude of the facilities enhancements that will be required to house,
maintain, and support alternatively fueled transit vehicles, the transition toward lower-emission and
zero-emission buses is a significant undertaking that will require many years to fully implement.
Alternatively Fueled Buses

Packet Pg. 54

1.E.3

RTD was an early adopter of low/no emission technologies. The agency’s first steps toward a
low/no- emission bus fleet transition were taken in 2000, with the deployment of hybrid
electric/compressed natural gas (CNG) buses along the 16th Street Mall. A subfleet of hybrid
diesel/electric fixed-route buses followed in 2008. The CNG-powered MallRide buses were also later
replaced by a fleet of 36 zero-emission battery-electric buses (BEBs) in 2017. The agency has
garnered operational knowledge through the deployment and maintenance of these low- and noemission vehicles, as well as industry best practices and lessons learned, both by RTD and other
public transit service providers throughout North America and across the world.
Transition Planning
On April 25, 2023, the RTD Board of Directors passed a motion to approve the summary scope of work
for a solicitation, and to subsequently authorize the General Manager and CEO (GM/CEO) to enter into a
contract, for consulting services for the development of a holistic Low/No Emission Facilities and Fleet
Transition Plan (Plan) compliant with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), Pub. L. 117-58, in an
amount not to exceed $10,000,000.
Following the Board action, the agency subsequently released a solicitation on May 23, 2023, to select
a consultant to lead the planning process. After reviewing proposals from five qualified firms, WSP USA
Inc. was selected to lead the Plan. On August 24, 2023, RTD executed a contract with WSP USA Inc.
to complete the Plan, and the project kicked off shortly after.
DISCUSSION
The Plan will assess four major areas of transition: facilities, fleet, workforce, and finances. The fleet
analysis assesses RTD’s future fleet needs using various propulsion technologies, including battery
electric, fuel cell electric, diesel hybrid, compressed natural gas (CNG), and diesel. Because different
propulsion technologies require different infrastructure at supporting facilities, the facilities analysis will
determine what changes need to be made at RTD’s operating divisions to support a new fleet
technology. The financial analysis will evaluate costs associated with making the transition, and the
workforce development analysis will identify existing skill gaps and training needs to ensure the
workforce is adequately prepared for a transition.
Working Group and Steering Committee
Following contract execution, a cross functional Working Group composed of agency departments and
consultants was convened to provide technical support and expertise for the project. Over 50 Working
Group members now support the project. The project team also developed subgroups that align with
specific tasks included in the project’s scope of work. The five subgroup emphasis areas are:
• Fleet Technology
• Facility Planning
• Capital Planning and Financial Analysis
• Workforce Development
• Safety and Environmental Compliance
A Steering Committee formed to guide the project includes the following staff:

Project Vision Framework
In October 2023, a workshop was conducted with members of the Working Group to develop vision,
goals, and parameters for the Plan. During a follow-up workshop in November 2023, a team
representing a broad cross section of agency departments supporting this project came to consensus on
the Plan’s Vision Framework and helped establish project parameters, which highlight tradeoffs
associated with the Plan and will guide technical decisions throughout the planning process.
Existing Plans, Programs, and Policies Review
In early January 2024, the project team finalized the Existing Plans, Programs, and Policies Review,
which documents how existing plans, studies, policies, and legislation may impact RTD’s facility and
fleet transition. The Existing Plans, Programs, and Policies Review includes previous RTD planning
efforts, local, regional, and state plans, and national plans and programs.
Fleet Analysis
In December 2023, RTD received preliminary results from the project team’s fleet modeling analysis.
This modeling accounted for different scenarios related to the agency’s operating environment, such as
weather, specific service and scheduling requirements, and advertised and expected useful battery life of
battery-electric buses.
The preliminary modeling was conducted based on RTD’s September 2023 service changes and factored
in ranges for summer (warm weather) and winter (cold weather) operations. The modeling showed that,
with current technology, less than half of RTD’s service blocks could be completed with a batteryelectric bus during the summer scenario, and less than a third of RTD’s service blocks could be
completed during the winter scenario. For reference, “blocking” is the practice of dividing parts of a
scheduled route among vehicles and operators.
The results of the winter scenario improved significantly when a diesel auxiliary heater was used to
power the HVAC system. Auxiliary heaters produce lower emissions than a diesel engine but
significantly improve range and battery life during cold weather operations. In early 2024, RTD staff
audited and finalized this initial round of fleet modeling results.
Throughout February 2024, the project team further advanced the fleet analysis to understand the fleet
mix needed to support the projected fixed-route services detailed in the System Optimization Plan (SOP).
Additionally, previous battery-electric bus modeling showed a large number of incomplete service blocks.
Mitigation strategies, which could improve block completion rates, were explored. These strategies
include mid-day charging, on-route charging, and fuel cell-electric buses.
Facility Analysis and Site Visits

Packet Pg. 56

1.E.3

In early February 2024, the consultant team conducted a first round of on-site facility visits. These visits
focused on eight RTD-owned and contracted fixed-route bus facilities and allowed the consultant team
to collect data and observe the facilities’ operations firsthand.
A transition to a new fleet propulsion technology will likely require significant changes to how RTD’s
existing facilities operate, and understanding present-day operations is critical to accurately inform how
operations might change with a different fleet. Additionally, the consultants assessed RTD’s bus
facilities to identify areas for improving energy efficiency and evaluate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Areas of focus included lighting, HVAC systems, and building automation systems. After this initial
round of site visits, the project team returned in late February 2024 to conduct site visits at RTD rail,
administrative, and public facilities to evaluate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Financial Analysis and Workforce Analysis
Work on the financial and workforce analysis tasks has been ongoing since Q4 2023. Discussions
regarding assumptions for each of these analyses have taken place with key staff, and RTD has provided
a significant amount of data that will be used for each of the tasks. The consultant team is holding
interviews with various RTD staff to understand how the agency operates, as well as the workforce
changes that will need to be made with the transition to a new fleet propulsion technology.
Next Steps
The project team will hold a study session with the Board of Directors in June 2024. The team is on
track to complete the Plan by December 15, 2024.
FINANCIAL IMPACT
The contract with WSP USA Inc. to complete the Plan is $6,165,761. Funding for 2024 contract
deliverables and activities is contemplated in the 2024 Budget.
